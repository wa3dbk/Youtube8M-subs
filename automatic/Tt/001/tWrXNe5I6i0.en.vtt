then<00:02:09.530> collect<00:02:09.769> those<00:02:09.890> things<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.519> it's<00:02:11.030> you

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
then collect those things and it's you

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.759 
then collect those things and it's you
know<00:02:11.330> it's<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.540> pretty<00:02:11.769> straightforward

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
know it's a pretty straightforward

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.140 
know it's a pretty straightforward
puzzle<00:02:13.220> game<00:02:13.340> obviously<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:13.880> gets<00:02:13.970> more

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
puzzle game obviously it gets more

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.180 
puzzle game obviously it gets more
complex<00:02:14.510> than<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:14.840> but<00:02:15.050> for<00:02:15.680> our<00:02:15.830> purposes

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
complex than that but for our purposes

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.380 
complex than that but for our purposes
we're<00:02:16.370> really<00:02:16.519> just<00:02:16.580> looking<00:02:16.730> at<00:02:17.000> see<00:02:17.180> what

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
we're really just looking at see what

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.610 
we're really just looking at see what
it's<00:02:17.750> like<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.260> look<00:02:18.530> around<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.500> see

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
it's like to look around and you can see

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.780 
it's like to look around and you can see
it<00:02:21.709> sort<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:21.950> loses<00:02:22.069> my<00:02:22.340> face<00:02:22.580> that's

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
it sort of loses my face that's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.340 
it sort of loses my face that's
partially<00:02:23.060> because<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:23.690> have<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.049> camera

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
partially because I do have the camera

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.320 
partially because I do have the camera
between<00:02:24.500> me<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:24.950> my<00:02:25.010> face<00:02:25.220> but<00:02:25.910> even<00:02:25.940> when<00:02:26.299> it

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
between me and my face but even when it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.850 
between me and my face but even when it
is<00:02:26.540> tracking<00:02:26.720> my<00:02:26.930> face<00:02:27.140> perfectly<00:02:27.650> at<00:02:27.739> all

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
is tracking my face perfectly at all

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.039 
is tracking my face perfectly at all
times<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.910> there's<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.390> little<00:02:29.569> bit<00:02:29.660> of<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.780> delay

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
times it there's a little bit of a delay

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.070 
times it there's a little bit of a delay
it's<00:02:30.350> not<00:02:30.560> automatically<00:02:31.190> responding

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
it's not automatically responding

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.240 
it's not automatically responding
instantaneously<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.319> that<00:02:33.470> delay<00:02:33.799> really

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
instantaneously and that delay really

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.240 
instantaneously and that delay really
destroys<00:02:35.060> any<00:02:35.299> of<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.930> effect<00:02:36.349> that<00:02:36.590> the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
destroys any of the the effect that the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.800 
destroys any of the the effect that the
dynamic<00:02:37.640> perspective<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.209> supposed<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.540> give

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
dynamic perspective is supposed to give

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.780 
dynamic perspective is supposed to give
what<00:02:39.680> it's<00:02:39.799> supposed<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.099> do<00:02:40.250> is<00:02:40.370> make<00:02:40.519> it<00:02:40.640> feel

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
what it's supposed to do is make it feel

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.449 
what it's supposed to do is make it feel
like<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:41.450> image<00:02:41.720> has<00:02:41.959> real<00:02:42.290> depth<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.860> that

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
like the image has real depth and that

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.949 
like the image has real depth and that
you're<00:02:43.549> looking<00:02:43.819> into<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.030> 3d<00:02:44.450> like<00:02:44.690> little

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
you're looking into a 3d like little

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.140 
you're looking into a 3d like little
window<00:02:45.380> but<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.519> doesn't<00:02:46.790> happen<00:02:46.910> with

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
window but that doesn't happen with

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.570 
window but that doesn't happen with
delay<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.140> it's<00:02:48.860> actually<00:02:49.160> kind<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.430> bummer

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
delay so it's actually kind of a bummer

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.220 
delay so it's actually kind of a bummer
what<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:49.910> in<00:02:50.030> them<00:02:50.180> ends<00:02:50.420> up<00:02:50.480> feeling<00:02:50.690> like<00:02:50.870> is

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
what it in them ends up feeling like is

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.710 
what it in them ends up feeling like is
that<00:02:51.799> you're<00:02:52.099> just<00:02:52.370> controlling<00:02:52.849> a<00:02:53.150> camera

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
that you're just controlling a camera

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.380 
that you're just controlling a camera
but<00:02:54.470> with<00:02:54.620> your<00:02:54.799> head<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:56.120> could<00:02:56.329> be

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
but with your head and that could be

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.430 
but with your head and that could be
very<00:02:56.720> distracting<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.370> uh<00:02:58.720> what's<00:02:59.720> hop<00:03:00.260> out

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
very distracting so uh what's hop out

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.140 
very distracting so uh what's hop out
this<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.100> about<00:03:01.250> all<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:01.609> really<00:03:01.760> need<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:01.970> see

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
this is about all you really need to see

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.660 
this is about all you really need to see
this<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.709> think<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.010> probably<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.459> only

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
this I think this is probably the only

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.229 
this I think this is probably the only
other<00:03:04.730> game<00:03:04.970> we'll<00:03:05.150> check<00:03:05.329> out<00:03:05.510> let's<00:03:05.690> uh<00:03:07.239> go

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
other game we'll check out let's uh go

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.420 
other game we'll check out let's uh go
get<00:03:08.359> the<00:03:08.510> idea<00:03:08.750> by<00:03:09.350> watching<00:03:09.590> me<00:03:09.829> play<00:03:09.980> this<00:03:10.160> so

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
get the idea by watching me play this so

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.949 
get the idea by watching me play this so
this<00:03:10.670> is<00:03:10.819> one<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.090> games<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.420> found<00:03:11.750> by

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
this is one of the games I found by

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.650 
this is one of the games I found by
looking<00:03:12.140> in<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.500> Amazon<00:03:12.920> Appstore<00:03:13.130> and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
looking in the Amazon Appstore and

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
have that support dynamic perspective

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.140 
have that support dynamic perspective
I<00:03:18.410> love<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.280> bridge<00:03:19.430> constructor<00:03:19.940> games

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
I love the bridge constructor games

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.460 
I love the bridge constructor games
there's<00:03:20.450> something<00:03:20.690> nice<00:03:20.780> about<00:03:20.840> building

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
there's something nice about building

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.449 
there's something nice about building
bridges<00:03:22.329> it's<00:03:23.329> enjoyable<00:03:23.600> this<00:03:24.470> game's<00:03:24.739> rich

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
bridges it's enjoyable this game's rich

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.160 
bridges it's enjoyable this game's rich
constructor<00:03:25.970> medieval<00:03:26.630> or<00:03:26.690> whatever<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.079> is

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
constructor medieval or whatever it is

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.259 
constructor medieval or whatever it is
and<00:03:27.620> it's<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.700> know<00:03:28.790> it's<00:03:28.910> fine<00:03:29.030> it's<00:03:29.150> good

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
and it's you know it's fine it's good

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.670 
and it's you know it's fine it's good
it's<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.540> same<00:03:29.720> exact<00:03:30.079> game<00:03:30.200> you'd<00:03:30.380> find<00:03:30.590> on

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
it's the same exact game you'd find on

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.550 
it's the same exact game you'd find on
android<00:03:31.010> or<00:03:31.130> iOS<00:03:31.959> but<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.170> difference<00:03:33.440> is

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
android or iOS but the difference is

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.210 
android or iOS but the difference is
it's<00:03:33.709> got<00:03:33.889> this<00:03:35.799> camera<00:03:36.799> control

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
it's got this camera control

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.379 
it's got this camera control
functionality<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:40.000> think<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.060> looks<00:03:41.180> it

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
functionality and I think it looks it

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:42.910 
functionality and I think it looks it
might<00:03:41.600> look<00:03:41.780> pretty<00:03:42.079> neat<00:03:42.260> in<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.470> images

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
might look pretty neat in the images

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
might look pretty neat in the images
you're<00:03:43.190> seeing<00:03:43.900> but<00:03:44.900> when<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.139> am<00:03:45.730> playing<00:03:46.730> it

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
you're seeing but when I am playing it

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.710 
you're seeing but when I am playing it
and<00:03:47.389> I'm<00:03:47.810> just<00:03:47.840> trying<00:03:48.170> to<00:03:48.260> build<00:03:48.410> a<00:03:48.560> bridge

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
and I'm just trying to build a bridge

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.440 
and I'm just trying to build a bridge
every<00:03:50.720> little<00:03:50.989> motion<00:03:51.639> gets<00:03:52.639> translated<00:03:53.120> into

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
every little motion gets translated into

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.800 
every little motion gets translated into
a<00:03:53.569> camera<00:03:53.959> movement<00:03:54.530> so<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:56.420> can<00:03:56.540> see<00:03:56.690> how

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
a camera movement so you can see how

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.910 
a camera movement so you can see how
it's<00:03:56.959> sort<00:03:57.079> of<00:03:57.200> twitching<00:03:57.650> in<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.829> background

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
it's sort of twitching in the background

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.089 
it's sort of twitching in the background
and<00:04:01.510> that<00:04:02.510> is<00:04:02.720> very<00:04:03.019> it's<00:04:03.409> annoying<00:04:03.739> it's

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
and that is very it's annoying it's

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.540 
and that is very it's annoying it's
distracting<00:04:04.640> it's<00:04:04.819> like<00:04:05.060> having

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
distracting it's like having

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.640 
distracting it's like having
someone<00:04:05.910> come<00:04:06.660> up<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.900> your<00:04:06.990> controller<00:04:07.380> like

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
someone come up to your controller like

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.960 
someone come up to your controller like
you're<00:04:07.770> playing<00:04:07.890> a<00:04:08.010> console<00:04:08.400> game<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.760> just

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
you're playing a console game and just

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.520 
you're playing a console game and just
slightly<00:04:09.270> wiggling<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.900> right<00:04:10.080> stick<00:04:10.380> that

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
slightly wiggling the right stick that

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.520 
slightly wiggling the right stick that
controls<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.980> camera<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:12.810> know<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:12.900> haven't

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
controls the camera you know I haven't

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.440 
controls the camera you know I haven't
gotten<00:04:13.740> nauseous<00:04:14.430> or<00:04:14.550> anything<00:04:14.700> but<00:04:15.210> I<00:04:15.240> could

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
gotten nauseous or anything but I could

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.699 
gotten nauseous or anything but I could
see<00:04:15.720> some<00:04:15.930> people<00:04:16.170> may<00:04:16.260> be<00:04:16.320> having<00:04:16.500> some

see some people may be having some
issues<00:04:16.799> with<00:04:16.980> this<00:04:17.250> just<00:04:17.549> cuz<00:04:17.700> it's<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.200> so

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
sensitive now I've read not every games

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.060 
sensitive now I've read not every games
gonna<00:04:21.450> be<00:04:21.600> like<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:21.900> but<00:04:22.200> most<00:04:22.440> are<00:04:22.710> most

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
gonna be like this but most are most

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.470 
gonna be like this but most are most
this<00:04:23.250> is<00:04:23.310> what<00:04:23.520> they<00:04:23.610> use<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.910> dynamic<00:04:24.120> right

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
this is what they use the dynamic right

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.050 
this is what they use the dynamic right
perspective<00:04:24.720> for<00:04:28.400> okay<00:04:29.400> let's<00:04:29.700> look<00:04:29.790> at<00:04:29.910> one

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
perspective for okay let's look at one

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.730 
perspective for okay let's look at one
more<00:04:30.090> game<00:04:30.420> this<00:04:30.630> is<00:04:30.750> safer's<00:04:31.080> edge<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:33.740> you

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
more game this is safer's edge and you

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.100 
more game this is safer's edge and you
could<00:04:34.890> see<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.280> by<00:04:35.820> tilting<00:04:36.090> I'm<00:04:36.510> looking

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
could see that by tilting I'm looking

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.390 
could see that by tilting I'm looking
around<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:38.190> world<00:04:39.290> but<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:41.040> don't<00:04:41.070> know<00:04:41.340> if

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
around the world but and I don't know if

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.560 
around the world but and I don't know if
you<00:04:41.460> could<00:04:41.580> tell<00:04:41.700> this<00:04:41.790> from<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.060> video<00:04:42.300> but

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
you could tell this from the video but

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.720 
you could tell this from the video but
it<00:04:43.380> looks<00:04:43.560> like<00:04:43.650> it's<00:04:43.860> just<00:04:43.920> sort<00:04:44.160> of<00:04:44.250> panning

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
it looks like it's just sort of panning

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.280 
it looks like it's just sort of panning
around<00:04:44.880> a<00:04:45.120> still<00:04:45.420> image<00:04:45.570> there's<00:04:45.930> not<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> lot

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
around a still image there's not a lot

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.070 
around a still image there's not a lot
of<00:04:46.320> parallax<00:04:46.830> going<00:04:47.040> on<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.900> mean<00:04:48.900> maybe

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
of parallax going on I mean maybe

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.720 
of parallax going on I mean maybe
there's<00:04:49.230> maybe<00:04:49.830> it's<00:04:49.980> slightly<00:04:50.250> going<00:04:50.490> on<00:04:50.640> but

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
there's maybe it's slightly going on but

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.890 
there's maybe it's slightly going on but
I<00:04:50.790> can't<00:04:51.000> even<00:04:51.090> tell<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.510> so<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.690> really<00:04:51.840> just

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
I can't even tell and so it really just

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.900 
I can't even tell and so it really just
feels<00:04:52.140> like<00:04:52.350> I'm<00:04:52.590> moving<00:04:52.830> a<00:04:53.100> cursor<00:04:53.310> around<00:04:53.790> a

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
feels like I'm moving a cursor around a

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.720 
feels like I'm moving a cursor around a
screen<00:04:54.120> by<00:04:54.960> moving<00:04:55.200> my<00:04:55.320> head<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.830> by<00:04:56.460> tilting

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
screen by moving my head and by tilting

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.450 
screen by moving my head and by tilting
the<00:04:56.910> device<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.740> again<00:04:58.740> there's<00:04:58.920> this<00:04:59.040> delay

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
the device and again there's this delay

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.610 
the device and again there's this delay
there's<00:04:59.940> just<00:05:00.150> this<00:05:00.270> like<00:05:00.510> half<00:05:00.720> second<00:05:01.530> not

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
there's just this like half second not

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.010 
there's just this like half second not
even<00:05:01.890> maybe<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.130> quarter<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:02.550> second<00:05:02.880> delay

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
even maybe a quarter of a second delay

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.780 
even maybe a quarter of a second delay
that's<00:05:04.020> noticeable<00:05:04.740> enough<00:05:05.100> to<00:05:05.310> really<00:05:05.520> just

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
that's noticeable enough to really just

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.820 
that's noticeable enough to really just
destroy<00:05:06.270> any<00:05:06.480> you<00:05:06.900> know<00:05:06.990> impact<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.560> effect

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
destroy any you know impact the effect

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.890 
destroy any you know impact the effect
should<00:05:08.010> have<00:05:11.030> see<00:05:12.030> if<00:05:12.090> we<00:05:12.180> can<00:05:12.360> get<00:05:12.690> into<00:05:12.810> a

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
should have see if we can get into a

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:27.930 
should have see if we can get into a
game<00:05:13.080> real<00:05:13.260> quick<00:05:14.450> yeah<00:05:15.450> fight

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.260 

and<00:05:28.940> it's<00:05:29.330> just<00:05:29.510> uh<00:05:29.630> it's<00:05:29.810> a<00:05:29.930> basic<00:05:30.320> you<00:05:30.800> know

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
and it's just uh it's a basic you know

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:41.100 
and it's just uh it's a basic you know
matching<00:05:32.270> game<00:05:36.250> but<00:05:37.250> you<00:05:37.340> could<00:05:37.460> see<00:05:39.220> up<00:05:40.220> here

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
matching game but you could see up here

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.600 
matching game but you could see up here
twisting<00:05:42.110> again<00:05:42.350> it's<00:05:42.500> just<00:05:42.620> like<00:05:42.800> pivoting<00:05:43.550> a

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
twisting again it's just like pivoting a

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:51.100 
twisting again it's just like pivoting a
camera<00:05:48.790> so<00:05:49.790> overall<00:05:50.300> I<00:05:50.390> would<00:05:50.540> say<00:05:50.630> that<00:05:50.810> it's

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
camera so overall I would say that it's

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.310 
camera so overall I would say that it's
I<00:05:52.000> mean<00:05:53.000> it's<00:05:53.030> a<00:05:53.180> powerful<00:05:53.810> phone<00:05:54.080> it<00:05:54.260> can

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
I mean it's a powerful phone it can

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.400 
I mean it's a powerful phone it can
handle<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.680> games<00:05:54.890> all<00:05:55.130> right<00:05:55.340> no<00:05:55.910> it's<00:05:56.410> it's

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
handle the games all right no it's it's

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.810 
handle the games all right no it's it's
got<00:05:57.620> you<00:05:57.920> know<00:05:58.010> the<00:05:58.100> whole<00:05:58.220> Amazon<00:05:58.580> store

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
got you know the whole Amazon store

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.580 
got you know the whole Amazon store
selection<00:05:59.240> which<00:05:59.360> doesn't<00:06:00.020> have<00:06:00.170> quite<00:06:00.470> as

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
selection which doesn't have quite as

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.730 
selection which doesn't have quite as
many<00:06:00.830> games<00:06:01.070> as<00:06:01.370> clearly<00:06:02.060> as<00:06:02.240> iOS<00:06:02.510> or<00:06:03.440> even
