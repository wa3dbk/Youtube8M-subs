00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:04.100
 nobody had but because the guidelines 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.970
 to be able to continue at the first and may even explain that there is 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.649
 Heuberger 4 2 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:14.499
 and the bad quality comes from the fact that I do not have the pop yet 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.349
 Red Coface have 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.660
 Another such contract with Malware Top can use it on the screen often 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:21.630
 devices 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.130
 yes I hope that we are not without reason the gameplay and mountain rescue 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.849
 of course to the fullest 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.419
 So it should be during the title as well 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.810
 I would like to do more videos 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.680
 and the importance of how difficult it is to see 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.520
 Then, talking through the sleeves, everything would have to start over again 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.280
 So have 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.780
 is finding the offer 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.090
 It is true that it was not so 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.380
 but that the funding costs 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.420
 and so it plays like me 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.510
 Game Principle l am most lateral over 70 am with my parker 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.440
 very strong weapon you cook two shots then left so that's it 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.650
 things 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.270
 and although he speaks with MedImmune PilotsEYE such gadget switches to 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.610
 explain jur 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.350
 Schiester percent during private pleasure Wittenstein 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.890
 so if they drove in green light MBO club year let s how they played but 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.040
 as intended small annoyances like 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.530
 no campers or I do not know 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.720
 never ever 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.370
 but you just have to overlook that and play side when he gets upset then 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.800
 she lowers the already too late and then actually only has a house roof that 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.340
 Game so I led us 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.620
 al Jaber guests played well 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.970
 at the action 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.630
 So to note that this very good weapon on the list itself is not 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.499
 good because 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:44.490
 in close combat 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.670
 yes, she is refunding a strong weapon this year 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.130
 Grossmann had fun and that means if you have several opponents in Boberg 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.370
 sees itself approaching 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.340
 Of course, that's natural 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.640
 Arthur Schönhoff then there are hopefully well going out 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.600
 and 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.510
 I 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.590
 meanwhile, so if you have any special ones 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.979
 Want to see weapons if you want to see a blog 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.709
 to cea-pme Steinfurth and I will try to implement it 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.329
 around 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.920
 Write repeatedly tried do not like tried and tested by Dirk Bangert 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.430
 SPD Real me for me to improve myself could have done something wrong 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.369
 yes the quality I hope that I can 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:28.729
 I'll do it 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:31.729
 that's the way to stay in Cambridge UK Ballack 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.740
 well there 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.900
 cold calculus fourth kilo prompt now 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.789
 Jäckel from now I get my fourth 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.279
 not then 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.449
 yes, but now he should be in the fourth game 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:51.779
 Unfortunately I have Kerner so high graduation series creates by that 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.219
 that's just a small passage with this video 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.479
 how it works yes to go find work 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:02.349
 also not natural, of course, usually but are discussed 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.809
 ACS was 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:07.569
 and then to Blatter 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.529
 what really makes me feel like Fricke too, that they are all hiding, yes I do 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.489
 that too thoughtfully, though 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.049
 very lucky that I got more yes because of that too 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.819
 embroidered embroidered 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.919
 4 annoying Feistel Rast could laboriously fought that no one could 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.110
 Munich covers while the heads 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.659
 it does not matter anymore or they all hid in the Kunsthalle Kiel 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.719
 yes that's annoying 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.649
 Okay, since Mbabi could not do the best thing that could happen to the fair 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.709
 These are just the most important ones coming from behind 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.709
 and then I'll just mend 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:48.259
 even if he has a childish Steinbach 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.180
 and that despite an international one 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.359
 I'm mostly with orion-pi® 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.999
 Golden Gophers yourself 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.050
 Percent of the latter tries 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.499
 a renewed tactic with knives which then goes on and on 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:02.609
 against it can 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.809
 I did not have that set this time although I have no synonymous 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.809
 got a mare look and died 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.479
 around 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.349
 I think the Harrier a bit stronger 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.339
 dapd and that is also very annoying I think so far not price and NRW 

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.240
 Expect 20 euros costs 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.669
 around 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.379
 yes, um 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.309
 from 10 30 o'clock over 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.770
 so Rossi will want 2 liters or a bad luck 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.120
 the gaze wanders a tiger which destroyed too carelessly Dr 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.080
 It is very annoying 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.760
 not enough happens that I have ten Kiss once again comes to a fair 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.320
 you do not or know me way 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.460
 you absolutely obeyed when she could get 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.570
 So just not the fat that's the numbers like that 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.350
 yes i'm just trying to learn 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.360
 So a 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.360
 that's the absolutely racy one to get 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.650
 but there I am now 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.150
 August Harms 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.520
 four or five times 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.550
 what does it help in tests 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.460
 strange windows to jump 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.240
 he is that i still have something and then hopefully i will score a lot from him 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.809
 4 0 

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:15.749
 the signal 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:19.389
 yes Rome it is wrong because Wokingham brave and 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.130
 there will not be a soon the 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.809
 he has no idea 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.580
 therefore it is also very annoying situation 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.599
 So fame tries to go back or duck back 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.860
 but it is not under special pressure because the head of the animal to ask 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.499
 him 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.550
 on 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.860
 even those and again do not do this anymore 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.520
 can 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.490
 and now just do some search I again add train opponent viewers 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.949
 still there 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.439
 because I might get any key 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.860
 Examples are the same 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.900
 No he is not there anymore but suddenly I want to see this stupid thing 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.629
 still killed 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:05.559
 because it is so intelligent man and his point down when Dominik Hipp or 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:06.580
 be better 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.919
 that the opponent Poland there he waits with and bounced another child 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.099
 unfortunately not 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.059
 that is not what is there that has not been so 

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:19.869
 but others have been there for the TuS has the fate of a morning week 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:21.150
 disappear 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.939
 underneath is give 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.440
 So as I said he comments 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.809
 is fit again and I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:32.300
 that was not a first video with not 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.300
 that nothing picture goes into the money everywhere Red 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:36.930
 Why 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.030
 Schauerte and I hope that we will meet again
