new desktop picture now what does that
take<00:01:59.350> a<00:01:59.380> total<00:01:59.860> of<00:01:59.979> 20<00:02:00.340> seconds<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.970> do<00:02:01.119> go

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
take a total of 20 seconds to do go

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.910 
take a total of 20 seconds to do go
through<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:01.869> do<00:02:01.959> an<00:02:02.080> image<00:02:02.349> search

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
through and do an image search

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.859

and<00:02:03.099> what<00:02:03.520> turns<00:02:03.729> out<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.030> be<00:02:04.060> really<00:02:04.630> nice<00:02:04.810> and

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
and what turns out to be really nice and

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.490 
and what turns out to be really nice and
what<00:02:05.590> I've<00:02:05.770> done<00:02:06.009> myself<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.259> can

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
what I've done myself is that you can

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.580 
what I've done myself is that you can
use<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:08.920> same<00:02:08.979> image<00:02:09.700> search<00:02:10.030> trick<00:02:10.660> to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
use that same image search trick to

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.930 
use that same image search trick to
actually<00:02:12.010> grab<00:02:12.310> 10<00:02:12.790> 20<00:02:13.360> 50<00:02:13.799> 200<00:02:14.799> images<00:02:15.310> that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
actually grab 10 20 50 200 images that

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.420 
actually grab 10 20 50 200 images that
you<00:02:16.030> really<00:02:16.420> like<00:02:16.630> for<00:02:16.989> your<00:02:17.290> desktop<00:02:17.739> put

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
you really like for your desktop put

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.819 
you really like for your desktop put
them<00:02:18.549> all<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.910> folder<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
them all in a folder and then in the

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.759 
them all in a folder and then in the
System<00:02:21.400> Preferences<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.390> Mac<00:02:22.769> specify

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
System Preferences on the Mac specify

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.410 
System Preferences on the Mac specify
that<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.099> should<00:02:24.280> randomly<00:02:24.790> pick<00:02:25.030> from<00:02:25.239> that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
that it should randomly pick from that

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.330 
that it should randomly pick from that
folder<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.900> even<00:02:26.260> change<00:02:26.560> every<00:02:26.860> 30<00:02:27.099> minutes

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
folder and even change every 30 minutes

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.520 
folder and even change every 30 minutes
so<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.450> can<00:02:28.599> have<00:02:28.720> lots<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.170> lots<00:02:29.260> of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
so you can have lots and lots of

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.410 
so you can have lots and lots of
interesting<00:02:29.950> backgrounds<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:31.120> one<00:02:31.390> I

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
interesting backgrounds this one I

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.240 
interesting backgrounds this one I
really<00:02:31.959> really<00:02:32.290> like<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.739> haven't<00:02:33.100> actually

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
really really like I haven't actually

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.879 
really really like I haven't actually
played<00:02:33.609> the<00:02:33.970> game<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.720> tied<00:02:35.019> to<00:02:35.319> and

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:35.889 
played the game that this is tied to and

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.770 
played the game that this is tied to and
I<00:02:36.010> understand<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.459> game<00:02:36.609> has<00:02:36.970> rather<00:02:37.329> a<00:02:37.480> dark

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
I understand the game has rather a dark

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.039 
I understand the game has rather a dark
theme<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.319> but<00:02:39.160> suffice<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.030> say<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.930> was

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
theme to it but suffice to say that was

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.720 
theme to it but suffice to say that was
a<00:02:41.079> really<00:02:41.440> fast<00:02:41.709> way<00:02:41.920> for<00:02:42.160> me<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.310> change<00:02:42.430> my

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
a really fast way for me to change my

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.860 
a really fast way for me to change my
wallpaper
