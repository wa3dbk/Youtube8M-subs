of my PC specs you can now just by

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.729 
of my PC specs you can now just by
looking<00:00:39.530> at<00:00:39.680> this<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:41.809> monitor<00:00:42.230> now<00:00:42.380> has<00:00:42.590> the

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
looking at this the monitor now has the

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.180 
looking at this the monitor now has the
ability<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.190> read<00:00:43.969> your<00:00:44.239> computer<00:00:45.010> how<00:00:46.010> cool

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
ability to read your computer how cool

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.229 
ability to read your computer how cool
is<00:00:46.250> that<00:00:46.280> that<00:00:47.200> is<00:00:48.200> just<00:00:48.379> cool<00:00:48.500> eyes<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:49.239> as

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
is that that is just cool eyes and as

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.060 
is that that is just cool eyes and as
with<00:00:50.540> before<00:00:50.960> it's<00:00:51.290> not<00:00:51.410> got<00:00:51.559> a<00:00:51.590> function<00:00:51.950> if

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
with before it's not got a function if

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.860 
with before it's not got a function if
you<00:00:52.129> don't<00:00:52.309> have<00:00:52.430> any<00:00:52.579> power<00:00:55.480> next<00:00:56.480> up<00:00:56.600> we<00:00:56.719> have

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
you don't have any power next up we have

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.410 
you don't have any power next up we have
the<00:00:56.989> assembler<00:00:57.440> which<00:00:57.860> is<00:00:58.100> very<00:00:58.969> pretty<00:00:59.210> and

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
the assembler which is very pretty and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.450 
the assembler which is very pretty and
it's<00:01:00.110> showing<00:01:00.410> all<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.770> items<00:01:01.070> that<00:01:01.129> can

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
it's showing all the items that can

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.999 
it's showing all the items that can
actually<00:01:01.670> create<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:03.350> way<00:01:03.469> this<00:01:03.680> works

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
actually create and the way this works

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.310 
actually create and the way this works
is<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:05.299> have<00:01:05.329> a<00:01:05.449> selection<00:01:05.810> of<00:01:06.079> different

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
is you have a selection of different

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.609 
is you have a selection of different
things<00:01:06.770> yeah<00:01:07.340> all<00:01:07.969> from<00:01:08.209> the<00:01:08.329> ABP<00:01:08.539> mod<00:01:08.950> and

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
things yeah all from the ABP mod and

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.410 
things yeah all from the ABP mod and
that's<00:01:12.619> step<00:01:12.829> one<00:01:13.009> into<00:01:13.670> understanding<00:01:14.389> how

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
that's step one into understanding how

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.550 
that's step one into understanding how
this<00:01:14.600> works<00:01:15.219> now<00:01:16.219> for<00:01:16.459> instance<00:01:17.409> say<00:01:18.409> we

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
this works now for instance say we

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.669 
this works now for instance say we
wanted<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.829> craft<00:01:19.420> Doritos<00:01:20.420> down<00:01:21.259> here<00:01:21.529> it's

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
wanted to craft Doritos down here it's

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.230 
wanted to craft Doritos down here it's
telling<00:01:21.920> us<00:01:22.130> that<00:01:22.279> we<00:01:22.399> need<00:01:22.609> for<00:01:22.939> wheat<00:01:23.119> and

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
telling us that we need for wheat and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.080 
telling us that we need for wheat and
for<00:01:23.899> baked<00:01:24.079> potatoes<00:01:24.759> so<00:01:25.759> I<00:01:25.789> grabbed<00:01:26.060> some

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
for baked potatoes so I grabbed some

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.940 
for baked potatoes so I grabbed some
wheat<00:01:26.389> and<00:01:27.549> baked<00:01:28.549> potatoes<00:01:29.560> now<00:01:30.560> I'll<00:01:30.649> go<00:01:30.799> out

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
wheat and baked potatoes now I'll go out

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.070 
wheat and baked potatoes now I'll go out
a<00:01:30.979> creative<00:01:31.369> mode

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.730 

and<00:01:34.830> now<00:01:35.280> we'll<00:01:35.550> scroll<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:36.030> down<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
and now we'll scroll back down to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
and now we'll scroll back down to
Doritos<00:01:37.740> now<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.610> long<00:01:38.760> as<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.940> have<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.390> my

my accidentally crafted to and with
creative<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.370> doesn't<00:02:44.670> actually<00:02:44.760> -<00:02:45.690> away

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
creative it doesn't actually - away

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.750 
creative it doesn't actually - away
their<00:02:46.500> materials<00:02:47.100> but<00:02:47.280> as<00:02:47.400> soon<00:02:47.520> as<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.670> go

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
their materials but as soon as you go

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.670 
their materials but as soon as you go
into<00:02:47.880> survival<00:02:48.270> it'll<00:02:48.660> -<00:02:49.050> away<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.290> materials

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
into survival it'll - away the materials

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.440 
into survival it'll - away the materials
so<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.890> makes<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.220> I'm<00:02:50.580> being<00:02:50.820> creative<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.330> lot

its head and then the acid spewed
everywhere<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.590> then<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.769> regrow<00:03:32.100> its<00:03:32.280> head

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.110 
everywhere and then it regrow its head
and<00:03:32.910> then<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.690> went<00:03:33.840> up<00:03:33.959> inside<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.530> hole<00:03:34.739> that

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
and then it went up inside the hole that

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.630 
and then it went up inside the hole that
the<00:03:36.120> severed<00:03:36.690> arm<00:03:36.780> was<00:03:37.380> giving<00:03:37.980> availability

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
the severed arm was giving availability

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.460 
the severed arm was giving availability
to<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.150> then<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.690> another<00:03:39.870> one<00:03:40.230> crawled

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
to and then in another one crawled

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.870 
to and then in another one crawled
inside<00:03:40.620> his<00:03:40.890> mouth<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.430> they<00:03:41.519> killed<00:03:41.760> him

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
inside his mouth and they killed him

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.950 
inside his mouth and they killed him
from<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.090> inside<00:03:42.120> so

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
from the inside so

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.710 
from the inside so
they're<00:03:44.960> as<00:03:45.140> bad<00:03:45.320> as<00:03:45.530> facehuggers<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.910> put<00:03:47.060> to

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
they're as bad as facehuggers to put to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.990 
they're as bad as facehuggers to put to
put<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.960> bluntly<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:49.310> they<00:03:49.790> look<00:03:49.970> very

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
put it bluntly and they look very

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.290 
put it bluntly and they look very
similar<00:03:50.240> and<00:03:51.190> from<00:03:52.190> my<00:03:52.340> knowledge<00:03:52.730> it's

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
similar and from my knowledge it's

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.090 
similar and from my knowledge it's
basically<00:03:53.630> just<00:03:53.750> an<00:03:54.050> unevolved<00:03:54.470> facehugger

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
basically just an unevolved facehugger

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.100 
basically just an unevolved facehugger
at<00:03:55.340> facehuggers<00:03:56.060> are<00:03:56.210> more<00:03:56.360> evolved<00:03:56.690> than<00:03:56.810> the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
at facehuggers are more evolved than the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.590 
at facehuggers are more evolved than the
Hema<00:03:57.500> peds<00:03:57.740> and<00:03:58.040> they<00:03:58.400> will<00:03:58.580> attack<00:03:58.850> you<00:03:59.000> they

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
Hema peds and they will attack you they

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.910 
Hema peds and they will attack you they
don't<00:03:59.660> actually<00:03:59.930> do<00:04:00.200> anything<00:04:00.440> -<00:04:00.710> they<00:04:00.890> just

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
don't actually do anything - they just

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.670 
don't actually do anything - they just
you<00:04:01.520> know<00:04:01.550> attack<00:04:02.120> like<00:04:02.570> Bam<00:04:02.840> Bam<00:04:03.260> Bam<00:04:03.500> like

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
you know attack like Bam Bam Bam like

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.290 
you know attack like Bam Bam Bam like
you're<00:04:03.800> hitting<00:04:03.890> someone<00:04:04.160> with<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.430> sword<00:04:04.640> but

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
you're hitting someone with a sword but

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.910 
you're hitting someone with a sword but
it'll<00:04:05.870> be<00:04:05.930> good<00:04:06.080> to<00:04:06.110> see<00:04:06.380> if<00:04:06.470> they're<00:04:06.620> actually

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
next up we have the proto morph this was

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.220 
next up we have the proto morph this was
one<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.250> first<00:04:22.460> aliens<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.330> appear<00:04:23.930> in

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
one of the first aliens to appear in

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.040 
one of the first aliens to appear in
prometheus<00:04:25.480> it's<00:04:26.480> yeah<00:04:26.810> it's<00:04:27.080> it's<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.840> first

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
prometheus it's yeah it's it's the first

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.290 
prometheus it's yeah it's it's the first
first<00:04:30.530> fully<00:04:31.340> developed<00:04:31.760> digs<00:04:31.940> in<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.090> morph

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
first fully developed digs in a morph

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.060 
first fully developed digs in a morph
from<00:04:32.750> my<00:04:33.310> itinerary<00:04:34.310> of<00:04:34.630> understanding<00:04:36.070> it

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
from my itinerary of understanding it

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.510 
from my itinerary of understanding it
hasn't<00:04:37.310> got<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.460> proper<00:04:37.910> texture<00:04:38.270> yet<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:39.520> you

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
hasn't got a proper texture yet so you

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.450 
hasn't got a proper texture yet so you
get<00:04:40.670> rid<00:04:40.760> of<00:04:40.880> it<00:04:41.080> but<00:04:42.080> that's<00:04:42.590> obviously<00:04:43.250> work

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
get rid of it but that's obviously work

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.030 
get rid of it but that's obviously work

here it's not even on her but before
you'd<00:05:23.300> be<00:05:23.510> like<00:05:23.720> this<00:05:23.960> you<00:05:24.380> were<00:05:24.530> like<00:05:24.680> why<00:05:24.890> is

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
you'd be like this you were like why is

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.740

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
right in between the lake oh my god is

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.250 
right in between the lake oh my god is
that<00:05:28.370> hitting<00:05:28.700> her<00:05:32.050> okay

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
that hitting her okay

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.830 
that hitting her okay
so<00:05:33.500> heat<00:05:34.070> box<00:05:34.280> is<00:05:34.460> a<00:05:34.640> lot<00:05:34.850> more<00:05:35.000> bigger<00:05:35.150> so<00:05:35.600> it's

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
so heat box is a lot more bigger so it's

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.600 
so heat box is a lot more bigger so it's
a<00:05:35.900> lot<00:05:36.050> easier<00:05:36.320> to<00:05:36.440> hit<00:05:36.530> her<00:05:36.650> now<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:37.220> she'll
