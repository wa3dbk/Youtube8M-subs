going to do we're going to do a

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.380 
going to do we're going to do a
butcher's<00:04:17.830> knot<00:04:18.040> here<00:04:18.280> which<00:04:18.430> is<00:04:18.580> simple<00:04:18.940> hold

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
butcher's knot here which is simple hold

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.750 
butcher's knot here which is simple hold
the<00:04:19.510> string<00:04:20.170> over<00:04:20.350> your<00:04:20.500> hand<00:04:20.710> grab<00:04:21.460> it<00:04:21.640> with

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
your fingers underneath and make a loop

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.580 
your fingers underneath and make a loop
and<00:04:23.770> just<00:04:24.700> put<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:24.970> string<00:04:25.270> through<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:26.500> it

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
and just put the string through and it

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.430 
and just put the string through and it
becomes<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.980> slipknot<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.990> will<00:04:29.110> hold<00:04:29.290> in

we're going to make another loop and tie

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.710 
we're going to make another loop and tie
it<00:04:34.360> off<00:04:34.510> on<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.810> end<00:04:35.010> there<00:04:36.010> we<00:04:36.130> go
