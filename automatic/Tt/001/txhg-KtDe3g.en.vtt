going to do is put the penny in the tin

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.950 
going to do is put the penny in the tin
pan<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.960> as<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.109> move<00:00:25.320> up<00:00:25.529> closer<00:00:26.810> you<00:00:27.810> can

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
pan like so as I move up closer you can

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.820 
pan like so as I move up closer you can
barely<00:00:28.680> see<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:30.029> penny<00:00:30.240> now<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.560> Far

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
barely see the penny now is in the Far

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.530 
barely see the penny now is in the Far
Away<00:00:31.940> it<00:00:32.940> disappears<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.700> now<00:00:35.700> what<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
Away it disappears and now what the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.240 
Away it disappears and now what the
light<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.739> pour<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> water

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
light is going to do as I pour the water

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.150 
light is going to do as I pour the water
into<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.910> tin<00:00:39.120> pan<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> refract

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
into the tin pan it's going to refract

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.130 
into the tin pan it's going to refract
and<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> image<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> penny<00:00:42.239> will<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.840> shown

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
and the image of the penny will be shown

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:54.729 
and the image of the penny will be shown
through<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> parent<00:00:44.520> depth<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.750> pan<00:00:45.960> now

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.020 

without<00:00:55.739> even<00:00:56.100> moving<00:00:57.079> there's<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.559> penny

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
without even moving there's the penny

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.920 
without even moving there's the penny
now<00:01:00.030> apparent<00:01:00.930> depth<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.440> regarding<00:01:02.930> two

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
now apparent depth is regarding two

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.750 
now apparent depth is regarding two
different<00:01:04.320> things<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.769> regards<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> height

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
different things it regards the height

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.510 
different things it regards the height
and<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.990> reflection<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.100> refraction

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and the reflection of the refraction

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.800 
and the reflection of the refraction
angle<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.720> image<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:11.210> pretty<00:01:12.210> soon<00:01:12.479> i

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
angle of the image and pretty soon i

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.990 
angle of the image and pretty soon i
will<00:01:12.840> show<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.380> an<00:01:13.710> equation<00:01:14.040> about<00:01:14.729> how<00:01:14.939> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
will show you an equation about how to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.950 
will show you an equation about how to
do<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.930> solving<00:01:16.290> our<00:01:16.380> problem<00:01:16.939> guarding

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
do so in solving our problem guarding

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.230 
do so in solving our problem guarding
apparent<00:01:18.960> death

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.990 

so<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> part<00:01:22.619> where<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.880> solve<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
so this is the part where we solve a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.370 
so this is the part where we solve a
problem<00:01:24.240> using<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.810> apparent<00:01:25.170> depth

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
problem using the apparent depth

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.810 
problem using the apparent depth

glass and quartz just as easily as you
could<00:02:19.380> water<00:02:19.849> ok<00:02:20.849> so<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.510> start<00:02:21.720> off<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
could water ok so to start off the

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.020 
could water ok so to start off the
problem<00:02:22.260> we'll<00:02:23.099> have<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:24.810> man<00:02:25.760> looking<00:02:26.760> down

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
problem we'll have a man looking down

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.410 
problem we'll have a man looking down
into<00:02:27.299> water<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.709> there's<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.280> man's<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.640> ok

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
into water so there's the man's I ok

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.349 
into water so there's the man's I ok
there's<00:02:31.290> his<00:02:31.470> eye<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.799> he's<00:02:32.760> looking<00:02:33.150> down

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
there's his eye and he's looking down

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:39.050 
there's his eye and he's looking down
into<00:02:33.420> water<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:35.070> we'll<00:02:35.280> draw<00:02:35.549> that<00:02:37.850> ok<00:02:38.850> that's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
into water so we'll draw that ok that's

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.860 
into water so we'll draw that ok that's
enough<00:02:39.150> water<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.769> then<00:02:40.769> he's<00:02:41.760> got<00:02:42.209> lv<00:02:42.510> about

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
enough water and then he's got lv about

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.690 
enough water and then he's got lv about
30<00:02:43.170> degrees<00:02:43.530> they'll<00:02:43.799> tell<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.190> all<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.519> in

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
30 degrees they'll tell you all this in

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.170 
30 degrees they'll tell you all this in
the<00:02:44.760> problem<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.320> then<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.820> first<00:02:48.090> thing

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
the problem and then so the first thing

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.120 
the problem and then so the first thing
you're<00:02:48.420> going<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.600> do<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.079> draw<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.130> normal

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
you're going to do is draw the normal

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.520 
you're going to do is draw the normal
which<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:54.030> normal<00:02:54.329> is<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.750> line<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.380> for

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
which the normal is just a line just for

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.559 
which the normal is just a line just for
reference<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:56.359> make<00:02:57.359> with<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:59.370> angle<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.150> i

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
reference to make with the angle so i

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.750 
reference to make with the angle so i
drew<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.560> over<00:03:01.769> here<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.100> make<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.280> more<00:03:02.549> clear

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
drew it over here to make it more clear

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.210 
drew it over here to make it more clear
but<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.299> can<00:03:03.450> easily<00:03:03.660> draw<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.109> here<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:05.130> you

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
but you can easily draw it here so you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.370 
but you can easily draw it here so you
can<00:03:05.430> see<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.389> a<00:03:06.420> 30-degree<00:03:07.139> angle

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
can see that this is a 30-degree angle

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.420 
can see that this is a 30-degree angle
right<00:03:07.889> there<00:03:08.239> ok<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.620> first<00:03:10.920> thing<00:03:11.100> you're

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
right there ok so the first thing you're

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.550 
right there ok so the first thing you're
going<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:11.609> do<00:03:11.870> because<00:03:12.870> we<00:03:13.200> all<00:03:13.319> know<00:03:13.530> that

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
going to do because we all know that

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.059 
going to do because we all know that
this<00:03:13.859> is<00:03:14.040> air<00:03:14.459> this<00:03:15.329> is<00:03:15.480> going<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.690> be<00:03:15.810> water

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
this is air this is going to be water

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.420 
this is air this is going to be water
the<00:03:17.069> index<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.639> refraction<00:03:17.700> over<00:03:18.480> here<00:03:18.780> is

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
the index of refraction over here is

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.160 
the index of refraction over here is
1.00<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.970> if<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.329> look<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.630> up<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.989> book

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
1.00 and if we look it up in the book

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.470 
1.00 and if we look it up in the book
over<00:03:22.620> here<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.880> index<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.420> refraction<00:03:24.680> for

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
over here the index of refraction for

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.040 
over here the index of refraction for
water<00:03:27.480> water<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:29.510> 1.33

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.160 

okay<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:37.190> plug<00:03:38.180> those<00:03:38.420> numbers<00:03:38.480> into<00:03:39.140> the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
okay so plug those numbers into the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.220 
okay so plug those numbers into the
equation<00:03:39.290> it's<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.130> simple<00:03:40.160> okay<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:41.230> you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
equation it's that simple okay so you

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.170 
equation it's that simple okay so you
have<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:42.560> take<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.800> corresponding<00:03:43.730> angles

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
have to take the corresponding angles

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.730 
have to take the corresponding angles
and<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.450> corresponding<00:03:44.750> indexes<00:03:45.710> of

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
and the corresponding indexes of

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.730 
and the corresponding indexes of
refraction<00:03:46.640> so<00:03:47.120> what<00:03:47.360> you're<00:03:47.510> going<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.720> do<00:03:47.930> so

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
refraction so what you're going to do so

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.700 
refraction so what you're going to do so
n<00:03:49.010> 1<00:03:49.550> that'll<00:03:50.300> be<00:03:50.390> air<00:03:50.830> so<00:03:51.910> 1.00<00:03:53.440> times<00:03:54.440> the

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
n 1 that'll be air so 1.00 times the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:01.750 
n 1 that'll be air so 1.00 times the
sine<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.720> 30<00:03:56.720> degrees<00:03:58.990> okay<00:03:59.990> and<00:04:00.220> then<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.580> is

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
sine of 30 degrees okay and then that is

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.630 
sine of 30 degrees okay and then that is
going<00:04:01.850> to<00:04:01.970> be<00:04:02.060> equal<00:04:02.210> to<00:04:02.570> water<00:04:02.810> which<00:04:03.110> is<00:04:03.640> 1.33

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
going to be equal to water which is 1.33

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.860 
going to be equal to water which is 1.33
and<00:04:05.380> then<00:04:06.380> times<00:04:06.820> sine<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:07.850> theta<00:04:08.240> you<00:04:08.690> don't

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
and then times sine of theta you don't

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.850 
and then times sine of theta you don't
know<00:04:08.960> if<00:04:09.020> ADA<00:04:09.200> because<00:04:09.470> we're<00:04:09.590> going<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.770> be

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
know if ADA because we're going to be

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.410 
know if ADA because we're going to be
solving<00:04:10.220> for<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.400> envelope<00:04:10.700> refraction

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
solving for the envelope refraction

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.500 
solving for the envelope refraction
that's<00:04:11.720> formed<00:04:12.170> or<00:04:12.380> so<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.370> first<00:04:13.670> step

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
that's formed or so the first step

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.330 
that's formed or so the first step
you're<00:04:14.750> going<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.960> do<00:04:15.110> is<00:04:15.350> find<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.130> sine<00:04:16.310> of

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
you're going to do is find the sine of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.349 
you're going to do is find the sine of
30<00:04:16.790> degrees<00:04:17.120> which<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.600> 0<00:04:17.810> point<00:04:18.019> 5<00:04:18.670> so<00:04:19.670> point<00:04:20.209> 5

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
30 degrees which is 0 point 5 so point 5

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.200 
30 degrees which is 0 point 5 so point 5
1<00:04:21.080> times<00:04:21.320> 0<00:04:21.410> point<00:04:21.560> 5<00:04:21.769> it's<00:04:22.610> going<00:04:22.790> to<00:04:22.850> be<00:04:22.940> point

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
1 times 0 point 5 it's going to be point

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.330 
1 times 0 point 5 it's going to be point
5<00:04:23.390> so<00:04:24.220> next<00:04:25.220> up<00:04:25.370> we're<00:04:25.490> going<00:04:25.670> to<00:04:25.730> do<00:04:25.850> is<00:04:26.060> divide

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
5 so next up we're going to do is divide

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.810 
5 so next up we're going to do is divide
point<00:04:28.340> 5<00:04:28.520> by<00:04:28.730> 1.33<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:30.380> solve<00:04:30.680> for<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.190> sine<00:04:31.490> of

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
point 5 by 1.33 to solve for the sine of

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.000 
point 5 by 1.33 to solve for the sine of
theta<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:33.050> okay<00:04:33.380> well<00:04:33.560> now<00:04:33.710> we'll<00:04:33.860> go<00:04:33.980> over

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
theta so okay well now we'll go over

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.080 
theta so okay well now we'll go over
here<00:04:34.220> because<00:04:34.400> we're<00:04:34.550> running<00:04:34.640> out<00:04:34.880> of<00:04:34.910> room

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
here because we're running out of room

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.920 
here because we're running out of room
over<00:04:35.240> there<00:04:35.420> it's<00:04:37.030> point<00:04:39.310> 3759<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.780> that's

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
over there it's point 3759 and that's

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.909 
over there it's point 3759 and that's
going<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.169> be<00:04:42.230> equal<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.740> sine<00:04:43.130> of<00:04:43.490> theta

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
going to be equal to the sine of theta

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.290 
going to be equal to the sine of theta
so<00:04:45.919> now<00:04:46.070> what<00:04:46.190> you're<00:04:46.310> going<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.550> do<00:04:46.730> is<00:04:47.000> go<00:04:47.240> on

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
so now what you're going to do is go on

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.420 
so now what you're going to do is go on
your<00:04:47.419> calculator<00:04:47.600> and<00:04:48.110> press<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.890> second

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
Enter well you actually don't really

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.440 
Enter well you actually don't really
have<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.550> press<00:04:55.700> ENTER<00:04:55.910> on<00:04:55.970> my<00:04:56.090> calculator

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
have to press ENTER on my calculator

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.300 
have to press ENTER on my calculator
that<00:04:56.660> comes<00:04:57.140> about<00:04:57.290> to<00:04:57.530> be<00:04:57.650> 22<00:04:58.870> point<00:04:59.870> 0<00:05:00.110> 8<00:05:00.680> is

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
that comes about to be 22 point 0 8 is

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.070 
that comes about to be 22 point 0 8 is
equal<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.790> theta<00:05:01.970> that's<00:05:02.690> going<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.930> be<00:05:02.960> in

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
equal to theta that's going to be in

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.909 
equal to theta that's going to be in
degrees<00:05:03.380> so<00:05:04.480> let's<00:05:05.480> round<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:05.930> to<00:05:06.140> three

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
degrees so let's round it to three

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.430 
degrees so let's round it to three
significant<00:05:07.700> figures<00:05:07.730> so<00:05:08.000> that'll<00:05:08.419> be<00:05:08.510> 20<00:05:08.840> 2.1

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
significant figures so that'll be 20 2.1

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.159 
significant figures so that'll be 20 2.1
degrees<00:05:09.730> is<00:05:10.730> equal<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:11.180> theta<00:05:11.360> that'll<00:05:12.050> be

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
degrees is equal to theta that'll be

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.800 
degrees is equal to theta that'll be
