gameplay and stuff here's my character

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.490 
gameplay and stuff here's my character
so<00:00:11.400> far<00:00:11.700> i<00:00:12.059> use<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> wine<00:00:13.440> hander<00:00:13.889> sword<00:00:14.400> shield

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
so far i use a wine hander sword shield

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.810 
so far i use a wine hander sword shield
i'm<00:00:16.500> only<00:00:16.650> level<00:00:16.859> 21<00:00:17.190> right<00:00:17.430> now<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.580> think<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
i'm only level 21 right now I think the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.740 
i'm only level 21 right now I think the
cap<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.359> 70<00:00:19.140> or<00:00:19.380> something<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.830> and

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
cap is 70 or something like that and

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.480 
cap is 70 or something like that and
this<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> starting<00:00:22.380> area<00:00:22.680> for<00:00:22.890> hunt<00:00:23.160> I

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
this is just a starting area for hunt I

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.189 
this is just a starting area for hunt I
think<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.850> get<00:00:24.000> about<00:00:24.150> 50<00:00:24.720> minutes<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.109> go

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
think you get about 50 minutes to go

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.960 
think you get about 50 minutes to go
around<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.470> hunt<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.430> pretty<00:00:26.609> much<00:00:26.789> done

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
around a hunt but it's pretty much done

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
perspective which is what I really going

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.840 
perspective which is what I really going
to<00:01:18.450> use<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> look<00:01:19.979> at<00:01:20.189> some<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to use so it's going to look at some of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.420 
to use so it's going to look at some of
the<00:01:21.030> areas<00:01:21.650> of<00:01:22.650> course<00:01:22.860> right<00:01:22.979> now<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.250> go

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the areas of course right now is to go

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.609 
the areas of course right now is to go
and<00:01:23.549> eliminate<00:01:24.030> all<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.420> blue<00:01:24.960> pretty<00:01:25.500> much

insanely insanely hard and usually can

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.840 
insanely insanely hard and usually can
take<00:03:19.600> more<00:03:19.810> than<00:03:19.900> one<00:03:20.049> person<00:03:20.160> or<00:03:21.160> just<00:03:21.370> you

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
take more than one person or just you

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.220 
take more than one person or just you
can<00:03:21.970> do<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.420> can<00:03:22.540> probably<00:03:22.870> do<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.019> by

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
can do to you can probably do it by

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.110 
can do to you can probably do it by
ourselves<00:03:23.260> but<00:03:23.890> it's<00:03:24.579> just<00:03:24.760> gonna<00:03:24.850> be<00:03:24.940> way

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
ourselves but it's just gonna be way

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.539 
ourselves but it's just gonna be way
harder<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.500> let's<00:03:26.980> go<00:03:27.100> ahead<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.250> look<00:03:27.459> at

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
harder so let's go ahead and look at

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.160 
harder so let's go ahead and look at
some<00:03:27.670> more<00:03:27.760> stuff

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.350 

we<00:03:31.500> can<00:03:31.620> go<00:03:31.800> over<00:03:32.490> here<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.000> try<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.240> kill

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
we can go over here and try and kill

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.520 
we can go over here and try and kill
some<00:03:33.540> more<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:36.510> I'll<00:03:36.840> show<00:03:36.989> off<00:03:37.110> my<00:03:37.230> three

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
some more and I'll show off my three
