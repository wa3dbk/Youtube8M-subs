them<00:01:32.600> in<00:01:32.840> clean<00:01:33.259> water<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:37.189> let<00:01:37.369> them<00:01:37.460> sit

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
them in clean water and I let them sit

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:38.800 
them in clean water and I let them sit
for<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.000> little<00:01:38.090> while

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
for a little while

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.580 
for a little while
stir<00:01:39.200> them<00:01:39.259> around<00:01:39.560> just<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:41.390> get<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.840> vinegar

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
stir them around just to get the vinegar

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.130 
stir them around just to get the vinegar
off<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:43.039> them<00:01:43.189> put<00:01:43.850> vinegar<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.509> a<00:01:44.570> mild<00:01:44.869> acid

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
off of them put vinegar is a mild acid

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.560 
off of them put vinegar is a mild acid
but<00:01:46.039> at<00:01:46.130> least<00:01:46.250> it's<00:01:46.549> biodegradable<00:01:46.729> and

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
but at least it's biodegradable and

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.990 
but at least it's biodegradable and
non-toxic<00:01:47.810> so<00:01:48.679> that's<00:01:48.890> why<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.159> like<00:01:49.429> to<00:01:49.490> use<00:01:49.789> it

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
non-toxic so that's why I like to use it

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.380 
non-toxic so that's why I like to use it
and<00:01:50.240> it's<00:01:50.390> cheap<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:51.979> it<00:01:52.039> works<00:01:52.220> good<00:01:52.549> let's

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
and it's cheap and it works good let's

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.960 
and it's cheap and it works good let's
take<00:01:53.569> these<00:01:53.810> up<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.500> just<00:01:55.340> blow<00:01:55.580> them<00:01:55.640> out<00:01:55.819> with

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
take these up I just blow them out with

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.749 
take these up I just blow them out with
compressed<00:01:56.360> air<00:01:56.979> through<00:01:57.979> make<00:01:58.250> sure<00:01:58.280> all<00:01:58.610> the

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
compressed air through make sure all the

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.200 
compressed air through make sure all the
holes<00:01:58.880> are<00:01:59.240> open

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.090 

we<00:02:04.210> go<00:02:04.359> that's<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.750> before<00:02:04.929> and<00:02:05.320> after<00:02:05.649> picture

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
we go that's a before and after picture

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.970 
we go that's a before and after picture
it<00:02:06.450> takes<00:02:07.450> about<00:02:07.810> 5-10<00:02:08.769> minutes<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.729> do<00:02:09.879> that

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
it takes about 5-10 minutes to do that

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.110 
it takes about 5-10 minutes to do that
