00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.269
 I will not open the program if you will see a message asking if I want to give a 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.269
 rest your efficiency in your decision 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.269
 Vanone does not do it. 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.829
 our side 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.560
 mold addams 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.130
 here you check option again 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.330
 I would say yes because even being a beginner does not have to leave the program 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.340
 blocked musicians 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.580
 here is where all the content of your game is 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.870
 should be organized 104.8 million estimated unwanted 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.720
 options will appear 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.930
 practically the same 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.120
 understandable 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.400
 here we have the shortcuts you can not use to allocate resources 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.680
 more quickly on games of this type 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.000
 Let's add more to wait. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.520
 all this base scenario is right click at the beginning wanted 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.590
 and if it hurt, discard will look like 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.620
 actions marina is giving its name 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 let's keep an eye on the ranking 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.280
 let's physically put 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 ball 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.670
 Let's load the instant 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 will use the group operates mini mind has several 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.750
 but let's use the good time 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.710
 with a brilliant 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.710
 and there appears in the right corner selected 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.760
 for a while 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.760
 Unpleasant of us to do only this that confirmed 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.830
 there appears next year and we will now add the object looks like it is going 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.670
 to be good 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.380
 directed us from bizet 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.520
 brazil offshore that's it 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.430
 for object loss 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.920
 have many 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.340
 I did it here where we can 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.570
 work with objects 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.670
 in arms 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.809
 How can you be fine? 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:13.009
 Let's explain more seductively of the mind the next classes 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.699
 here is where the actions take place 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.089
 must go jackson 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.419
 here is where we define the effects 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:25.680
 in this ranking 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.569
 biosphere 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.549
 if we are going to send the name of the ball object always put the head in the thorax pr 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.739
 is defined 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.730
 six unguarded beaches one end of the program makes it easier to visualize 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.849
 here some options the brand will be solid or we will not stay after 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.969
 also 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.629
 since also year object to go masked also we will be more to the 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.289
 front 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.059
 for a while 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.459
 our object of attack years we were to confirm 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.459
 of receipt 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.859
 done that let's create 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.410
 a level of play 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.959
 that the pomegranate 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.349
 Salazar dew are the levels 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.969
 employees are excited about positioning themselves on 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.719
 where the game happens less 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:22.970
 for now only 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.679
 Let's confirm 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:27.679
 since more care was created 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.529
 then we will now have changed the movement the ball 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:38.119
 let's on good object and new right button 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.239
 and let's start giving children and young people the ball 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.899
 Let's add an event. 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:49.779
 so several events here 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.079
 here they will need to use said he 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.009
 looks like 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.309
 the aquidauanense 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.399
 for ney franc 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.760
 Who's going up again? 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.949
 has eliminated 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.189
 down 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.189
 will be selected the events that we will use 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.129
 well now 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.469
 so we can see traded goods 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.030
 I'm not here 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.030
 we have to know how the Cartesian plane works 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.740
 also we will not use that instant moving in the direction was that they are 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.309
 men but we have ahead 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:34.300
 in Cartesian plane 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.729
 The new computational nucleus is different from what it never 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.189
 Do you see in school? 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:41.849
 or ibson 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.400
 he has with his negative values ​​up and the positive down 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.330
 the abnormal file 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.550
 three negative children after being elected positive 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.580
 just be careful he make proof of school not to get confused and now 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.199
 complete as a signed professional 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.639
 mazinho 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.050
 well in this local movie plan 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.029
 now we can add the actions 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.029
 the events we have created 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.830
 do not worry, it's free to walk 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:18.900
 on the left 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.900
 selected 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.589
 jeff teague winds and rain 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:30.619
 and you are going to ask the value of x and y as fishing we will move 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.729
 the negative value of xc so let's use less 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.169
 5 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.919
 nivaldo europe 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.819
 five 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:43.819
 mark is relative on this track 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.479
 ever 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.569
 I caught you 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.300
 if you have not checked the update at all 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.780
 afraid to walk 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.080
 yesterday that always marks her 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.080
 Get up now, same thing. 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:04.289
 we stay there he will do it just as it is up wilson moods 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.930
 as negative it is not 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.300
 - yea 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.740
 the power in france 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.889
 marcó and róbston renatinho too 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.939
 to the right 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:21.939
 are the calls are difficult times 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:25.039
 positive five 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.369
 previously 

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.699
 down 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:32.249
 same thing in relation 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:35.249
 down on me this happens positively 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.960
 relative to that 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.569
 and so in ten years all the parties to all our events 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:47.100
 they are confirmed 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.069
 israel is not ready 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:51.399
 now 

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:55.180
 we're going to have to put the object in the beginning 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.339
 We can not mess with him. 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:59.279
 cabrini see here 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:02.279
 be vegetarian and we put objects 

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:05.869
 if we put the next mandate this year 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.740
 you put as tunnels on our site 

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:13.869
 we put it left here right 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:20.539
 let's confirm now and be ready in our first step of the game 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:23.020
 Let's prove that we do not 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.539
 here we go take 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:28.539
 Let's have a meeting there. 

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:32.499
 without naming the same 

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:33.689
 Paulo 

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:36.339
 and let's run to see how it got 

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:39.339
 Robinho 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.629
 to load this here 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.169
 up 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:45.340
 down 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.499
 be the first 

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:50.589
 you can combine saints to make the diagonal movements 

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:54.749
 we do not have all the moves are men 

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:58.379
 they are the first 

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:00.300
 Eminem 

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.380
 next week
