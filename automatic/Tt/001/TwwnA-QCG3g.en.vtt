00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.060
 I knew that the first easy one was going to play 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.680
 in a way and that if we pass the 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.570
 second phase onwards was going to play from 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.280
 another way that pretty much had it 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.930
 clear later with respect to the 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.780
 matches especially the first three 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.690
 but to the other means in many 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.540
 often mix the actions of 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.100
 game that you see when it was that I left 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.500
 back now I remember yes it was 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.000
 with belgium but what of the time if for 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.420
 example that we can not remember well 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.580
 what a match it was with the water theme 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.270
 that's good because you enter a vortex 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.640
 you saw but have to calm down and 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.830
 start thinking you see a few times you 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.740
 you forget because they are so many players and 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.810
 both cat and one behind the other and if 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.610
 in the end we play more and more often not 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.220
 like at the beginning that we play every 67 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.020
 days later we play every four days and 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.420
 they were the trips one-way trips 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.250
 back so we had a 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.050
 game make up usa we had played in 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.570
 December in November sorry in 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.490
 November of the previous year and we had 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.500
 won very well and we had played with that 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.780
 scheme and we had done very well 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.759
 but logical one thing is a the scheme and 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.950
 others 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.500
 and suddenly with different players the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.560
 scheme is no longer the same and there 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.969
 Suddenly the mistake of mine was greater 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.619
 that 's good change already afterwards for the 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.719
 second half third time 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.979
 we had more options than they had 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.049
 the clearest options 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.920
 we had a dubious play in the area of 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.109
 them and so even match who had 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.020
 the best Argentine options are 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:01.619
 general lines 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.450
 or that party as you say there is a 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.859
 winner could have won Argentina 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.929
 good but it was very even and won 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.409
 germany and very satisfied so 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.409
 did the players 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.380
 they made a great game I made a change 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.880
 because like taking into account that 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.770
 Germany had played the previous day 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.030
 that he had practically played 30 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.280
 minutes with us we had played the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.930
 day before the day after we had 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.820
 played lengthen that we had been criminal 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.280
 with the great physical wear and 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.260
 psychological thought that yes go to the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.900
 supplementary would have been negative 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.880
 then there you can put to good 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.470
 instead of the time and to give it more 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.410
 Messi company to try to see if 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.870
 we could make a goal 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.060
 even at the expense of neglecting a little 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.010
 defense what I could not was take it out to 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.780
 that and leave it at the same time and because 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.760
 it was too much that had been left 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.350
 also too unprotected to the team 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.240
 then within the search for a 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.220
 simple balance I like to do 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.410
 changes a little bit forward a 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.120
 little bit back handle like the 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.320
 nut a little bit adjust it a little bit 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.270
 for spoken to the other not to do 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.250
 drastic changes drastic changes 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.960
 with me they do not wait but the great merit 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.660
 beyond that is that of the players 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.860
 who made a great world cup which 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.370
 I want the whole world is their 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.409
 grateful and how good they are going to be 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.540
 a little bit in the history of all of 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:21.370
 all of everything they gave and the 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.370
 feeling that aroused the agent
