logging<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> data<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.850> then<00:01:44.939> I'll<00:01:45.060> export<00:01:45.540> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
logging the data and then I'll export it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.530 
logging the data and then I'll export it
will<00:01:46.189> do<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.250> kind<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.850> comparative<00:01:48.299> analysis

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
will do a kind of a comparative analysis

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.010 
will do a kind of a comparative analysis
of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.790> data<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.270> different<00:01:51.720> mediums

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
of the data from these different mediums

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.080 
of the data from these different mediums
so<00:01:55.020> we'll<00:01:55.170> begin<00:01:55.350> our<00:01:55.619> test<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.460> foam

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
so we'll begin our test with the foam

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:07.200 
so we'll begin our test with the foam
earplugs<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.920> chart<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.979> vibration

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.199 

got<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.660> foam<00:02:07.900> earplugs

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
got the foam earplugs

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.590 
got the foam earplugs
in<00:02:10.450> testing

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
in testing

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.480 
in testing
okay<00:02:13.600> for<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.900> moon<00:02:14.080> gel<00:02:14.290> vibration<00:02:14.860> test<00:02:15.370> I'm

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
okay for the moon gel vibration test I'm

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.360 
okay for the moon gel vibration test I'm
going<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.670> use<00:02:15.790> two<00:02:16.650> little<00:02:17.650> strips<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.130> moon

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
going to use two little strips of moon

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.150 
going to use two little strips of moon
gel<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.940> just<00:02:19.150> going<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.360> mount<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:20.160> directly

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
gel and just going to mount it directly

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.660 
gel and just going to mount it directly
on<00:02:21.670> top<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.180> quad<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.720> then<00:02:23.490> we'll<00:02:24.490> give

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
on top of the quad and then we'll give

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:40.370 
on top of the quad and then we'll give
this<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:24.880> 30<00:02:25.270> second<00:02:25.690> hover<00:02:25.870> test

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.640 

for<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.740> sore<00:02:41.980> birth<00:02:42.130> ain<00:02:42.310> I've<00:02:42.640> made<00:02:43.270> two

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
for the sore birth ain I've made two

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.550 
for the sore birth ain I've made two
very<00:02:44.650> similar<00:02:44.980> cuts<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.030> moon<00:02:46.690> gel<00:02:46.960> size

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
very similar cuts to the moon gel size

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.760 
very similar cuts to the moon gel size
now<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:49.120> footprint<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.630> fairly<00:02:50.440> similar

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
now the footprint is fairly similar

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.250 
now the footprint is fairly similar
probably<00:02:51.400> about<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.640> same<00:02:51.880> thickness<00:02:52.720> but

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
probably about the same thickness but

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.200 
probably about the same thickness but
you<00:02:53.980> know<00:02:54.100> it's<00:02:54.280> it's<00:02:54.550> definitely<00:02:54.700> not<00:02:55.000> as

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
you know it's it's definitely not as

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.510 
you know it's it's definitely not as
squishy<00:02:55.630> as<00:02:56.430> as<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.910> moon<00:02:58.090> gel<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:59.340> we'll<00:03:00.340> see

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
squishy as as the moon gel so we'll see

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.120 
squishy as as the moon gel so we'll see
a<00:03:00.550> little<00:03:00.730> bit<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.240> a<00:03:01.710> good<00:03:02.710> or<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> bad

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
a little bit of that a good or a bad

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:21.740 
a little bit of that a good or a bad
thing

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.720 

okay<00:03:22.750> let's<00:03:22.990> take<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.260> look<00:03:23.500> at<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.740> vibration

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
okay let's take a look at the vibration

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.490 
okay let's take a look at the vibration
data<00:03:25.440> we<00:03:26.440> have<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:28.450> ear<00:03:28.630> plug<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.170> foam<00:03:29.350> ear

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
data we have the ear plug the foam ear

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.910 
data we have the ear plug the foam ear
plugs<00:03:29.740> moon<00:03:30.250> gel<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:30.880> soar<00:03:31.090> birthing<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.920> you

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
plugs moon gel and soar birthing and you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.070 
plugs moon gel and soar birthing and you
know<00:03:33.040> each<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.370> these<00:03:33.460> the<00:03:33.640> raw<00:03:33.820> data<00:03:34.630> for<00:03:34.930> each

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
know each of these the raw data for each

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.280 
know each of these the raw data for each
axis<00:03:35.710> is<00:03:35.920> in<00:03:36.820> its<00:03:36.970> own<00:03:37.210> sheet<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.900> then<00:03:38.200> we

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
axis is in its own sheet and then we

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
axis is in its own sheet and then we
have<00:03:38.440> a<00:03:38.470> chart<00:03:39.210> for<00:03:40.210> each<00:03:40.390> axis<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.890> looking<00:03:42.190> at

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
have a chart for each axis so looking at

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.570 
have a chart for each axis so looking at
the<00:03:42.400> x-axis<00:03:43.120> chart<00:03:43.510> you'll<00:03:43.780> notice<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.580> with

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
the x-axis chart you'll notice that with

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.940 
the x-axis chart you'll notice that with
the<00:03:45.730> ear<00:03:45.850> plugs<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.480> moon<00:03:47.470> gel<00:03:47.709> did

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
the ear plugs and moon gel did

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.980 
the ear plugs and moon gel did
significantly<00:03:48.280> better<00:03:49.090> than<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:49.630> sort<00:03:49.870> of

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
significantly better than the sort of

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.820 
significantly better than the sort of
thing<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:51.070> moon<00:03:51.280> gel<00:03:51.520> actually<00:03:52.530> has<00:03:53.530> pretty

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
thing the moon gel actually has pretty

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.540 
thing the moon gel actually has pretty
much<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.280> lowest<00:03:54.490> footprint<00:03:55.300> of<00:03:55.510> all<00:03:55.690> three

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
much the lowest footprint of all three

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.710 
much the lowest footprint of all three
so<00:03:57.550> we'll<00:03:57.640> go<00:03:57.790> ahead<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.090> head<00:03:58.209> over<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.600> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
so we'll go ahead and head over to the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.410 
so we'll go ahead and head over to the
y-axis<00:03:58.900> chart<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:02.010> once<00:04:03.010> again<00:04:03.300> sort<00:04:04.300> of

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
y-axis chart and once again sort of

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.270 
y-axis chart and once again sort of
Thayne<00:04:05.550> kind<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:06.670> all<00:04:06.850> over<00:04:07.209> the<00:04:07.330> place<00:04:08.280> you

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
Thayne kind of all over the place you

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.170 
Thayne kind of all over the place you
know<00:04:09.370> ear<00:04:09.580> plugs<00:04:11.400> relatively<00:04:12.930> decent<00:04:15.180> damping

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
know ear plugs relatively decent damping

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.810 
know ear plugs relatively decent damping
and<00:04:16.390> then<00:04:16.950> moon<00:04:17.950> gel<00:04:18.250> just<00:04:18.609> pretty<00:04:19.359> much<00:04:20.820> you

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
and then moon gel just pretty much you

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.030 
and then moon gel just pretty much you
know<00:04:21.940> knocked<00:04:22.210> it<00:04:22.390> out<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.690> park<00:04:22.990> it's<00:04:23.200> the

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
know knocked it out of the park it's the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.260 
know knocked it out of the park it's the
lowest<00:04:24.250> footprint<00:04:24.910> once<00:04:25.120> again<00:04:25.479> of<00:04:25.690> all<00:04:25.840> three

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
lowest footprint once again of all three

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
lowest footprint once again of all three
so<00:04:28.270> let's<00:04:28.450> take<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.690> look<00:04:28.900> at<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.140> z-axis<00:04:31.290> so

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
so let's take a look at the z-axis so

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.290 
so let's take a look at the z-axis so
sort<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.620> thing<00:04:32.800> looks<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:34.270> know

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
sort of a thing looks like it's you know

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.770 
sort of a thing looks like it's you know
pretty<00:04:34.720> pretty<00:04:34.990> noisy<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.510> know<00:04:37.510> I<00:04:37.540> think

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
pretty pretty noisy and you know I think

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.280 
pretty pretty noisy and you know I think
it's<00:04:37.900> for<00:04:38.140> me

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
it's for me

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.710 
it's for me
you<00:04:38.530> could<00:04:38.710> almost<00:04:38.850> declare<00:04:39.850> a<00:04:39.880> tie<00:04:40.210> for<00:04:40.270> both

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
you could almost declare a tie for both

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.350 
you could almost declare a tie for both
the<00:04:40.870> ear<00:04:40.930> plugs<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:41.410> moon<00:04:41.650> gel<00:04:41.979> so<00:04:42.760> all<00:04:43.060> in<00:04:43.240> all

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
the ear plugs and moon gel so all in all

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.850 
the ear plugs and moon gel so all in all
moon<00:04:43.990> gel<00:04:44.260> really<00:04:45.870> seemed<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:46.900> yield<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.650> best

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
moon gel really seemed to yield the best

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.200 
moon gel really seemed to yield the best
results<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:50.320> all<00:04:50.530> three<00:04:50.860> now<00:04:51.100> keep<00:04:52.060> in<00:04:52.150> mind

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
results of all three now keep in mind

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.110 
results of all three now keep in mind
the<00:04:52.450> foam<00:04:52.840> ear<00:04:53.020> plugs<00:04:53.320> are<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:54.610> know<00:04:54.729> really

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
the foam ear plugs are you know really

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.000 
the foam ear plugs are you know really
not<00:04:55.330> designed<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:57.880> know<00:04:58.000> for<00:04:59.010> vibration

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
not designed you know for vibration

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.680 
not designed you know for vibration
dampening<00:05:00.669> they<00:05:00.880> were<00:05:00.940> they<00:05:01.240> were<00:05:01.300> just<00:05:01.570> a

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
dampening they were they were just a

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.260 
dampening they were they were just a
suggestion<00:05:02.140> that<00:05:02.350> actually<00:05:03.060> worked<00:05:04.060> out

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
suggestion that actually worked out

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.080 
suggestion that actually worked out
fairly<00:05:05.140> well<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.770> they're<00:05:05.979> obviously<00:05:06.610> the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
fairly well and they're obviously the

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.430 
fairly well and they're obviously the
cheapest<00:05:07.720> of<00:05:07.950> all<00:05:08.950> three<00:05:09.280> solutions<00:05:10.200> moon<00:05:11.200> gel

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
cheapest of all three solutions moon gel

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.890 
cheapest of all three solutions moon gel
relatively<00:05:14.440> inexpensive<00:05:15.070> as<00:05:15.190> well<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:16.750> don't

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
relatively inexpensive as well you don't

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.750 
relatively inexpensive as well you don't
get<00:05:17.169> you<00:05:17.860> know<00:05:17.890> with<00:05:18.130> each<00:05:18.220> pack<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:18.640> get

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
get you know with each pack you get

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.420 
get you know with each pack you get
about<00:05:18.970> four<00:05:19.300> small<00:05:19.690> strips<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:20.560> just

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
about four small strips so just

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.250 
about four small strips so just
something<00:05:22.150> to<00:05:22.240> keep<00:05:22.390> in<00:05:22.540> mind<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:22.930> then<00:05:23.020> sort

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
something to keep in mind and then sort

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.760 
something to keep in mind and then sort
of<00:05:23.290> a<00:05:23.350> thing<00:05:23.610> actually<00:05:24.610> I<00:05:24.669> got<00:05:24.820> a<00:05:25.770> relatively

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
of a thing actually I got a relatively

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.180 
of a thing actually I got a relatively
large<00:05:27.070> sheet<00:05:27.430> of<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.729> and<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:29.070> you<00:05:30.070> know

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
large sheet of it and I you know

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.890 
large sheet of it and I you know
wouldn't<00:05:30.729> roll<00:05:30.910> it<00:05:31.030> out<00:05:31.150> just<00:05:31.419> yet<00:05:31.690> it's

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
wouldn't roll it out just yet it's

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.240 
wouldn't roll it out just yet it's
actually<00:05:32.410> a<00:05:32.470> 52

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
actually a 52

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.320 
actually a 52
which<00:05:34.180> is<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.360> harder<00:05:35.730> medium<00:05:36.730> than<00:05:36.970> like<00:05:37.180> the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
which is a harder medium than like the
