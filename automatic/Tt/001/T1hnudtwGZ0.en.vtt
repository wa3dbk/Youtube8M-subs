00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.279
 stakeholders when you preferred 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.809
 yeah there it goes great you I was 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.059
 a bit of a game against buying this because 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.590
 that I took beating on the key but I 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.470
 I told myself I'm going to play against them 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.330
 it's drier it has to go 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.330
 will finally know who is the best duo 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.650
 you are used to seeing us play 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.790
 together but never against each other 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.740
 and then it's true that there is a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.310
 litigation then there is a story or 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.189
 in celebration in a bar good I have stung 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.160

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.170
 that was it I lost is clear 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.820
 with a ream of synthpop you see 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.170
 I told you yesterday on the stage with 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.030
 I was 120 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.440
 the plax thing did not know was that 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.270
 the mines did not disappear at 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.010

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.350
 I've seen one of them 2 3 you see I'm 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.000
 second are finished would have earlier who 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.040
 loved himself mines in his ore line 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.550
 there was a mine that is at 35 it was 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.600
 magnificent 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.260
 it was horrible I had mine 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.950
 that they have indeed tested but I know 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.880
 well dude I know but it's like 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.459
 that must be accepted 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:36.130
 frankly it's farted the mines cpt is 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.799
 so well there is 2 1 for you there is 2 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.959
 0 for you even there will be 2 1 the end of 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.380
 the party as by chance the vod that goes 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.820
 to walk is the one I would have won 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.110
 audrey has said enough that you had 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.209
 won the first two if I win 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.000
 it's there anyway at the flight tx on 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.459
 can recognize it a little slow bit this 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.480
 so stop crying and fight a 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.739
 little worried 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.209
 and then here it is here I hope that 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.350
 I'm going to come back because 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.930
 it is true that my morale has taken a small 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.930
 blow in the mouth your honor 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.490

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.340
 that they win a game against me 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.320
 still the first thing that does 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.040
 place to a glass of water for example because 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.930
 that he has he sweated before invited himself 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.910

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.910
 go to okami and everything was played 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.400

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.110
