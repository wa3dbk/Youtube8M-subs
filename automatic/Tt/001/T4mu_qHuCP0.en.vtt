a<00:01:33.240> game<00:01:33.450> called<00:01:33.600> skyhawk<00:01:34.229> out<00:01:34.979> there<00:01:35.369> that's

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
a game called skyhawk out there that's

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.240 
a game called skyhawk out there that's
basically<00:01:36.119> mech<00:01:36.659> versus<00:01:37.200> pilot<00:01:37.829> i'm<00:01:38.070> in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
basically mech versus pilot i'm in

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.120 
basically mech versus pilot i'm in
verses<00:01:38.790> min<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.650> was<00:01:40.770> more<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.040> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
verses min and but that was more of a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 
verses min and but that was more of a
third-person<00:01:41.549> shooter<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.570> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
third-person shooter so this is not a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.440 
third-person shooter so this is not a
revolutionary<00:01:43.680> game<00:01:43.920> by<00:01:44.369> any<00:01:44.640> stretch<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
revolutionary game by any stretch of the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.200 
revolutionary game by any stretch of the
imagination<00:01:45.570> at<00:01:46.290> all<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.909> does<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.180> of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
imagination at all and that does kind of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.300 
imagination at all and that does kind of
bother<00:01:48.450> me<00:01:48.689> about<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.799> people<00:01:50.130> say

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
bother me about that like people say

doesn't get the fuck out of here it is

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.149 
doesn't get the fuck out of here it is
it's<00:01:56.880> not<00:01:57.060> rebel<00:01:57.450> she's<00:01:57.570> been<00:01:57.750> done<00:01:57.960> before<00:01:58.159> it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
suck is maybe disappointing I can get

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.300 
suck is maybe disappointing I can get

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
that because maybe kind of felt you

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.460 
that because maybe kind of felt you
deserved<00:05:02.460> more<00:05:02.669> and<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.630> feel<00:05:04.139> like<00:05:04.169> the

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
deserved more and I feel like the

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.870 
deserved more and I feel like the
biggest<00:05:04.650> thing<00:05:05.010> that's<00:05:05.160> holding<00:05:05.430> this<00:05:05.669> game

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
biggest thing that's holding this game

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.939 
biggest thing that's holding this game
back<00:05:06.030> is<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.360> lack<00:05:06.539> of<00:05:06.570> death<00:05:07.050> between<00:05:07.560> its

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
back is the lack of death between its

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.500 
back is the lack of death between its
characters<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.699> single<00:05:08.940> player<00:05:09.150> or

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
characters and the single player or

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.290 
characters and the single player or
whatever<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:09.990> campaign<00:05:10.530> multiplayer<00:05:10.740> or<00:05:11.370> the

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
whatever the campaign multiplayer or the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.450 
whatever the campaign multiplayer or the
depth<00:05:12.840> of<00:05:12.990> like<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.440> weapons<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.099> all<00:05:14.220> that

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
depth of like the weapons and all that

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.800 
depth of like the weapons and all that
stuff<00:05:14.610> even<00:05:14.970> though<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.060> believe<00:05:15.330> their<00:05:15.570> doubts

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
stuff even though I believe their doubts

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.990 
stuff even though I believe their doubts
even<00:05:16.020> though<00:05:16.260> there's<00:05:17.070> only<00:05:17.190> one<00:05:17.490> weapon<00:05:17.729> in

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
even though there's only one weapon in

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.790 
even though there's only one weapon in
this<00:05:18.120> game<00:05:18.300> which<00:05:18.479> i<00:05:18.599> think<00:05:18.660> is<00:05:18.960> overpowering

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
this game which i think is overpowering

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.879 
this game which i think is overpowering
in<00:05:20.479> it<00:05:21.479> could<00:05:21.660> be<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.900> shotgun<00:05:22.380> if<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.620> want

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
in it could be the shotgun if you want

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.560 
in it could be the shotgun if you want
to<00:05:23.070> but<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.610> don't<00:05:23.880> really<00:05:24.000> think<00:05:24.150> that's<00:05:24.389> all

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
to but I don't really think that's all

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.180 
to but I don't really think that's all
power<00:05:24.840> but<00:05:25.020> I<00:05:25.050> think<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.470> only<00:05:25.530> weapon<00:05:26.070> that's

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
power but I think the only weapon that's

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.830 
power but I think the only weapon that's
over<00:05:26.490> power<00:05:26.729> in<00:05:26.820> this<00:05:26.880> game<00:05:26.940> look<00:05:27.210> at<00:05:27.300> this<00:05:27.389> you

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
over power in this game look at this you

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.469 
over power in this game look at this you

I die the only gun that's over power in

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.779 
I die the only gun that's over power in
this<00:05:33.539> game<00:05:33.630> I<00:05:33.870> believe<00:05:33.930> is<00:05:34.349> a<00:05:34.610> smart<00:05:35.610> pistol

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
this game I believe is a smart pistol

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.659 
this game I believe is a smart pistol
with<00:05:36.780> advanced<00:05:37.110> targeting<00:05:37.380> the<00:05:38.250> lock<00:05:38.460> on

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
with advanced targeting the lock on

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.219 
with advanced targeting the lock on
feature<00:05:38.940> with<00:05:39.150> that<00:05:39.300> with<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:39.840> van<00:05:39.990> sorry

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
feature with that with the van sorry

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.560 
feature with that with the van sorry
it's<00:05:40.380> just<00:05:40.440> ridiculous<00:05:41.220> yeah<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:41.970> I<00:05:42.389> hope

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
it's just ridiculous yeah and I hope

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.540 
it's just ridiculous yeah and I hope
that<00:05:42.750> gets<00:05:42.870> nerfed<00:05:43.200> but<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:43.800> think<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.340> smart

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
that gets nerfed but I think the smart

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.520 
that gets nerfed but I think the smart
pistol<00:05:44.760> in<00:05:44.970> general<00:05:45.330> is<00:05:45.510> not<00:05:45.720> really<00:05:46.050> it's

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
pistol in general is not really it's

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.560 
pistol in general is not really it's
just<00:05:46.680> annoying<00:05:47.070> but<00:05:47.400> Opie<00:05:47.789> but<00:05:48.090> unless<00:05:48.419> you

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
just annoying but Opie but unless you

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.270 
just annoying but Opie but unless you
put<00:05:48.750> advanced<00:05:48.960> targeting<00:05:49.260> them<00:05:49.590> becomes<00:05:49.889> 0<00:05:50.070> p

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
put advanced targeting them becomes 0 p

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.600 
put advanced targeting them becomes 0 p
