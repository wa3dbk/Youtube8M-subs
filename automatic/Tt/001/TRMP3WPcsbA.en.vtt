00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.070
 hello how about friends and welcome to 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.070
 dimension of change 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.889
 we represent in those three faults if 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.650
 well it's a few more movies 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.330
 controversial from your home to the 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.029
 way in which they were going to develop 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.240
 this reboot changing the origin a little 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.779
 how they got their powers these 45 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.179
 subjects 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.009
 Well, it turned out worse in this movie 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.189
 it was demonstrated that it was that for 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.659
 lose the rights of these characters 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.999
 he said I want to do a reboot of the 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:33.730
 four fantastic and he did it just like that 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.950
 because if I want to make money and do not give 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.230
 account that now he lost more than he 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.510
 he invested evidently foxx does not know what 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.180
 do with the fantastic four and has 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.280
 his eyes only on the x-men 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.780
 so let's go with the review I want to say 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.060
 that I would not have got into his premiere 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.680
 I saw that they start to loose plague after 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.110
 plague after plague this movie and 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.210
 let loose a lot of shit for no reason about 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.160
 of this movie then I said yes 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.380
 really this shit this movie 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.870
 I want to see the movie shit that 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.030
 So much the world is talking is so bad 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.009
 it was so bad that not even spoiler 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.470
 played on this garment and see what 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.770
 degree came to be so bad despite 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.289
 all these bad reviews for 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.060
 and the road tomatoes that definitely 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.140
 it's something that I trust to see 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.359
 a movie 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.509
 Well, I said, I'm going to see her 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:23.460
 my curiosity and badly did it but 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.079
 I want to give my opinion about 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.149
 Many have already seen the review of the top 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.340
 calling de gabi table and andrey nobody 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.689
 which I send a greeting if it is that 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.520
 watch this video and I agree in many 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.640
 things about your opinion of this movie 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.200
 we already know the plot we already know how 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.789
 they got their powers to change a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.890
 little lorik travel to a new 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.780
 dimension where they have these powers and 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.970
 we already know the most 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.459
 stellar reed richards queimada su 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.500
 cane michael jordan is johnny storm and 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.149
 yes and the fact that johnny storm now 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.709
 I was African American 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.329
 stupid if they thought that was the 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.670
 problem a lot before recording with 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.950
 will premiere since they saw that the problem 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.500
 was that game I see like ben grimm and the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.880
 pseudo well I did not have to see as a doctor 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.280
 doom I said what I liked because 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.829
 really the bad is what covers more 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.539
 things generalizing many things the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.760
 special effects 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.040
 in fact the mole is one of the best things 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.780
 in the film they feel light and not 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.450
 because of being a mole you can see that 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.390
 be 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.819
 or that you can not do certain things like 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.530
 the movies past movies that 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.870
 we see that just as they ran they moved a 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.580
 muscle the guy now let's go with what 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.739
 terrible that is what covers a lot the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.620
 movie sequence is terry loses 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.989
 the notion of each scene you lose the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.849
 important moments of the movie if 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.160
 is that there were lost the notion between 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.230
 this and the other there is no 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.690
 concordance in everything they say or 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.239
 they do is just a dialogue here and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.950
 there and let's move on to the following as if 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.799
 what they are talking about was important 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.870
 knowing that sometimes certain things 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.329
 or certain phrases can lead us to a 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.160
 good connection inside the movie 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.680
 everything here in this movie is 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.370
 destined to happen by art of I do not know 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 who also never understand why 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.739
 richard came to panama arrives here arrives 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.049
 you never know how it is like fuck 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.150
 he made the damn suit where he got 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.000
 a house a computer even a 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.950
 car from where that same fact took us 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.459
 generates the fact that there is not a good 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.590
 villain 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.569
 it is assumed that here the villains or the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.819
 bad is the government and dr 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.709
 one of which does not make any in 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.680
 some time you think the government will be 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.409
 the enemy or the oppressive factor in this 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.049
 movie but not also lost in the 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:38.139
 movie with the pseudo villain only 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.650
 he wants to destroy the earth as 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.719
 because he does not have a fixed concept of what 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.700
 what you want to do first being 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.129
 Victor where you do not know why 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.620
 locked in that place and why is it so 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.540
 hermit to a certain extent and why 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.579
 have a boyfriend towards the people and this 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.560
 same hate as it rises and then 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.209
 come back and then you want to go back 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.519
 another and of the dimension and it becomes 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.659
 bipolar the type that wave your explanation 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:07.030
 to be bad is too ambiguous 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.159
 the way in which vÃ­ctor doom kills the 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.579
 dad of the storm is the most of the most 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.530
 ridiculous if you assume that Mr. storm 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.180
 try to help him and try to give him a 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.180
 different approach so that the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.400
 society suddenly no more for their cigars 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.320
 Roman songs and not just the role of 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.660
 Doom painter did not develop well 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.569
 everyone's never exploits a great 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.520
 potential to richards plus stiller 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:32.349
 great actor we already saw him in wedbush and 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.809
 we see and we know that it can give much more 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.099
 of this kind of thing is in fact a 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:38.349
 guy that you leave me super well in 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.860
 past movies we did not see solving 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:43.330
 here doing experimenting creating 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.539
 even then that talking is the head 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.459
 with an equation and here none of that here 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.589
 see you some shots on computers 

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:53.050
 creating this we draw his notebook 

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:55.509
 when I was a child and is already related 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.759
 sister brother among the storm is what 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.020
 more dysfunctional if it was already 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:01.509
 because that is definitely adopted 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.819
 he does not know if they are brothers or they are just 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.189
 known and the one that stands out is 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.990
 ben green is only has the paper 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.209
 of the best friend that appears when the 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.529
 another one needs it if you do not get to understand 

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:13.629
 the fact that because it was or not you 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:15.249
 He asked hear why you want to go or 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:17.709
 if I'm your friend but explain why 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.300
 I do not miss something, it's never bad 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:20.979
 that if something is true and we have seen it 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.689
 in other movies is that the fact 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.879
 that if they are scientists or they like the 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:27.519
 science this is going to unite them to be 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.349
 a stronger or stronger team and it 

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:32.589
 can support in any situation 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.670
 this does not happen even within the movie 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.950
 nor out 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.650
 in interviews the guys feel very 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.480
 distant in every way 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.160
 very very opposite personalities and 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.080
 definitely I think that was the 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.240
 ed an incredible problem is the 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.220
 guys are good actors, just not 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.590
 they could give a good script to each one 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.060
 so that the character that 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.890
 they will take to the big screen 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.320
 picking up a bit of the transitions 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.000
 the events between one place and another the 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.010
 scenes get to lose with the 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.590
 animation that you have to do 1 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.900
 point as I said is good but has those 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.830
 quotes or that but and definitely a 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.870
 factor that many criticize a 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.090
 endless marvel movies or with the 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.070
 marvel stamp is love if the two 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.050
 past movies had a love and 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.670
 This does not have no convincing 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.350
 I definitely feel that humor or 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.420
 it would have been an important factor this 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.490
 movie so that it was not so heavy on 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.830
 this movie never explores a little bit 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.460
 even the relationship that could have 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:33.100
 between ruiz and his it is supposed that years more 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.840
 late ruiz and her get married but here not 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.810
 there is a loving contact or nothing for the 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.150
 style are more than another laugh out there 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.070
 and the powers of Victor never again 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.200
 they exploit is not only bad and is 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.880
 super powerful because the fact that 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.010
 represents the zoom number in the 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.260
 comics and they say it must already be powerful and 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.480
 nothing else and to finish it is outlined the 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.280
 final scene in the fight equal and you can 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.080
 believe that the fight can save in the 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.500
 movie and to stay with a good taste 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.930
 of mouth at the end but I do not know if it was one 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.910
 that another blow smashed around the mole 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.120
 ends up saving the day with your phrase is 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.310
 time to fight and one left doctor doom 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.260
 what happened, I think a muscle is more 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.210
 I work because the zumba bastard buzzes 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.220
 all night and no matter how much you do for 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.870
 here there never kill until 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.090
 you are bay with the director georges 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.400
 train recently said he had a 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.100
 very different view of this movie 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.810
 but we will never see it and I think 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.150
 which is very true I think we will not arrive 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.770
 to see a good reboot of this movie 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.630
 I definitely think we would stay 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.729
 with the 2005 film of the four 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.530
 fantastic I think foxx should think 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:37.660
 better to return the rights 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.979
 cinematographic to marvel but this 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.919
 situation for more see is difficult 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:43.689
 because fox is like that next girlfriend that 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:45.879
 no matter how hard you insist 

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:47.589

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:49.899
 my opinion of the movie salmini me 

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:52.209
 satisfied of the room do not buy anything 

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:54.069
 because obviously I saw so many things that 

00:07:52.209 --> 00:07:56.379
 I said it's really worth buying 

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:57.939
