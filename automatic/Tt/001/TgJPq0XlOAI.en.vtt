00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hey guys in this video I wanna show you

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.309 
hey guys in this video I wanna show you
really<00:00:02.490> cool<00:00:02.700> reference<00:00:03.090> ink<00:00:03.360> it's<00:00:04.080> really

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
really cool reference ink it's really

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.499 
really cool reference ink it's really
good<00:00:04.440> breath<00:00:04.620> because<00:00:05.279> it<00:00:06.210> uses<00:00:06.359> different

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
good breath because it uses different

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.570 
good breath because it uses different
lots<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:06.930> different<00:00:07.200> techniques<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.429> uses

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
lots of different techniques and it uses

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.820 
lots of different techniques and it uses
most<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.150> notes<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.510> blue<00:00:09.690> scale<00:00:09.929> so

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
most of the notes of the blue scale so

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.440 
most of the notes of the blue scale so
it<00:00:11.190> does<00:00:11.309> not<00:00:11.429> incorporates<00:00:12.000> all<00:00:12.120> things

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
it does not incorporates all things

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.270 
it does not incorporates all things
which<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.139> hopefully<00:00:13.469> learn<00:00:13.830> from<00:00:14.070> my<00:00:14.219> other

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
which you hopefully learn from my other

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.730 
which you hopefully learn from my other
videos<00:00:14.809> as<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.870> saw<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.109> myth<00:00:16.260> goes<00:00:18.740> as

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
videos as you saw the myth goes as

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.540 
videos as you saw the myth goes as
simple<00:00:20.010> as<00:00:20.070> that

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
simple as that

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.189 
simple as that
finally<00:00:21.210> we're<00:00:21.330> doing<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.660> different

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
finally we're doing in different

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.259 
finally we're doing in different
positions<00:00:22.820> positions

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
positions positions

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.460 
positions positions
I<00:00:24.390> say<00:00:25.199> positions<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.680> mean<00:00:27.140> still<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.289> same

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
I say positions I mean still in the same

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.470 
I say positions I mean still in the same
key<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.340> different<00:00:29.640> position<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
key but in different position so it

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.319 
key but in different position so it
moves<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:31.050> when<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.800> 12<00:00:32.460> bar<00:00:32.700> blues<00:00:32.730> sequence

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
moves up when the 12 bar blues sequence

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.889 
moves up when the 12 bar blues sequence
goes<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> next<00:00:34.020> chord<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.670> C<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
goes to the next chord so in C go that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.600 
goes to the next chord so in C go that
this

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.910 

to<00:00:41.610> play<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.150> play<00:00:42.380> see<00:00:45.620> before<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.650> start

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
to play this you play see before I start

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.590 
to play this you play see before I start
it's<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.400> really<00:00:47.880> important<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.330> have<00:00:48.450> this

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it's just really important to have this

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.570 
it's just really important to have this
composition<00:00:48.960> I've<00:00:49.320> got<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> moment<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
composition I've got the moment it's a

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.720 
composition I've got the moment it's a
some<00:00:51.420> middle<00:00:51.870> finger<00:00:52.170> from<00:00:52.410> fifth<00:00:52.710> finger<00:00:53.040> if

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
some middle finger from fifth finger if

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.250 
some middle finger from fifth finger if
you<00:00:53.880> can<00:00:54.060> keep<00:00:54.240> that<00:00:54.420> spread<00:00:54.690> out<00:00:54.810> throughout

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
you can keep that spread out throughout

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.540 
you can keep that spread out throughout
the<00:00:55.320> operative<00:00:55.770> it'll<00:00:56.040> help<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.310> play<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the operative it'll help you play the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.470 
the operative it'll help you play the
riff<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.970> lot<00:00:57.180> easier<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.600> smoother<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> okay

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.060 

and<00:01:05.060> then<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.390> second<00:01:06.720> part<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.020> me<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.770> crush

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and then the second part is me you crush

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.110 
and then the second part is me you crush
the<00:01:08.280> F<00:01:08.460> sharp<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.090> G<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> sea

you fancy and there's a thing I'm doing

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.850 
you fancy and there's a thing I'm doing
here<00:01:22.850> it's<00:01:23.060> kind<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.450> rolling<00:01:24.350> down<00:01:24.530> notes

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
here it's kind of a rolling down notes

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.770 
here it's kind of a rolling down notes
it's<00:01:25.160> a<00:01:25.220> booth<00:01:25.370> movie<00:01:25.700> technique<00:01:25.910> I'm<00:01:26.570> doing

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
it's a booth movie technique I'm doing

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.630 
it's a booth movie technique I'm doing
the<00:01:26.870> wrong<00:01:27.050> down<00:01:27.290> AGA

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.300 

look<00:01:42.710> at<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.860> riff<00:01:43.010> it<00:01:43.280> just<00:01:43.430> goes<00:01:43.610> down<00:01:45.310> now

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
look at the riff it just goes down now

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.140 
look at the riff it just goes down now
it's<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.580> seat<00:01:46.790> since<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.690> same<00:01:47.930> guitar

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
it's the seat since the same guitar

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.840 
it's the seat since the same guitar
Gianna<00:01:50.150> F<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.690> E<00:01:50.840> flat<00:01:51.020> going<00:01:51.440> downwards

that's<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.510> C<00:01:56.660> position<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.380> in<00:01:57.530> in<00:01:57.980> F<00:01:58.160> would

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
that's the C position so in in F would

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.410 
that's the C position so in in F would
go<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.000> this<00:02:00.910> that's<00:02:01.910> a<00:02:02.030> different<00:02:02.300> different

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
go to this that's a different different

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.070 
go to this that's a different different
technique<00:02:03.460> basically<00:02:04.460> mostly<00:02:05.270> because<00:02:05.450> the

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
technique basically mostly because the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.320 
technique basically mostly because the
the<00:02:07.040> F<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.370> dodgy<00:02:07.730> position<00:02:08.090> because

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
the F to the dodgy position because

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.030 
the F to the dodgy position because
they're<00:02:08.600> flattened<00:02:09.590> v<00:02:09.860> be<00:02:10.640> natural

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
they're flattened v be natural

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.880 
they're flattened v be natural
so<00:02:13.040> hospital<00:02:13.960> it's<00:02:14.960> hard<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.290> kind<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.500> roll

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
so hospital it's hard to kind of roll

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.120 
so hospital it's hard to kind of roll
off<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.760> crush<00:02:17.000> it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
off that and crush it

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.470 
off that and crush it
now<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.280> one's<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.490> major<00:02:19.700> if<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.060> ends<00:02:20.300> on<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
now this one's a major if it ends on the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.760 
now this one's a major if it ends on the
major<00:02:21.050> stuff<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:24.230> basically<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.620> same

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
major stuff so it's basically the same

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.820 
major stuff so it's basically the same
position<00:02:25.190> as<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.670> same<00:02:26.170> before<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.590> keep

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
position as the same before so you keep

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.050 
position as the same before so you keep
that<00:02:27.980> position<00:02:28.100> yet<00:02:33.250> again<00:02:34.250> I'm<00:02:34.370> doing<00:02:34.940> that

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
that position yet again I'm doing that

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.310 
that position yet again I'm doing that
kind<00:02:35.240> of<00:02:35.270> roll<00:02:35.450> technique<00:02:35.690> on<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.140> scene

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
kind of roll technique on the scene

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:51.660 
kind of roll technique on the scene
today<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.770> little<00:02:46.010> better<00:02:46.160> faster

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.590 

that's<00:02:52.670> basically<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:52.970> riffin<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.480> know

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
that's basically the riffin you know

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.100 
that's basically the riffin you know
people<00:02:53.960> just<00:02:53.990> gonna<00:02:54.230> experiment<00:02:54.650> run<00:02:54.890> those

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
and you kind of figure out a cool riff

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.470 
and you kind of figure out a cool riff
to<00:03:02.750> go<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:05.090> know<00:03:06.160> same<00:03:07.160> style<00:03:07.460> file<00:03:08.300> which

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
to go you know same style file which

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
to go you know same style file which
ends<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.840> verse<00:03:09.140> you<00:03:09.410> do<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.680> with<00:03:09.800> a<00:03:09.860> eg<00:03:11.500> this

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
ends the verse you do it with a eg this

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.820 
ends the verse you do it with a eg this
is<00:03:12.590> exactly<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.980> same<00:03:13.100> as<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.310> C<00:03:13.460> position

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
is exactly the same as the C position

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:30.699 
is exactly the same as the C position
that's<00:03:15.830> just<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.130> G<00:03:17.170> again<00:03:18.170> you're<00:03:21.670> in<00:03:22.670> C<00:03:29.709> it's

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
that's just in G again you're in C it's

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.880 
that's just in G again you're in C it's
just<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:30.950> definitely<00:03:31.250> seems<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:33.680> can

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
just it definitely seems that you can

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.580 
just it definitely seems that you can
kind<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.400> bear<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:35.000> if<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.570> want<00:03:35.750> sue

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
okay I'll show you an example of how

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.410 
okay I'll show you an example of how
when<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.910> can<00:03:57.060> use<00:03:57.239> this<00:03:57.420> riff<00:03:58.250> Maleng<00:03:59.250> a

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
when you can use this riff Maleng a

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.640 
when you can use this riff Maleng a
stop-start<00:04:00.680> technique<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.280> what<00:04:02.459> why<00:04:02.640> do<00:04:02.700> I

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
stop-start technique so what why do I

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.110 
stop-start technique so what why do I
stop<00:04:04.650> there<00:04:04.860> let<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.640> right<00:04:05.790> hand<00:04:05.970> do<00:04:06.440> playing

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
stop there let the right hand do playing

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.390 
stop there let the right hand do playing
example<00:04:11.750> I'm<00:04:12.750> doing<00:04:13.080> there<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.530> I'm<00:04:13.860> teaching

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
example I'm doing there is I'm teaching

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.509 
example I'm doing there is I'm teaching
it<00:04:14.519> simply<00:04:15.120> an<00:04:15.209> octave<00:04:15.480> higher

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519

basically<00:04:43.810> what<00:04:44.080> I've<00:04:44.230> just<00:04:44.260> done<00:04:44.590> there<00:04:44.830> it's

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
basically what I've just done there it's

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.710 
basically what I've just done there it's
just<00:04:45.540> really<00:04:46.540> simple<00:04:46.720> just<00:04:48.450> imitating<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.540> an

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
just really simple just imitating it an

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.580 
just really simple just imitating it an
octave<00:04:49.990> apart<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.710> left<00:04:50.890> I'm<00:04:51.040> just<00:04:51.340> going<00:04:51.880> up

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
octave apart the left I'm just going up

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.920 
octave apart the left I'm just going up
semitone<00:04:53.590> from<00:04:54.070> below<00:04:54.310> or<00:04:54.730> above<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:55.870> that

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
semitone from below or above and that

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.400 
semitone from below or above and that
won't<00:04:56.200> give<00:04:56.410> me<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:57.480> baseline<00:04:58.480> position<00:04:58.930> so

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
won't give me the baseline position so

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:27.630 
won't give me the baseline position so
you<00:04:59.470> see<00:04:59.860> let's<00:05:00.040> see<00:05:25.290> how<00:05:26.290> to<00:05:26.350> use<00:05:26.440> it<00:05:26.650> I<00:05:26.950> hope

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
you see let's see how to use it I hope

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.360 
you see let's see how to use it I hope
this<00:05:27.760> video<00:05:27.910> helps
