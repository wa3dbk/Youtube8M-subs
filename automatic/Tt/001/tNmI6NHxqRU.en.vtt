 A little, this is the category I'm going to 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.540
 Talk to you, I'll be honest. 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.600
 I did a little trick in the edition I put 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.030
 high saturation her to stay one're fade 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.549
 Connected verdade bonito the verdão fusca 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.950
 so I did the put a lot of saturation 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.390
 to stay and get green cool because 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.629
 when I saw this kanú on day 2 30 cm 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.790
 I looked and said goodbye how delicious 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.349
 what a wonderful thing, what a wonderful thing 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.599
 did not come to test then we saw 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.030
 it kind of on the menu only and at the time the 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.019
 people of ladakh and release spoke 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.900
 my God 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.069
 the guys talking that was reiser 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.709
 the conspiracy begins 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.629
 Oh, and I said, my god, what a beautiful thing. 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.909
 that of him looking at her sideways in the 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.400
 boy and he strong verbiage 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.560
 I said it will be very crazy and when 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.889
 She came to be very sincere I found 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.319
 a little bit out, I was 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.060
 expecting truth even then who 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.099
 more if the eyes and such 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.689
 In the video now you guys are going to have I go 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.389
 do the following right now 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:51.189
 here from the video I'm going to cut the part 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.150
 You are now seeing her without the 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.359
 saturation 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.030
 You may notice that she is dead in the 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:01.359
 her is one is the green one a well well 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.010
 Calm down, you know then it's for more. 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.980
 I do not like things that much I like 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.329
 flashy maybe a green well strong 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.459
 It would be cool to serve then Amy was not 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.859
 was disappointment is too great to speak of 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.840
 a disappointment as it liked but in his view 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.299
 cool little dinho much more 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.030
 Then I think that if it were 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.280
 a verdict but even a verdade 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.530
 of that reserve theme would be 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.989
 ben stein and finally it does not give 47 not 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.209
 You need to talk a lot. 76 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.720
 You know a lot of people question is not 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:42.220
 anyone your favorite weapon of mine 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:46.150
 has been the favorite since 47 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.239
 cisa in the acronym wood in 47a and a year one 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.590
 detail one stop that I noticed is 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:56.260
 Maybe this one reminded me a lot. 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.180
 celtics uniform which is a team of 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.829
 basketball the celtics basketball team 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.889
 probably kaka if I have one 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.750
 now it's pardon forgiveness of 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.829
 It's true, but I have freshness. 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.939
 my mind celtics is a team of 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.150
 basketball I will not search the internet 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.459
 now if not i will not be well celtic 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.699
 just google and yes it 's a team of 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.380
 nbc basketball lnb right then remember 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.090
 much that their symbol is a clover of 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.859
 four leaves so I guess if 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.710
 do you have someone from crossfire who 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.450
 It made your process very happy, right? 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.139
 It's a little something I wanted to comment on. 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.659
 with you 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.120
 already leaving the people talking about this 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:33.789
 47 does not really have much to say 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.080
 I spoke a bit of dst's it a 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.740
 little thing I wanted to talk to 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.080
 you recently have make me 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.629
 introduced amy introduced portuguese 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.699
 coming is never in the competitive landscape 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:47.379
 know how to find a cool team 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.659
 friends, the guys who stay a lot 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:51.849
 committed and now that I have a 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:53.770
 Time, I think it was missing. 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.340
 a team a cool team use to train 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.020
 such 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.210
 We're in the spotlight, they 're training there. 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.099
 are organizing some things yet is 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.930
 doing well the rapport know 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.539
 so yes the guys who have asked 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.620
 very never entered competitive is do not know 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.900
 if there is too it this population 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.729
 Competitive vineyard player 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.080
 I think there is not much and sack 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.580
 I started playing like this with the guys 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.439
 I started to train with the guys in focus 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.419
 well happy I'm learning a lot 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:21.430
 the galileo danielle years has a lot to 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.740
 to teach the well experienced crew then 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.259
 I'm learning a lot and that too. 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.659
 which resulted a lot in mine. 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.750
 you search and not in crisis here in my 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.310
 namibia notion game bag it 's me 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.259
 trained enough and I have played a lot 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.750
 I remember crossfire at the end of the year 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:40.150
 now I had abandoned crossfire to 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.599
 play cs goal and i think get into a 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:46.270
 time was a stop that gave me the ew 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.949
 commenting on talking to eliza, eh? 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.649
 I said man, those are bizarre like 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.180
 crossfire is cool know crossfire tatá 

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:54.610
 fun for me I 'm having fun with 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.159
 willingness to play a cruise on that level 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.899
 to get in college to study and stay 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.460
 with that face in my head that I 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:02.649
 I think I will not study but I will not 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.930
 get an integrated fc on this level tô 

00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:06.639
 enjoying a lot of game and stay here one more 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.520
 Tip for you maybe if you have 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.199
 very pulled with the game long time 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.419
 including you a mirror of this is that 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.250
 you saw in the channel there is the will that 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.649
 I have to produce it at the risk 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.629
 releasing three videos per bag day will 

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:23.949
 to depend on you is dedicated to km 6 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:26.259
 logical then if you have half broached 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:29.259
 The game that is the tip for you to try 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:31.719
 a new mode I do not just say sef 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:32.529
 of five, and with certain 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.899
 rules 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:36.339
 try to know there is a lot a team or 

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:38.150
 example is calm 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:40.010
 An example of a time 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.740
 whatever ghost has to play more 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.200
 ghost vote is a beast example but 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.310
 try to change maybe to a process and only in 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.140
 June for you 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.910
 if you keep judging the same molds 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.980
 of the same maps that I think 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.780
 You any game I think if you 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.210
 for example playing fifa with the 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.590
 Barcelona I think you will have a 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.720
 time that will make you sick if you stay 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.120
 playing this only goal in the west 2 will have 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.100
 An hour you're going to fly so I guess. 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.750
 that 's it was a way that what I 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.800
 I found ddma real resuscitate in the game is 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.300
 working well 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.680
 I really want to get closer and 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.180
 want to produce a lot of video 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.490
 will make stream will be 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.130
 near you and that's it I think I 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:21.710
 I'm living a nice part of the channel. 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:24.290
 There's this fucking thing, my god, that's it. 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.030

 this video catar 1,500 life already 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.790
 then another is released into the mouth 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.310
 no matter what time it can be used tomorrow 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.860
 it's a lie, you can not 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.600
 but this is no longer play joninha joinha 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.070
 Favorites writes the channel 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.870
