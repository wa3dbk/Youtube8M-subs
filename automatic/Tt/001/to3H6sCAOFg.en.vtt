00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.500
 welcome in this video we are going to 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:11.750
 present the school's virtual campus 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.750
 to register do it in 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.540
 www.collectivebrands.com score bar 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.720
 field after entering your username and 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.869
 password and click on entry 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.180
 both the user and the password do not 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.480
 they have in their headquarters description 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.750
 well here we are on the page 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.970
 of students start we will find 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.820
 four main panels with different 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.340
 information in one we will have access 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.450
 to different tools then we will have 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:51.040
 a calendar with the featured events 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.600
 a panel with the main announcements in 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.050
 the forums in which we are 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.440
 strict 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.170
 Y 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.390
 a panel that allows us to access the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.180
 received messages 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.180
 click on my courses from the to 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.980
 tools that we quickly access 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.850
 to the bacteria in which we 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.920
 we find enrolled in this case 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.440
 accounting biology and civic education 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.220
 and we will always have access to the module 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.180
 of coordination that allows us to do 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.180
 consult the administrative type 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.330
 let's go to the civic education module 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.250
 we click and access the portal of the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.670
 drums 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.110
 let's see reality or higher 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.330
 left that we have here is 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.460
 information of the subject to the forum 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.270
 to a diary that allows us to carry 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.780
 notes 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.750
 for Soraya on the progress of the study 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.900
 below we have option we have access 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.250
 to the contents of this subject in this 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.670
 case we have 5 units and an evaluation 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.100
 let's click on unit 1 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.470
 and here we quickly have access to 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.660
 study material in this window to 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.420
 left side we see the obvious hard 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.550
 of the bacteria which we can read 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.410
 We can print or download according 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.730
 for our needs our 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.470
 pleasures 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.420
 on the right side we have 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.110
 the possibility of navigating between 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.110
 different units 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.840
 in the unit of matter here we see the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.750
 second unit so we can go from 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.090
 one or another unit to download or 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.060
 print in accordance 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.880
 square our needs 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.310
 we have here below access to a 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.420
 evaluation let's say about it 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.730
 in this case it is an evaluation 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.920
 of automatic correction us 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.459
 we must complete this evaluation 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.440
 we click on send the test and 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.380
 automatically we will receive the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.590
 result of it with 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.980
 the rating and the answers 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.170
 correct wrong we have obtained 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.810
 this helps us prepare face 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.730
 to the final exam 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.500
 we have the possibility to repeat this 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.330
 evaluation on different occasions 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.640
 it will also depend battery will learn 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.190
 several of these form evaluations 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.030
 periodically to be well prepared 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.730
 tribal exam 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.550
 well we click again the link a 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.640
 simple that we will see that another 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.550
 information we have available here in 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.440
 the portal of the matter well we have the 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.310
 calendar again with events 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.920
 we will have announcements 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.910
 links to other materials a very link 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.180
 important is here 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.190
 22 main this allows us to contact us 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.290
 with the subject teacher and send him 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.840
 queries 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.609
 because it will bring together the text we want 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.890
 send we have the possibility to accept 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.640
 Some kind 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.010
 of file being that you have to send is 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.650
 it is automatically received by the teacher 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.989
 assigned 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.720
 below we have the possibility of 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.720
 download the material from it 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.200
 we go 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.699
 and save the unit this unit is the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.960
 same that we have had access in the 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.610
 tree that is in the part 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.819
 left 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.000
 ok let's go back to the page 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.000
 principal 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.460
 here we see in biology how it repeats 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.130
 basically in new structures 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.740
 left information of the bacterium by 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.080
 the newspaper below the tree 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.970
 contents or affinity by the side 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.990
 right it repeats basically the same 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:11.540
 in this case we have access to a video 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.540
 from a platform to a link 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.300
 that you were not external in this case we 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.480
 View an article about the system 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.480
 respiratory 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.140
 we also have the units for 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.220
 download and in this case we have another 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:29.260
 extra file that is a good sheet well 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.210
 in each of the batteries of the 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.650
 which we are ingest we will obtain in 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.129
 portal to access all the content 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:39.110
 and being able to contact teachers 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.319
 We can also contact us from the 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.420
 link that we have in the upper part 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:49.690
 right we unfold a menu seems 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.630
 incoming messages that basically is the 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.100
 tray which 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.100
 all messages received 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:04.009
 to effect from below we have 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.919
 different commands but 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:09.060
 this one that allows us to respond to the text 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.180
 sent 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.249
 we just came here to complete 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:18.309
 the answer and send detect 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:20.220
 if we go back to messages and we can 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:23.820
 create 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.950
 we have the same template basically 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.390
 but in this case blank 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.420
 addressee 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.070
 we should complete the name of the 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.550
 person we want to have the 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.460
 message if we start writing 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:41.660
 automatically the system will give us 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.660
 different alternatives 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.200
 with that name 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:50.169
 this is one way to communicate the other 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.389
 is directly by clicking 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:56.630
 on the blue track that appears next 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:59.760
 of the recipient field here below 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.520
 selecting to communicate with professor 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.759
 in the module 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.590
 we unfold the list and we'll see that 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.630
 we are willing to communicate with 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.430
 the teachers 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.260
 of the batteries in which we are 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.270
 enrolled we also always have the 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.180
 world of computing for consultations 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.160
 administrative and to the new below 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:23.009
 As always, it is important to clarify that 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:25.979
 position rebound a file 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:29.689
 ok going back to the main page 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:31.729
 from the corresponding 

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:35.149
 we are finally in this first 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:37.129
 video tutorial to see how 

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:40.659
 we do to disconnect this what 

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:43.169
 we do from the top right 

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:45.960
 we click 

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:48.539
 over the link and we disconnect from the 

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.449
 platform we hope this video will 

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:55.520
 has been very useful and we 

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:55.520
 we say goodbye until point
