00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
generator using one command and this

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.960 
generator using one command and this
thing<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.780> so<00:00:22.110> much<00:00:22.140> fun<00:00:22.710> guys<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.370> let's<00:00:23.700> go

thing is so much fun guys so let's go

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.040 
thing is so much fun guys so let's go
ahead<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.300> started<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.780> first<00:00:24.810> thing

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
ahead and get started the first thing

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.810 
ahead and get started the first thing
that<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:25.320> need<00:00:25.440> to<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.770> to<00:00:26.100> generate<00:00:26.610> this

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that we need to do to generate this

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.090 
that we need to do to generate this
dungeon<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.450> to<00:00:28.050> give<00:00:28.230> ourself<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.710> command

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
dungeon is to give ourself a command

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.650 
dungeon is to give ourself a command
block<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.520> there's<00:00:29.700> a<00:00:29.760> lot<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.000> commands<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.570> I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
block so there's a lot of commands but I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.740 
block so there's a lot of commands but I
find<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.020> easiest<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.680> is<00:00:32.009> give<00:00:32.750> your

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
find the easiest one is give your

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.720 
find the easiest one is give your
in-game<00:00:34.110> name<00:00:34.170> command<00:00:34.860> underscore<00:00:35.399> blocked

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
in-game name command underscore blocked

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.279 
in-game name command underscore blocked
and<00:00:36.059> that'll<00:00:36.539> give<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> command<00:00:37.110> block

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
and that'll give you a command block

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.920 
and that'll give you a command block
give<00:00:38.219> yourself<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> way<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> power<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.600> command

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
give yourself a way to power the command

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.230 
give yourself a way to power the command
block<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.410> then<00:00:40.680> simply<00:00:41.220> just<00:00:41.520> paste<00:00:41.940> your

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
block and then simply just paste your

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.950 
block and then simply just paste your
code<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.579> power<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.810> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
code and power that and it's going to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.740 
code and power that and it's going to
make<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.890> dungeon<00:00:47.370> generator<00:00:47.880> that<00:00:48.540> will

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
make the dungeon generator that will

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.370

what<00:01:19.290> exactly<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.890> does<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.250> we've<00:01:20.370> got<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
what exactly this does so we've got to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
what exactly this does so we've got to
go<00:01:20.729> pretty<00:01:20.940> far<00:01:21.270> away<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.830> together

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
go pretty far away here and together

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.170 
go pretty far away here and together
there's<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.340> Plains<00:01:23.610> over<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.060> will

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
there's a Plains over here this will

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.219 
there's a Plains over here this will
work<00:01:24.299> perfect<00:01:24.780> awesome

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
work perfect awesome

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.990 
work perfect awesome
alright<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.710> let's<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.190> at<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> plains

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
alright so let's do this at the plains

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.840 
alright so let's do this at the plains
we'll<00:01:27.780> put<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.200> probably<00:01:29.159> right<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.729> it's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
we'll put it probably right here so it's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.450 
we'll put it probably right here so it's
gonna<00:01:30.030> lag<00:01:30.330> for<00:01:30.690> just<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.020> second<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.100> put<00:01:32.310> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
gonna lag for just a second so put that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.020 
gonna lag for just a second so put that
down<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.510> to<00:01:33.720> build<00:01:34.350> its<00:01:34.680> its<00:01:35.220> doh<00:01:35.790> god

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
down it's going to build its its doh god

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.390 
down it's going to build its its doh god
it's<00:01:36.479> moving<00:01:36.600> me<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:36.930> around<00:01:39.409> okay<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.159> is

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
it's moving me all around okay so it is

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.140 
it's moving me all around okay so it is
essentially<00:01:42.030> built<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.900> dungeon<00:01:43.619> right<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
essentially built this dungeon right and

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.330 
essentially built this dungeon right and
what<00:01:45.150> we<00:01:45.299> have<00:01:45.510> here<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.380> an<00:01:46.890> entrance

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
what we have here is we have an entrance

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.980 
what we have here is we have an entrance
to<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.729> dungeon<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:50.840> what<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.990> world<00:01:52.080> I

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
to a dungeon and what in the world I

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.050 
to a dungeon and what in the world I
don't<00:01:54.990> know<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.350> doing<00:01:55.640> ok<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> think

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
don't know what it's doing ok I think

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.899 
don't know what it's doing ok I think
what<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.360> doing<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.990> creating<00:01:58.049> levels

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
what it's doing is it's creating levels

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.249 
what it's doing is it's creating levels
ok<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.479> think<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.750> was<00:02:00.900> actually

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.020 
ok so I think I think it was actually
still<00:02:01.680> creating<00:02:02.220> levels<00:02:02.400> but<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:02.909> it's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
still creating levels but I think it's

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.359

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
all the way over here maybe even goes

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.709 
all the way over here maybe even goes
even<00:02:35.530> further<00:02:35.769> than<00:02:36.069> what<00:02:36.250> we<00:02:36.400> see<00:02:36.719> starts

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
even further than what we see starts

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
right here

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.819 
right here
and<00:02:39.549> then<00:02:40.650> goes<00:02:41.650> all<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.389> way<00:02:43.389> back<00:02:44.049> over<00:02:44.349> to
