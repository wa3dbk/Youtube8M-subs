00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you know if jon jon was at the k1 and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.310 
you know if jon jon was at the k1 and
tried<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.760> fight<00:01:02.969> over<00:01:03.180> him<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.899> then<00:01:04.049> get<00:01:04.229> his

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
tried to fight over him and then get his

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.370 
tried to fight over him and then get his
ass<00:01:04.500> kicked<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.900> you<00:01:06.900> got<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.140> ask<00:01:07.229> yourself

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
ass kicked so you got to ask yourself

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.370 
ass kicked so you got to ask yourself
what<00:01:08.040> would<00:01:08.070> happen<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.610> fight<00:01:08.930> well<00:01:09.930> Jon

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
what would happen in this fight well Jon

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.600 
what would happen in this fight well Jon
Jones<00:01:10.650> would<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.979> looking<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> takedown

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
Jones would be looking for the takedown

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.810 
Jones would be looking for the takedown
for<00:01:12.570> sure<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.140> ovary<00:01:13.979> would<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.790> I

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
for sure and ovary would know it so I

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.740 
for sure and ovary would know it so I
think<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:16.110> would<00:01:16.290> make<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.390> his<00:01:18.570> game

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
think it would make you know his game

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.630 
think it would make you know his game
playing<00:01:19.049> pretty<00:01:19.229> obvious<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.650> over<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.280> think

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
playing pretty obvious to over I think

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.679 
playing pretty obvious to over I think
over<00:01:20.820> him<00:01:20.939> would<00:01:21.090> note<00:01:21.270> was<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.400> I

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
over him would note was going on and I

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.149 
over him would note was going on and I
just<00:01:24.689> don't<00:01:24.900> see<00:01:25.080> him<00:01:25.170> taking<00:01:25.409> down<00:01:25.680> Alistair

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
just don't see him taking down Alistair

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.719 
just don't see him taking down Alistair
Overeem<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.420> guys<00:01:27.630> too<00:01:27.900> big<00:01:28.159> if<00:01:29.159> he<00:01:29.310> went<00:01:29.460> foot

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
Overeem the guys too big if he went foot

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670 
Overeem the guys too big if he went foot
to<00:01:29.970> take<00:01:30.150> down<00:01:30.299> position<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:31.049> think<00:01:31.259> Overeem

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
to take down position I think Overeem

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.289 
to take down position I think Overeem
could<00:01:31.979> probably<00:01:32.250> pull<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> guillotine<00:01:33.090> or

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
could probably pull a guillotine or

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
could probably pull a guillotine or
something<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.960> really<00:01:34.680> crank<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.340> his<00:01:35.490> neck<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
something I really crank on his neck and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.899 
something I really crank on his neck and
I<00:01:36.869> also<00:01:37.170> think<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.500> Overeem<00:01:37.979> would<00:01:38.220> find<00:01:38.790> his

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I also think that Overeem would find his

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.240 
I also think that Overeem would find his
way<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.210> against<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> cage<00:01:39.869> or<00:01:40.799> he'd<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.130> able

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
way up against the cage or he'd be able

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.050 
way up against the cage or he'd be able
to<00:01:41.610> turn<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.540> around<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.320> top<00:01:44.060> Jon

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
to turn it around and get on top Jon

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.149 
to turn it around and get on top Jon
Jones<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.659> weaker<00:01:46.439> than<00:01:46.740> Alistair

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
Jones is just weaker than Alistair

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.260 
Jones is just weaker than Alistair
Overeem<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:48.600> also<00:01:49.020> helps<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> overran<00:01:49.649> shrinks

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
Overeem it also helps to overran shrinks

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.520 
Overeem it also helps to overran shrinks
following<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> state<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> allegations<00:01:52.290> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
following the state of allegations I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.560 
following the state of allegations I
don't<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.130> any<00:01:53.250> way<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.729> Jon<00:01:53.970> Jones<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.420> win

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
don't see any way for Jon Jones to win

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.810 
don't see any way for Jon Jones to win
you<00:01:55.229> know<00:01:55.350> over<00:01:56.250> him<00:01:56.340> would<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.640> shrink

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you know over him would have to shrink

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.709 
you know over him would have to shrink
back<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.329> his<00:01:57.479> old<00:01:57.979> Friday's<00:01:59.270> if<00:02:00.270> those<00:02:00.509> two
