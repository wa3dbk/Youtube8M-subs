00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 O 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.670
 page what is my name from 6 eva and 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.690
 I work probably feared the 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.150
 collective black ops 2 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.650
 what is between league play on the map 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.970
 slums it is capture the flag we 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.289
 want to play though up there 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.970
 I become like this explanatory is 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.660
 today's gameplay comments topic 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.210
 content thing and so exactly what a day in 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.110
 the bank but again directly with two 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.689
 other topics 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.969
 So pay attention if someday 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.530
 for you in niger zdf better heeded 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.899
 please on the gameplay of the contrary 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.059
 Again, yes I know when I say 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.949
 that I played well I did 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.749
 really good for me the round me 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:50.239
 really broke some good actions 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:51.620
 that's why I'm in front of everything because then 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.449
 Afterwards in third team something else 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.390
 happy but start first topic 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.280
 and we talk about the mappack and 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.409
 Context as accurate why is it called 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.789
 actually the first stint the topic 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.430
 call of duty mappack it's a new one 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.820
 map map map pack announced again 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.760
 been 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.430
 means to leave named names uprising 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.350
 it is I do not know what is it 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.080
 so a small child at home 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.370
 understands what will probably be in the new map 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.730
 pack trainer in maybe 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.400
 maybe new children maybe weapons 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.410
 maybe again has the same as 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.120
 always four multiplayer maps and one 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.350
 zombie map to the zombie maps can not 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.770
 say because I just do not say 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.270
 play 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.950
 but it looks very cool is the trailer 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.780
 Incidentally, the trailer is for you in the 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.210
 linked video description is the 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.950
 left open and then you have four again 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.600
 multiplayer maps it is anyway that 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.280
 same as always who many public 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.470
 plays in the delicious 2 and fun 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.940
 because she can buy it well worth it 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.170
 As always, if you look more closely 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.650
 think about a singleplayer game 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.980
 Full price to pay 50 to 60 euros 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.370
 50 euro for that you then five hours 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.110
 sometimes even just in game time have in 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.370
 the story and it just is not worth it 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.840
 you think about it because I buy myself 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.910
 the mappack for 15 euros 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.410
 by the way, it costs again and has 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.670
 maybe ten hours off fun 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.140
 In the end, definitely comes in any case 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.010
 cheaper is only my personal 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.979
 opinion on it 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.060
 if you are not a blackout safe fanatic 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.319
 and for the shooting times brown still 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.180
 Do not buy if you only play games 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.069
 as well as plays and otherwise 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.290
 just kind of games or you are or 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.969
 csl or something synonymous have this buy 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.040
 So without you is prohibited there 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.659
 So as I said when you have fun on 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.879
 Black ops plays a game then buys 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.980
 otherwise you really buy 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.200
 second theme second theme call of duty 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.609
 xp did you hear the photo I know it 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.349
 maybe not so maybe 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.200
 incidentally two years ago or so gave 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.120
 should be bold call of duty, in the event 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.590
 it's about the million dollars and one 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.189
 fat call of duty championship 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.680
 Circular trophy against there were too weapons to 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.840
 ak-47 or in the 16th 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.950
 so what you dream to a cup 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.629
 Maybe there may be something 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.849
 noticed is that the gaming time 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.889
 won and this event is now 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.319
 starts again over the whole 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.639
 weekend we also live the 2 I will 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.409
 then the two sides where that 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.609
 probably will be at my like that 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.319
 description link your opinion 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.269
 that call of duty elite from this 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.870
 official strong side there is one 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.849
 own board department area 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.989
 page layout where now stop the left 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.669
 or embedded is the livestream of 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.359
 from carl zeiss the line i believe 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:22.190
 is currently coming from emily so twitter 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.840
 could pack loudly again 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.540
 sometimes comment makes a relative 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.030
 I can do it well and when 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.530
 unfortunately pay if the video online 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.819
 start instrument but I will 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.639
 In any case, tweet at the show yet 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.019
 if you are interested then you can 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.340
 you follow on twitter 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.870
 because I will do that I do so many 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.340
 but that was the direction as well 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.629
 I do not know that a bit 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.389
 lately much more left on 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:48.799
 twitter the americans in mallorca 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.419
 to give it away from the ski 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.299
 So it's about one again 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.669
 million us dollars and the title and glory 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.859
 for call of duty champion in black ops 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.090
 three , in the end, found it really cool 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.840
 we must do them the thing or in the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.519
 direction is a bit too 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.419
 I know some cases 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.280
 watch and as I said if you 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.989
 then you should have a look 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.099
 in the two left in the video look 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.870
 on the performance are already online 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.430
 otherwise fall on twitter there 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.610
 you sure as well on then the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.830
 stream goes online 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.420
 but should come to the actual 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.500
 the theme of Verdi is back 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.230
 almost over the time 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.609
 I 'm late for league games 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.250
 capture the flag 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.570
 the motivation behind it 17 I have me 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.340
 brought the end of the first half 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.020
 still because we just still the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.330
 balancing just makes the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.250
 balancing doing and why but just 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.080
 after we endured one 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.880
 leave the game from our team 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.140
 we want to play when down 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.520
 So three against four 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.380
 because her game is so that no 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.060
 disadvantages has never dreamed you 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.460
 That's just not gonna happen 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.740
 possible to say that 3 against 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.130
 many natural ass situation is the 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.450
 stain but what we for the past is 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.340
 that I reach my thani league 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.660
 had and mentally helicopter has 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.220
 unlikely we have requested 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.290
 should get our second child 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.150
 still have noticed her what 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.190
 maybe that's why I use the game 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.750
 Bad celebration when she says that he is fine 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.210
 plays and that we were all good 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.370
 the opponents are four man team that are 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.220
 an organized team that has a risk 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.510
 gaming are the four of us and with 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.640
 probably a substitute 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.860
 Only three of those name the sources 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.690
 risks your name still in there they had 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.790
 already wanted to be in the more professional 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.200
 be rail or something on it and 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.240
 In any case, taken apart 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.880
 for that they four against three flat as 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.350
 shows then finally have lost 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.640
 but what I am in the position of what we 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.229
 The people on the spot had already been through 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.760
 the panel ii copter you can on each 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.710
 if you look at it, look at it 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.120
 the gameplay again a bit 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.800
 know about it maybe you are 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.390
 or mute I have too 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.370
 damn played on the helicopter 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.720
 because if you let them gray the whole thing 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.310
 think about it when you are three against four 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.290
 it could be hard to play 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.820
 Forgot forgot because the exhibition 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.340
 from where your chance settle here very much 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.380
 difficult search and destroy pretty much 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.550
 just that is still a small spot 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.810
 it is just quite questionable there must 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.210
 one can exploit as the game 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.850
 until the last how it works and what 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.010
 Well, that's what gives you the game 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.470
 that's what they're about to rip something up 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.180
 streams or oberbauer the weapons ins 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.040
 Play alone over parade weapons 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.000
 why should not I play the best 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.230
 because you have the game at your disposal 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 make that big bit 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.350
 click what's like capture the 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.360
 take flag with most 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.830
 Alstom lightning strike and protected 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.020
 I will have extra again my 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.460
 Helicopter with taken because times 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.020
 will rest if it starts to pay off 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.250
 in the protected tali head towards all 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.230
 I have a hard one then 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.520
 magic spells poker bob has me too 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.600
 even before that said he as 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.070
 protected bavaria and I thought so 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.110
 that a good player reaches the h 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.990
 Protected anyway what he does 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.030
 because she has achieved and how 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.820
 said it was pretty good we got that 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.560
 delivered your ideals and what else I have 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.940
 times at the moment you have to say if 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.250
 you play three against four as I said 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.840
 Hardly vacant and scarcely searchable 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.580
 pretty easy pretty much destroy 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.680
 easily capture the flag is gone says 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.030
 kickin does not leave as soon as one 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.190
 left the game 1 2 against four 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.020
 it is impossible but three against four 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.790
 you have the goal you can tear it 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.170
 and if you look after it on it 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.000
 be proud in the end three to four 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.920
 is already a christian benefits 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.420
 All measures between are in this sense 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.190
 my name 6 eva and I wish no 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.570
 I want to record again 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.280
 I stand up for it myself 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:16.110
 I wish you a nice day and so on 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.110
 Do it until the next match is over
