it really is so so easy and I'm just
going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.530> go<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.890> random<00:01:29.369> sections<00:01:30.020> focusing

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
going to go in random sections focusing

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
going to go in random sections focusing
mainly<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.619> ends<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.430> apply<00:01:32.790> the

mainly on the ends and just apply the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.030 
mainly on the ends and just apply the
color<00:01:33.240> bug

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.310 

I<00:01:40.070> find<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:40.970> pressing<00:01:41.540> my<00:01:41.720> thumb<00:01:41.990> against

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
I find that pressing my thumb against

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.230 
I find that pressing my thumb against
the<00:01:42.500> color<00:01:42.710> with<00:01:42.920> my<00:01:43.070> hair<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:43.460> between<00:01:43.580> helps

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
the color with my hair in between helps

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.760 
the color with my hair in between helps
to<00:01:44.360> go<00:01:44.480> into<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.840> color<00:01:45.050> on<00:01:45.260> that<00:01:45.290> a<00:01:45.440> little

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
to go into the color on that a little

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.710 
to go into the color on that a little
bit<00:01:45.860> easier<00:01:46.220> although<00:01:46.910> it<00:01:47.300> really<00:01:47.570> isn't

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
bit easier although it really isn't

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.190 
bit easier although it really isn't
difficult<00:01:48.050> either<00:01:48.500> way<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:48.740> do<00:01:48.950> it

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.450 

throughout<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.320> whole<00:01:55.470> process<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.130> tend<00:01:56.370> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
throughout the whole process I tend to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.130 
throughout the whole process I tend to
break<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:56.940> into<00:01:57.330> my<00:01:57.450> hair<00:01:57.660> a<00:01:57.690> little<00:01:57.870> bit

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
break it up into my hair a little bit

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.630 
break it up into my hair a little bit
just<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.470> I<00:01:58.620> can<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.980> where<00:01:59.190> I've<00:01:59.280> applied

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
just so I can see where I've applied

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.690 
just so I can see where I've applied
where<00:02:00.150> I<00:02:00.180> need<00:02:00.510> to<00:02:00.540> add<00:02:00.780> more<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.440> just<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.400> add

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
where I need to add more and just to add

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:24.260 
where I need to add more and just to add
a<00:02:03.360> little<00:02:03.570> bit<00:02:03.660> of<00:02:03.810> texture<00:02:04.140> really

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.630 

once<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.930> finished<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.530> side<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.130> then<00:02:26.430> go

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
once I finished on that side I then go

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.250 
once I finished on that side I then go
on<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.060> other<00:02:27.180> side<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:27.870> do<00:02:28.140> exactly

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
on to the other side and just do exactly

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.950 
on to the other side and just do exactly
the<00:02:28.860> same

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.770 

I<00:02:36.610> did<00:02:37.610> say<00:02:37.820> it<00:02:37.940> did<00:02:38.060> get<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.300> little<00:02:38.390> bit<00:02:38.540> messy

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
I did say it did get a little bit messy

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.020 
I did say it did get a little bit messy
