00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.840
 hi friends how are we now in this 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.639
 occasion is I bring the games and 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.760
 applications and found the day free 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.650
 November 18, 2013 so you have to 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.180
 start quickly I remind you if 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.279

 and share this video with all your 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.630
 Let's start friends quickly 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.040
 that we do not get so late 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.780
 to hl and this game is going to be a puzzle what 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.340
 What is interesting about this is that we are going to 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.870
 to be able to put our photos and 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.220
 turn them into a point we're going to have 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.760
 that accommodate 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.519
 I do not love the game I'm not so 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.620
 fan of the puzzles but you can 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.210
 be interesting the truth as I say 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.730
 I do not like this kind of 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.550
 games we also find laguard arts 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.800
 in hd this comparison of the past me 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.960
 love 100 percent recommended 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.519
 friends download what is free today 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.550
 and at a price of usually 3 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.510
 dollars and I'm sure they are not going to 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.000
 to repent is those typical little monkeys 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.920
 are made in lines and also that 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.710
 now with a 3d touch the truth that is 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.510
 pretty pretty father download it friend 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.500
 I was playing it and it's 100% 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.170
 recommendable we also find wing 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.910
 this is missions is good is 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.800
 entertained as well as to kill the 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.720
 weather 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.270
 well I think it's that good to dry 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.640
 it's not a game that will hook you and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.500
 I 'll leave you hours and hours playing 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.550
 but the game is really good 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.460
 we also find both this going to 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.549
 be as I can explain 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.369
 you will be able to create music in a way 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.560
 different you will have the option of putting 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.880
 some battery you're going to put what you're going 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.159
 have the option to actually touch 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.540
 the guitar and the piano with this pretty 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.110
 good the game like the repetitive game 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.060
 it's the apology application but good if it's 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.590
 that you have that there is something to do with the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.590
 music or do you understand these things from 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.789
 the music in my case I do not understand 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.400
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.709
 we also find for ever lose that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.709
 is episode 1 and what we have to 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.319
 to do is to find all things 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.140
 lost in different styles of 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.450
 Rooms ok pretty good if 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.209
 you want to start thinking for a while 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.859
 break your head for a while as I say 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.650
 pretty good since as you go 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:34.019
 advancing it is getting more and more 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.420
 difficult, it's really quite good 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.090
 100% recommended game 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.159
 we found abc go this game 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 logically falls into the category of 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.470
 children's games and if you have children 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.359
 according to what you like it will help you 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.919
 go putting pictures go knowing 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.200
 what is it going to give you interactive videos 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:55.769
 is going to give you these things in fact 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.439
 paint pretty good and pretty good 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.620
 rated in the appstore too 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.900
 we found rd 4 and well this too 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.519
 will go into the music category and 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.319
 you will be able to create your songs 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.159
 directly from here it will serve you 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.569
 as a console and it is more advisable 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.900
 work on ipad is compatible with 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.319
 iphone ipod touch and 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.840
 well we also find piquin this 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.239
 application also enters into categories 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.129
 of children's games and what will 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.590
 to do is that we will be able to interact 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:31.670
 we will be able to enter and we will be able to 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:35.030
 create a sequence of videos to 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.040
 this one keep them either in your camera or 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.530
 we will be able to save them by 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.880
 pretty good dropbox 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.459
 but the wta I find it unnecessary 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.530
 we also found a said this is going to be 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.530
 How can I explain it? It's going to be like a 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.610
 good magazine is going to be like a wikipedia 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.950
 little one to be more in for 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.739
 explain it better will be like wikipedia 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.290
 little one is not so complete 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:09.870
 but if it fulfills its purpose ok in a few 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.300
 with few words to say it with no 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.120
 It has as much variety as Wikipedia 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.769
 obviously but it's starting and it's good 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.019
 chase them also checking 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.140
 we found a time nation in their 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.970
 graphics are pretty parents pretty 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.820
 addictive the game is war from 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.070
 fights 100% recommended this site 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.410
 I'm sure it will take away a very good 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.100
 society time when you have nothing 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.140
 what to do 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.020
 they play for a while, it's really quite 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.530
 pretty father 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.750
 and we also find alfaz in good 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.910
 this game what is going to do to us is that 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.039
 we will be able to create words like 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.620
 a kind of letter games a 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.139
 kind if I believe that how good is 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.979
 alphabet soup what is called you have 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.720
 to go creating or putting letters on 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.270
 words I think it's enough for 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.699
 of the game and how do I tell you if you want 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.729
 to be a while thinking this game is 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.639
 for you and finally we find 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.909
 martÃ­n quest this is going to be a game of 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:13.319
 wizards devil style but with graphics 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:17.080
 more infant is pretty good enough 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:19.990
 entertaining but it does not become a game 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.880
 that is going to hook you completely and 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.159
 good friends, these are all 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.669
