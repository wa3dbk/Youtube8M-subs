carry all this stuff on my back so it

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.580 
carry all this stuff on my back so it
rolls<00:03:08.150> out<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.600> this<00:03:08.750> this<00:03:08.989> is<00:03:09.140> how<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.380> keeps

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
rolls out like this this is how it keeps

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.650 
rolls out like this this is how it keeps
everything<00:03:09.860> waterproof<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.269> opens<00:03:11.569> like

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
everything waterproof and it opens like

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.570 
everything waterproof and it opens like
up<00:03:11.930> like<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.319> you<00:03:12.530> see<00:03:12.709> it's<00:03:12.860> white<00:03:13.160> inside

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
up like that you see it's white inside

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.370 
up like that you see it's white inside
so<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.060> makes<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.390> really<00:03:14.750> easy<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:15.140> see

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
really easy to move around so let's see

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.570 
really easy to move around so let's see
what<00:04:18.590> else<00:04:18.799> we<00:04:19.130> got

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.370 

so<00:04:23.120> here's<00:04:23.420> something<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.080> they've<00:04:24.230> been

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
so here's something that they've been

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.850 
so here's something that they've been
they<00:04:24.860> just<00:04:25.190> switched<00:04:25.580> up<00:04:25.880> in<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:27.620> newer

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
they just switched up in the newer

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.770 
they just switched up in the newer
models<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.460> this<00:04:28.640> they<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:29.000> these<00:04:29.180> alloy

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
models of this they have these alloy

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.840 
models of this they have these alloy
straps<00:04:30.290> before<00:04:30.680> they<00:04:31.130> were<00:04:31.190> just<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.670> think

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
straps before they were just I think

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.720 
straps before they were just I think
they<00:04:32.240> were<00:04:32.300> all<00:04:32.570> like<00:04:32.840> this<00:04:33.250> these<00:04:34.250> kinds<00:04:34.640> of

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
they were all like this these kinds of

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.730 
they were all like this these kinds of
buckles<00:04:35.210> but<00:04:35.990> now<00:04:36.080> we<00:04:36.140> have<00:04:36.380> these<00:04:36.470> alloy

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
buckles but now we have these alloy

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.800 
buckles but now we have these alloy
straps<00:04:37.220> so<00:04:37.760> that's<00:04:37.940> really<00:04:38.240> nice<00:04:38.510> high

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
straps so that's really nice high

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.170 
straps so that's really nice high
quality<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:41.210> buckle<00:04:42.170> it<00:04:42.230> all<00:04:42.350> together<00:04:43.180> this

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
quality to buckle it all together this

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.640 
quality to buckle it all together this
is<00:04:44.360> actually<00:04:44.720> how<00:04:44.840> you<00:04:44.900> hook<00:04:45.050> everything<00:04:45.380> up

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
is actually how you hook everything up

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.140 
is actually how you hook everything up
and<00:04:45.920> that's<00:04:46.040> how<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:46.520> attach<00:04:46.820> the

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
and that's how it you attach the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.630 
and that's how it you attach the
additional<00:04:48.610> additional<00:04:49.610> packs<00:04:50.090> onto<00:04:50.660> this<00:04:51.640> so

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
additional additional packs onto this so

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.470 
additional additional packs onto this so
that's<00:04:52.880> just<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.360> quick<00:04:53.600> unboxing<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.650> review

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
that's just a quick unboxing and review

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.970 
that's just a quick unboxing and review
