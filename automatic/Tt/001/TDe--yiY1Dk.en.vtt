 built in the early 200s comes 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.670
 considered one of the highest masterpieces 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.650
 of Italian Gothic architecture there yes

 damaged it was restored and rebuilt 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.119
 in the 12th century also with intervention 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.760
 of the antelami the artist bound 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.250
 inextricably creating almost a single one 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.350
 complex existing building of the 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.800
 cathedral with the new love of 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.800
 baptistery 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.350
 the interior of the cathedral and the plan a 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.810
 Latin cross arise from an extension 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.290
 of the structures completed during the 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.910
 twelfth century a large women 's gallery 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.489

 Christian basilicas with kings above 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.600
 side aisles overlooking this one

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.570
 the background decorated with a technique appears 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.030
 Byzantine tends to present the relief 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.910
 with a miniated page a floor 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.850
 coloristic serves to give prominence to 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.250
 figures whose rounded forms are 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.229
 rippled by dense regular folds 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.229
 just detected garments 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:55.649

 he learned that architectural members 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.160
 they can be reduced to the subtlety of one 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.299
 written line without losing any of the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.310
 their facade is the facade of sant'andrea 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:20.010
 tight between two towers seems thin 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.319
 like a thread stretched between the depths of the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.450
 three portals and loggias and in 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.840
 highlight of the bundles of slender columns 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.569
 almost filiform but what it gives to the piano 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.269
 the tenuousness of the veil is not so much the 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.849
 empty as much as the measure and the 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.340
 perfect writing of limbs purity 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.720
 linear of the columns at the top the

 diagonals 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.700
 with subtle dialectic without compromise 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.080
 blessed antelami associates tradition

 with the experience directly lived

 first of the ProvenÃ§al French art 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.010
 following the trend already widespread in 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.340
 emilia and then of the great cathedrals 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.950
 Parisian the interior of the church of 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.110
 sant'andrea and a Latin cross with three

 aisles divided by polistil pillars i 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.180
 covered with ribbed cross vaults 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.959
 resulting from the intersection of two 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.180
 barrel vaults in cross vaults yes 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.700
 accentuate the lines of force that 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.920
 take prominence as ribs while 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.440
 the triangular sections thus determined 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.440
 they become simple covering veils 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.849
 reworking Moorish examples of bows 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.190
 transversal and those of the spans 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.349
 they take an acute ogival shape which 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.140
 increases height allowing for 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.299
 vary the width of the interior sen 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.730
 Romanesque architecture was founded 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.069
 on the static balance of weights that 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.389
 Gothic is based on dynamic balance 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.389
 of pushes and counter-thrusts 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.579
 started around the middle of the century 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.549
 xii the construction of the Siena Cathedral 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.620
 with waves very troubled events that 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.890
 see the subsequent intervention of various 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.130
 designers and artists and the sprint a 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.460
 polychrome marbles carved extractors with 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.770
 niches that host a stage crowd 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:27.430
 on the right side there was the bell tower 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.260
 Romanesque with black and white bands 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.320
 at the intersection of the transept dominates the 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.600
 hexagonal dome the lower part is 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.900
 consisting of three portals surmounted by 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.240
 Gothic tympanums in flowery Gothic style 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.789
 yet the whole upper part with a 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.789
 rosette framed by small tabernacles 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.050
 from 1371 the realization began 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.690
 continued for centuries of the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.530
 extraordinary marble floor work 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.530
 of different artists 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.060
 the interior is entirely covered with 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:12.480
 typical of Tuscan colors

 early fifteenth century it spreads into

 europa the so-called gothic

 international and milan is in that

 period the center of a culture

 programmatically international that 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:43.539
 supports the universality of art against

 the historicist interpretations the

 milano cathedral factory is 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.289
 the direct expression of a vision of 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.529
 world that spiritualizes the technique as 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:56.229
 ideal way of human doing is a work 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:58.509
 gigantic to which engineers work 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.340
 not only Italian but also French and 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.789
 Germans that fits almost 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.830
 confluence in the urban fabric breaking down 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:09.759
 the historical and representative nucleus of the

 municipal power the facade of the 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.860
 cathedral is thematic elaboration 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:17.129
 according to a virtuoso scheme of the 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.789
 upward motion of visible forms 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.180
 everything

 from the high plinth to the last puglia 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.009
 penetrates into space to animate it with 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:29.020
 light and intangible arches with

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.250
 naples with the dense decorations and
