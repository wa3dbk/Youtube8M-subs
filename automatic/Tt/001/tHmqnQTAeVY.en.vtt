00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.100
 hello love video games from here 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.990
 the andi and i welcome you to one 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.090
 new edition here on tape.tv 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.920
 you know that maybe there are 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.440
 Eight come a try or yes 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.600
 come another level games where 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.910
 you quickly lose time most of the time 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.910
 are the year either puzzle games like 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.529
 eg the good old tetris or else 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.320
 skill games like nintendo 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.539
 land or warioware every now and then 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.030
 you can find such games in others 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.520
 genres such as the genre of the jump n runs 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.530
 That's how I did carrot 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.890
 kangaroo what i give you in this issue 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.989
 Imagine the game is a 3D 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.059
 anthology as written in the book 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.730
 means for you that the focus 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.920
 in fact , something is on the back 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.200
 A kangaroo is logical somewhere 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 and you also avoid obstacles 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.879
 and enemies must knock as 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.100
 So I was the lover of 3d jump on 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.469
 Hot on the kangaroo and started that 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.360
 adventure on my dreamcast yet 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.639
 already the first level r left me 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.439
 shudder crouched kangaroo was suffering 

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:10.079
 namely the most important element 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.789
 Nothing at a year on the controller 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.770
 for a bad dear developer but why 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.679
 the protagonist moves like that 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.509
 he runs on smooth ice jumps properly 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:20.819
 but sharing is not good 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.889
 opponents meet without being hit 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:24.779
 but will only go in one of three 

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:26.789
 do a job in run with one 

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:27.240
 kangaroo killing the control 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.299
 has been 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.459
 oh man being fucked up maybe 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.740
 too hard to express too hard 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.990
 it might be more factual 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.849
 On the other hand, if you like the quality and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.859
 Accuracy of one of mario or banjo 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.659
 kazooie knows the control of 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.790
 kangaroo actually plain and simple 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.830
 ruined 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.410
 why then the video asks you questions 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.450
 why it stuck to it 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.640
 Would you ask me, right? 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.980
 I believed you but I am 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.930
 at the first level the teeth together too 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.300
 in view of the moderate camera work 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.580
 I did not manage the first level 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.830
 represented extraordinary witchcraft 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.020
 since it was very short and found me in 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.090
 a level survey again instead 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.369
 a coherent world offers you 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.420
 the game 25 level one by one 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.880
 can deny 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.160
 so I said so deal 1 made 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.320
 after that, play the second level 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.280
 then the third then the fourth and so on 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.050
 on and on 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.970
 meanwhile , the controls went a bit 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.860
 better by hand the levels were short 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.390
 and crisp and the classic double 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.900
 run gameplay started really fun too 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.900
 do 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.540
 and behold card kangaroo woods even 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.040
 A little change here since us there 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.200
 levels were displayed where you 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.350
 for example, through a cave slides 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.860
 or a rink lasts about 60 yards 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.080
 to greet 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.630
 and so the game developed for 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.090
 me to a change of feelings 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.280
 fun motivation and ambition changed 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.530
 with frustration because of the control 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.130
 and the camera problems I often died 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.870
 and died and died and died my trouble 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.120
 now it was me, after all 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.160
 drive and this feeling of the oh come 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.430
 a level you still do play principle 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.810
 that arises due to the level selection 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.940
 And so I saw myself a final boss 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.450
 strong against the menacing big 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.370
 appeared 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.290
 but like the whole game unbelievable 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.660
 It was really easy to defeat 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.430
 point and simple kangaroo map 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.140
 actually good five to six hours 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.000
 you need to finish 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.680
 depending on how often you are due to the 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.760
 sluggish control of the lousy would have 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.590
 action and the brand ran 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.480
 collision query who gives the spoon 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.880
 The cute presentation helps as well 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.010
 nothing is graphically highest 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.780
 is for mediocrity and rayman me 2 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.510
 Compared much better in comparison 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.070
 who wants to do my rayman 2 review 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.240
 like to see a link to this 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.850
 her in the video game 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.910
 ok enough own application withdrew 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.920
 By the way, kangaroo sounds completely 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.380
 on speech output waived but 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.240
 with nice pieces of music I come along 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.090
 by the way, share the reviews of the press 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.150
 the job of yesteryear between 65 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.190
 and 70 forgave the kangaroo does not matter 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.320
 new genre and fails at the well 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.640
 main aspect of the control as well 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.530
 if i dozens at this place 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.790
 repeat the control must in 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.890
 to vote for a platformer 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.600
 and here you have to deal with the control 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.520
 make friends with chaos 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.760
 Fine tuning had really wonder here 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.010
 who worked beinhart ag from run fan 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.810
 is allowed to risk a look 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.700
 everyone else is playing dozens 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.380
 better alternatives like there 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.150
 outside on the video game market 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.260
 Find 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.730
 Bergauer the waitress not yet 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.830
 played had basically nothing 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.140
 missed and it seems to me a little bit like 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.210
 the game to release so well 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.940
 could even in poland where it in the release 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.550
 period over 45,000 pieces settle 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.380
 I could say it definitely needs fans 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.770
 especially because yes, too 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.470
 the successor came ground to appeared at that time 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.810
 for xbox playstation 2 and the gamecube 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.340
 the first part on drinking is like 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.320
 said rather average 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.820
 nothing new maybe even fall 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.780
 that's why it's mine 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.780
 66 percent
