and then most important is the the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.240 
and then most important is the the
measurement<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.560> if<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.710> take<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> beadboard

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
measurement and if you take a beadboard

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.120 
measurement and if you take a beadboard
and<00:01:23.759> go<00:01:24.540> ahead<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.930> lay<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.320> your<00:01:25.350> watch<00:01:25.770> and

and go ahead and lay out your watch and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.700 
and go ahead and lay out your watch and
your<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.850> beads<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.450> your<00:01:27.479> clasp<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.500> will

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
your your beads in your clasp this will

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.850 
your your beads in your clasp this will
help<00:01:28.940> with<00:01:29.940> your<00:01:30.000> pattern<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.810> also<00:01:31.080> figuring

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
help with your pattern and also figuring

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.530 
help with your pattern and also figuring
out<00:01:32.009> how<00:01:32.549> long<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.970> needs<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.390> because

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
out how long it needs to be because

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.300 
out how long it needs to be because
you're<00:01:33.869> obviously<00:01:34.259> gonna<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.920> subtract

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you're obviously gonna have to subtract

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.600 
you're obviously gonna have to subtract
the<00:01:35.460> amount<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.630> length<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.310> watch<00:01:38.310> space

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the amount the length of the watch space

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.190 
the amount the length of the watch space
so<00:01:38.909> all<00:01:38.940> I'm<00:01:39.180> gonna<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.539> is<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> lay

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so all I'm gonna do is just going to lay

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.539 
so all I'm gonna do is just going to lay
out<00:01:40.320> my<00:01:40.440> pattern<00:01:40.649> so<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> kind

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
out my pattern so I'm just going to kind

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.800 
out my pattern so I'm just going to kind
of<00:01:41.610> Center<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.299> I'm<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> make<00:01:42.780> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
of Center this if I'm going to make a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.510 
of Center this if I'm going to make a
seven<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> half<00:01:43.409> inch<00:01:44.869> watch<00:01:46.310> I'm<00:01:47.310> just

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
seven and a half inch watch I'm just

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.740 
seven and a half inch watch I'm just
going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> Center<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:48.509> lay<00:01:48.600> my

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
going to Center it out and then lay my

00:01:48.750 --> 00:02:01.149 
going to Center it out and then lay my
beads<00:01:48.990> out

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
now that I've got a basic design laid

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.120 
now that I've got a basic design laid
out<00:02:15.560> I'm<00:02:15.830> going<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.610> cut<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:18.140> beading<00:02:18.890> wire

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
out I'm going to cut the beading wire

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.510 
out I'm going to cut the beading wire
and<00:02:19.190> I'm<00:02:20.030> gonna<00:02:20.150> cut<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:21.310> several<00:02:22.310> inches

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
and I'm gonna cut it several inches

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.310 
and I'm gonna cut it several inches
longer<00:02:22.880> than<00:02:23.000> what<00:02:23.210> I<00:02:23.240> need<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.660> be<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:23.870> to

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
longer than what I need it to be just to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.500 
longer than what I need it to be just to
make<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.800> easier<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.130> work<00:02:25.310> with<00:02:25.450> what<00:02:26.450> I'm

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.480 
make it easier to work with what I'm
gonna<00:02:26.630> do<00:02:26.840> first<00:02:27.320> is<00:02:27.710> we're<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:27.950> gonna<00:02:28.190> lift

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
gonna do first is we're just gonna lift

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.890 
gonna do first is we're just gonna lift
the<00:02:29.320> watch<00:02:30.320> face<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.180> we're<00:02:32.180> going<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.630> string

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
the watch face and we're going to string

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.730 
the watch face and we're going to string
on<00:02:33.280> string<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.790> ends<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.330> wire<00:02:35.740> through

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
on string the ends of the wire through

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.560 
on string the ends of the wire through
the<00:02:36.830> watch<00:02:37.040> face<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.640> then<00:02:38.120> we're<00:02:38.240> going<00:02:38.450> to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
the watch face and then we're going to

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.910 
the watch face and then we're going to
slip<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:39.580> your<00:02:40.580> crimp<00:02:40.880> bead<00:02:41.590> you're<00:02:42.590> gonna<00:02:42.680> run

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920

the crimp bead the wire back through the
crimp<00:02:45.170> bead<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.770> then<00:02:46.010> we're<00:02:46.100> gonna<00:02:46.190> crimp

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
crimp bead and then we're gonna crimp

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:55.450 
crimp bead and then we're gonna crimp
this<00:02:47.060> end<00:02:53.170> as<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.380> said<00:02:54.590> I'm<00:02:54.770> going<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.010> be<00:02:55.100> using

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
this end as I said I'm going to be using

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.930 
this end as I said I'm going to be using
the<00:02:55.610> magical<00:02:56.030> crimp<00:02:56.950> forming<00:02:57.950> tool<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.550> what

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
the magical crimp forming tool and what

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.020 
the magical crimp forming tool and what
this<00:02:59.120> does<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.630> gives<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.960> little<00:03:00.320> nicer

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
this does is it gives you a little nicer

look crimp bead at the tip at the watch

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.010 
look crimp bead at the tip at the watch
face<00:03:04.790> here<00:03:05.060> what<00:03:05.240> it<00:03:05.330> does<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.720> makes<00:03:05.900> that

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
face here what it does is it makes that

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.310 
face here what it does is it makes that

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
don't have to cover this crimp some

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.350 
don't have to cover this crimp some
people<00:03:13.490> may<00:03:13.610> want<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:13.910> go<00:03:13.970> ahead<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.210> use<00:03:14.330> a

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
people may want to go ahead and use a

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.700 
people may want to go ahead and use a
regular<00:03:14.540> crimping<00:03:15.050> tool<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.350> then<00:03:15.440> cover<00:03:15.620> it

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
regular crimping tool and then cover it

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.640 
regular crimping tool and then cover it
with<00:03:15.860> a<00:03:15.890> crimp<00:03:16.100> cover<00:03:16.460> or<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.390> large<00:03:18.170> hole<00:03:18.440> bead

with a crimp cover or a large hole bead

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.840 
with a crimp cover or a large hole bead
that<00:03:18.800> will<00:03:18.950> slide<00:03:19.160> over<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.550> but<00:03:19.730> I'm<00:03:19.820> just

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
that will slide over that but I'm just

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.630 
that will slide over that but I'm just
gonna<00:03:20.120> use<00:03:20.330> this<00:03:20.480> crimping<00:03:20.990> tool<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.520> use

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
gonna use this crimping tool and to use

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.180 
gonna use this crimping tool and to use
the<00:03:22.760> crimping<00:03:22.940> tool<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:23.800> place<00:03:24.800> the<00:03:24.950> crimp

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
the crimping tool you place the crimp

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.530 
the crimping tool you place the crimp
within<00:03:25.490> the<00:03:25.610> grooves<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.540> press<00:03:26.780> down<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:29.480> you

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
within the grooves and press down so you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.530 
within the grooves and press down so you
get<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:30.170> flat<00:03:30.530> in<00:03:30.770> four<00:03:31.100> corners<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.760> then<00:03:32.390> you

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
get it flat in four corners and then you

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.440 
get it flat in four corners and then you
just<00:03:32.750> continue<00:03:32.960> to<00:03:33.910> rotate<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.270> around

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
just continue to rotate it around

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.740 
just continue to rotate it around
through<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.990> two<00:03:36.200> through<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.130> tool<00:03:37.750> which

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
through the two through the tool which

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:51.510 
through the two through the tool which
is<00:03:38.930> rounding<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.680> off

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.100 

we've<00:03:52.120> got

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
we've got

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.890 
we've got
crap<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.190> then<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.210> next<00:03:55.330> thing<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.570> do<00:03:55.720> is

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
crap and then the next thing you do is

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.870 
crap and then the next thing you do is
just<00:03:56.080> string<00:03:56.290> your<00:03:56.410> beads<00:03:56.620> on<00:03:56.830> just<00:03:57.610> like<00:03:57.730> you

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
just string your beads on just like you

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:09.270 
just string your beads on just like you
would<00:03:58.030> as<00:03:58.120> if<00:03:58.360> you<00:03:58.480> were<00:03:58.600> basic<00:03:58.930> beating

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.770 

of<00:04:10.280> course<00:04:10.520> you<00:04:10.610> can<00:04:10.730> use<00:04:10.880> any<00:04:11.060> variety<00:04:11.390> of

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
of course you can use any variety of

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.600 
of course you can use any variety of
beads<00:04:12.170> to<00:04:12.500> do<00:04:12.920> this<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.550> just<00:04:14.480> picked<00:04:14.930> up<00:04:15.610> these

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
beads to do this I just picked up these

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.560 
beads to do this I just picked up these
crackle<00:04:17.150> beads<00:04:17.390> and<00:04:17.660> some<00:04:17.930> spacers<00:04:22.570> what

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
crackle beads and some spacers what

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.510 
crackle beads and some spacers what
you're<00:04:23.660> gonna<00:04:23.750> do<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:24.110> have<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.470> tail<00:04:27.520> and

you're gonna do is have the tail and
just<00:04:28.550> continue<00:04:29.180> stringing<00:04:29.510> until<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.810> get<00:04:29.960> to

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
just continue stringing until you get to

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.270 
just continue stringing until you get to
the<00:04:30.260> end<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:31.130> then<00:04:31.970> we'll<00:04:32.120> apply<00:04:32.860> one<00:04:33.860> end<00:04:34.160> of

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
the end and then we'll apply one end of

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.070 
the end and then we'll apply one end of
our<00:04:34.460> top<00:04:34.760> toggle<00:04:35.390> to<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.830> end<00:04:37.810> now<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:38.960> I've

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080

then we're gonna beat the other end of

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:25.540 
then we're gonna beat the other end of
our<00:06:25.129> watch
