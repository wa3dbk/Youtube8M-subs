00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.120 

just<00:02:13.120> look<00:02:13.300> at<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.100> the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
just look at that so that you do it the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:27.900 
just look at that so that you do it the
right<00:02:15.370> way<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:26.320> push<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.740> down<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.430> press<00:02:27.730> it

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
a bit so then it sits well
