00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.339
 well then today I find for 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.140
 a first impressions video and this 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.090
 will be as you saw in the title 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.610
 on the new mascara of l'oréal paris 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.429
 which is the mega volumes put this manga 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.740
 so it's a mascara that promises you 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.480
 to make soft eyelashes really dolls 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.390
 of as seen in mangas actually 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.750
 so very bulky attraction is killed 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.250
 there is a brush she is like that 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.250
 she's really big enough it's 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.649
 nice and I see that well it's 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 that you see the brush bending 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.270
 so that 's going to be pretty handy for 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.690
 apply a mask to a it's gone I 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.690
 start right away 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.270
 the application is really easy so 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.460
 already after a single layer we see that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.140
 a good length I have a little volume 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.030
 so that I think it's not bad by 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.070
 compared to the mascara I had before 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.730
 I finished who was the graet the age of 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.680
 maybelline 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.240
 but it's really not bad for us 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.260
 put a layer on and win 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.960
 and then tell you what I think 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:23.880
 after and that's a result after two 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.950
 houses so frankly I am 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.860
 just stunned of the result I have the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.000
 super long voluminous lashes and I 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.990
 really doll targets that's 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.180
 really what I'm looking for in a 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.760
 mascara personally and do not bother me 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.760
 as here the past unnoticed in quarter 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.650
 and I am extremely satisfied in 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.910
 plus it's true that the fact that the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.070
 brush is flexible 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.660
 it's pretty handy for use 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.960
 because we usually have the impression 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.280
 pull on the lashes and there the brush of the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.010
 blow has the time to apply the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.930
 produced that if he got it enough 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.119
 nice it makes a very very sweet effect 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.060
 a very soft application in the end and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.070
 yes m 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.270
 super happy with this new mascara 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.979
 frankly it's going to be one of my 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.280
 preferred for December smells 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.700
 strongly for the holidays loud is 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.420
 awesome 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.090
 so here is mascara but there is me wanted 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.490
 this manga from l'oréal paris frankly 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.610
 for now first application 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.020
 conquered 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.130
 So here I am full of you 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.000
 full of big kisses we find ourselves very 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.000
 soon for a new video
