00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.120
 hello everyone is well arrived on this 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.690
 channel I call them valentina are one 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:18.070
 creative that for several years now maybe 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.689
 you're my main creativity wheel 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.210
 around the world of beads 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.700
 in fact, here in the information ports 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.369
 you will find the link that sends you back to me 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.059
 first channel the whims of lilly this 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:34.300
 channel this new channel is born 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:37.510
 from the desire to speak also of other and 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.480
 mainly of rows and top ones of 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.030
 four techniques in particular 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.760
 crochet also known as a cross 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.519
 mafia and tatting and sewing 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.159
 it will be a new experience for me because 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.949
 I never talked about these techniques 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:56.140
 within the other channel and per 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.530
 talk about these techniques i decided to 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.859
 develop a separate virtual place where 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.989
 collecting history of QT tively 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:10.720
 arguments on these 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:14.320
 four types of obi that can give 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.800
 place to creations of different kinds 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.590
 I intend to structure this channel in two 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.600
 precise ways on the one hand the lessons of 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.530
 base where beginners can 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.010
 learn how to start a 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.620
 work and then come down the tutorials 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.610
 dedicated to those who already use it anyway 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.750
 certain techniques and wants 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.020
 create things in particular myself 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.490
 I thank all the people who 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.670
 knowing me they have already decided to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.710
 sign up for this new channel and I take it 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.710
 an opportunity to greet all the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.830
 new people who will listen to this 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.470
 space is will give from time to time the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:06.360
 their opinion their suggestion o 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.670
 they will simply leave a like one 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.530
 I want to make a premise I'll say it 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.290
 only in this video I will not repeat it 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.230
 in others regarding these 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.220
 I am a self-taught four bows 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.940
 so in this channel I will say only ed 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.580
 exclusively what I can do and 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.670
 I will show how I can do it not 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.580
 I pretend to be a teacher for 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:36.600
 none therefore obviously all 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.640
 people who will find in my way of 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.220
 handle iron handle crochet hook 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.799
 handle chattering roda or 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.450
 use the sewing machine 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.430
 mistakes 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.670
 I wish they start from the assumption that 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.760
 I am a self-taught and I do not mean 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.820
 absolutely 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.030
 obscure the importance of masters but 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.880
 simply give support to whom 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.270
 maybe he failed otherwise 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.460
 I understand a given project 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.270
 I learned everything by myself and I'm happy 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:15.000
 for me youtube and the web 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.010
 in particular they were a boon from 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.300
 heaven because with all the tutorials there 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.090
 they are also coming from people who 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.700
 they explained really hard 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.030
 their their technical 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.820
 I managed to reach levels 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.070
 for me at tf maybe they are enough for 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.209
 someone else, however, the fact of being 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.100
 still managed to master one 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.050
 certain technique for me is already a 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.970
 great success and me with mine 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.740
 contribution I would like other people 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.380
 could master the 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.480
 techniques and therefore for this in form mi 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.280
 I put at your disposal 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.300
 I hope you will find good on this 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.440
 channel I will simply try to 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.180
 teach you everything from time to time 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.940
 once I learn it's for me this will be a 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.500
 way to make a journey together then 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.110
 to make a journey together with the others 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.239
