00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello today we find ourselves for 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.620
 a simple recipe we will do 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.259
 oriental-style cauliflower donuts 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.940
 so some vegetables some spices and 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.680
 it's all about memories 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.680
 very simple and super tasty it's 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.970
 gone to realize these donuts cabbage 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.039
 oriental flower we will need 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.359
 600 g of cauliflower that I already have 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.029
 performed English rattle ie 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.640
 birch in gold with salt on 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.199
 will also need two highs 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.540
 about 100 g of flour 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.489
 so I would say between 60 and 100 g of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.989
 flour you take 100 g life you 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.790
 will see if you put any next step 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.379
 the consistency that you are only you 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.620
 like to have then we need them 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.450
 so cumin tracks in full so a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.550
 half teaspoon half a spoon to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.039
 powdered cumin coffee half a 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 teaspoon of turmeric half a 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.170
 teaspoon dayan powder as well as 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.649
 half a teaspoon of chili pepper 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.480
 powder 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.739
 we will of course need olive oil 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 not cook them a little bit of salt a little 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.250
 of weight and to finish of course we 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.489
 will need a tablespoon 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.470
 curved coriander fresh a trip 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.040
 that I have I chiseled there so we 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.570
 will add just before cooking no 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.659
 no bÃ©diÃ© we will start right away 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.259
 by crushing our driver to the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.150
 fork 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.890
 so of course I said to the fork 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.159
 if you have a spitter it works too 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.930
 super good their idea is not in 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.270
 to make porridge you have to keep 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.729
 pieces like that it will still be 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.560
 really nicer under the tooth in 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.820
 the donut so now what is this 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.890
 I still have to do and we'll go 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.890
 add our only ones simply 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.660
 we will already start a mixed milk of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.780
 way to get something pretty 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:55.800
 eat then avoid the fork for 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.570
 stir this preparation to keep 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.160
 maximum to the integrity of our little ones 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.229
 pieces of breath admits to doing the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.900
 boiled it's still there it's 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.610
 always what to avoid power 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:12.259
 add spices and gold chilli 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.259
 French at will it's you who see 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.410
 we add 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.090
 e 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.810
 that you have me whole and the pipe 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:33.340
 powder and gives a little bit of status 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.600
 so there by cons and despite income 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.850
 I have plenty who would be blessed bread 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.730
 with all the pepper and the other with that 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.500
 light what is not a super 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.480
 atmosphere at table after so now 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:52.990
 Ben we will add a little titouan salt 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:56.650
 two months already chili anyway for 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.820
 stir gently again and again 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.620
 now we will add the flour 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.950
 I think it does not matter at all 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:08.110
 because the preparation is already 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.670
 although basically embarrassed at 87 32 I'm going 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.470
 heat a pan with oil 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.160
 olive and then we'll train to come on 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.810
 will cook them 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.340
 this is the moment to add 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.530
 grant me cool shade so there but 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.780
 in everything last precisely for them 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.420
 keep its beautiful color and 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.160
 casselman range not too much with spices 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.450
 all that could change a little 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.459
 little its general appearance sees the bubble is 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.530
 warming up we'll be able to do 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.610
 donuts it needed a little 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:40.060
 amount of preparation and then bah one 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.010
 simply goes for less support like 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.300
 it 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.590
 here are the safe sites on one side and then 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.530
 we will return them to our bills of 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.220
 the other and we will do the same for the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.220
 remaining after Freche 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.390

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.710
