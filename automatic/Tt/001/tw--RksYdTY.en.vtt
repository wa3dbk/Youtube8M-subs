00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
like a half size stove so it has to work

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.090 
like a half size stove so it has to work
double<00:00:33.690> duty<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.530> cost<00:00:34.739> me<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> lot<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
double duty and it cost me a lot of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.670 
double duty and it cost me a lot of
money<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.340> electric<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> use<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.780> even

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
money in electric to use it so even

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.900 
money in electric to use it so even
though<00:00:37.770> propane<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.280> kind<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.520> expensive

the way I cut up an apple I was thinking

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.920 
the way I cut up an apple I was thinking
about<00:04:49.490> today<00:04:49.700> when<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.300> was<00:04:50.389> cutting<00:04:50.600> this<00:04:50.720> up

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
about today when I was cutting this up

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.810 
about today when I was cutting this up
and<00:04:51.530> you<00:04:51.950> know<00:04:52.070> what<00:04:52.160> everyone<00:04:52.430> does<00:04:52.669> things

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
and you know what everyone does things

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.730 
and you know what everyone does things
differently<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:54.050> I'm<00:04:54.260> gonna<00:04:54.350> show<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:54.620> how<00:04:54.710> I

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
differently so I'm gonna show you how I

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.120 
differently so I'm gonna show you how I
do<00:04:54.889> it

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
do it

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.650 
do it
and<00:04:55.250> then<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.490> like<00:04:55.669> video<00:04:55.880> responses<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.510> see

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
and then I like video responses to see

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.360 
and then I like video responses to see
if<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.840> do<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.139> differently<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.680> find<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.280> way

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
if you do it differently I find the way

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.490 
if you do it differently I find the way
I<00:04:58.400> do<00:04:58.520> it<00:04:58.639> is<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.389> easiest<00:04:59.660> most<00:04:59.990> efficient

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
I do it is the easiest most efficient

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.990 
I do it is the easiest most efficient
way<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.620> getting<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.070> most<00:05:01.220> Apple<00:05:01.669> out<00:05:01.790> of<00:05:01.910> it

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
way to getting the most Apple out of it

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.090 
way to getting the most Apple out of it
you<00:05:02.540> know<00:05:02.660> I<00:05:02.870> don't<00:05:03.050> have<00:05:03.169> a<00:05:03.200> core<00:05:03.530> that<00:05:03.979> would

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
you know I don't have a core that would

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.469 
you know I don't have a core that would
be<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.340> easier<00:05:04.580> thing<00:05:04.760> that<00:05:04.910> little<00:05:05.120> tool<00:05:05.300> you

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
be the easier thing that little tool you

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.879 
be the easier thing that little tool you
just<00:05:05.660> you<00:05:05.810> know<00:05:05.900> push<00:05:06.110> down<00:05:06.290> on<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.470> top<00:05:06.680> and
