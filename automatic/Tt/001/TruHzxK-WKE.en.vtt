00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.839 
hormone seen as I'm pumping myself full
of<00:03:20.620> them<00:03:20.739> it's<00:03:20.980> free<00:03:21.160> o'clock<00:03:21.370> now<00:03:21.519> I<00:03:21.549> finished

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
of them it's free o'clock now I finished

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.249 
of them it's free o'clock now I finished
work<00:03:22.000> at<00:03:22.150> 6:00<00:03:22.389> and<00:03:22.599> I'll<00:03:22.660> probably<00:03:22.780> again

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:23.259 
work at 6:00 and I'll probably again

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:25.020 
work at 6:00 and I'll probably again
when<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.500> get<00:03:23.560> home<00:03:23.799> off<00:03:24.070> six<00:03:24.370> or<00:03:24.579> see<00:03:24.759> you<00:03:24.850> them

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
when I get home off six or see you them

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.629 
when I get home off six or see you them
so<00:03:25.269> it's<00:03:25.449> 6:30<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.350> graveyard<00:03:26.979> shift<00:03:27.070> for<00:03:27.519> all

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
so it's 6:30 the graveyard shift for all

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.120 
so it's 6:30 the graveyard shift for all

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.880 
cutting it's the period of time in a day

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
salad wrap if you're into all your clean

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.930 
salad wrap if you're into all your clean
eat<00:03:53.990> in<00:03:54.170> which<00:03:54.320> I<00:03:54.620> am<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.220> certain<00:03:55.550> extent

eat in which I am to a certain extent

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.580 
eat in which I am to a certain extent
then<00:03:56.270> this<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:56.600> probably<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.960> more<00:03:57.170> healthier

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
then this is probably the more healthier

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.920 
then this is probably the more healthier
option<00:03:58.070> all<00:03:58.610> it<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.880> is<00:03:59.150> grilled<00:03:59.540> chicken

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
option all it is is grilled chicken

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.840 
option all it is is grilled chicken
which<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.290> protein<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:01.070> carbs<00:04:01.490> in<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.700> wrap

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
which is protein and carbs in the wrap

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.120 
which is protein and carbs in the wrap
so<00:04:02.060> it's<00:04:02.210> now<00:04:02.330> a<00:04:02.360> 22<00:04:02.780> 7<00:04:03.140> I'll<00:04:03.350> eat<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:03.770> and
