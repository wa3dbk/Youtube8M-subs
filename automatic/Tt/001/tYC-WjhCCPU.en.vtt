00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.109
 welcome to the destruction I am an additional subject 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.959
 at bungie, shop starts Sunday in November 2008 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.490
 nobility required in this store is actually the target group from 25 onwards 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.759
 is going to build 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.999
 that is our target group which we ourselves grow at that age engwirda also alone 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.239
 but at that age 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.849
 and I easy to keep up with 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.039
 and the great thing about that target group is actually a Nazi in making the 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:31.820
 flat 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.510
 is that there is a lot that can be missed as a think tank 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.210
 certain sports like now celebrates outdoor very much coming back and you really know that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.120
 paul breslin story 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.090
 and the things that can make it very clear what you can do for example 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 see back in 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.450
 inception is star 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.930
 you can say very old professional but such incidents are coming back 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.160
 so come 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.560
 apart from the fact that the old man gets in, deliciously finally says another 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.670
 so people I also have the young target says he calls and he did not get along 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730
 an uppercase letter but with a 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.060
 that short sleeve shirt that is trying to be tackled that way 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.090
 baarn is able to sell this last time in a row 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.530
 as we make it here, I think it's very cool 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.670
 all the games you like when you fall in love from vintage 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.850
 just a little boxley, therefore, gives a short and good way 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.840
 that makes me pray to be very disturbed it ad 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.010
 was also questioned 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.710
 we even closed set something like that pretty full replaces it 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.500
 became a diamond and on the other hand the stripe business and differs 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.330
 differently cut also strange with a matching 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 tie 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.790
 for example, you naturally have cash or exemption and you can do that 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.270
 You can do that in different ways 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.850
 yes 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.530
 Recently, the men's store that owns his home needs five points 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.740
 caught and runs what he did then he went so actually separate one 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.920
 process 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.259
 who did not just see jacket and that there was then the service that the margin if you 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:01.789
 heard 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:02.880
 those errors that on 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.250
 and a scarf upon entering it should stay ahead of those grants 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.780
 robbed 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.229
 like the round neck 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.109
 and then ask the combination that you are currently seeing 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.549
 each be made 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.949
 with it depends think i just like dropped you see things like this 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:17.749
 Now you see that we have a rate 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.119
 Twenty have performed the point in the second round 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.769
 with the booty was from the woman 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.839
 This can also be the largest voters associated with no scarf or fuss 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:30.279
 and ask that would have been busy recently 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.069
 that for the men easier off for the women 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.699
 the band the the pond this has on the five best for the men 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.019
 if it knows the same cascais it is license free 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.519
 In short, the Houthis were unable to keep up with the path 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:46.919
 I have to have a good party 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.869
 the wind director and that is his brain 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.149
 5b is visible at 7 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:57.109
 yes I will always look for summer that has come out of the brackish 10th point 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.979
 and that is also the way how dirt struck 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.149
 yes the store actually 4 what is the ultimate 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.869
 basic for that man 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:07.289
 Women can find it harder story 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:08.640
 Which 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.970
 Boekel technicians come in with already on YouTube who have already led the booklets 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.089
 until September it's going to be that way 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:16.459
 so there you have 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.539
 two types of consumers have their own neighborhood of Slotervaart, which is wild 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:21.809
 and how it should be 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:25.639
 and if you do not have it, they are also outside and definitely not trying 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:26.949
 against eleven football 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.039
 they do not want that, which is also one of the main reasons why we 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.980
 represent in the foreground starting falls mirrors in the fitting rooms 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:34.609
 to have 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.439
 a large group of women who look much more expensive for beautiful 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.559
 And in addition you have the group I have very often 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.559
 and before that experience the bare feet of the loot contact particles 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:50.479
 he tried to do through vom presentations and just too many 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:53.039
 if the need is for it is once 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.459
 yes to provide information or 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.549
 six was to make it is possible
