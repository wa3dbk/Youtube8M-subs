get it will rebuild everything with the
steel<00:00:43.350> barriers<00:00:43.860> instead<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
steel barriers instead of just the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
really really quickly and the effect is

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.060 
really really quickly and the effect is
only<00:00:56.399> lost<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.379> next<00:00:58.379> carpenter<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
only lost if the next carpenter that you

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.830

and then killers on me by the window the
effect<00:01:05.189> will<00:01:05.280> keep<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> don't

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
effect will keep going but if you don't

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.880 
effect will keep going but if you don't
kill<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> zombie<00:01:06.960> when<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> carpenter

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
kill the zombie when you get a carpenter

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.070 
kill the zombie when you get a carpenter
then<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.939> next<00:01:09.090> time<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.450> get<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> carpenter

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
then the next time you get a carpenter

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.770 
then the next time you get a carpenter
it<00:01:10.229> won't<00:01:10.439> happen<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.150> an<00:01:12.150> easy<00:01:12.270> way<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> get

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
it won't happen and an easy way to get

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.320 
it won't happen and an easy way to get
this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.950> simply<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> defensive

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
this is to simply just have a defensive

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.240 
this is to simply just have a defensive
strategy<00:01:15.540> where<00:01:15.990> there's<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.200> window<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> cover

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
strategy where there's a window to cover

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.490 
strategy where there's a window to cover
behind<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> navcard<00:01:18.810> area<00:01:19.259> in

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
behind you like in the navcard area in

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.090 
behind you like in the navcard area in
die<00:01:20.189> rise<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.930> gotta<00:01:22.080> hold<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
die rise and you just gotta hold on to a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.859 
die rise and you just gotta hold on to a
carpenter<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> gets<00:01:24.119> dropped<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> then

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
carpenter if it gets dropped and then

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.230 
carpenter if it gets dropped and then
just<00:01:25.170> wait<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> zombie<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.159> by<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> window

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
just wait for a zombie to be by a window

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
just wait for a zombie to be by a window
and<00:01:27.570> then<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.900> shoot<00:01:28.110> him<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.439> soon<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and then just shoot him as soon as you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
and then just shoot him as soon as you
pick<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.880> I'll<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.030> get

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
pick it up and then that I'll just get

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.450 
pick it up and then that I'll just get
you<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:30.990> easily<00:01:31.530> although<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you it really really easily although it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.550 
you it really really easily although it
can<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.090> tricky<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:33.780> situations

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
can be kind of tricky in some situations

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.370 
can be kind of tricky in some situations
but<00:01:35.299> usually<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.479> pretty<00:01:36.720> easy<00:01:36.840> again<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
but usually it's pretty easy again and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
but usually it's pretty easy again and
it's<00:01:37.470> pretty<00:01:37.650> simple<00:01:40.939> now<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.000> next<00:01:42.119> thing

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it's pretty simple now the next thing

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.999 
it's pretty simple now the next thing
that<00:01:42.509> I'm<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.930> show<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.500> steel

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that I'm going to show you is the steel

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.010 
that I'm going to show you is the steel
boards<00:01:44.369> power<00:01:44.640> up<00:01:44.939> where<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.270> rebuild<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
boards power up where you rebuild the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.170 
boards power up where you rebuild the
barriers<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.619> steel<00:01:47.009> boards<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.030> easy

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
barriers with steel boards and it's easy

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.330 
barriers with steel boards and it's easy
to<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.840> does<00:01:49.020> take<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.320> very<00:01:49.890> long<00:01:50.100> time

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
to get but it does take a very long time

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.969 
to get but it does take a very long time
much<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.060> my<00:01:51.210> dismay<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.840> took<00:01:52.020> many<00:01:52.770> many

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
much to my dismay it took many many

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.740 
much to my dismay it took many many
window<00:01:53.369> boards<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.820> fixing<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.180> actually<00:01:54.600> get

window boards are fixing to actually get
this<00:01:54.899> footage<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:56.130> they<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
this footage of it and all they have to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.340 
this footage of it and all they have to
do<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:56.850> fix<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> windows<00:01:57.659> until<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.140> get

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
do is just fix the windows until you get

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
do is just fix the windows until you get
it<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.710> only<00:01:59.520> last<00:01:59.790> for<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.000> short<00:02:00.030> while<00:02:00.450> it's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it and only last for a short while it's

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.800 
it and only last for a short while it's
some<00:02:01.590> time<00:02:01.829> less<00:02:02.130> than<00:02:02.159> five<00:02:02.579> minutes<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.119> game

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
some time less than five minutes of game

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.719 
some time less than five minutes of game
time<00:02:03.840> because<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.799> quit<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> game<00:02:05.460> and

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
time because you can quit the game and

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.069 
time because you can quit the game and
then<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:05.969> into<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.180> different<00:02:06.329> map<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:06.990> will

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
then go into a different map and it will

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.450 
then go into a different map and it will
still<00:02:07.290> carry<00:02:07.530> over

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
still carry over

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.910 
still carry over
because<00:02:09.360> after<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:09.660> got<00:02:09.900> the<00:02:10.200> power<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.740> this

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
because after I got the power up this

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.370 
because after I got the power up this
game<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.460> this<00:02:11.550> game<00:02:11.640> play<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.420> only<00:02:13.080> repaired

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
game in this game play I only repaired

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.800 
game in this game play I only repaired
about<00:02:13.560> two<00:02:13.770> boards<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.520> then<00:02:14.730> when<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> started

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
about two boards and then when I started

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.720 
about two boards and then when I started
repairing<00:02:16.200> stuff<00:02:16.470> five<00:02:16.830> minutes<00:02:17.070> later<00:02:17.310> it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
repairing stuff five minutes later it

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.610 
repairing stuff five minutes later it
was<00:02:18.090> back<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> old<00:02:18.690> regular<00:02:19.200> wooden

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
was back to the old regular wooden

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.890 
was back to the old regular wooden
boards<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.850> best<00:02:21.030> way<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.180> get<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.600> one

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
boards and the best way to get this one

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.190 
boards and the best way to get this one
is<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.820> either<00:02:23.820> go<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.270> transit<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.900> then

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
is to either go on to transit and then

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.900 
is to either go on to transit and then
go<00:02:25.590> into<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.920> bus<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.460> just<00:02:26.490> let<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.880> zombies

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
go into the bus and just let the zombies

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.790 
go into the bus and just let the zombies
take<00:02:27.420> down<00:02:27.630> all<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.840> windows<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.380> then<00:02:28.650> just

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
every time he attacks through the boards

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.520 
every time he attacks through the boards
he<00:02:58.980> only<00:02:59.100> attacks<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.490> twice<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.260> he<00:03:01.260> doesn't

and then you just got an infinite supply
boards<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.690> that's<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.020> two<00:03:10.170> window<00:03:10.740> related

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
boards so that's the two window related

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.000 
boards so that's the two window related
power-ups<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.900> can<00:03:13.110> get<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.500> zombies
