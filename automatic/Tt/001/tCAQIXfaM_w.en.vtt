buddy<00:00:00.269> if<00:00:00.570> we<00:00:00.750> had<00:00:00.960> ice<00:00:01.230> dams<00:00:01.589> last<00:00:02.250> winter<00:00:02.810> I

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
buddy if we had ice dams last winter I

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.210 
buddy if we had ice dams last winter I
know<00:00:04.410> that<00:00:04.890> ice<00:00:05.190> dams<00:00:05.460> can<00:00:05.700> be<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> symptom<00:00:06.299> of

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
know that ice dams can be a symptom of

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.520 
know that ice dams can be a symptom of
air<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.670> air<00:00:09.000> leaks<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:10.110> need<00:00:10.320> for

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
air of air leaks and a need for

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.820 
air of air leaks and a need for
insulation<00:00:11.990> specifically<00:00:12.990> in<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.320> knee<00:00:13.559> wall

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830

attic what would you recommend is the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.890 
attic what would you recommend is the
approach<00:00:16.279> to<00:00:17.279> address<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.940> conditions<00:00:18.539> that

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
approach to address the conditions that

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.240 
approach to address the conditions that
might<00:00:19.770> have<00:00:19.949> led<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> ice<00:00:20.760> dams<00:00:22.070> actually<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
might have led to ice dams actually I

might have led to ice dams actually I
scams<00:00:23.670> are<00:00:25.010> ice<00:00:26.010> dams<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.609> usually<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> symptom

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
scams are ice dams are usually a symptom

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.950 
scams are ice dams are usually a symptom
of<00:00:27.630> inadequate<00:00:28.500> attic<00:00:28.890> ventilation<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
of inadequate attic ventilation so you

from there not from the knee wall well
then<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.820> should<00:00:54.059> insulate<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.600> because

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
then you should insulate it because

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.840 
then you should insulate it because
what's<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> sounds<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.610> on

what's what it sounds like is going on

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.709 
what's what it sounds like is going on
without<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.510> insulation<00:00:58.170> heat<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.719> escaping

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
without the insulation heat is escaping

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
is there any do you know if there's any

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.450 
is there any do you know if there's any
installation<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.530> rest<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> roof<00:01:11.280> up

there<00:01:13.310> what's<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.780> see<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:16.020> happens<00:01:16.380> is

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
there what's that see what happens is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.800 
there what's that see what happens is
the<00:01:16.710> snow<00:01:17.040> melts<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> snow<00:01:18.150> accumulates

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the snow melts or the snow accumulates

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.990 
the snow melts or the snow accumulates
on<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> roof<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.860> escaping<00:01:20.490> heat<00:01:20.670> from<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
on the roof the escaping heat from the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.020 
on the roof the escaping heat from the
house<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:21.780> blocked<00:01:22.110> by<00:01:22.259> insulation

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
house if it's not blocked by insulation

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
house if it's not blocked by insulation
the<00:01:24.030> escaping<00:01:24.840> heap<00:01:25.049> causes<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> snow<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the escaping heap causes the snow to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.840 
the escaping heap causes the snow to
melt<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:27.299> runs<00:01:27.750> down<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.320> roof<00:01:28.560> until<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
melt that runs down the roof until it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.240 
melt that runs down the roof until it
gets<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.689> overhang<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
gets to the overhang if you have one and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.030 
gets to the overhang if you have one and
that's<00:01:32.460> an<00:01:32.610> even<00:01:32.759> that's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.240> cold<00:01:33.509> spot<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that's an even that's a cold spot so the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.789 
that's an even that's a cold spot so the
water<00:01:35.280> freezes<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.290> cycle

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
water freezes there and then that cycle

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.039 
water freezes there and then that cycle
continues<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> water<00:01:38.970> starts<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> build<00:01:39.810> up

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
continues the water starts to build up

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.710 
continues the water starts to build up
so<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> first<00:01:41.220> step<00:01:41.430> would<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.790> insulate<00:01:42.420> in

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
so a first step would be to insulate in

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.910 
so a first step would be to insulate in
that<00:01:43.380> knee<00:01:43.680> wall<00:01:46.850> God<00:01:47.850> find<00:01:48.210> some<00:01:48.509> way<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
that knee wall God find some way to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.039 
that knee wall God find some way to
ventilate<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.159> attic<00:01:50.549> too<00:01:50.790> because<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
ventilate that attic too because the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.100 
ventilate that attic too because the
solution<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> having<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.909> warm<00:01:54.450> floor<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
solution is having a warm floor but a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.530 
solution is having a warm floor but a
cold<00:01:55.470> roof<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.399> roof<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.759> cold<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> snows

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
cold roof if the roof is cold the snows

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.499 
cold roof if the roof is cold the snows
not<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> melt<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.590> like<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.509> could

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
not going to melt on it like that could

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.289 
not going to melt on it like that could
you<00:02:00.630> follow<00:02:00.810> me<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.399> Yeah<00:02:02.399> right<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
you follow me on that Yeah right you

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.149 
you follow me on that Yeah right you
know<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:03.420> would<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.780> ventilate<00:02:04.140> under<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
know what would you ventilate under the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.570 
know what would you ventilate under the
soffit<00:02:05.640> or<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.299> answer

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
soffit or the answer

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.520 
soffit or the answer
the<00:02:08.580> ideal<00:02:09.030> attic<00:02:09.570> insulation<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the ideal attic insulation is a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.180 
the ideal attic insulation is a
combination<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.460> soffit<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.060> ridge<00:02:12.420> vents

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
combination of soffit and ridge vents

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.980 
combination of soffit and ridge vents
not<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.370> houses<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:15.090> accommodate<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:17.990> if

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
not all houses can accommodate that if

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.450 
not all houses can accommodate that if
you<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.350> soffit<00:02:19.860> vent<00:02:20.040> you've<00:02:20.190> got<00:02:20.340> to

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
you have a soffit vent you've got to
