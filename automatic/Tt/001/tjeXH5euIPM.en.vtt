00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.140
 I have a fantastic new game very well 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.210
 I'll explain to you, you blindfold me 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.550
 this and then I walk through the house and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.920
 I tried to guess where I am 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:45.090
 playing very well here I'm so 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.000
 exciting that you do not tell me not me 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.460
 you say 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.460
 I'm in the room what fun 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:13.520
 round and smooth and you are the soup 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.520
 let's go somewhere else 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.200
 forgive excuse me 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.200
 I'm sorry better let's go somewhere else 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.399
 I'm very well in the hall 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.870
 the hall seems much bigger 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:38.400
 when blindfolded 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.400
 and I must be coming to the end 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.969
 what is this a door so now 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.569
 I must be coming out of the hall and I'm 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:52.319
 entering another room but what 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.319
 exciting 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.530
 but not anymore 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.930
 you dropped something wine I wonder what 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.630
 fourth is if they come to a measure wine 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.680
 maybe it's the kitchen 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.680
 there's no need to 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.909
 it does not feel so soft 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.210
 there is not but it smells like a dirty rag 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.210
 not because you can be 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.510
 I know that's the towel so I'm in the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.900
 I am very good and this must be the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.900
 shelf 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.350

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.790

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:03.490
 I'm not sure about this in your wet 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:06.600

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.490
