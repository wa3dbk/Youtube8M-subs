00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
see it is this is how you would put the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.360 
see it is this is how you would put the
items<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> crafting<00:00:39.930> bench<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.500> then<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
items in the crafting bench and then it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.290 
items in the crafting bench and then it
would<00:00:41.489> create<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.960> first<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
would create the first one the

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.540 
would create the first one the
reinforced<00:00:45.300> bow<00:00:45.770> basically<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.980> reinforced

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
reinforced bow basically the reinforced

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.029 
reinforced bow basically the reinforced
both<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.020> 31st<00:00:49.610> bows<00:00:50.780> basically<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.680> does

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
both the 31st bows basically all it does

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.340 
both the 31st bows basically all it does
change<00:00:53.520> wise<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.289> a<00:00:55.289> distance<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.780> power<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
change wise is a distance and power and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.189 
change wise is a distance and power and
I<00:00:58.559> guess<00:00:58.800> speed<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.309> well<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.660> reinforced

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
I guess speed as well but the reinforced

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.119 
I guess speed as well but the reinforced
bow<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:02.010> goes<00:01:02.250> pretty<00:01:02.430> far<00:01:03.830> it<00:01:04.830> goes<00:01:04.979> pretty

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
bow it goes pretty far it goes pretty

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.000 
bow it goes pretty far it goes pretty
far<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.760> damage<00:01:06.150> i'm<00:01:06.360> pretty<00:01:06.600> sure<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.500> almost

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
far the damage i'm pretty sure is almost

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.230 
far the damage i'm pretty sure is almost
doubled<00:01:08.760> than<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.840> regular<00:01:10.770> bow<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.970> next

bow<00:01:44.689> breaks<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.960> lot<00:01:46.140> faster<00:01:46.320> than<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
bow breaks a lot faster than the the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.139 
bow breaks a lot faster than the the
iron<00:01:48.479> or<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> reinforced<00:01:49.680> bow<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.700> next<00:01:50.970> one<00:01:51.119> is

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
iron or a reinforced bow the next one is

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.429 
iron or a reinforced bow the next one is
the<00:01:51.450> diamond<00:01:51.869> door<00:01:52.229> crystal<00:01:52.710> bow<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:54.439> this

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the diamond door crystal bow and this

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.109 
the diamond door crystal bow and this
one<00:01:55.969> again<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:58.469> distance<00:01:59.189> speed<00:01:59.700> and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
one again it's just distance speed and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.149 
one again it's just distance speed and
damage<00:02:01.579> this<00:02:02.579> one<00:02:02.960> durability<00:02:03.960> wise<00:02:04.380> lasts<00:02:05.070> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
damage this one durability wise lasts a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.969 
damage this one durability wise lasts a
lot<00:02:05.520> longer<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.350> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.439> probably<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.770> best

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
lot longer so this is probably the best

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.949 
lot longer so this is probably the best
one<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.729> want<00:02:08.970> straight<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:10.489> damage

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
one if you just want straight up damage

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.160 
one if you just want straight up damage

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.370 
one after this is the leggy bow I never
really<00:02:16.560> knew<00:02:16.680> how<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.860> say<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:18.450> um<00:02:18.690> this

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
really knew how to say this but um this

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.229 
really knew how to say this but um this
is<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.620> pretty<00:02:19.830> cool<00:02:20.099> one<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.459> requires<00:02:20.849> two

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
is a pretty cool one this requires two

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.210 
is a pretty cool one this requires two
iron<00:02:21.480> bows<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.620> know<00:02:22.770> what's<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.040> big

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
deal but basically this bow shoots two

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.660 
deal but basically this bow shoots two
arrows<00:02:28.040> simultaneously<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.310> let<00:02:29.459> me<00:02:29.550> just

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
arrows simultaneously so let me just

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.390 
arrows simultaneously so let me just
shoot<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.020> see<00:02:31.200> two<00:02:32.010> arrows

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
shoot that as you can see two arrows

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.850 
shoot that as you can see two arrows
shot<00:02:32.790> out<00:02:32.970> simultaneously<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:34.410> distance

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
shot out simultaneously the distance

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.920 
shot out simultaneously the distance
speed<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.520> damage<00:02:35.670> are<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> same<00:02:36.510> as<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
speed and damage are the same as the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.020 
speed and damage are the same as the
regular<00:02:37.230> bow<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.250> only<00:02:38.400> difference<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.970> that

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
regular bow the only difference is that

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.680 
regular bow the only difference is that
you<00:02:39.360> shoot<00:02:39.690> two<00:02:40.050> arrows<00:02:40.800> at<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> time<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:42.450> next

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
you shoot two arrows at a time the next

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.920 
you shoot two arrows at a time the next
one<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.319> blazing<00:02:44.160> above<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.970> as<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:45.780> can

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
one is the blazing above and as you can

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
one is the blazing above and as you can
tell<00:02:46.069> this<00:02:47.069> one<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:48.180> can<00:02:48.209> well<00:02:48.959> shoot<00:02:49.440> fire

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
tell this one you can well shoot fire

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.580 
tell this one you can well shoot fire
arrows<00:02:50.489> which<00:02:51.450> i<00:02:51.569> think<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.810> pretty<00:02:52.019> cool<00:02:52.080> so

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
arrows which i think is pretty cool so

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.009 
arrows which i think is pretty cool so
you<00:02:52.650> do<00:02:53.100> get<00:02:53.280> fire<00:02:53.549> damage<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.540> next<00:02:54.840> one<00:02:54.989> and

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
you do get fire damage the next one and

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.660 
you do get fire damage the next one and
this<00:02:55.319> is<00:02:55.440> probably<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.890> my<00:02:55.980> favorite<00:02:56.459> ones

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
this is probably one of my favorite ones

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
this is probably one of my favorite ones
is<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> ender<00:02:57.630> bow<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.760> this<00:02:59.760> one<00:03:00.030> takes<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
is the ender bow and this one takes a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.400 
is the ender bow and this one takes a
little<00:03:00.870> bit<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.380> craft<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:03.360> uh<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.810> one<00:03:04.080> you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
little bit to craft but uh this one you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.890 
little bit to craft but uh this one you
would<00:03:04.560> think<00:03:04.790> you'd<00:03:05.790> be<00:03:05.940> able<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.180> teleports

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
would think you'd be able to teleports

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.729 
would think you'd be able to teleports
but<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> know<00:03:08.220> all<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.269> have<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.600> do<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:10.110> shoot

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
but I know all you have to do is shoot

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.850 
but I know all you have to do is shoot
one<00:03:11.040> arrow<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.870> wherever<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.200> arrow<00:03:13.470> lands

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
one arrow and wherever the arrow lands

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.190 
one arrow and wherever the arrow lands
is<00:03:14.220> where<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.459> huge<00:03:15.090> just<00:03:15.989> I<00:03:16.260> guess<00:03:16.860> amount<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:18.200> a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
is where a huge just I guess amount of a

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.319 
is where a huge just I guess amount of a
whole<00:03:19.980> bunch<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.250> arrows<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:20.609> rain<00:03:21.090> down

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
whole bunch of arrows just rain down

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.229 
whole bunch of arrows just rain down
from<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.660> sky<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:22.140> little<00:03:22.440> bit<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.820> then<00:03:24.209> a

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
from the sky a little bit and then a

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.930 
from the sky a little bit and then a
whole<00:03:24.510> bunch<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.769> basically<00:03:25.950> destroys

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
whole bunch so this basically destroys

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.970 
whole bunch so this basically destroys
your<00:03:27.150> enemy<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.750> one<00:03:28.140> hit<00:03:28.440> all<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.709> have<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.890> do

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
your enemy in one hit all you have to do

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.490 
your enemy in one hit all you have to do
is<00:03:29.130> basically<00:03:29.940> tag<00:03:30.450> him<00:03:30.720> with<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.079> singular

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
is basically tag him with the singular

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.240 
is basically tag him with the singular
arrow<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.160> then<00:03:32.820> he<00:03:33.480> will<00:03:33.720> be<00:03:33.870> destroyed<00:03:34.380> by<00:03:34.799> a

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
arrow and then he will be destroyed by a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.120 
arrow and then he will be destroyed by a
huge<00:03:35.880> rain<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.630> arrows<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.560> last<00:03:37.799> one<00:03:38.100> is

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
huge rain of arrows and the last one is

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.860 
huge rain of arrows and the last one is
the<00:03:38.820> frost<00:03:39.769> now<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:41.130> one<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.820> would<00:03:42.329> probably

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
the frost now this one I would probably

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.550 
the frost now this one I would probably
use<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.230> for<00:03:43.650> more<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.690> decorative<00:03:45.690> kind

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
use this for more of a decorative kind

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.099 
use this for more of a decorative kind
of<00:03:46.739> thing<00:03:46.980> maybe<00:03:47.730> if<00:03:47.910> you're<00:03:48.090> trying<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.660> make

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
of thing maybe if you're trying to make

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.710 
of thing maybe if you're trying to make
snow<00:03:49.980> floors<00:03:50.370> but<00:03:50.700> you're<00:03:50.850> nowhere<00:03:51.000> near<00:03:51.150> any

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
snow floors but you're nowhere near any

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.770 
snow floors but you're nowhere near any
like<00:03:52.200> snowy<00:03:52.769> areas<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.519> this<00:03:53.640> bow<00:03:53.910> basically

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
like snowy areas of this bow basically

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.620 
like snowy areas of this bow basically
it<00:03:55.709> has<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.100> same<00:03:56.370> damage<00:03:56.700> durability<00:03:57.329> and

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
it has the same damage durability and

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.110 
it has the same damage durability and
speed<00:03:57.989> as<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.230> regular<00:03:58.799> bow<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.489> just<00:03:59.790> spawns

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
speed as the regular bow it just spawns

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.220 
speed as the regular bow it just spawns
snow<00:04:01.220> on<00:04:02.220> basically<00:04:02.670> on<00:04:03.060> any<00:04:03.480> block<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.109> you

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
snow on basically on any block that you

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.590 
snow on basically on any block that you
