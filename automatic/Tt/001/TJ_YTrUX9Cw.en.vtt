that<00:03:15.580> I<00:03:15.910> would<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.269> probably<00:03:16.450> use<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.959> when

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
that I would just probably use it when

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.420 
that I would just probably use it when
I'm<00:03:17.260> styling<00:03:17.739> my<00:03:17.799> hair<00:03:17.830> like<00:03:18.100> if<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.250> heard<00:03:18.400> a

I'm styling my hair like if I heard a
twist<00:03:18.880> out<00:03:19.090> if<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.720> took<00:03:19.780> some<00:03:19.900> flexi<00:03:20.320> rods<00:03:20.500> if<00:03:20.799> I

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
twist out if I took some flexi rods if I

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.289 
twist out if I took some flexi rods if I
do<00:03:20.980> a<00:03:21.070> bantu<00:03:21.370> knot<00:03:21.519> because<00:03:21.850> it's<00:03:22.060> like<00:03:22.269> a

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
do a bantu knot because it's like a

lighter Jill and I think I like a more
firmer<00:03:24.190> hold<00:03:24.430> but<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.000> honestly<00:03:25.600> do<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:26.019> the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140
