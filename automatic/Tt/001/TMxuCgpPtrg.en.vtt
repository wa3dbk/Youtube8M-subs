00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.240
 There is still a song which its in different 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.490
 performers perform sasha roitman with 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.499
 which we are friends of principle he said that 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.039
 in one city somewhere somewhere in there base 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:20.440
 he sang and there this song caused just 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.750
 such an explosion an explosion of awakening 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.120
 and I would like her to show me have on 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.690
 that I am her appearance at Renault I will show her in 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.700
 minor 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.710
 it is possible that this key you more 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.600
 it will do if you ca n't perry it 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:39.210
 to transpose fucking minors as in 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:39.210
 principle and and joy yes yes yes yes 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.789
 na-nara 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.789
 I see 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.090
 sixth desert 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.540
 go 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.350
 they sing 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.010
 set 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.010
 and give 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.710
 livshitsa 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.320
 jared 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.870
 also 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.870
 perhaps 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.149
 but let us put 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.200
 even 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.130
 it is better 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.670
 already 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.240
 there 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.599
 Here is a song and of course she is biblio 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.019
 minor more convenient to play because 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:28.939
 Something is more convenient to play there. 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.939
 but this song just consists of 3 parts 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:35.560
 here besides chorus chorus there is still 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.560
 the third part of this 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.560
 This is the third part of this bridge is such a 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.800
 just for a breakthrough very well 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.160
 is used 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.160
 and the song itself is again very simple 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.080
 exactly 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.410
 the very same 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.990
 and
