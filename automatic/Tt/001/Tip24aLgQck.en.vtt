painted<00:02:55.730> engine<00:02:56.060> cover<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.299> I<00:02:56.420> kind<00:02:56.629> of<00:02:56.690> think

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
painted engine cover and I kind of think

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.589 
painted engine cover and I kind of think
the<00:02:57.049> black<00:02:58.040> manifold<00:02:58.639> is<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.819> nice<00:02:59.060> touch<00:02:59.329> man

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
the black manifold is a nice touch man

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.599 
the black manifold is a nice touch man
those<00:02:59.840> those<00:03:00.500> manifolds<00:03:01.129> are<00:03:01.220> kind<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.489> an

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
those those manifolds are kind of an

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.610 
those those manifolds are kind of an
ugly<00:03:01.909> color<00:03:02.120> when<00:03:02.389> they're<00:03:02.540> stock<00:03:02.810> man<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.349> um

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
ugly color when they're stock man so um

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.129 
ugly color when they're stock man so um
I<00:03:03.859> guess<00:03:04.519> that's<00:03:04.849> it<00:03:05.090> man<00:03:05.329> it's<00:03:05.690> your<00:03:05.810> boy<00:03:05.930> Don

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139
