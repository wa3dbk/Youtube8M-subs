00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
Vita the downside to it of course is

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.620 
Vita the downside to it of course is
that<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:44.330> appli<00:02:45.290> matil<00:02:45.890> 100<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.239> can<00:02:47.480> only

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
that the appli matil 100 so you can only

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.440 
that the appli matil 100 so you can only
really<00:02:47.780> have<00:02:48.230> 10<00:02:48.680> different<00:02:48.890> folders<00:02:49.489> with<00:02:50.180> 10

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
really have 10 different folders with 10

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.729 
really have 10 different folders with 10
different<00:02:50.600> things<00:02:50.959> inside<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.320> once<00:02:51.650> you

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
different things inside and once you

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.140 
different things inside and once you
reach<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:51.920> limit<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.459> can't<00:02:52.700> go<00:02:52.820> over<00:02:52.850> and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
reach that limit you can't go over and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.400 
reach that limit you can't go over and
used<00:02:53.300> to<00:02:53.390> delete<00:02:53.600> something<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.110> really

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
used to delete something so I really

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.690 
used to delete something so I really
thought<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:54.650> was<00:02:54.800> going<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.010> help<00:02:55.100> us<00:02:55.250> exceed

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
thought this was going to help us exceed

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.850 
thought this was going to help us exceed
that<00:02:55.880> limit<00:02:55.940> but<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:56.989> doesn't<00:02:57.290> which<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.560> kind

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
that limit but it doesn't which is kind

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.550 
that limit but it doesn't which is kind
of<00:02:57.920> pain<00:02:58.510> that's<00:02:59.510> okay<00:02:59.780> so<00:02:59.840> maybe<00:03:00.260> hopefully

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
of pain that's okay so maybe hopefully

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.050 
of pain that's okay so maybe hopefully
they'll<00:03:00.860> they'll<00:03:01.250> get<00:03:01.520> on<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.760> at<00:03:01.910> some

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
they'll they'll get on that at some

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.920 
they'll they'll get on that at some
point<00:03:02.500> now<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.830> next<00:03:04.070> thing<00:03:04.489> they<00:03:04.880> added<00:03:05.239> was

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930

all<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:58.810> basic<00:05:59.080> updates<00:05:59.410> I<00:06:00.180> think<00:06:01.180> that<00:06:01.390> this

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
all the basic updates I think that this

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.240 
all the basic updates I think that this
is<00:06:01.750> probably<00:06:02.200> the<00:06:02.530> most<00:06:02.590> substantial<00:06:02.860> upgrade

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
is probably the most substantial upgrade

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.140 
is probably the most substantial upgrade
update<00:06:04.210> that<00:06:04.330> we've<00:06:04.450> had<00:06:04.570> since<00:06:04.710> 2.0<00:06:05.710> or<00:06:05.770> 1.8<00:06:06.430> I

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
update that we've had since 2.0 or 1.8 I

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.940 
update that we've had since 2.0 or 1.8 I
didn't<00:06:07.720> add<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:07.900> whole<00:06:08.260> lot<00:06:08.500> but<00:06:08.680> the<00:06:08.770> stuff

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
didn't add a whole lot but the stuff

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.260 
didn't add a whole lot but the stuff
they<00:06:09.070> added<00:06:09.340> it<00:06:09.430> was<00:06:09.550> quality<00:06:10.000> and<00:06:10.090> especially

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
they added it was quality and especially

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.779 
they added it was quality and especially
the<00:06:10.479> folders<00:06:10.810> I<00:06:10.960> you<00:06:11.169> know<00:06:11.430> it<00:06:12.430> was<00:06:12.610> really

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
the folders I you know it was really

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.590 
the folders I you know it was really
people<00:06:13.510> have<00:06:13.600> been<00:06:13.720> asking<00:06:13.840> for<00:06:14.229> this

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
people have been asking for this

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.270 
people have been asking for this
since<00:06:16.240> since<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.390> days<00:06:17.540> when<00:06:18.320> 3d<00:06:18.770> Escott<00:06:19.130> then

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
since since the days when 3d Escott then

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.650 
since since the days when 3d Escott then
I<00:06:19.340> think<00:06:19.550> as<00:06:19.670> a<00:06:19.700> big<00:06:20.030> addition<00:06:20.270> for<00:06:20.540> three

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
I think as a big addition for three

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.910 
I think as a big addition for three
years<00:06:20.870> and<00:06:20.900> I<00:06:21.110> like<00:06:21.290> the<00:06:21.440> way<00:06:21.560> I<00:06:21.590> like<00:06:21.800> the

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
years and I like the way I like the

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.360 
years and I like the way I like the
immediacy<00:06:22.400> and<00:06:22.610> how<00:06:22.850> fast<00:06:23.750> it<00:06:23.990> pops<00:06:24.380> up<00:06:24.590> here

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
immediacy and how fast it pops up here

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.200 
immediacy and how fast it pops up here
of<00:06:25.750> inside<00:06:26.750> on<00:06:27.410> the<00:06:28.250> Vita<00:06:28.430> is<00:06:28.550> this<00:06:28.730> nice<00:06:29.000> and
