very<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.009> being<00:01:59.280> here<00:01:59.430> no<00:01:59.640> audience<00:02:00.240> is

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
very much for being here no audience is

very much for being here no audience is
going<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.659> win<00:02:00.780> we're<00:02:00.930> talking<00:02:01.200> about<00:02:01.290> this

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
going to win we're talking about this

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.399 
going to win we're talking about this
question<00:02:02.549> Mike<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.299> question<00:02:03.420> no<00:02:04.079> am

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
question Mike out of the question no am

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.150 
question Mike out of the question no am
I<00:02:04.590> my<00:02:05.040> contention<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.969> there's<00:02:06.210> as<00:02:06.509> many<00:02:06.659> as

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
I my contention is there's as many as

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.609 
I my contention is there's as many as
10,000<00:02:08.160> 12,000<00:02:09.030> pieces<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.869> junk<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.560> there

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
10,000 12,000 pieces of junk up there

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.200 
10,000 12,000 pieces of junk up there
floating<00:02:11.190> around<00:02:11.280> you're<00:02:11.550> going<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:11.879> some

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
floating around you're going to see some

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.630 
floating around you're going to see some
it<00:02:12.390> that's<00:02:13.320> right<00:02:13.500> Mike<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.280> probably

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
it that's right Mike and and probably

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.560 
it that's right Mike and and probably
the<00:02:14.730> biggest<00:02:14.880> thing<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.420> worry

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
the biggest thing you have to worry

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.150 
the biggest thing you have to worry
about<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.990> it<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.290> same<00:02:16.500> orbit<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.890> with

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
about is it in the same orbit is with

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.590 
about is it in the same orbit is with
you<00:02:17.340> or<00:02:17.520> some<00:02:17.730> other<00:02:17.850> orbit<00:02:18.210> if<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
you or some other orbit if it's in the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.970 
you or some other orbit if it's in the
same<00:02:18.780> orbit<00:02:19.080> it's<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.320> as<00:02:19.440> dangerous<00:02:19.620> because

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
same orbit it's not as dangerous because

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.430 
same orbit it's not as dangerous because
not<00:02:20.250> going<00:02:20.460> as<00:02:20.580> fast<00:02:20.820> it's<00:02:21.540> another<00:02:21.750> orbit<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
not going as fast it's another orbit and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.080 
not going as fast it's another orbit and
hiss<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.190> would<00:02:23.310> say<00:02:23.490> twice<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> speed

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
hiss you would say twice the speed

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.090 
hiss you would say twice the speed
you're<00:02:24.240> going<00:02:24.300> at<00:02:24.660> say<00:02:24.840> 35,000<00:02:25.680> miles<00:02:25.800> an<00:02:25.980> hour

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
you're going at say 35,000 miles an hour

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.100 
you're going at say 35,000 miles an hour
because<00:02:26.820> serious<00:02:27.210> damage<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.630> shuttle<00:02:27.930> so

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
because serious damage the shuttle so

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.500 
because serious damage the shuttle so
what<00:02:28.620> look<00:02:29.460> at<00:02:29.550> these<00:02:29.670> things<00:02:29.910> possibly<00:02:30.270> be<00:02:30.480> I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
what look at these things possibly be I

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.880 
what look at these things possibly be I
mean<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.750> lot<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.170> people<00:02:31.410> are<00:02:31.500> writing<00:02:31.770> in

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
mean a lot of people are writing in

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.250 
mean a lot of people are writing in
saying<00:02:32.480> satellites<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.690> often<00:02:34.050> they<00:02:34.140> be

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
saying satellites is often they be

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.230 
saying satellites is often they be
satellite<00:02:34.740> pieces<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.310> satellite<00:02:35.760> well

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
satellite pieces of satellite well

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.520 
satellite pieces of satellite well
they're<00:02:36.390> unlikely<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:36.960> off<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> satellite

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
they're unlikely to be off a satellite

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.620 
they're unlikely to be off a satellite
because<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.280> fact<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.880> they're<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
because the fact that the they're in the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.790 
because the fact that the they're in the
same<00:02:39.810> orbit<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.350> shuttle<00:02:40.680> they're

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
same orbit as the shuttle they're

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.680 
same orbit as the shuttle they're
floating<00:02:41.040> along<00:02:41.310> with<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.610> orbital<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.390> more

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
floating along with the orbital so more

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.970 
floating along with the orbital so more
likely<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.230> something<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.680> was<00:02:43.830> maybe

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
likely is something that was maybe

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.860 
likely is something that was maybe
dropped<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.610> payload<00:02:44.940> Bay<00:02:45.090> during<00:02:45.690> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
dropped in the payload Bay during the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.870 
dropped in the payload Bay during the
servicing<00:02:46.380> in<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.530> shuttle<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:46.950> during<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
servicing in the shuttle and during the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.580 
servicing in the shuttle and during the
thruster<00:02:48.240> firings<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.960> flight<00:02:49.260> control

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
thruster firings and the flight control

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.140 
thruster firings and the flight control
checks<00:02:49.860> yesterday<00:02:50.070> they<00:02:50.490> floated<00:02:50.820> up<00:02:50.970> out<00:02:51.120> of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
checks yesterday they floated up out of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.000 
checks yesterday they floated up out of
the<00:02:51.270> bay<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.570> just<00:02:51.750> start<00:02:51.930> up<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.050> lot<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.800> don't

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
the bay and just start up a lot I don't

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.440 
the bay and just start up a lot I don't
recall<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.460> I<00:02:53.550> don't<00:02:53.760> recall<00:02:53.880> seeing<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.300> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
recall it I don't recall seeing this and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.610 
recall it I don't recall seeing this and
recent<00:02:54.780> missions<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.320> something<00:02:55.590> that

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
recent missions is this something that

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.530 
recent missions is this something that
happens<00:02:56.010> frequently<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.490> it's<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.820> not

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
happens frequently and it's just not

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.660 
happens frequently and it's just not
occasionally<00:02:58.470> I'm<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.830> my<00:02:59.010> second<00:02:59.430> mission

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
occasionally I'm on my second mission

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.710 
occasionally I'm on my second mission
which<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.880> the<00:02:59.940> first<00:03:00.120> flight<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.420> Endeavour

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
which is the first flight of Endeavour

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.870 
which is the first flight of Endeavour
one<00:03:00.960> of<00:03:01.050> these<00:03:01.170> floated<00:03:01.590> up<00:03:01.680> about<00:03:02.460> four<00:03:02.760> hours

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
one of these floated up about four hours

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.970 
one of these floated up about four hours
after<00:03:03.420> we<00:03:03.930> opened<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.560> pale<00:03:04.680> I've<00:03:04.800> been

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
after we opened the pale I've been

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.160 
after we opened the pale I've been
looking<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.430> house<00:03:06.330> an<00:03:06.480> Allen<00:03:06.780> wrench<00:03:06.810> I

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
looking for that house an Allen wrench I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.720 
looking for that house an Allen wrench I
wondered<00:03:07.620> who<00:03:07.710> watch<00:03:07.920> them<00:03:08.160> yeah<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.310> was<00:03:08.490> hey

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
wondered who watch them yeah I was hey

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640 
wondered who watch them yeah I was hey
we're<00:03:09.480> going<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.630> my<00:03:09.720> tail<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.200> there's<00:03:10.530> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
we're going to my tail is it there's a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.960 
we're going to my tail is it there's a
big<00:03:10.770> fine<00:03:11.070> for<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.430> when<00:03:11.580> you<00:03:11.640> lose<00:03:11.790> these

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
big fine for that when you lose these

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.480 
big fine for that when you lose these
things<00:03:12.180> aboard<00:03:12.390> spacecraft<00:03:12.690> huh<00:03:13.310> was<00:03:14.310> that

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
things aboard spacecraft huh was that

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.300 
things aboard spacecraft huh was that
yours<00:03:14.930> no<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.410> was<00:03:16.560> actually<00:03:16.740> dropped<00:03:17.130> by<00:03:17.280> a

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
yours no it was actually dropped by a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.740 
yours no it was actually dropped by a
worker<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.700> think<00:03:17.940> when<00:03:18.060> they're<00:03:18.150> constructing

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
worker I think when they're constructing

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.930 
worker I think when they're constructing
the<00:03:18.980> especially<00:03:19.980> well<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.220> these<00:03:20.460> things<00:03:20.730> but

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
the especially well for these things but

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.190 
the especially well for these things but
they<00:03:21.060> can't<00:03:21.270> find<00:03:21.510> them<00:03:21.600> sometimes<00:03:21.960> and<00:03:22.080> they

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
they can't find them sometimes and they

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.140 
they can't find them sometimes and they
just<00:03:22.350> happen<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.680> float<00:03:22.890> up<00:03:23.040> well<00:03:23.790> that's<00:03:24.030> like

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
just happen to float up well that's like

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.250 
just happen to float up well that's like
leaving<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.510> knife<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.960> then<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.170> know

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
leaving the knife and then you know

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.010 
leaving the knife and then you know
insertion<00:03:25.710> in<00:03:26.400> someones<00:03:26.700> belly<00:03:26.970> that's<00:03:27.840> not

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
insertion in someones belly that's not

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.100 
insertion in someones belly that's not
good<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.860> should<00:03:29.790> we<00:03:29.820> be<00:03:30.150> concerned<00:03:30.180> at<00:03:30.600> 641

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
good so should we be concerned at 641

they've done what they need to do they
did<00:03:39.960> an<00:03:40.050> inspection<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.680> orbiter<00:03:41.010> both

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
did an inspection of the orbiter both

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.580 
did an inspection of the orbiter both
the<00:03:41.670> underside<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.330> in<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.510> payload<00:03:42.840> Bay<00:03:43.050> the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
the underside and in the payload Bay the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.750 
the underside and in the payload Bay the
two<00:03:43.920> things<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.220> have<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.370> be<00:03:44.460> concerned

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
two things you have to be concerned

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.820 
two things you have to be concerned
about<00:03:44.880> again<00:03:45.270> are<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.480> high-speed<00:03:46.020> impacts

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
about again are the high-speed impacts

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.020 
about again are the high-speed impacts
which<00:03:47.040> doesn't<00:03:47.430> look<00:03:47.520> like<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.790> would<00:03:47.910> be<00:03:48.000> a

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
which doesn't look like that would be a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.940 
which doesn't look like that would be a
problem<00:03:48.300> right<00:03:48.480> now<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:49.200> second<00:03:49.590> thing<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.830> it

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
problem right now the second thing is it

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.500 
problem right now the second thing is it
is<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.070> piece<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.370> order<00:03:50.790> that's<00:03:51.060> critical

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
is a piece of order that's critical

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.720 
is a piece of order that's critical
hardware<00:03:51.900> that<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.560> need<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:52.950> operate<00:03:53.100> say

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
hardware that you need to operate say

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.980 
hardware that you need to operate say
the<00:03:53.850> payload<00:03:54.180> bay<00:03:54.270> doors<00:03:54.300> going<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.870> latch

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
the payload bay doors going to latch

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.780 
the payload bay doors going to latch
them<00:03:55.200> down<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.440> seriously<00:03:56.040> doubt<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.310> okay<00:03:56.730> so

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
them down I seriously doubt that okay so

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.730 
them down I seriously doubt that okay so
the<00:03:57.780> thing<00:03:57.960> is<00:03:57.990> they're<00:03:58.230> not<00:03:58.380> going<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.530> stop

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
the thing is they're not going to stop

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.110 
the thing is they're not going to stop
trying<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.040> figure<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.340> out<00:03:59.550> once<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.970> order

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
trying to figure this out once the order

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.490 
trying to figure this out once the order
land<00:04:00.450> y'all<00:04:00.690> going<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.840> come<00:04:01.110> back<00:04:01.260> and

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
land y'all going to come back and

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.870 
land y'all going to come back and
they'll<00:04:01.650> try<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:01.860> figure<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.220> out<00:04:02.280> up<00:04:02.610> here<00:04:02.670> I

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
they'll try to figure it out up here I

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.250 
they'll try to figure it out up here I
want<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.180> jump<00:04:03.300> in<00:04:03.450> because<00:04:03.510> Julia<00:04:03.870> at<00:04:04.230> a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
want to jump in because Julia at a

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.870 
want to jump in because Julia at a
better<00:04:04.470> question<00:04:04.890> but<00:04:05.010> I<00:04:05.040> want<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.580> jump<00:04:05.730> in

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
better question but I want to jump in

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.120 
better question but I want to jump in
here<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.540> okay<00:04:06.720> let's<00:04:06.960> do<00:04:07.440> if<00:04:07.800> there<00:04:08.010> was

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
here so okay let's do if there was

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.910 
here so okay let's do if there was
trouble<00:04:08.690> could<00:04:09.690> Atlantis<00:04:10.290> get<00:04:10.500> back<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.830> the

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
trouble could Atlantis get back to the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.770 
trouble could Atlantis get back to the
space<00:04:11.160> station<00:04:11.310> do<00:04:12.240> they<00:04:12.330> have<00:04:12.420> enough<00:04:12.510> fuel

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
space station do they have enough fuel

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.020 
space station do they have enough fuel
to<00:04:12.870> do<00:04:13.110> that<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.590> if<00:04:13.770> they<00:04:13.890> do<00:04:13.950> the<00:04:14.370> soy<00:04:14.610> is<00:04:14.820> is

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
to do that and if they do the soy is is

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.810 
to do that and if they do the soy is is
already<00:04:15.270> in<00:04:15.360> their<00:04:15.480> parking<00:04:15.720> spot<00:04:16.140> who<00:04:16.950> would

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
already in their parking spot who would

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.890 
already in their parking spot who would
they<00:04:17.910> have<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.120> back<00:04:18.270> out<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.510> get<00:04:18.660> out<00:04:18.720> of

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
they have to back out and get out of

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.539 
they have to back out and get out of
there<00:04:19.020> well<00:04:19.560> they're<00:04:19.920> probably<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.280> bit<00:04:20.430> about

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
there well they're probably a bit about

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.190 
there well they're probably a bit about
debate<00:04:20.880> what<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.180> do<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.419> early<00:04:21.780> you're<00:04:21.930> on<00:04:22.080> a

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
debate what to do this early you're on a

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.560 
debate what to do this early you're on a
fuel<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.669> Sawyer's<00:04:24.030> may<00:04:24.180> have<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.419> go<00:04:24.510> to

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
fuel and the Sawyer's may have to go to

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.960 
fuel and the Sawyer's may have to go to
the

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
the

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.190 
the
important<00:04:25.390> they<00:04:25.450> might<00:04:25.600> just<00:04:25.720> have<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:26.050> have

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
important they might just have to have

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.840 
important they might just have to have
the<00:04:26.230> soya<00:04:26.530> strong<00:04:26.890> as<00:04:27.010> more<00:04:27.190> than<00:04:27.310> one<00:04:27.460> docking

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
the soya strong as more than one docking

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.030 
the soya strong as more than one docking
port<00:04:28.090> on<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.510> station<00:04:28.840> there's<00:04:29.710> more<00:04:29.890> than

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
port on the station there's more than

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.270 
port on the station there's more than
one<00:04:30.220> but<00:04:30.400> they<00:04:30.520> might<00:04:30.690> position<00:04:31.690> with<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:32.280> all

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
one but they might position with it all

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.490 
one but they might position with it all
that<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:34.690> you're<00:04:34.840> not<00:04:34.960> concerned<00:04:35.110> at<00:04:35.440> all

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
that so you're not concerned at all

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.780 
that so you're not concerned at all
about<00:04:35.560> reentry<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.250> think<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.490> is<00:04:36.610> going<00:04:36.700> to

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
about reentry you think this is going to

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.940 
about reentry you think this is going to
be<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:36.880> smooth<00:04:37.170> yeah<00:04:38.170> there<00:04:38.440> will<00:04:38.500> be<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.680> smooth

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
be a smooth yeah there will be a smooth
