how does a pressure cooker work the

cook things in no time one of the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.580 
cook things in no time one of the
reasons<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.879> use<00:00:38.910> water<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.750> cook<00:00:39.989> food<00:00:40.320> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
reasons we use water to cook food is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.100 
reasons we use water to cook food is
because<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> better<00:00:42.000> conductor<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.750> heat

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
because it is a better conductor of heat

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.920 
because it is a better conductor of heat
than<00:00:43.530> air<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.239> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.420> raise<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
than air is you can raise the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
than air is you can raise the
temperature<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> water<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.340> transfer<00:00:47.910> its

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
temperature of water to transfer its

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.170 
temperature of water to transfer its
energy<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> water<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.649> food<00:00:50.180> basically

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
energy to the water in food basically

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.889 
energy to the water in food basically
cooking<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:52.820> pressure<00:00:53.820> cooker<00:00:54.090> increases

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
cooking it a pressure cooker increases

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.810 
cooking it a pressure cooker increases
the<00:00:55.020> pressure<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> water<00:00:56.309> will<00:00:56.579> come

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the pressure so that the water will come

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.849 
the pressure so that the water will come
to<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> boil<00:00:57.390> higher<00:00:57.960> than<00:00:58.289> its<00:00:58.440> regular

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
to a boil higher than its regular

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.889 
to a boil higher than its regular
boiling<00:00:59.280> point<00:00:59.550> which<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.149> 100<00:01:00.570> degree

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
boiling point which is 100 degree

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.920 
boiling point which is 100 degree
Celsius<00:01:01.550> but<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.879> only<00:01:03.030> half<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.719> reason

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
Celsius but this is only half the reason

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.740 
Celsius but this is only half the reason
why<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.470> takes<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.250> little<00:01:05.489> time<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.270> cook<00:01:06.420> food

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
why it takes so little time to cook food

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.679 
why it takes so little time to cook food
inside<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.290> pressure<00:01:07.560> cooker<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:09.210> increased

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
inside a pressure cooker the increased

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.289 
inside a pressure cooker the increased
pressure<00:01:10.110> inside<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> cooker<00:01:11.299> literally

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
pressure inside the cooker literally

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.160 
pressure inside the cooker literally
forces<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> heat<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> food<00:01:14.960> think<00:01:15.960> of

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
forces the heat into the food think of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080 
forces the heat into the food think of
the<00:01:16.320> pressure<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.920> an<00:01:17.189> invisible<00:01:17.580> hand

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the pressure as an invisible hand

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.780 
the pressure as an invisible hand
pushing<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> extra<00:01:19.710> hot<00:01:19.920> steam<00:01:20.369> into<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
pushing the extra hot steam into the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.890 
pushing the extra hot steam into the
very<00:01:21.210> core<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.080> food<00:01:22.320> inside<00:01:23.689> but<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
very core of the food inside but if the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.320 
very core of the food inside but if the
pressure<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> crushing<00:01:26.280> hand<00:01:26.729> then

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
pressure is like a crushing hand then

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.819 
pressure is like a crushing hand then
why<00:01:27.570> doesn't<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> food<00:01:28.200> come<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.590> all

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
why doesn't the food come out all

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.030 
why doesn't the food come out all
smashed<00:01:29.600> well<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.770> steam

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
smashed well this is because the steam

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.609 
smashed well this is because the steam
applies<00:01:32.520> uniform<00:01:33.270> pressure<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.200> the
