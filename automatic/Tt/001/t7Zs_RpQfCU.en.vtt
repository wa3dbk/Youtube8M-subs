should come up and then here's your
little<00:02:07.660> barrier<00:02:08.110> leaner<00:02:08.710> cuts<00:02:09.010> here<00:02:10.710> your

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
little barrier leaner cuts here your

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.080 
little barrier leaner cuts here your
more<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.220> is<00:02:12.280> medium<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:12.790> is<00:02:12.880> definitely

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
