00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
together so here's the one-inch square

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.700 
together so here's the one-inch square
tubing<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.480> I'm<00:00:12.570> gonna<00:00:12.780> use<00:00:13.019> as<00:00:13.380> the

tubing that I'm gonna use as the

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.590 
tubing that I'm gonna use as the
platform<00:00:14.420> I've<00:00:15.680> cleaned<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.859> all<00:00:16.980> out<00:00:17.570> cut<00:00:18.570> it

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
platform I've cleaned it all out cut it

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.700 
platform I've cleaned it all out cut it
to<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.869> right<00:00:19.080> length<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.439> I've<00:00:19.590> even

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
to the right length and I've even

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.310 
to the right length and I've even
beveled<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.520> edges<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> pipe<00:00:22.109> there

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
beveled the edges of the pipe there

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.160 
beveled the edges of the pipe there
before<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.740> weld<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.100> together<00:00:23.570> so<00:00:24.570> I'll<00:00:24.960> weld

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
before I weld that together so I'll weld

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.570 
before I weld that together so I'll weld
that<00:00:25.289> together<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:25.769> first<00:00:26.039> gonna<00:00:26.130> start<00:00:26.460> by

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
that together I'm first gonna start by

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.500 
that together I'm first gonna start by
tacking<00:00:27.180> it

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
tacking it

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.810 
tacking it
so<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> metal<00:00:28.140> doesn't<00:00:28.349> work<00:00:28.560> too<00:00:28.769> much<00:00:28.980> so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
so the metal doesn't work too much so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.680 
so the metal doesn't work too much so
I've<00:00:29.970> got<00:00:30.150> my<00:00:30.300> ec225<00:00:31.309> welder<00:00:32.309> there<00:00:32.690> stick

the bike so I've got that frame edge

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.270 
the bike so I've got that frame edge
swallowed<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> onto<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> bike<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
swallowed it onto the bike this is

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.000 
swallowed it onto the bike this is
pretty<00:01:17.490> well<00:01:17.700> where<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> needs<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.110> go<00:01:19.230> for<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
pretty well where it needs to go for the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.560 
pretty well where it needs to go for the
motor<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> go<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.790> how<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.120> motors

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
motor to go on so this is how the motors

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.090 
motor to go on so this is how the motors
gonna<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.050> there's<00:01:25.410> gonna<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> metal

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
gonna be on there's gonna be a metal

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.980 
gonna be on there's gonna be a metal
plate<00:01:26.310> welded<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.910> this<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.800> I<00:01:28.800> just<00:01:28.830> kind<00:01:29.190> of

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
plate welded on this and I just kind of

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.790 
plate welded on this and I just kind of
tried<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.680> how<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.979> work<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.700> tire

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
tried it out see how it work on the tire

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.830 
tried it out see how it work on the tire
so<00:01:34.800> this<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.790> position<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:36.450> would<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.750> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so this is the position it would be in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.340 
so this is the position it would be in
and<00:01:37.100> it's<00:01:38.100> gonna<00:01:38.250> clear<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.729> pedals<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.270> well

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350

a professional welder but I do know that
when<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.240> weld<00:02:03.450> metal<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.710> together

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
when you weld metal like this together

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.289 
when you weld metal like this together
don't<00:02:06.990> well<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.440> straight<00:02:07.740> line<00:02:08.040> just<00:02:08.820> attack

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
don't well the straight line just attack

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.080 
don't well the straight line just attack
it<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.690> tack<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.200> there<00:02:10.549> let<00:02:11.549> it<00:02:11.580> cool<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.000> bit

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
it here tack it there let it cool a bit

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.620 
it here tack it there let it cool a bit
the<00:02:12.840> other<00:02:12.959> side<00:02:13.820> then<00:02:14.820> while<00:02:15.120> bits<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
the other side then while bits and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.420 
the other side then while bits and
pieces<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.380> does<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:16.890> prevents<00:02:17.220> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
pieces what this does is it prevents the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
pieces what this does is it prevents the
metal<00:02:17.700> from<00:02:17.880> getting<00:02:18.209> too<00:02:18.480> hot<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.900> working

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
metal from getting too hot and working

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.060 
metal from getting too hot and working
the<00:02:20.100> metal

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:41.770 

now<00:02:28.070> we'll<00:02:28.280> do<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.610> other<00:02:28.670> side<00:02:40.240> what<00:02:41.240> is<00:02:41.450> cool

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
now we'll do the other side what is cool

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.780 
now we'll do the other side what is cool
a<00:02:41.810> bit<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.200> then<00:02:42.830> I'm<00:02:42.980> gonna<00:02:43.160> flip<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.640> over

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
a bit and then I'm gonna flip it over

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.150 
a bit and then I'm gonna flip it over
and<00:02:44.030> weld<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.840> bit<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.260> bead<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:45.620> that<00:02:45.890> and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
and weld a bit of a bead on that and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.600 
and weld a bit of a bead on that and
just<00:02:46.300> continue<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.420> process<00:02:48.130> hey<00:02:49.130> our<00:02:49.280> piece

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
just continue the process hey our piece

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.060 
just continue the process hey our piece
is<00:02:49.640> cooled<00:02:50.360> down<00:02:50.450> now<00:02:50.750> I'm<00:02:50.900> gonna<00:02:51.080> involved<00:02:51.980> a

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
is cooled down now I'm gonna involved a

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:13.380 
is cooled down now I'm gonna involved a
bit<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.370> bead<00:02:52.550> on<00:02:52.670> there

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.850 

once<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.570> know<00:03:14.690> your<00:03:14.870> thing<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:15.320> stacked<00:03:15.620> on

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
once you know your thing is stacked on

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.730 
once you know your thing is stacked on
pretty<00:03:16.130> good<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.400> can<00:03:16.550> take<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.850> clamps<00:03:17.060> off

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.500 

so<00:03:21.740> now<00:03:22.070> I'm<00:03:22.160> going<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.370> continue<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.030> D<00:03:23.210> on

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
so now I'm going to continue the D on

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:37.970 
so now I'm going to continue the D on
top<00:03:24.020> side

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.440 

so<00:03:38.980> I've<00:03:39.040> got<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.340> welded<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.790> put<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.180> on<00:03:40.300> the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
so I've got it welded I put it on the

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.320 
so I've got it welded I put it on the
bike<00:03:40.570> just<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.080> see<00:03:41.320> how<00:03:41.830> would<00:03:41.890> work<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:43.000> seems

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
bike just to see how would work it seems

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.050 
bike just to see how would work it seems
pretty<00:03:43.570> good<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.100> I<00:03:45.100> figured<00:03:45.640> out<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:45.940> I'm

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
pretty good and I figured out that I'm

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.480 
pretty good and I figured out that I'm
going<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.570> cut<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.260> metal<00:03:47.800> plate<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.250> I'm

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
going to cut the metal plate that I'm

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.250 
going to cut the metal plate that I'm
putting<00:03:48.790> on<00:03:48.910> here<00:03:49.920> deep<00:03:51.090> by<00:03:52.090> 10<00:03:52.570> inches<00:03:53.020> wide

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
putting on here deep by 10 inches wide

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.080 
putting on here deep by 10 inches wide
so<00:03:53.920> it's<00:03:54.070> going<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.310> give<00:03:54.459> me<00:03:54.490> a<00:03:54.610> bit<00:03:54.820> of<00:03:54.850> room

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
so it's going to give me a bit of room

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.730 
so it's going to give me a bit of room
on<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.720> outer<00:03:56.010> part<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.310> square<00:03:57.640> tubing

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
on the outer part of the square tubing

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.890 
on the outer part of the square tubing
and<00:03:59.740> I'm<00:04:00.490> gonna<00:04:00.610> cut<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:00.940> out<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.209> this<00:04:01.630> piece

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
and I'm gonna cut it out of this piece

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.740 
and I'm gonna cut it out of this piece
here<00:04:02.200> it's<00:04:02.709> from<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.190> snowblower<00:04:03.640> body<00:04:04.000> it's

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
here it's from a snowblower body it's

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.540 
here it's from a snowblower body it's
already<00:04:04.990> got<00:04:05.140> some<00:04:05.350> holes<00:04:05.620> drilled<00:04:05.980> in<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.190> so

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
already got some holes drilled in it so

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.940 
already got some holes drilled in it so
I<00:04:06.580> may<00:04:06.940> have<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:08.140> use<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.500> holes<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.890> are

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
I may have to use the holes that are

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.030 
I may have to use the holes that are
pre-drilled<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.730> attach<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.300> saw<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.600> it

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
pre-drilled to attach the saw to it

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.500 
pre-drilled to attach the saw to it
stone<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.459> next<00:04:12.700> thing<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:12.910> got<00:04:12.940> to<00:04:13.180> do<00:04:13.300> is

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
stone the next thing I got to do is

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.920 
stone the next thing I got to do is
measure<00:04:14.050> piece<00:04:14.530> out<00:04:14.739> of<00:04:14.860> that<00:04:18.540> so<00:04:19.540> if<00:04:19.750> there

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
measure piece out of that so if there

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.560 
measure piece out of that so if there
are<00:04:20.049> my<00:04:20.169> cutting<00:04:20.530> marks<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:21.609> I<00:04:21.640> got<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.180> piece

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
are my cutting marks so I got the piece

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.450 
are my cutting marks so I got the piece
of<00:04:22.600> metal<00:04:22.870> cut<00:04:23.290> out<00:04:23.410> of<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:23.620> piece<00:04:24.070> of<00:04:24.250> showed

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
of metal cut out of that piece of showed

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.570 
of metal cut out of that piece of showed
you<00:04:24.580> earlier<00:04:25.230> and<00:04:26.230> I'm<00:04:26.710> gonna<00:04:26.919> weld<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.460> on

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
you earlier and I'm gonna weld it on

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
all this on I'm just gonna attack the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.860 
all this on I'm just gonna attack the
plate<00:04:48.130> on<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.729> frame<00:04:49.060> I'm<00:04:49.300> not<00:04:49.450> gonna<00:04:49.600> put

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
plate on to the frame I'm not gonna put

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.860 
plate on to the frame I'm not gonna put
full<00:04:50.200> running<00:04:50.650> beads<00:04:50.979> all<00:04:51.190> over<00:04:51.690> there's<00:04:52.690> no

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
full running beads all over there's no

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.690 
full running beads all over there's no
need<00:04:53.080> for<00:04:53.110> that<00:04:53.470> so<00:04:54.070> that's<00:04:54.310> what<00:04:54.520> I'm<00:04:54.610> gonna

that it's attacked I'm going to remove
the<00:05:06.770> clamps<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:12.440> I've<00:05:12.530> got<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:12.890> plate<00:05:13.490> welded

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
the clamps so I've got that plate welded

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.470 
the clamps so I've got that plate welded
on<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.480> body<00:05:15.820> this<00:05:16.820> is<00:05:16.970> what<00:05:17.150> it's<00:05:17.300> going

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
on to the body this is what it's going

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.240 
on to the body this is what it's going
to<00:05:17.570> look<00:05:17.630> like<00:05:17.750> it's<00:05:18.590> starting<00:05:19.040> to<00:05:19.100> come

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
to look like it's starting to come

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.270 
to look like it's starting to come
together<00:05:19.430> on<00:05:19.850> that<00:05:20.510> and<00:05:20.690> line<00:05:21.530> up<00:05:21.710> on<00:05:21.890> to<00:05:22.250> the

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
together on that and line up on to the

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:31.960 
together on that and line up on to the
wheel<00:05:29.950> now<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.040> next<00:05:31.460> step<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:31.640> going<00:05:31.850> to<00:05:31.910> be

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
wheel now the next step is going to be

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.120 
wheel now the next step is going to be
to<00:05:32.270> secure<00:05:32.690> the<00:05:33.380> saw<00:05:33.650> motor<00:05:34.210> to<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.390> frame<00:05:36.130> I'm

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
to secure the saw motor to the frame I'm

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.590 
to secure the saw motor to the frame I'm
thinking<00:05:37.640> of<00:05:37.760> putting<00:05:37.970> a<00:05:38.120> piece<00:05:38.300> of<00:05:38.450> angle

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
thinking of putting a piece of angle

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.240 
thinking of putting a piece of angle
iron<00:05:38.870> that's<00:05:39.230> going<00:05:39.440> to<00:05:39.710> have<00:05:39.890> two<00:05:40.070> holes

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
iron that's going to have two holes

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.160 
iron that's going to have two holes
drilled<00:05:40.670> in<00:05:40.850> it<00:05:40.940> for<00:05:41.270> this<00:05:41.390> to<00:05:41.600> go<00:05:41.720> in<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:42.020> be

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
drilled in it for this to go in to be

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.800 
drilled in it for this to go in to be
bolted<00:05:42.560> onto<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:43.280> then<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.150> bracket<00:05:44.570> welded

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
bolted onto and then the bracket welded

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.220 
bolted onto and then the bracket welded
on<00:05:45.080> to<00:05:45.290> the<00:05:45.440> body<00:05:45.740> here<00:05:46.070> and<00:05:46.960> at<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.020> back<00:05:48.170> of

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
on to the body here and at the back of

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.290 
on to the body here and at the back of
this<00:05:48.470> saw<00:05:48.770> there's<00:05:49.040> a<00:05:49.100> little<00:05:49.340> hole<00:05:49.520> here<00:05:49.550> for

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
this saw there's a little hole here for

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.180 
this saw there's a little hole here for
where<00:05:50.420> the<00:05:50.540> handle<00:05:50.870> used<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.140> be<00:05:51.260> I'm<00:05:51.890> gonna

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
where the handle used to be I'm gonna

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.860 
where the handle used to be I'm gonna
mount<00:05:52.430> some<00:05:52.760> kind<00:05:52.790> of<00:05:53.000> bracket<00:05:53.450> on<00:05:53.570> there<00:05:53.780> as

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
mount some kind of bracket on there as

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.580 
mount some kind of bracket on there as
well<00:05:53.900> and<00:05:55.210> if<00:05:56.210> I<00:05:56.360> need<00:05:56.540> to<00:05:56.570> I'm<00:05:57.050> going<00:05:57.260> to<00:05:57.350> mount

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
well and if I need to I'm going to mount

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.030 
well and if I need to I'm going to mount
a<00:05:57.770> bracket<00:05:58.250> that<00:05:58.280> bolts<00:05:58.790> onto<00:05:59.030> here<00:05:59.510> and<00:06:00.040> goes

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
a bracket that bolts onto here and goes

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.890 
a bracket that bolts onto here and goes
under<00:06:01.370> here<00:06:01.550> so<00:06:01.970> hopefully<00:06:02.300> that<00:06:02.660> will<00:06:02.750> work

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
under here so hopefully that will work

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.740 
under here so hopefully that will work
so<00:06:03.220> in<00:06:04.220> part<00:06:04.490> three<00:06:04.790> and<00:06:04.970> we're<00:06:05.300> going<00:06:05.510> to<00:06:05.570> be

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
so in part three and we're going to be

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.310 
so in part three and we're going to be
doing<00:06:05.990> that<00:06:06.110> and<00:06:06.350> I<00:06:06.710> hope<00:06:06.830> to<00:06:06.980> see<00:06:07.070> you<00:06:07.160> then
