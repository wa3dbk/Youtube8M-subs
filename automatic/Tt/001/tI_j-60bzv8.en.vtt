00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
verse lick which is probably the most

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.700 
verse lick which is probably the most
important<00:00:08.080> part<00:00:08.320> and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.100 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.190 

C<00:00:12.790> power-chord<00:00:13.150> that's<00:00:13.540> how<00:00:13.690> it<00:00:13.809> starts<00:00:16.200> one

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
C power-chord that's how it starts one

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.300 
C power-chord that's how it starts one
more<00:00:17.350> time

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.050 

alright<00:00:21.310> then<00:00:21.550> you're<00:00:21.670> going<00:00:21.790> to<00:00:21.880> take

alright then you're going to take

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.960 
alright then you're going to take
instead<00:00:22.540> of<00:00:22.810> your<00:00:23.320> index<00:00:24.099> finger<00:00:24.460> we're<00:00:24.849> going

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
instead of your index finger we're going

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.139 
instead of your index finger we're going
to<00:00:25.029> move<00:00:25.270> your<00:00:25.599> middle<00:00:25.869> finger<00:00:26.259> up<00:00:26.849> two<00:00:27.849> frets

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.760 

lowest<00:00:38.660> note<00:00:38.810> comes<00:00:39.079> up<00:00:39.230> two<00:00:39.410> frets<00:00:39.620> two

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770

finger and you're going to move it up a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.650 
finger and you're going to move it up a
string<00:00:47.130> to<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.170> actually<00:00:49.350> playing<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.040> a

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
string to so it's actually playing the a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.560 
string to so it's actually playing the a
the<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.870> note<00:00:53.150> so<00:00:54.150> it's<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.570> go

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.049 

play<00:00:59.200> author<00:00:59.380> he<00:00:59.559> knows

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.719 

moved<00:01:03.449> up

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.380 

and<00:01:10.890> then<00:01:11.190> those<00:01:11.340> same<00:01:11.640> two<00:01:11.940> notes<00:01:12.180> you've

and then those same two notes you've
been<00:01:12.540> playing<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> same<00:01:13.400> every<00:01:14.400> time<00:01:14.430> those

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
been playing the same every time those

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.370 
been playing the same every time those
two<00:01:14.970> notes<00:01:15.330> right<00:01:15.540> there<00:01:15.750> you're<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.230> going

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
two notes right there you're just going

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.820 
two notes right there you're just going
to<00:01:16.410> repeat<00:01:16.680> those

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
to repeat those

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.780 
to repeat those
so<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.920> goes<00:01:20.100> today

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.940 

and<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> plays<00:01:24.180> them<00:01:24.360> again

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and it plays them again

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.590 
and it plays them again
and<00:01:26.189> then<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> trickiest<00:01:27.540> part

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and then this is the trickiest part

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.870 
and then this is the trickiest part
you're<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> take<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.979> play<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.610> note

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
you're going to actually move go back

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:44.480 
you're going to actually move go back
three<00:01:35.729> frets<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.450> play<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.840> note<00:01:39.020> back<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:43.490> so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
three frets to play this note back to so

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.010 
three frets to play this note back to so
like<00:01:44.850> this

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.180 

all<00:01:53.020> right<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:53.260> I'm<00:01:53.320> going<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.500> do<00:01:53.620> all<00:01:53.860> that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
all right so I'm going to do all that

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.400 
all right so I'm going to do all that
all<00:01:54.400> of<00:01:54.700> those<00:01:54.880> positions<00:01:55.150> slowly<00:01:55.840> for<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:56.229> so

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
all of those positions slowly for you so

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.460 
all of those positions slowly for you so
you<00:01:56.500> can<00:01:56.620> play<00:01:56.800> long<00:01:57.990> starting<00:01:58.990> on<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.200> C

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
you can play long starting on the C

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:12.520 
you can play long starting on the C
power-chord

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:22.470 

the<00:02:13.530> right<00:02:13.710> speed<00:02:13.980> it'll<00:02:14.250> sound<00:02:14.400> like<00:02:14.520> this

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.420 

so<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.590> kind<00:02:23.799> of<00:02:23.830> groove<00:02:24.069> it<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.250> little

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
so you just kind of groove it a little

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.190 
so you just kind of groove it a little
bit<00:02:24.580> more<00:02:24.730> but<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.239> seam<00:02:25.480> it's<00:02:26.049> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
bit more but it's this seam it's the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.930 
bit more but it's this seam it's the
same<00:02:26.440> notes

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.060 

so<00:02:34.940> that's<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.270> verse<00:02:35.450> like<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:36.470> chorus<00:02:36.830> is

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
so that's the verse like the chorus is

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.850 
so that's the verse like the chorus is
really<00:02:37.490> easy<00:02:37.670> it's<00:02:38.060> just<00:02:38.660> C<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:40.700> G<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:42.560> D<00:02:42.800> minor

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
really easy it's just C to G to D minor

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.680 
really easy it's just C to G to D minor
you<00:02:45.070> should<00:02:45.250> not<00:02:45.370> play<00:02:45.550> those<00:02:45.760> chords<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:46.510> it's

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
you should not play those chords so it's

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.240 
you should not play those chords so it's
saseru<00:02:47.590> bong<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.640> see<00:02:50.700> g-d

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
saseru bong and see g-d

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.900 
saseru bong and see g-d
No

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.810
