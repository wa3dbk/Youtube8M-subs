exciting discussion I think these last
couple<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:07.020> hours<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.770> hopefully<00:00:08.670> it's

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
couple of hours and hopefully it's

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.020 
couple of hours and hopefully it's
opening<00:00:09.450> up<00:00:09.690> some<00:00:10.500> new<00:00:10.950> possibilities<00:00:11.730> for

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
opening up some new possibilities for

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.320 
opening up some new possibilities for
you<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.450> be<00:00:12.599> considering<00:00:13.759> particularly<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
you to be considering particularly the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.900 
you to be considering particularly the
whole<00:00:15.540> concept<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:16.379> buses<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> fixed

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
whole concept of buses on a fixed

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.779 
whole concept of buses on a fixed
guideway<00:00:18.109> which<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.410> feel<00:00:19.800> has<00:00:20.070> not<00:00:20.400> been

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
guideway which I feel has not been

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.240 
guideway which I feel has not been
properly<00:00:21.750> studied<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.560> think<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> city

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
properly studied I think the city

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.120 
properly studied I think the city
administration<00:00:23.869> has<00:00:24.869> been<00:00:25.140> hostile<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.980> that

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
administration has been hostile to that

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.790 
administration has been hostile to that
alternative<00:00:26.789> from<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> beginning<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.869> has

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
alternative from the beginning and has

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.070 
alternative from the beginning and has
slanted<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.699> their<00:00:29.849> studies<00:00:30.269> against<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
slanted all of their studies against it

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.729 
slanted all of their studies against it
which<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.949> saw<00:00:32.160> again<00:00:32.489> today<00:00:32.969> very<00:00:33.300> clearly

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
do a thorough alternatives analysis that

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.619 
do a thorough alternatives analysis that
includes<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.950> idea<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.609> buses<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.449> can

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
includes the idea of buses that can

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.750 
includes the idea of buses that can

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
circulate in the community go on a fixed

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.050 
circulate in the community go on a fixed
guideway<00:03:21.349> with<00:03:22.349> some<00:03:22.650> ramps<00:03:23.129> maybe<00:03:23.190> we<00:03:23.910> need

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
guideway with some ramps maybe we need

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.569 
guideway with some ramps maybe we need
three<00:03:24.329> or<00:03:24.359> four<00:03:24.599> ramps<00:03:25.049> at<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.129> beginning<00:03:26.489> at

guideway<00:03:31.109> structure<00:03:32.120> while<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.269> may<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:33.720> a

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
guideway structure while it may be a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.229 
guideway structure while it may be a
little<00:03:34.109> wider<00:03:34.409> than<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:35.010> for<00:03:35.159> a<00:03:35.220> train<00:03:35.549> let's

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
little wider than that for a train let's

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.990 
little wider than that for a train let's
let's<00:03:36.989> give<00:03:37.139> them<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.709> does<00:03:38.519> not<00:03:38.549> have<00:03:38.879> to

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
let's give them that it does not have to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.599 
let's give them that it does not have to
go<00:03:39.150> through<00:03:39.739> residential<00:03:40.739> communities<00:03:41.370> it

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
go through residential communities it

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.270 
go through residential communities it
can<00:03:41.819> go<00:03:41.970> over<00:03:42.629> or<00:03:43.079> next<00:03:43.379> to<00:03:43.500> our<00:03:43.799> existing

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
can go over or next to our existing

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.140 
can go over or next to our existing
freeway<00:03:45.260> because<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.470> doesn't<00:03:46.500> require

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
freeway because it doesn't require

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.599 
freeway because it doesn't require
immediate<00:03:48.349> people<00:03:49.349> living<00:03:49.889> right<00:03:50.190> next<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.579> it

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
immediate people living right next to it

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.280 
immediate people living right next to it
to<00:03:51.209> walk<00:03:51.479> to<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:52.129> it<00:03:53.129> can<00:03:53.729> be<00:03:53.909> in<00:03:54.540> our<00:03:54.750> existing

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
to walk to it it can be in our existing

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.309 
to walk to it it can be in our existing
transit<00:03:55.919> corridor<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.790> therefore<00:03:57.780> much<00:03:58.049> less

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
transit corridor and therefore much less

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.759 
transit corridor and therefore much less
obtrusive<00:03:58.729> then<00:03:59.729> elevated<00:04:00.150> rail<00:04:00.449> would<00:04:00.599> be

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
obtrusive then elevated rail would be

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.379 
obtrusive then elevated rail would be
