00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.680
 Feel like doing a do it yourself then 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.340
 but then stays or stands 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.340
 decoration idea 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.120
 so first of all i have to look at the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.619
 look for a branch made you have to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.110
 look that he might not 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.430
 too thin is because depending on what her turn 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.360
 he has to hang a bit already 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.360
 keep weight 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.550
 then you need a hedge or 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.470
 lope it always and always 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.259
 cuts everything around it from that they 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.270
 just have the bare first and 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.970
 rather so that you stop yourself from the form 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.160
 like it 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.800
 Now you have the foundation and yes now 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.300
 Do you need a spray paint or something 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.580
 I always choose here now 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.589
 one in white you can for everything 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.820
 take and spray the doctor 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.989
 just completely 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.890
 in the meantime load then dry now 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.330
 and then you jump the other side 1 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.580
 and yes, make sure he's alright 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.530
 is dry 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.540
 on the edge of who mentioned a document 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.659
 Maybe not bad the idea 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.460
 can recognize yes and then controlled 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.680
 Just once again when the us dries 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.729
 is he really all everywhere? 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.939
 have played or painted 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.950
 you really only need it now 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:24.750
 a slightly higher vase I have here 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.450
 chosen a carafe and something 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.130
 the material he suspects that the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.710
 Doctor just a bit stop me 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.509
 I have mussels here now 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.439
 decided you can of course on deco 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.079
 sand earth 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.310
 You can take whatever you want 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.100
 you like the most 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.899
 and yes you fill the base then 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.460
 or whatever that was 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.829
 actually everything you do 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.179
 must and then we come now to 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:00.450
 nice part to decorate 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:04.149
 with this variant I have easy 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.270
 wear jewelry and yes that's what it was for 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:11.700
 actually thought of as a nice decoration idea 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.700
 and practical jewelry holder so to speak 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.420
 I think the whole thing is very decorative 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.220
 appealing is something for the eye and 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.430
 of course, virtually as it is easy 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.660
 is clear 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.430
 Of course it can always do that 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.710
 redecorate one another 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.870
 So I'm personally attached to it 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.870
 think that's a very nice idea 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.240
 And the second idea is of course whole 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.740
 just easy to hang on I have 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:48.020
 now here are blitzer butterflies and 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.670
 just such carving-related 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.450
 and I think that looks very, too 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.850
 very cute and yes that was it from me 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.250
 with my decoration inspiration jewelry 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.450
 storage whatever i hope 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.900

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.900
