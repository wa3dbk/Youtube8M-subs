00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 equal some good to all and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.799
 welcome to a magic video more today 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.599
 I bring you a magic trick amazing no 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.660
 it's from this world the truth is that if you 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.230
 you do well fantastic work one of 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.390
 the best games with cards also 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 I have to say that it is great 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.890
 difficulty is no longer of these effects that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.320
 you can do it 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.810
 a day of practice or two but they are 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.570
 games that if you want them from someone 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.809
 you have to be days practicing what 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.940
 Nothing I hope you like and right now 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.879
 I will try to perform to see 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.850
 let's try to make this great 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.670
 effect and for that we need the four 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.460
 picture 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.969
 the four the four aces the four 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.239
 aces and the 44 then let's put the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.460
 four aces here and I know that in poker 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.800
 the aces are better than the four so 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.649
 that here we have my friend manolo that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.350
 I'll give him the aces I'll give him the ace 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:14.670
 of clover is the diamond ace of the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.640
 decorations and the ace 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.490
 so manolo you can have the aces 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.070
 and here we also stay with 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.689
 the four cards that have to be the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.310
 44 of course yes and now we are going to try 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.789
 do something because really a magician 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.830
 can do something is not to say can catch 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.920
 this 4 for example and just with flicking 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.000
 the fingers and float a little we can see 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.340
 what is an ace 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.060
 it's incredible truth has become 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.680
 an ace is magic really but let's 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.470
 take this 4 now let's put it 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.840
 put here just snap your fingers already 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.180
 they have become again another ace 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.100
 more specifically than the aces in the 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.800
 four are being changed so it's 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.540
 but let's let them here and let's 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.920
 to try to do again we are going to catch 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.490
 this four and now even just 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.530
 doing so we already have we already have 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.170
 observe them like that is already all aces 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.540
 as you can see the 44 have 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.240
 disappeared and they have become 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.510
 four is like that but in truth 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:26.080
 he is a magician and truth has all been 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.010
 an illusion and here we can see that there 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.350
 the 44 so really with many 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.350
 you think that here in the aces you have all 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.910
 the reason here we have the four aces 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.470
 it's worth the four aces here from the 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.440
 principle that my friend had them manolo 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.610
 but everything you have seen has 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.640
 friend manolo that is an optical illusion 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.300
 so I hope you liked the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.150
 trick I love you I hope your 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.820
 likes but your comment a greeting 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.820
 and see you in the next video goodbye
