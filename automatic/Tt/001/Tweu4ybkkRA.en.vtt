I've also included an accelerometer

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.050 
I've also included an accelerometer
which<00:01:03.210> tells<00:01:03.449> me<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.690> left<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.260> my<00:01:04.500> braking

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
which tells me my left right my braking

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.630 
which tells me my left right my braking
g-forces<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.390> also<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.290> my<00:01:07.620> graph<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
g-forces I also have my graph on the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.820 
g-forces I also have my graph on the
left<00:01:08.850> side<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.420> shows<00:01:09.660> my<00:01:09.840> miles<00:01:10.050> per<00:01:10.380> per

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
left side which shows my miles per per

minutes all the way up to eight hour

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.510 
minutes all the way up to eight hour
increments<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.740> current<00:01:17.010> on<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.280> left

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
increments and my current on the left

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.760 
increments and my current on the left
and<00:01:17.820> then<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:18.360> tack<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.320> circles

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and then here is my tack which circles

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.790 
and then here is my tack which circles
around<00:01:20.150> my<00:01:21.150> clips<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.780> my<00:01:21.810> Mitsubishi<00:01:22.410> emblem

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
around my clips in my Mitsubishi emblem

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.890 
around my clips in my Mitsubishi emblem
there<00:01:22.980> and<00:01:23.190> it<00:01:23.250> also<00:01:23.430> gives<00:01:23.790> me<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> specific

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
there and it also gives me the specific

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.580 
there and it also gives me the specific
number<00:01:25.260> of<00:01:25.410> what<00:01:26.250> my<00:01:26.630> my<00:01:27.630> rpms<00:01:28.080> are<00:01:28.260> for<00:01:28.470> my

tutorial or a little showing of the the
multi-touch<00:01:38.430> properties<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.660> a<00:01:40.440> little

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
multi-touch properties here a little

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.590 
multi-touch properties here a little
harder<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.160> hold<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> phone<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.330> this<00:01:42.450> at

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
harder to hold the phone and do this at

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.500 
harder to hold the phone and do this at
the<00:01:42.690> same<00:01:42.720> time<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.940> okay<00:01:44.940> we'll<00:01:45.120> start<00:01:45.360> off

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
the same time but okay we'll start off

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.220 
the same time but okay we'll start off
with<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.860> Microsoft<00:01:47.550> Lagoon<00:01:48.030> screensaver<00:01:48.960> I

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
with the Microsoft Lagoon screensaver I

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.810 
with the Microsoft Lagoon screensaver I
know<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:49.890> guys<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.280> probably<00:01:50.520> went<00:01:50.640> into

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
know you guys have probably went into

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.420 
know you guys have probably went into
whatever<00:01:51.540> stores<00:01:52.080> and<00:01:52.440> saw<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
whatever stores and saw the the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.390 
whatever stores and saw the the
touchscreen<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:55.140> multi-touch<00:01:55.650> monitors

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
touchscreen the multi-touch monitors

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.060 
touchscreen the multi-touch monitors
hooked<00:01:57.180> up<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.660> newer<00:01:57.810> computers<00:01:58.410> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
hooked up to the newer computers you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.200 
hooked up to the newer computers you
know<00:01:59.160> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.460> basically<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.030> same

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
know this is basically the same

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.870 
know this is basically the same
principle<00:02:00.620> it's<00:02:01.620> a<00:02:01.710> five<00:02:01.950> wire<00:02:02.220> resistive

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
principle it's a five wire resistive

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.100 
principle it's a five wire resistive
multi-touch<00:02:03.450> screen<00:02:04.260> here<00:02:05.660> like<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.870> see<00:02:07.080> a

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
multi-touch screen here like you see a

globe I typically like to use Google

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.280 
globe I typically like to use Google
Earth<00:02:43.240> however<00:02:44.240> Google<00:02:44.750> Earth<00:02:45.020> is<00:02:45.170> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
Earth however Google Earth is a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.210 
Earth however Google Earth is a
multi-touch<00:02:45.800> compatible<00:02:46.790> as<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.090> yet<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:48.220> the

multi-touch compatible as of yet and the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.150 
multi-touch compatible as of yet and the
only<00:02:49.370> drawback<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.940> using<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.300> beam<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:51.160> it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
only drawback to using the beam is it

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.430 
only drawback to using the beam is it
takes<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.490> minute<00:02:52.730> for<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.060> load<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.690> also

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
takes a minute for it to load and also

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.140 
takes a minute for it to load and also
it's<00:02:55.150> you<00:02:56.150> can't<00:02:56.390> do<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.540> GPS<00:02:57.020> overlay<00:02:57.550> which<00:02:58.550> is

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
it's you can't do a GPS overlay which is

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.840 
it's you can't do a GPS overlay which is
kind<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.510> sucky<00:02:59.780> because<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.260> liked<00:03:00.650> having<00:03:01.400> my

kind of sucky because I liked having my

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.480 
kind of sucky because I liked having my
Google<00:03:02.240> Earth<00:03:02.390> which<00:03:02.660> I<00:03:02.780> could<00:03:02.960> still<00:03:03.200> use<00:03:03.490> I

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
Google Earth which I could still use I

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.560 
Google Earth which I could still use I
also<00:03:05.360> use<00:03:05.660> Google<00:03:06.020> Maps<00:03:06.700> which<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:08.150> need<00:03:08.480> an

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
also use Google Maps which I need an

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.970 
also use Google Maps which I need an
Android<00:03:08.870> emulator<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.710> do<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:10.120> but<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:12.830> gives

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
Android emulator to do that but it gives

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.950 
Android emulator to do that but it gives

making a plexiglass cover it's gonna be

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.940 
making a plexiglass cover it's gonna be
a<00:04:31.710> black<00:04:32.010> plexiglass<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.930> it'll<00:04:34.590> be<00:04:34.740> nice<00:04:34.920> and

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950
