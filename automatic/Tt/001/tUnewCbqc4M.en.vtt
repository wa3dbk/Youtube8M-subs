00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
beetle will be on your bean plants so I

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.500 
beetle will be on your bean plants so I
had<00:00:54.949> a<00:00:54.979> pretty<00:00:55.190> bad<00:00:55.400> infestation<00:00:55.820> of<00:00:56.299> these

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
had a pretty bad infestation of these

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.689 
had a pretty bad infestation of these
last<00:00:56.809> year<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.379> I<00:00:57.559> basically<00:00:57.949> kept<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.489> under

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
last year and I basically kept it under

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.329 
last year and I basically kept it under
control<00:00:58.909> by<00:00:59.449> just<00:01:00.409> hand<00:01:00.680> collecting<00:01:01.129> them<00:01:01.309> in

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
control by just hand collecting them in

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.460 
control by just hand collecting them in
a<00:01:01.580> pickle<00:01:01.879> jar<00:01:01.930> with<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:02.960> little<00:01:03.290> bit<00:01:03.379> of

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
a pickle jar with a little bit of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.740 
a pickle jar with a little bit of
rubbing<00:01:03.739> alcohol<00:01:03.860> in<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:05.420> can<00:01:05.540> most

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
rubbing alcohol in it and you can most

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.140 
rubbing alcohol in it and you can most
easily<00:01:05.990> find<00:01:06.500> these<00:01:06.740> on<00:01:07.130> an<00:01:07.250> overcast<00:01:07.700> day<00:01:07.880> on

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
easily find these on an overcast day on

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.899 
easily find these on an overcast day on
top<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.720> plant<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:10.460> adults

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
top of the plant and the adults

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.880 
top of the plant and the adults
overwinter<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.810> garden<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:12.440> I<00:01:12.470> do<00:01:12.619> have

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
overwinter in the garden so I do have

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.940 
overwinter in the garden so I do have
them<00:01:13.070> again<00:01:13.400> this<00:01:13.820> year<00:01:14.090> in<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.420> garden<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.590> I

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
them again this year in the garden and I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.459 
them again this year in the garden and I
basically<00:01:16.130> can<00:01:16.640> find<00:01:17.000> them<00:01:17.210> fairly<00:01:17.840> easily<00:01:18.020> by

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
basically can find them fairly easily by

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.380 
basically can find them fairly easily by
walking<00:01:18.799> through<00:01:19.039> and<00:01:19.369> just<00:01:19.640> looking<00:01:20.000> at<00:01:20.240> the

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
walking through and just looking at the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.090 
walking through and just looking at the
leaves<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.049> I<00:01:21.109> can<00:01:21.320> usually<00:01:21.439> see<00:01:21.859> them

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
leaves and I can usually see them

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.910 
leaves and I can usually see them
through<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.000> skeletonized<00:01:23.719> leave<00:01:26.920> the

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
through the skeletonized leave the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.310 
through the skeletonized leave the
damage<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.369> they<00:01:28.490> caused<00:01:29.109> skeletonize<00:01:30.109> is

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
damage that they caused skeletonize is

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.959 
damage that they caused skeletonize is
the<00:01:30.469> leaf<00:01:30.710> where<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:31.189> see<00:01:31.369> just<00:01:31.609> the<00:01:31.729> veins

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
the leaf where you see just the veins

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.940 
the leaf where you see just the veins
and<00:01:32.240> like<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.570> flesh<00:01:32.899> of<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.500> leaf<00:01:33.710> is

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
and like the flesh of the leaf is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.490 
and like the flesh of the leaf is
missing<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:35.329> they're<00:01:35.570> pretty<00:01:35.689> easy<00:01:35.990> to<00:01:36.229> see

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
missing so they're pretty easy to see

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.410 
missing so they're pretty easy to see
when<00:01:36.799> they're<00:01:36.920> feeding<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:37.850> usually<00:01:38.179> spray

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
when they're feeding you usually spray

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.419 
when they're feeding you usually spray
with<00:01:38.570> neem<00:01:38.750> seed<00:01:38.780> oil<00:01:39.140> but<00:01:39.770> last<00:01:40.009> year<00:01:40.250> I<00:01:40.280> did

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
with neem seed oil but last year I did

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.310 
with neem seed oil but last year I did
not<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:40.670> wanted<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.240> attract<00:01:41.570> a<00:01:41.689> lot<00:01:42.020> of

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
not I wanted to attract a lot of

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.760 
not I wanted to attract a lot of
beneficial<00:01:42.679> insects<00:01:43.189> to<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.490> garden<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.770> and

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
beneficial insects to the garden and and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.789 
beneficial insects to the garden and and
I<00:01:46.310> think<00:01:46.399> that<00:01:46.609> it<00:01:46.820> helped<00:01:47.380> pollinate<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.409> lot

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
I think that it helped pollinate a lot

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.709 
I think that it helped pollinate a lot
of<00:01:48.920> my<00:01:49.009> open<00:01:49.310> pollinated<00:01:49.789> cucumber<00:01:50.240> plants

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
of my open pollinated cucumber plants

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.959 
of my open pollinated cucumber plants
now<00:01:51.679> you<00:01:51.770> can<00:01:52.039> look<00:01:52.159> underneath<00:01:52.460> your<00:01:52.759> leaves

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
now you can look underneath your leaves

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.630 
now you can look underneath your leaves
and<00:01:53.329> find<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.990> larva<00:01:54.439> of<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:54.920> squash<00:01:55.219> beetle

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
and find the larva of the squash beetle

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.580 
and find the larva of the squash beetle
along<00:01:56.179> with<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:56.329> lot<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.630> different<00:01:56.990> other<00:01:57.140> kind

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
along with a lot of different other kind

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.760 
along with a lot of different other kind
of<00:01:57.710> insects<00:01:58.219> eggs<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:59.119> larva<00:01:59.569> as<00:01:59.719> well<00:02:02.770> this

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
of insects eggs and larva as well this

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.520 
of insects eggs and larva as well this
is<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.950> picture<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.490> squash<00:02:04.789> beetle<00:02:05.530> larva

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
is a picture of the squash beetle larva

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.219 
is a picture of the squash beetle larva
I<00:02:06.829> don't<00:02:07.729> have<00:02:07.819> a<00:02:07.880> picture<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.360> eggs<00:02:08.569> but

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
I don't have a picture of the eggs but

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
kind of damage I also hand collected

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:38.070 
kind of damage I also hand collected
that<00:02:30.880> last<00:02:31.180> year<00:02:31.570> I<00:02:36.330> had<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.360> wonderful<00:02:37.870> harvest

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
that last year I had a wonderful harvest

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.980 
that last year I had a wonderful harvest
of<00:02:38.850> cucumbers<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.210> think<00:02:40.420> it's<00:02:40.570> due<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
of cucumbers and I think it's due to the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.020 
of cucumbers and I think it's due to the
fact<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.530> allowed<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> lot<00:02:42.460> of<00:02:42.610> beneficial

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
fact that I allowed a lot of beneficial

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.230 
fact that I allowed a lot of beneficial

different than the other beetles I just

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.230 
different than the other beetles I just
showed<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.110> because<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.860> head<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:01.090> is

one way you can tell the difference and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.390 
one way you can tell the difference and
this<00:03:04.180> is<00:03:04.240> my<00:03:04.570> fear<00:03:05.050> lime<00:03:05.200> trap<00:03:05.530> caught<00:03:06.370> a

couple of ladybugs on there they

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.620 
couple of ladybugs on there they
probably<00:03:08.950> didn't<00:03:09.430> appreciate<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.240> too<00:03:10.450> much

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630

napa cabbage and after about two
applications<00:03:56.830> they<00:03:56.980> were<00:03:57.070> almost<00:03:57.520> all<00:03:57.700> gone
