00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
they were a little protective Bruce

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:15.330 
they were a little protective Bruce
because<00:02:14.319> they<00:02:14.469> were<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:14.950> know<00:02:15.069> here's

no<00:02:18.890> school<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:19.850> I

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
no school but I

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.790 
no school but I
they're<00:02:21.430> really<00:02:21.640> excited<00:02:22.000> for<00:02:22.209> me

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.110 

you<00:02:25.040> know<00:02:25.130> it's<00:02:25.280> hard<00:02:25.490> for<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.760> kids<00:02:25.970> because

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
you know it's hard for the kids because

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.640 
you know it's hard for the kids because
that's<00:02:26.270> we<00:02:26.480> grew<00:02:26.690> up<00:02:26.720> watching<00:02:26.870> your<00:02:27.170> dad<00:02:27.350> do

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
that's we grew up watching your dad do

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.680 
that's we grew up watching your dad do
so<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.010> even<00:02:28.250> think<00:02:28.430> my<00:02:28.610> sister<00:02:29.060> probably<00:02:29.600> at

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
so I even think my sister probably at

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.839 
so I even think my sister probably at
one<00:02:29.840> point<00:02:30.050> was<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.320> too

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.270 
because it's hard to walk away from
something<00:02:35.829> did<00:02:36.829> you<00:02:36.920> have<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.129> favorite
