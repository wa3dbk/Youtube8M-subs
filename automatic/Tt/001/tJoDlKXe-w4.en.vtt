00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
to get some option in there overall this

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.590 
to get some option in there overall this
roster<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> very<00:02:04.710> senior<00:02:05.340> heavy<00:02:05.640> sixty<00:02:06.450> eight

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
players 23 of those are seniors so we're

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.720

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.610 
going to be losing 23 players after this
season<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.599> we<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:12.900> have<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.170> recruit

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.070 
season so we will have to recruit
very<00:02:13.920> heavily<00:02:14.310> probably<00:02:14.940> giving<00:02:15.239> out<00:02:15.330> all<00:02:15.569> 25

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
very heavily probably giving out all 25

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.380 
very heavily probably giving out all 25
of<00:02:16.409> our<00:02:16.799> scholarships<00:02:17.519> hopefully<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.209> get

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
of our scholarships hopefully we can get

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.930 
of our scholarships hopefully we can get
25<00:02:18.900> players<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.830> commit<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.400> Georgia<00:02:20.790> State

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
25 players to commit to Georgia State

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.770 
25 players to commit to Georgia State
and<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:22.230> secondary<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.239> offensive<00:02:24.239> line<00:02:24.450> are

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and the secondary and offensive line are

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.890 
and the secondary and offensive line are
our<00:02:24.959> biggest<00:02:25.310> places<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.459> need<00:02:26.760> probably<00:02:27.299> we

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
our biggest places of need probably we

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.300 
our biggest places of need probably we
really<00:02:28.140> need<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.379> recruit<00:02:28.590> heavily<00:02:28.860> for<00:02:29.159> there

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
really need to recruit heavily for there

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.369 
really need to recruit heavily for there
we<00:02:29.519> have<00:02:29.760> Georgia<00:02:30.180> as<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.629> pipeline<00:02:30.840> state

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
we have Georgia as the pipeline state

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.680 
we have Georgia as the pipeline state
and<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:32.040> think<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.459> might<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.390> edge<00:02:33.510> of

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
and I think we might be on the edge of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.080 
and I think we might be on the edge of
losing<00:02:33.870> Florida<00:02:34.409> as<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.769> pipeline<00:02:35.099> state<00:02:35.610> but

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
losing Florida as a pipeline state but

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.330 
losing Florida as a pipeline state but
we'll<00:02:36.209> see<00:02:36.390> how<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.810> goes<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.500> overall<00:02:38.190> a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
we'll see how that goes so overall a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.330 
we'll see how that goes so overall a
very<00:02:38.519> senior<00:02:39.360> heavy<00:02:39.629> roster<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.530> recruiting

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
very senior heavy roster and recruiting

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.850 
very senior heavy roster and recruiting
will<00:02:41.459> have<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.819> done<00:02:42.319> during<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.470> season

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
will have to be done during the season

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.339

to<00:02:44.129> get<00:02:44.459> more<00:02:44.700> people<00:02:44.819> in<00:02:45.060> here<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:46.170> we're

system<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.950> little<00:03:26.130> bit<00:03:26.280> around<00:03:26.669> and<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.959> seems

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
system a little bit around and it seems

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.640 
system a little bit around and it seems
to<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:29.430> better<00:03:29.760> fit<00:03:30.090> for<00:03:30.120> me<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:31.200> the
