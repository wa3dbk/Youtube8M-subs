00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.059
 in this new tutorial where vi 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.230
 i will show how to install very long 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.239
 minecraft launcher sp 1.6.2 then 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.690
 first the link that will put it in 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.360
 description there is this open you open it 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.949
 you played it to load the page 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.589
 after who then on this basis 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:54.890
 download ok once you have 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.320
 downloaded the file andrÃ¨ where the v 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.830
 reserved in my case on the desktop and it 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.030
 open with guitar of course because one 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.860
 archive to give 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.680
 then go to the desktop and I believe one 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.920
 new folder and renamed it with the 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.659
 name you prefer and within 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.360
 this part of the file is damaged 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.130
 that present in the archive and carle in 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.250
 this way 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:23.600
 then open the latter then 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.350
 first time it will open will ask you 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.340
 must while the new directory of 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.439
 minecraft precisely 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.570
 now I advise you to do the key 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.850
 right of this white space here do 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.610
 new folder and write wine and craft 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.549
 then selected that in this one 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.890
 make card open and where away 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.540
 click ok now a car will open 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.299
 but the lancer and you should get out one 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.820
 finger and with water this bar here 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.619
 and soon after in this bar will have to 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.450
 be there another mind bar that will be 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.580
 closed here that will have to load and dro 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.040
 get here eventually this 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.560
 may mean that the angers a 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.820
 download the files you need 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.140
 precisely to create the stitch look 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.790
 minecraft then while downloading 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.150
 these files where to have the connection 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.269

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.610

 antonio and then we click on play 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.079

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.870
