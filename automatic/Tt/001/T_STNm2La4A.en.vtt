looks<00:02:06.990> pretty<00:02:07.170> good<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.680> course<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
looks pretty good of course I like the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.779 
looks pretty good of course I like the
graphics<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> graphics<00:02:09.989> are

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
graphics I think the graphics are

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.509 
graphics I think the graphics are
sharp<00:02:11.030> now<00:02:11.299> and<00:02:11.890> it's<00:02:12.890> like<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.040> lot<00:02:13.310> more

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
sharp now and it's like a lot more

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.380 
sharp now and it's like a lot more
beautiful<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.810> visualize<00:02:15.469> a<00:02:15.640> 3d<00:02:16.640> world<00:02:17.030> in

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
beautiful to to visualize a 3d world in

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.630 
beautiful to to visualize a 3d world in
HD<00:02:17.930> graphics<00:02:18.409> in<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.709> cartoony<00:02:19.280> sort<00:02:19.519> of

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
HD graphics in that cartoony sort of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.550 
HD graphics in that cartoony sort of
Mario<00:02:19.939> Kart<00:02:20.150> style<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.629> like<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.049> graphics<00:02:21.290> a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
Mario Kart style I like the graphics a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.050 
Mario Kart style I like the graphics a
lot<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.219> think<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:22.579> great<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:22.849> they're

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
lot and I think it's great that they're

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.030 
lot and I think it's great that they're
really<00:02:23.480> using<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:23.989> we<00:02:24.200> use<00:02:24.379> power<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.890> their

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
really using that we use power to their

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.220 
really using that we use power to their
advantage<00:02:25.250> but<00:02:25.969> besides<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.629> graphics<00:02:27.140> and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
advantage but besides the graphics and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.660 
advantage but besides the graphics and
things<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.590> because<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.220> already<00:02:28.340> kind

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
things of that because we already kind

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.250 
things of that because we already kind
of<00:02:28.760> expect<00:02:29.239> that<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.480> graphics<00:02:29.930> are<00:02:30.049> going<00:02:30.200> to

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
of expect that the graphics are going to

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.050 
of expect that the graphics are going to
be<00:02:30.349> really<00:02:30.620> sharp<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.519> thing<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.879> I'm

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
be really sharp the thing that I'm

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.119 
be really sharp the thing that I'm
really<00:02:32.090> focused<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:32.900> personally<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.859> the
