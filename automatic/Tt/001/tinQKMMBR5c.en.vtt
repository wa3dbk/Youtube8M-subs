generic this I believe is 12 blocks of
wood<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.579> by<00:00:33.270> 12<00:00:33.660> blocks<00:00:34.020> just<00:00:34.260> another

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
wood here by 12 blocks just another

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.870 
wood here by 12 blocks just another
square<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.070> did<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> kitchen<00:00:35.730> and

going to I don't really know it's just

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.830 
going to I don't really know it's just
kind<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.030> design<00:02:15.360> there's<00:02:15.690> nothing

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
kind of a design there's nothing

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.500

using a new shader pack today it legs a
lot<00:02:31.350> less<00:02:31.560> than<00:02:31.740> roodal<00:02:31.950> plays<00:02:32.130> it's<00:02:32.310> not

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
lot less than roodal plays it's not

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.310 
lot less than roodal plays it's not
quite<00:02:32.730> as<00:02:32.940> beautiful<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.690> does<00:02:33.840> leg<00:02:34.020> less
