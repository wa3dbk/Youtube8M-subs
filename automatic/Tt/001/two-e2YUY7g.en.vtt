you<00:00:33.660> get<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> cool<00:00:35.610> thing<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.850> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
you get to go and the cool thing is it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.520 
you get to go and the cool thing is it
does<00:00:36.390> come<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.750> pump<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.260> you're<00:00:37.380> familiar

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
does come with a pump if you're familiar

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.069 
does come with a pump if you're familiar
with<00:00:37.829> now<00:00:38.070> snarls<00:00:38.640> foundations<00:00:39.300> normally<00:00:39.989> you

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
with now snarls foundations normally you

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.479 
with now snarls foundations normally you
don't<00:00:40.170> get<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> pump<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.129> pay<00:00:41.280> extra

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
don't get the pump you have to pay extra

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.910 
don't get the pump you have to pay extra
but<00:00:42.270> kinda<00:00:42.660> i<00:00:42.690> think<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.320> still<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.890> pay

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
but kinda i think you still have to pay

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.830 
but kinda i think you still have to pay
extra<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.670> pump<00:00:44.969> even<00:00:45.300> though<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.629> comes

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
extra for this pump even though it comes

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.170 
extra for this pump even though it comes
with<00:00:46.110> because<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.860> foundation<00:00:47.399> does<00:00:47.430> retail

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
with because this foundation does retail

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.880 
with because this foundation does retail
for<00:00:48.360> forty-eight<00:00:48.750> dollars<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.320> believe<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
for forty-eight dollars I believe the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.209 
for forty-eight dollars I believe the
other<00:00:50.070> networks<00:00:50.489> foundations<00:00:51.149> are<00:00:51.449> around

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
other networks foundations are around

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.069 
other networks foundations are around
$45<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.090> couple<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.539> dollars<00:00:54.690> more

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
$45 so it is a couple of dollars more

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.470 
$45 so it is a couple of dollars more
but<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.800> do<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> pump<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.090> extra

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
but you do get the pump for the extra

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.810 
but you do get the pump for the extra
couple<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.109> bucks<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.219> cool<00:00:59.579> thing<00:00:59.609> is

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
couple of bucks now the cool thing is

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.090 
couple of bucks now the cool thing is
that<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.510> comes<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.230> 20<00:01:01.680> shades<00:01:01.890> i

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
that this actually comes in 20 shades i

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.549 
that this actually comes in 20 shades i
believe<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.510> different<00:01:03.840> variations<00:01:04.439> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
believe and it's different variations of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.649 
believe and it's different variations of
the<00:01:04.680> shade<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.400> know<00:01:05.549> normally<00:01:06.030> with<00:01:06.360> somehow
