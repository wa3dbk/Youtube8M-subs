00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
this metal detector has been really good

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.650 
this metal detector has been really good
for<00:04:44.630> me<00:04:44.890> it's<00:04:46.120> something<00:04:47.120> that's<00:04:47.360> available

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
for me it's something that's available

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.190 
for me it's something that's available
for<00:04:48.200> about<00:04:48.410> four<00:04:48.770> hundred<00:04:48.890> dollars<00:04:49.070> online

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
for about four hundred dollars online

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.390 
for about four hundred dollars online
and<00:04:51.200> it's<00:04:51.350> considered<00:04:51.950> an<00:04:52.070> entry<00:04:52.370> level

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
and it's considered an entry level

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.930 
and it's considered an entry level
detector<00:04:53.360> but<00:04:54.350> it's<00:04:55.130> really<00:04:55.610> something<00:04:55.820> you

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
detector but it's really something you

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.530 
detector but it's really something you
can<00:04:56.120> use<00:04:56.150> right<00:04:56.660> out<00:04:56.870> of<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.410> box<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:58.010> I<00:04:58.790> had

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
can use right out of the box and I had

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.490 
can use right out of the box and I had
no<00:04:59.810> problem<00:05:01.270> finding<00:05:02.270> coins<00:05:02.750> I<00:05:03.110> mean

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
no problem finding coins I mean

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.320 
no problem finding coins I mean
immediately<00:05:03.830> when<00:05:04.550> I<00:05:04.580> started<00:05:04.940> using<00:05:05.120> the

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
immediately when I started using the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.520 
immediately when I started using the
Fisher<00:05:05.630> f4<00:05:06.080> so<00:05:06.470> that's<00:05:07.190> been<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.520> really<00:05:07.730> cool

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
Fisher f4 so that's been a really cool

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.360 
Fisher f4 so that's been a really cool
purchase<00:05:09.530> for<00:05:09.770> me<00:05:09.920> then<00:05:10.760> last<00:05:11.390> month<00:05:12.370> actually

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
in February I upgraded to an e track

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.670 
in February I upgraded to an e track
minelab<00:05:17.960> etrac<00:05:18.760> which<00:05:19.760> has<00:05:20.660> really<00:05:21.140> really

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
minelab etrac which has really really

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.220 
minelab etrac which has really really
been<00:05:21.980> nice<00:05:23.500> pros<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:24.740> cons<00:05:25.660> etrack<00:05:26.660> obviously

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
been nice pros and cons etrack obviously

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.360 
been nice pros and cons etrack obviously
you're<00:05:27.350> going<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.530> get<00:05:27.620> a<00:05:27.680> lot<00:05:27.740> more<00:05:27.890> depth

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
you're going to get a lot more depth

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.450 
you're going to get a lot more depth
you're<00:05:28.910> going<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.210> get<00:05:29.419> a<00:05:29.780> lot<00:05:30.020> better<00:05:30.440> ID<00:05:30.860> on

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
you're going to get a lot better ID on

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.170 
you're going to get a lot better ID on
what's<00:05:31.790> down<00:05:32.090> there

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
what's down there

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.850 
what's down there
I've<00:05:34.180> been<00:05:34.659> able<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:34.930> pull<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.139> lot<00:05:35.199> of<00:05:35.349> nickels

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
I've been able to pull a lot of nickels

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.390 
I've been able to pull a lot of nickels
for<00:05:35.949> instance<00:05:37.199> nickels<00:05:38.199> on<00:05:38.409> the<00:05:38.469> Fisher<00:05:39.129> come

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
for instance nickels on the Fisher come

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.270 
for instance nickels on the Fisher come
up<00:05:39.550> as<00:05:39.759> pull<00:05:40.060> tabs<00:05:40.360> and<00:05:40.780> so<00:05:41.199> unless<00:05:41.680> I<00:05:41.830> want<00:05:42.099> to

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
up as pull tabs and so unless I want to

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.850 
up as pull tabs and so unless I want to
dig<00:05:42.789> 50<00:05:43.300> pull<00:05:43.509> tabs<00:05:43.750> for<00:05:43.990> every<00:05:44.229> nickel<00:05:44.500> I

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
dig 50 pull tabs for every nickel I

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.920 
dig 50 pull tabs for every nickel I
pretty<00:05:45.370> much<00:05:45.460> leave<00:05:45.789> those<00:05:45.969> alone<00:05:46.000> but<00:05:46.689> with

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
pretty much leave those alone but with

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.709 
pretty much leave those alone but with
the<00:05:47.800> e-track<00:05:48.280> there's<00:05:49.270> a<00:05:49.360> definite

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
the e-track there's a definite

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.420 
the e-track there's a definite
difference<00:05:49.900> between<00:05:50.469> a<00:05:50.500> nickel<00:05:50.919> and<00:05:51.159> a<00:05:51.219> pull

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
difference between a nickel and a pull

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.080 
difference between a nickel and a pull
tab<00:05:51.639> so<00:05:52.300> nine<00:05:53.139> times<00:05:53.169> out<00:05:53.560> of<00:05:53.590> ten<00:05:53.710> I<00:05:54.219> can

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
tab so nine times out of ten I can

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.909 
tab so nine times out of ten I can
identify<00:05:55.210> a<00:05:55.659> nickel<00:05:57.659> the<00:05:58.659> e-track<00:05:59.620> is<00:05:59.889> a

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
identify a nickel the e-track is a

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.490 
identify a nickel the e-track is a
little<00:06:00.280> bit<00:06:00.370> heavier<00:06:00.819> than<00:06:01.300> the<00:06:01.840> fishing<00:06:02.259> the

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
little bit heavier than the fishing the

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.730 
little bit heavier than the fishing the
Fisher<00:06:02.889> f4<00:06:03.520> is<00:06:03.550> a<00:06:03.729> really<00:06:04.240> light<00:06:04.599> unit<00:06:05.050> you<00:06:05.560> can

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
Fisher f4 is a really light unit you can

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.409 
Fisher f4 is a really light unit you can
go<00:06:05.889> for<00:06:06.099> hours<00:06:06.250> on<00:06:06.669> that<00:06:06.819> thing<00:06:07.090> but<00:06:07.300> the

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
go for hours on that thing but the

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.140 
go for hours on that thing but the
e-track<00:06:07.779> is<00:06:07.990> a<00:06:08.020> little<00:06:08.379> bit<00:06:08.529> heavier<00:06:08.949> so<00:06:09.400> going

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
e-track is a little bit heavier so going

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.640 
e-track is a little bit heavier so going
to<00:06:10.180> play<00:06:10.360> around<00:06:10.449> with<00:06:10.719> some<00:06:10.840> coils<00:06:11.319> on<00:06:11.469> that

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
to play around with some coils on that

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.420 
to play around with some coils on that
each<00:06:11.830> rack<00:06:12.069> as<00:06:12.279> well<00:06:12.550> this<00:06:13.270> summer<00:06:13.599> so<00:06:14.560> we'll

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
each rack as well this summer so we'll

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.570 
each rack as well this summer so we'll
see<00:06:15.610> what<00:06:15.729> happens<00:06:15.879> with<00:06:16.210> that<00:06:16.270> but<00:06:16.810> anyway

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
see what happens with that but anyway

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.890 
see what happens with that but anyway
just<00:06:18.580> thought<00:06:18.699> I'd<00:06:18.909> let<00:06:19.120> you<00:06:19.599> have<00:06:19.779> a<00:06:19.810> little

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
just thought I'd let you have a little

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.809 
just thought I'd let you have a little
look<00:06:20.110> at<00:06:20.229> my<00:06:20.349> detectors<00:06:20.919> and<00:06:21.219> what<00:06:21.699> I'm

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:21.819 
look at my detectors and what I'm

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:23.820 
look at my detectors and what I'm
working<00:06:22.000> with<00:06:22.180> and<00:06:23.080> then<00:06:23.229> also<00:06:23.379> I<00:06:23.529> got<00:06:23.590> some

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
working with and then also I got some

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.769 
working with and then also I got some
digging<00:06:24.129> tools<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:24.879> some<00:06:25.270> things<00:06:25.509> that<00:06:25.659> have

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
digging tools and some things that have

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.519 
digging tools and some things that have
helped<00:06:26.080> out<00:06:27.210> about<00:06:28.210> that<00:06:28.360> Samson<00:06:28.870> T<00:06:29.080> shovel

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:29.529 
helped out about that Samson T shovel

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.909 
helped out about that Samson T shovel
which<00:06:30.400> is<00:06:30.610> really<00:06:30.939> nice<00:06:31.180> for<00:06:32.080> for<00:06:32.469> digging<00:06:32.680> in

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
which is really nice for for digging in

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.490 
which is really nice for for digging in
fields<00:06:33.370> that<00:06:33.520> little<00:06:34.210> eshe<00:06:34.389> knife<00:06:34.689> is<00:06:35.020> great

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
fields that little eshe knife is great

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.040 
fields that little eshe knife is great
it's<00:06:35.770> all<00:06:36.250> it's<00:06:36.400> cracked<00:06:36.580> up<00:06:36.789> to<00:06:36.849> be<00:06:36.969> I<00:06:37.270> tend<00:06:38.020> to

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
it's all it's cracked up to be I tend to

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.480 
it's all it's cracked up to be I tend to
bring<00:06:38.199> that<00:06:38.440> into<00:06:38.770> the<00:06:38.889> parks<00:06:39.219> and<00:06:39.460> things

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
bring that into the parks and things

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.010 
bring that into the parks and things
like<00:06:39.789> that<00:06:39.849> where<00:06:40.240> people<00:06:40.599> might<00:06:40.750> be<00:06:40.930> a<00:06:40.960> little

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
like that where people might be a little

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.839 
like that where people might be a little
leery<00:06:41.409> if<00:06:41.560> they<00:06:41.710> see<00:06:41.770> you<00:06:42.009> with<00:06:42.039> a<00:06:42.219> shovel<00:06:42.310> and

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
leery if they see you with a shovel and

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.149 
leery if they see you with a shovel and
then<00:06:43.360> of<00:06:43.449> course<00:06:43.479> the<00:06:43.930> garret<00:06:44.319> pro<00:06:44.529> pointer<00:06:44.979> is

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:45.159 
then of course the garret pro pointer is

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:47.579 
then of course the garret pro pointer is
a<00:06:45.190> must<00:06:45.639> have<00:06:45.849> for<00:06:45.909> any<00:06:46.270> metal<00:06:46.659> detector<00:06:47.139> so

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:47.589 
a must have for any metal detector so
