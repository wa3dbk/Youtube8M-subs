it's done now it's very information poor
so<00:01:22.150> environment<00:01:23.150> we<00:01:23.270> know<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.690> very

to make this an information-rich

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.440 
to make this an information-rich
endeavor<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.560> in<00:01:42.830> that<00:01:43.009> sense<00:01:43.360> once<00:01:44.360> you

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
endeavor and and in that sense once you

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.240 
endeavor and and in that sense once you
have<00:01:44.720> a<00:01:45.110> lot<00:01:45.320> of<00:01:45.350> information<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.160> you<00:01:46.220> can

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
have a lot of information and you can

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.130 
have a lot of information and you can
capture<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.759> information<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.509> process<00:01:47.750> it

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
capture that information and process it

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.870 
capture that information and process it
then<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.830> can<00:01:49.039> have<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.250> much<00:01:49.550> better

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
then you can have a much better

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.200 
then you can have a much better
assessment<00:01:50.810> tools<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:52.280> different<00:01:52.700> in

in<00:02:15.180> my<00:02:15.480> opinions<00:02:15.990> are<00:02:16.110> challenges<00:02:16.650> from<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
in my opinions are challenges from the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.820 
in my opinions are challenges from the
beginning<00:02:17.459> as<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.060> go<00:02:18.240> about<00:02:18.780> designing<00:02:19.320> your

bioinformatics side of it and to me the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.920 
bioinformatics side of it and to me the
biggest<00:02:36.180> challenge<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.620> bring<00:02:38.930> all

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
biggest challenge is to bring all

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.470 
biggest challenge is to bring all
different<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:41.340> angles<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:41.970> project<00:02:42.390> in

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
different like angles of the project in

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.350 
different like angles of the project in
terms<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.720> expertise<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.760> and

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
terms of expertise and and and and and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.080 
terms of expertise and and and and and
then<00:02:45.989> amalgamate<00:02:46.980> them<00:02:47.190> together<00:02:47.640> so<00:02:48.060> that

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
then amalgamate them together so that

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.420 
then amalgamate them together so that
they<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.989> handle<00:02:49.230> different<00:02:49.860> challenges

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
they can handle different challenges

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.060 
they can handle different challenges
within<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.030> process<00:02:51.570> like<00:02:52.350> for<00:02:52.380> example<00:02:52.680> in

within this process like for example in

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.440 
within this process like for example in
the<00:02:53.160> sampling<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.850> need<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.150> be<00:02:54.269> cautious

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
the sampling you need to be cautious

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.479 
the sampling you need to be cautious
about<00:02:54.750> logistics<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.950> need<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.160> be<00:02:56.280> conscious

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
about logistics you need to be conscious

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.300 
about logistics you need to be conscious
about<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.900> know<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.560> amount<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.070> work<00:02:59.250> that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
about you know the amount of work that

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.449 
about you know the amount of work that
it<00:02:59.790> requires<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.420> go<00:03:00.570> somewhere<00:03:00.989> remote<00:03:01.459> and

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
it requires to go somewhere remote and

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.729 
it requires to go somewhere remote and
and<00:03:02.820> so<00:03:03.030> your<00:03:03.180> methods<00:03:03.690> need<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.350> tweaked

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
and so your methods need to be tweaked

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.750 
and so your methods need to be tweaked
to<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:06.630> address<00:03:06.989> that<00:03:07.170> angle<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.519> then

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
to to address that angle and and then

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.610 
to to address that angle and and then
when<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.209> comes<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.630> doing<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.049> sequencing

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
when it comes to doing the sequencing

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.070 
when it comes to doing the sequencing
you<00:03:10.709> need<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.920> be<00:03:11.040> aware<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.280> costs<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:12.080> biases

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
you need to be aware of costs and biases

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.630 
you need to be aware of costs and biases
and<00:03:13.230> all<00:03:13.350> those<00:03:13.530> things<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.010> at<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.220> end<00:03:14.400> to

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
and all those things and at the end to

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.860 
and all those things and at the end to
quantitative<00:03:14.820> approaches<00:03:15.510> and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
quantitative approaches and

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.319 
quantitative approaches and
bioinformatics<00:03:16.230> which<00:03:17.160> you<00:03:17.310> really<00:03:17.489> need<00:03:17.790> in

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
bioinformatics which you really need in

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.000 
bioinformatics which you really need in
order<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.750> make<00:03:18.870> sense<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.440> information

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
order to make sense of the information

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:29.610 
order to make sense of the information
so

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.589 

that<00:03:30.620> is<00:03:30.800> probably<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.310> most<00:03:31.610> important<00:03:32.420> and

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
that is probably the most important and

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.009 
that is probably the most important and
difficult<00:03:33.190> challenge<00:03:34.190> for<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:34.970> DNA<00:03:35.330> or

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
difficult challenge for the DNA or

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.089 
difficult challenge for the DNA or
genomics<00:03:37.959> tools<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.290> technologies<00:03:39.920> and

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
genomics tools and technologies and

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.820 
genomics tools and technologies and
approaches<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.930> get<00:03:42.080> in<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.260> hands<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.590> users

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
approaches to get in the hands of users

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.670 
approaches to get in the hands of users
and<00:03:43.250> getting<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.060> real<00:03:44.239> world<00:03:44.690> applications

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
and getting the real world applications

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.910 
and getting the real world applications
and<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.989> really<00:03:47.989> think<00:03:48.170> that<00:03:48.970> we<00:03:49.970> are<00:03:50.120> at<00:03:50.239> a<00:03:50.360> very

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
and I really think that we are at a very

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.289 
and I really think that we are at a very
like<00:03:51.920> critical<00:03:52.370> juncture<00:03:52.879> with<00:03:53.030> all<00:03:53.180> these

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
like critical juncture with all these

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.089 
like critical juncture with all these
new<00:03:53.360> technologies<00:03:53.900> now<00:03:54.379> they<00:03:54.620> are<00:03:54.680> becoming

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
new technologies now they are becoming

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.550 
new technologies now they are becoming
more<00:03:55.250> mainstream<00:03:55.519> which<00:03:56.209> is<00:03:56.390> really<00:03:56.599> good<00:03:56.870> but

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
more mainstream which is really good but

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.220 
more mainstream which is really good but
on<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.830> other<00:03:57.920> hand<00:03:58.360> in<00:03:59.360> order<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.810> address

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
on the other hand in order to address

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.319 
on the other hand in order to address
the<00:04:00.590> challenge<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.220> regulatory<00:04:01.760> side<00:04:02.180> and

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
the challenge of regulatory side and

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.270 
the challenge of regulatory side and
policy<00:04:02.750> side<00:04:02.959> only<00:04:03.530> thing<00:04:03.829> that<00:04:03.980> we<00:04:04.099> should

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
policy side only thing that we should

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.910 
policy side only thing that we should
work<00:04:04.610> with<00:04:05.120> those<00:04:05.299> agencies<00:04:05.750> from<00:04:06.709> the

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
work with those agencies from the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.830 
work with those agencies from the
beginning<00:04:07.370> of<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.640> projects<00:04:08.090> don't<00:04:08.299> wait<00:04:08.540> all

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
beginning of the projects don't wait all

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.259 
beginning of the projects don't wait all
the<00:04:09.170> way<00:04:09.200> till<00:04:09.680> we<00:04:09.950> have<00:04:10.099> a<00:04:10.130> product<00:04:10.579> or<00:04:10.880> we

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
the way till we have a product or we

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.589 
the way till we have a product or we
have<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.480> method<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.140> then<00:04:12.590> go<00:04:12.799> and<00:04:12.950> try<00:04:13.160> to

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
have a method and then go and try to

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.509 
have a method and then go and try to
lobby<00:04:14.599> with<00:04:14.900> these<00:04:15.019> guys<00:04:15.170> because<00:04:15.290> those<00:04:16.160> guys

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
lobby with these guys because those guys

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.039 
lobby with these guys because those guys
who<00:04:16.760> are<00:04:16.880> developing<00:04:17.359> these<00:04:17.510> policies<00:04:17.959> they

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
who are developing these policies they

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.599 
who are developing these policies they
have<00:04:18.200> other<00:04:18.290> requirements<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.160> we<00:04:19.310> may<00:04:19.430> not

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
have other requirements that we may not

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.090 
have other requirements that we may not
be<00:04:19.669> aware<00:04:20.030> of<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:21.410> in<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:21.859> way

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
be aware of and and and in this way

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.010 
be aware of and and and in this way
we're<00:04:22.430> going<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.669> basically<00:04:23.030> build<00:04:23.419> a<00:04:23.660> tool

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
we're going to basically build a tool

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.040 
we're going to basically build a tool
customized<00:04:24.889> for<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.250> needs<00:04:25.460> of<00:04:25.639> the<00:04:26.050> agency

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
customized for the needs of the agency

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.140 
customized for the needs of the agency
and<00:04:27.229> then<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.860> regulatory<00:04:28.460> side<00:04:28.729> of<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:29.030> is

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
and then the regulatory side of it is

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.480 
and then the regulatory side of it is
going<00:04:29.330> to<00:04:29.389> be<00:04:29.449> handled<00:04:30.289> a<00:04:30.350> lot<00:04:30.470> faster<00:04:30.770> in<00:04:31.280> this

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
going to be handled a lot faster in this

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:40.820 
going to be handled a lot faster in this
sense

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.890 

you
