00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 now , my love 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.210
 then this 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.210
 Peruvian 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.320
 very well there we have it that can you 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.490
 say to calvià great now I guess that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.980
 many programs in Peru and in 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.689
 mexico are also listening here is 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.270
 the limiter of kiko deserves no no it 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.400
 deserves to be Peruvian says if you do not give me 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.689
 a lot of sadness, not because he says 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.940
 imagine each country 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.590
 I'm welcome, I've been working 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.690
 a lot of time and tell me I'm not 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.890
 let's say of my nationality I think of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.769
 that escaped him if I believe that 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.780
 it touched me I'm very sad for 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.239
 all things because for me the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.239
 characterize one of the most 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.519
 famous inside the neighborhood for me is 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.929
 an honor to offer affection all the 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.260
 children especially make a show 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:04.260
 where sometimes ten or fifteen people go 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.750
 and I demand that the show be given in 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.330
 the circus because I like to offer the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.680
 circus almost came down and I put 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.120
 the shoulder to be able to lift the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.010
 structure of each of the foundations 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.200
 of each of the artists and 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.840
 businessmen put the name for each 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.299
 holy as omar peñas took photographs 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.829
 on his facebook helping him also to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.920
 getting dressed at some time were 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.020
 friends were known to know now 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.649
 we are seeing and hearing what is not 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.929
 he wants to see you he does not want to know about you 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.929
 for me it is very interesting to me 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.659
 because it's a separate character like 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:42.479
 person I do not admire much but that 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.270
 have let's say a concept I think I 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.609
 wrong by different means that you 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.729
 can give information that is not like that 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:53.220
 because I introduce myself as the interpreter 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.399
 and I put the program follow me the good ones 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.130
 omar felipe peña marquez I characterized 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.799
 and interpreted and myth as they want 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.869
 call it here which character we have 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.090
 other statements a second part in 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.689
 Any case what Carlos Villagrán says 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.689
 very annoying 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.620
 and 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:24.500
 contest in mexico the best imitator of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.500
 I take advantage of it to leave it 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.349
 but 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.000
 Y 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.750
 2000 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.750
 then this call 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.049
 what do you want to say at this moment to 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.989
 Carlos Villagrán who is watching it in 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.540
 this moment can tell you here two gifts 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.629
 carlos villagrán eslava tell you all 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.120
 respect and consideration that I do not use your 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.709
 picture did not use his name the picture 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.140
 that is in the circus in the part of 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.700
 front is a photograph is that of the sea or 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.409
 in the one of carlos villagrán that you 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.940
 they can see that they have to teach them 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.329
 where I am with the ball I am here 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.540
 it's a huge back guide where I'm at 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:15.440
 so in this position and there it is 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.620
 omar felipe pina marquez and now two 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.299
 things that you say to me delinquent 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.109
 particular this is the photograph of 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.970
 omar is omar to me it makes me what is 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.269
 kiko good to be touched calloia great 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.829
 that's not I'm talking about the shore is 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.079
 the art of the circus 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.260
 is our art is art has to 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.349
 see it on its main cover that way 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.440
 that one down there already represented by 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:47.060
 omar felipe anarchist pineapple lubián a la 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.990
 image precisely about the 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.430
 company 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.070
 the company has already talked about that 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.120
 with the lady vekic and then the lord 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.740
 Carlos Piñana stated that this issue much 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.410
 before this comes out we already 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.750
 We had clarified by Carlos Villagrán 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.730
 before unloading in Peru still a 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.470
 I mean contact you Mr. 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.110
 Carlos Villagrán as at some point 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.470
 we have told him, videos have arrived 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.019
 you have arrived incomplete picture 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.489
 we will see below we can see it you 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.370
 I tell you here 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.430
 omar feels very sad I notice noto 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.860
 suddenly I tell you that much sadness 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.260
 for listening to all this because it says 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.450
 he instead of wanting me day thanks for 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.480
 imitate kiko tells me of 50 and they are 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.430
 serious words if I think that is 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.590
 an opener tremendously of heart by 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.380
 the sensitivity and the trajectory that 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.000
 I have myself watching from one of the 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.000
 great as 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.810
 with Don Carlos and especially the quality 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.250
 as always the one that was 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:57.390
 escape sometimes in a way I think to 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.220
 times things but I feel very 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.990
 sad because when I wear the 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.840
 character this shirt when I wear 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.810
 each of dress the 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.980
 let's say with all the affection of the 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.780
 world 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.180
 I come to interpret it as it should be 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.640
 like when that character was from 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.120
 the year I tell you a long time ago 70 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.220
 up to 78 with its characteristics that 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.400
 shut up shut up the act left smile 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:26.220
 what things do not do not feel I feel that 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.960
 It gives a lot of clarity is very important 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.080
 suddenly have that character have it 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.960
 done and that this word is heard 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.200
 I want to be with you because I would like to 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.990
 tell you 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.810
 you do not punish me all taste that way 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:47.870
 because I think I do not deserve it 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.260
 we have other words of Carlos 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.260
 villagrán
