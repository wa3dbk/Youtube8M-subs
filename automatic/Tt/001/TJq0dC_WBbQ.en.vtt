00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.649
 plus 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.850
 sanding and welcome again to the show 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.180
 today we are going to teach you the 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.449
 usb functionalities that brings weaving 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.420
 700 is the let 700 incorporates 3 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.320
 functionality one allows us to use the 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.039
 USB usb devices such as mice 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.260
 keyboards printer card readers 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.150
 and even cameras the second ones we 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.520
 allows this 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.840
 but economic a battery of 4 thousand 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.700
 units but the center and you can use 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.500
 as a portable battery to recharge 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.080
 other phones and the third is that 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.360
 from the 700 you can make the memory 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.270
 internal of other phones we are going to 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.910
 demonstrate one to one first we start 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.770
 with demonstrating connecting others 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.660
 usb devices this you have here is 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.580
 an adapter or also called a cable 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.830
 hotel head you can come in others 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.300
 formats all the touches have already or 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.180
 have implemented so the only thing that 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.920
 you have to do is click it here and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.920
 here we have for example a mouse 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.370
 we click 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.630
 you see it lights up and now you can 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.090
 use the time to leave the phone 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.909
 who says a mouse says a keyboard 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.840
 reader readers are also allowed 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.150
 card and keyboards including cameras and 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.100
 printers other very functionality 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.690
 interesting and what can be or is very 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.360
 useful especially when you are out with 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.400
 your 700 is that thanks to your battery 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.110
 of 4000 milliamps you can recharge 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.790
 other devices here we have a keys 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.220
 min 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.050
 we simply connect 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.050
 and as you can see it already detects 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.300
 the device and now 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.390
 as you can see 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.870
 it is loading it you see the icon 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.720
 that is loading is loading 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.400
 the kissimmee from the 700's though this 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.460
 be a gossip of our company load 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.530
 any other usb device and the 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.690
 latest functionality that the 700 axis brings 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.280
 is that it allows you to connect devices 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.890
 of internal storage as per 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.230
 example this usb we show connect 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.569
 is recognizing 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.280
 let's miss mayer what you ask us 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.030
 if we want to put the external memory 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.840
 as storage 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.860
 default that would say that I do not recommend it and 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.530
 as you can see we can enter 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.090
 directly to the content of the usb and by 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.420
 example let's see a picture so that 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.420
 see 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.730
 we can enter the content of v6 without 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.590
 problems but in addition to the usb we have 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.409
 we can connect to other devices 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.780
 as for example this card reader 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.580
 what have we put this mini sd 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.620
 Y 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.620
 we connect the same process 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.709
 as you see is recognizing and the same 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.500
 that before we go to pay manager can 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.630
 take a few seconds the first time 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.580
 tells me what to do we can access the 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.340
 content of any card that 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.900
 we can plug in these and not 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.900
 last and specify 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.850
 which can get us out of a bind 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.950
 here we have our hit man 500 850 that 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.239
 inside has an internal memory what 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.639
 we light 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.530
 and with him I left 700 and his ability to 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.329
 knit we can even access the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.739
 content of other phones which we 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.049
 It can come in handy when you do not have 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.190
 wifi or bluetooth works for us which is 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.710
 transfer large amounts of data 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.320
 this requires a little more adjustment 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.880
 than the previous ones you have to connect it 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.880
 as it is already loading 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.660
 it's like I told you this one has a 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.370
 difference with connecting a usb other is 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.010
 that you have to activate the storage 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.819
 by usb so that this works 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.499
 functionality is now 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.090
 is recognizing the inner love of 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:18.090
 this phone we give a few seconds 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.580
 and right now you can from this mobile 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.699
 access what you have the other mobile by 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.740
 example let's see if we have any 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.740
 photo not this one is empty 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.900
 to be able to another 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.060
 good is a new mobile then no 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.740
 we have nothing that we can transfer 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.890
 some other but it could be for example 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.270
 go to this mobile and if we have any photo 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.270
 in this 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.940
 if we have some photos here 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.350
 we can 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.710
 copy and pass the other phone with only 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.940
 this cable cited that it costs 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.230
 one euro one dollar to change with a lot 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.210
 and your charging charger cable 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.520
 normal you can transfer information from 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:13.050
 one other phone at the speed of 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.050
 usb now we enter here 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.500
 I leave it here 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.130
 Y 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.130
 we discount 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.890
 and as you can as you can see we have 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.720
 seen we have passed the photo of a 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.150
 phone to the other without wifi without bluetooth 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.100
 without anything and usb speeds we can 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.970
 from this phone access memory 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.970
 from other phones 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.680
 to
