00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.170
 and there is the departure of the Milan now 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.740
 a little uncomfortable because it was the 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.740
 Chilean but 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.480
 but without any continuity or jota 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.289
 fonda for Bonaventure Bonaventure 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.660
 You can can score Buenaventura goal 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.570
 can and marked an adventure like 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.010
 buenaventura the 0-1 go I hope that it 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 then have to follow the goal as a 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:35.480
 adventure 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:38.850
 but the first time they play a great 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 first debut with goal and this we are 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.149
 saying surely he's going to have to 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.500
 Spark the palms where they put the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.699
 0-1 because I was being very milan 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.400
 superior and you're looking at the picture very 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.440
 passive training and at the end 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.960
 end of letting handle is lucky 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.699
 because it 's a ball that does not go to hong 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960
 dale has a defender of the palms of 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.460
 every round and I'll solve it in 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.430
 good fortune then it happens of braking 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.140
 ristovski is trying to close some 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.329
 adventure is going to the other side remains 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.910
 and well, this goal will force the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.350
 palms do something other than what 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.780
 I was doing 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.119
 that he really liked the ability to 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.330
 sacrifice also in the party that 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.280
 game me nc in ante the lazio but I 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.500
 I think fundamentally what you have 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.909
 is the ability to generate football 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.250
 as we are seeing is to return to 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.090
 great pass team of jeremy mÃ©nez abate 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.100
 eye go golazo marked forget background 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.830
 goal of honda that finishes a phenomenal 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.830
 played a spectacular move really 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.770
 wonderful the action of milan a ball 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.560
 perfect cross of jeremy mÃ©nez la 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.210
 rise mark of the abbe's house for a 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.159
 perfect center and how it arrives wave that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.310
 great goal has made the miracle launched the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.500
 milan and precious the play of mn that I 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.119
 I said it generates a lot of game, just look at it 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.979
 that ball is already abate that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.390
 principle appears on the right side 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.210
 how he likes to appear to him and then the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.649
 pass that takes advantage of the Japanese background that 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.909
 either head will have gotten many 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.310
 goals by the way like Antonio 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.200
 cassano and good matches is getting 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.390
 favorite at the end the party that is 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.369
 being attractive even though he arrived 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.000
 of the palms is below the level that 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.000
 can you give this equipment 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:16.010
 immediately and the parma 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.629
 fantastic perfect
