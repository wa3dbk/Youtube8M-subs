most

00:06:39.989 --> 00:06:39.999 
most

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:48.129 
most
my<00:06:40.659> skills<00:06:41.519> masterly<00:06:42.549> at<00:06:43.239> crane

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.709 

okay<00:06:48.259> so<00:06:48.319> I'm<00:06:48.830> just<00:06:48.860> going<00:06:49.280> to<00:06:49.580> show<00:06:50.150> that<00:06:50.180> see

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
okay so I'm just going to show that see

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:53.200 
okay so I'm just going to show that see
if<00:06:50.870> I<00:06:50.990> can<00:06:51.169> make<00:06:51.289> it<00:06:51.409> snow<00:06:51.530> one<00:06:52.099> while<00:06:53.060> I'm

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
if I can make it snow one while I'm

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:01.749 

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:05.399 

no<00:07:02.749> I<00:07:02.779> can't

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:05.409 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:09.399 

so<00:07:06.430> yeah<00:07:07.430> I<00:07:07.819> think<00:07:08.180> that's<00:07:08.719> about<00:07:08.900> it

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:09.409

as you can see this snow everywhere

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.600 
as you can see this snow everywhere

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
looks really cool if you want to install

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.649 
looks really cool if you want to install
this<00:07:17.029> if<00:07:17.810> you<00:07:18.439> made<00:07:18.650> a<00:07:18.680> copy<00:07:18.979> of<00:07:19.340> the<00:07:19.849> game<00:07:20.270> you

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:20.659 
this if you made a copy of the game you

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:23.619 
this if you made a copy of the game you
can<00:07:20.900> basically<00:07:21.110> just<00:07:21.560> read<00:07:21.770> that<00:07:22.009> over<00:07:22.270> and<00:07:23.270> I

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:23.629
