00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.309
 and the photos of the administrations 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.200
 and yes no no no no no it's a problem of 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.200
 head sometimes big problems 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.450
 we have seen the porsche 911 run very 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.060
 quickly the truth is that there had to be 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.550
 run faster because we are not 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.350
 here in front anyway I know that 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.630
 in one week we have lowered the car 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.369
 moment two geometries and we have done 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.379
 some springs I know it's just the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.400
 car we had made for 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.379
 use of low of white mountains of 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.739
 1989 therefore the days have passed not 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.040
 so I think you have to go 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.860
 remembering the day this will be the car 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.470
 for the rest of season oo 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.110
 we will change the German for the French yo 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.619
 I think everything is desirable if it is 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.619
 possible 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.540
 beard money problem 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.080
 the problems have 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.240
 they have more than one hair plus 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.190
 fingers down here down here when you 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.890
 I say let's say the whole situation in this 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.840
 moment and now talking seriously not 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.060
 competitions for now this is 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.830
 difficult bust with the economic situation 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.150
 there because there is a husband who 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.120
 have focused on very operations 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.030
 important and why because it's a year 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.560
 calling you bad not Olympic wheat for 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.550
 call it another way then 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.100
 we are going to make an effort 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.990
 Olympic to pass it this year I say the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.540
 brokers in general not and then 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.400
 well our illusion is to run or 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.229
 evolve is a car to go forward 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.450
 or in the car that we already have manufactured 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.610
 that only lack to mount what is everything with 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.140
 citroën base try to win this is 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.000
 our goal our goal was 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.350
 make a car because the experience is already 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.720
 have seen today I want the car the year 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.340
 last I was rolling room and I do not think 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.200
 that an important brand like citroën 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.479
 must settle for fourth place 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.130
 then we put forward an idea of 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.290
 win what do I think there is 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.270
 than to try where that project was 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.830
 a project from the point of view that 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.660
 we have it stopped but it exists that 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.610
 is and that I think with a little bit of 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.060
 lucky we have and that a little bit of 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.319
 effort that we put all 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.360
 extremes ahead today has been seen as 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.250
 the Italian ice cream in the melted a 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.340
 little and have won the English candies 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.459
 well I think it's important 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.760
 is that the championship opened up I've 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.370
 been a long time defender and here you see 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.220
 backs good is pinochet that just for 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.800
 a drug many dislikes with him but 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.040
 I congratulate that this championship has been 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.040
 open and that not only wins the s4 in 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.890
 that moment he becomes human again 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.849
 come back has has feet like to be 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.980
 searched 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.950
 don gustavo could you please have a 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.590
 moment the internal radio microphones 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.970
 be by then I say that the important thing 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.760
 is that it is again a framework that manages 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.989
 they are divided they can be you can 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.989
 go very well 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.940
 it's a problem the important thing is that 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.709
 now you can try before you could not 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.420
 try at this time is again 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.209
 human and that's the good thing and the championship 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.150
 it benefits this we look for this car 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.810
 you have to work your name truth yes I 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.459
 I think yes the first thing that the car runs 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.129
 there's enough room to work 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.830
 all forms the habit has gone very well 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.870
 I think a lot of it has also been 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.670
 and the first one that I drive it in great 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.380
 part of it suddenly has been my problem 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.040
 he is also an uncle that costs him 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.680
 adapt to cars is clear before 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.240
 it is important, of course, that the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.650
 the your response to others try the 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.070
 yours but for me this is much better 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.070
 because here 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.930
 last year that I like to run and 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.150
 run and as much as possible not always win 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.500
 you have to give it emotion but I think that 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.360
 everyone comes to have if not all 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.850
 we had to what some seriousness 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.920
 that who alone and there are some 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.660
 racing wins one of them important and 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.100
 we ourselves try to win 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.959
 and we have more fabric to cut 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.040
 that she is almost I think that this 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.870
 championship is very important for the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.220
 vegetable that there is that I think they can 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.840
 run so much the guys this is very 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.380
 new like this old that are already for 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.380
 backing out 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.780
 thank you very much to both of you and of course 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.940
 The camaraderie that is truly exemplary 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.500
 exists between these two gentlemen pulls me out 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.020
 a lot when we have to do moments 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.020
 of friends thank you very much everyone
