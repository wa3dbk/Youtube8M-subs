00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
is is a shattered lava l'union so it has

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.150 
is is a shattered lava l'union so it has
two<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:39.059> three<00:00:39.420> lava<00:00:39.719> hounds<00:00:40.200> depending<00:00:40.920> on

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
two or three lava hounds depending on

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.549 
two or three lava hounds depending on
how<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.489> play<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.690> has<00:00:42.870> two<00:00:43.230> golems

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
how you play it and it has two golems

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.220 
how you play it and it has two golems
now<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> difference<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.910> there's<00:00:45.510> also<00:00:45.780> cold

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
now the difference is there's also cold

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.680 
now the difference is there's also cold
blooded<00:00:46.590> lava<00:00:46.890> l'union<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.300> one

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
blooded lava l'union but that's with one

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.810 
blooded lava l'union but that's with one
goal<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.070> depends<00:00:50.520> heavily<00:00:50.610> on

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
goal now it really depends heavily on

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.670 
goal now it really depends heavily on
the<00:00:50.910> base<00:00:51.149> which<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.840> use<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.320> heavily

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the base which one you use and heavily

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560 
the base which one you use and heavily
on<00:00:52.890> which<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.460> you're<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:54.239> comfortable

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
on which one you're more comfortable

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.010 
on which one you're more comfortable
with<00:00:55.010> but<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.730> similar<00:00:57.480> army

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
with but really it's a similar army

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.319 
with but really it's a similar army
style<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.559> each<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.070> guess<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.000> cold

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
style to each one I guess the cold

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.810 
style to each one I guess the cold
blooded<00:01:00.600> would<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:01.590> extra<00:01:02.129> lava<00:01:02.520> hound

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
blooded would have one extra lava hound

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.850 
blooded would have one extra lava hound
over<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.480> shattered<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.830> a
