been working with something that I call

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.520 
been working with something that I call
full<00:00:08.010> spectrum<00:00:08.760> tones<00:00:09.180> now<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.020> full<00:00:10.290> spectrum

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
full spectrum tones now a full spectrum

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.930 
full spectrum tones now a full spectrum
tone<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.280> simply<00:00:11.850> a<00:00:12.119> tone<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.549> includes<00:00:14.549> all

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
tone is simply a tone that includes all

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.700 
tone is simply a tone that includes all
the<00:00:15.209> harmonics<00:00:16.100> above<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.960> so<00:00:18.960> you're<00:00:19.439> hearing

the harmonics above it so you're hearing
all<00:00:19.980> those<00:00:20.160> harmonics<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.240> inside<00:00:22.169> your

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
all those harmonics and inside your

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.739 
all those harmonics and inside your
mouth<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.740> have<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.949> great<00:00:23.550> big<00:00:23.789> resonating

mouth you have a great big resonating
chamber<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.910> to<00:00:26.910> produce<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.329> beautiful<00:00:27.449> tone

behind this upper lip and lift your

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.550 
behind this upper lip and lift your
upper<00:02:03.490> palate<00:02:04.000> inside<00:02:04.420> your<00:02:04.599> mouth<00:02:04.719> so<00:02:05.409> it's

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
upper palate inside your mouth so it's

upper palate inside your mouth so it's
like<00:02:05.709> your<00:02:05.859> ego<00:02:06.069> awning<00:02:06.459> and<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.729> upper

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
like your ego awning and the upper

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.539 
like your ego awning and the upper
palate<00:02:07.239> is<00:02:07.479> very<00:02:07.750> high<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:09.009> while<00:02:09.340> we're

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.180 

again<00:02:28.270> we're<00:02:28.510> putting<00:02:28.660> air<00:02:29.140> right<00:02:29.590> up<00:02:29.770> here

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
again we're putting air right up here

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.100 
again we're putting air right up here
and<00:02:30.430> lifting<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.030> upper<00:02:31.330> palate<00:02:31.570> that's<00:02:31.870> how

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
and lifting that upper palate that's how

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:46.390 
and lifting that upper palate that's how
we're<00:02:32.320> changing<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:33.280> Eric<00:02:33.490> director

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.539 

let<00:02:47.400> me<00:02:47.549> shoot<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.939> on<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.209> switch<00:02:52.549> next

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
let me shoot that on the switch next

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:10.140 
let me shoot that on the switch next
time

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.490 

at<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.330> point<00:03:11.629> you<00:03:11.750> should<00:03:11.780> fill<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.110> lot<00:03:12.470> a

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
at this point you should fill a lot a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.869 
at this point you should fill a lot a
month<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:14.110> exercise<00:03:15.110> your<00:03:15.290> mouth<00:03:15.440> on<00:03:15.950> inside

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879

so now you could hear the low note you

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.240 
so now you could hear the low note you
can<00:03:27.940> hear<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.360> first<00:03:28.990> octave<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
can hear the first octave and the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:40.740 
can hear the first octave and the
harmonica<00:03:30.820> beyond<00:03:31.300> that<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.720> fifth<00:03:31.990> I<00:03:39.750> get

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
harmonica beyond that the fifth I get

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.460 
harmonica beyond that the fifth I get
that<00:03:40.930> highest<00:03:41.200> one<00:03:41.590> by<00:03:41.800> again<00:03:42.570> lifting<00:03:43.570> the

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
that highest one by again lifting the

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.460 
that highest one by again lifting the
upper<00:03:44.500> palate<00:03:44.950> inside<00:03:45.490> my<00:03:46.030> mouth<00:03:46.240> so<00:03:46.660> that<00:03:46.690> the
