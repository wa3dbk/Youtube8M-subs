we<00:00:14.050> have<00:00:14.170> a<00:00:14.230> GE<00:00:14.440> washer<00:00:14.740> complaint<00:00:15.430> as<00:00:15.610> that<00:00:15.790> it

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
we have a GE washer complaint as that it

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.760 
we have a GE washer complaint as that it
is<00:00:16.030> leaking<00:00:16.540> we're<00:00:17.170> going<00:00:17.290> to<00:00:17.350> go<00:00:17.470> ahead<00:00:17.560> and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
is leaking we're going to go ahead and

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.769 
is leaking we're going to go ahead and
open<00:00:17.800> up<00:00:18.040> the<00:00:18.190> front<00:00:18.400> panel<00:00:18.760> get<00:00:19.090> inside<00:00:19.420> and

open up the front panel get inside and

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.000 
open up the front panel get inside and
see<00:00:20.140> if<00:00:20.200> we<00:00:20.290> can<00:00:20.440> find<00:00:20.860> the<00:00:20.950> leak<00:00:22.890> once<00:00:23.890> we

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
see if we can find the leak once we

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.040 
see if we can find the leak once we
opened<00:00:24.250> it<00:00:24.310> up<00:00:24.400> we<00:00:24.730> looked<00:00:25.000> inside<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.600> found

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
opened it up we looked inside and found

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.359 
opened it up we looked inside and found
there's<00:00:26.290> some<00:00:26.439> water<00:00:26.650> coming<00:00:26.950> out<00:00:27.100> of<00:00:27.160> the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
there's some water coming out of the

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.550 
there's some water coming out of the
pump<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.880> tub<00:00:28.180> hose<00:00:28.390> if<00:00:28.780> I<00:00:28.900> squeeze<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.410> hose

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
pump the tub hose if I squeeze the hose

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.020 
pump the tub hose if I squeeze the hose
we<00:00:29.830> can<00:00:29.920> kind<00:00:30.190> of<00:00:30.250> see<00:00:30.430> maybe<00:00:30.640> a<00:00:30.760> little<00:00:30.850> bit

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.030

so we're going to go ahead and replace

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.380 
so we're going to go ahead and replace
that<00:00:38.410> pump<00:00:38.949> two<00:00:39.070> typos<00:00:39.430> we're<00:00:40.210> going<00:00:40.330> to

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
that pump two typos we're going to

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.900 
that pump two typos we're going to
remove<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:41.199> pump<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.650> tub<00:00:41.830> hose<00:00:42.040> at<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.520> top

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
remove the pump the tub hose at the top

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.819 
remove the pump the tub hose at the top
there's<00:00:43.899> a<00:00:44.160> 5/16<00:00:45.160> screw<00:00:45.520> clamp<00:00:49.530> try<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.590> just

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
there's a 5/16 screw clamp try to just

00:00:50.829 --> 00:01:19.980 
there's a 5/16 screw clamp try to just
loosen<00:01:16.380> found<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:19.150> put<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.479> hole<00:01:19.690> in<00:01:19.869> the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
loosen found what put the hole in the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.370 
loosen found what put the hole in the
hose<00:01:21.180> I'll<00:01:22.180> take<00:01:22.390> may<00:01:22.570> be<00:01:22.600> underwater<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.350> a

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
hose I'll take may be underwater to a

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.520 
hose I'll take may be underwater to a
bra<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:25.119> we're<00:01:25.720> going<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:25.900> go<00:01:26.020> ahead<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:26.409> get

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
bra so we're going to go ahead and get

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.750 
bra so we're going to go ahead and get
the<00:01:26.619> rest<00:01:26.799> of<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.950> water<00:01:27.159> out<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.369> that<00:01:27.549> hose

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
the rest of the water out of that hose

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.620 
the rest of the water out of that hose
there<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:32.939> there's<00:01:33.939> another<00:01:34.090> clamp

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
there and then there's another clamp

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.810 
there and then there's another clamp
this<00:01:34.930> one<00:01:35.140> is<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.350> spring<00:01:35.680> clamp<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.340> goes<00:01:36.580> on<00:01:36.729> to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
this one is a spring clamp it goes on to

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.570 
this one is a spring clamp it goes on to
the<00:01:36.909> pump<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.140> compress<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:39.369> then

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
the pump and it compress that and then

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:49.630 
the pump and it compress that and then
slide<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.060> off

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.120 

get<00:01:50.640> their<00:01:50.759> hose<00:01:50.939> off<00:01:51.619> take<00:01:52.619> off<00:01:52.710> our<00:01:52.950> other

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
get their hose off take off our other

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:09.949 
get their hose off take off our other
clamp<00:01:54.079> so<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.320> use<00:01:55.530> that<00:02:08.330> new<00:02:09.330> clamps<00:02:09.810> in

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
clamp so we can use that new clamps in

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.150 
clamp so we can use that new clamps in
position<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:13.110> hose<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.500> same<00:02:13.799> on<00:02:14.010> either

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
position the hose is the same on either

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.820 
position the hose is the same on either
side<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:15.170> no<00:02:17.120> nothing<00:02:18.120> will<00:02:18.239> get<00:02:18.420> mixed<00:02:19.410> up<00:02:19.620> if

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
side so no nothing will get mixed up if

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:28.910 
side so no nothing will get mixed up if
you<00:02:19.950> flip<00:02:20.190> them<00:02:20.310> around<00:02:27.620> alright<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.829> I'm

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you flip them around alright so I'm

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.470 
you flip them around alright so I'm
going<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.130> start<00:02:29.340> with<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.579> one<00:02:29.760> on<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.120> hub

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
going to start with the one on the hub

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.319 
going to start with the one on the hub
that's<00:02:31.019> gonna<00:02:31.230> be<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.470> most<00:02:31.620> difficult<00:02:31.920> one

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
that's gonna be the most difficult one

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.449 
that's gonna be the most difficult one
slide<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.510> hose<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:34.019> far<00:02:34.230> as<00:02:34.379> I<00:02:34.470> can

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.600 

compress<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.670> clamp<00:02:40.010> while<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:41.160> continue<00:02:41.579> to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
compress the clamp while we continue to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.259 
compress the clamp while we continue to
slide<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.420> rest<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.870> way<00:02:44.060> pull<00:02:45.060> our

clamp back in position and feel around
it<00:02:47.340> all<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.579> way<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.730> make<00:02:48.030> sure<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.420> we

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
it all the way to make sure that we

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.699 
it all the way to make sure that we
didn't<00:02:48.810> put<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.079> clamp<00:02:49.349> in<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.530> wrong

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
didn't put the clamp in the wrong

that in and tighten it this point here

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.009 
that in and tighten it this point here
will<00:03:17.220> just<00:03:17.340> run<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.579> test<00:03:17.880> cycle<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.630> verify

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
will just run a test cycle to verify

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.819 
will just run a test cycle to verify
that<00:03:19.169> the<00:03:19.290> unit<00:03:19.620> no<00:03:19.769> longer<00:03:20.130> leaks<00:03:21.769> okay<00:03:22.769> so

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
that the unit no longer leaks okay so
