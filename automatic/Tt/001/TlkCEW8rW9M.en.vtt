30 60 90 degree triangle has the 30
degree<00:00:15.850> angle<00:00:16.030> we<00:00:16.360> want<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.710> let's<00:00:17.920> say<00:00:18.010> that

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
degree angle we want so let's say that

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.820 
degree angle we want so let's say that
we've<00:00:18.370> looked<00:00:18.520> at<00:00:18.700> it<00:00:18.880> and<00:00:18.970> right<00:00:19.150> there<00:00:19.390> it<00:00:19.510> is

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
we've looked at it and right there it is

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.800 
we've looked at it and right there it is
now<00:00:20.830> there's<00:00:21.010> no<00:00:21.310> way<00:00:21.640> that<00:00:22.360> you<00:00:22.480> can<00:00:22.600> just

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
little piece of plastic here and just

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.380 
little piece of plastic here and just
start<00:00:26.560> cut<00:00:26.770> matter<00:00:27.490> of<00:00:27.580> fact<00:00:27.700> Mike<00:00:27.880> tips<00:00:28.150> gone

most important thing on radio matches to

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.980 
most important thing on radio matches to
keep<00:00:32.079> those<00:00:32.259> tips<00:00:32.760> so<00:00:33.760> really<00:00:34.150> a<00:00:34.360> better<00:00:34.750> way

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
keep those tips so really a better way

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.110 
keep those tips so really a better way
to<00:00:35.050> do<00:00:35.260> it<00:00:35.410> would<00:00:35.890> be<00:00:35.950> to<00:00:36.070> take<00:00:36.400> a<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:37.710> pencil<00:00:38.710> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
to do it would be to take a a pencil a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.870 
to do it would be to take a a pencil a
white<00:00:40.120> pencil<00:00:40.360> and<00:00:40.720> some<00:00:41.050> walnut<00:00:41.650> here<00:00:41.880> but

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
white pencil and some walnut here but

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.800 
white pencil and some walnut here but
but<00:00:43.090> mark<00:00:43.390> out<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:45.040> angle<00:00:45.540> now<00:00:46.540> remember

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
but mark out your angle now remember

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.780 
but mark out your angle now remember
when<00:00:47.110> we<00:00:47.200> get<00:00:47.350> done<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.770> means<00:00:47.950> our<00:00:48.070> table<00:00:48.610> is

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
when we get done that means our table is

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.440 
when we get done that means our table is
only<00:00:49.150> going<00:00:49.330> to<00:00:49.390> be<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:50.170> know<00:00:50.290> so<00:00:50.530> big<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:52.030> if

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
only going to be you know so big so if

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.970 
only going to be you know so big so if
you<00:00:52.600> want<00:00:52.810> to<00:00:52.870> make<00:00:52.990> a<00:00:53.020> big<00:00:53.260> table<00:00:53.590> then<00:00:53.890> you're

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
you want to make a big table then you're

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.860 
you want to make a big table then you're
going<00:00:54.070> to<00:00:54.130> have<00:00:54.250> to<00:00:54.310> have<00:00:54.400> a<00:00:54.460> big<00:00:54.760> packet<00:00:55.750> of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
going to have to have a big packet of

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.330 
going to have to have a big packet of
veneer<00:00:56.200> that<00:00:56.230> you're<00:00:56.500> working<00:00:56.800> off<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:56.950> but

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
veneer that you're working off of but

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.180 
veneer that you're working off of but
usually<00:00:57.640> most<00:00:57.790> of<00:00:57.970> our<00:00:58.090> tables<00:00:58.420> are<00:00:58.600> smaller

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
usually most of our tables are smaller

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.190 
usually most of our tables are smaller
okay<00:01:00.190> so<00:01:00.250> now<00:01:00.490> I've<00:01:00.610> got<00:01:00.760> my<00:01:00.970> my<00:01:01.540> shape<00:01:01.840> drawn

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
okay so now I've got my my shape drawn

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.660 
okay so now I've got my my shape drawn
on<00:01:02.350> here<00:01:02.560> I'll<00:01:02.680> just<00:01:02.830> use<00:01:03.010> this<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.400> kind<00:01:03.550> of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
on here I'll just use this to kind of

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.760 
on here I'll just use this to kind of
give<00:01:04.570> us<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.780> little<00:01:04.960> bit<00:01:05.110> better<00:01:05.259> view<00:01:05.560> of<00:01:05.650> what

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
give us a little bit better view of what

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.719 
give us a little bit better view of what
it<00:01:05.860> looks<00:01:06.009> like<00:01:06.159> so<00:01:07.150> there<00:01:07.299> it<00:01:07.390> is<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.860> cut<00:01:09.189> the

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
it looks like so there it is to cut the

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.450 
it looks like so there it is to cut the
key<00:01:10.119> is<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.689> keep<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.290> tip<00:01:11.619> now<00:01:11.920> there<00:01:12.340> are

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
key is to keep the tip now there are

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.510 
key is to keep the tip now there are
four<00:01:13.240> me<00:01:13.509> and<00:01:13.810> when<00:01:14.619> I<00:01:14.650> make<00:01:14.920> these<00:01:15.100> things<00:01:15.369> I

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
four me and when I make these things I

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.730 
four me and when I make these things I
get<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.790> absolute<00:01:16.000> best<00:01:16.750> radio<00:01:17.110> matches

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
get the absolute best radio matches

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
get the absolute best radio matches
you've<00:01:18.220> ever<00:01:18.400> seen<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.909> cheat<00:01:19.720> at<00:01:19.900> it<00:01:20.020> though

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
pieces of particle board on the top and

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.730 
pieces of particle board on the top and
bottom<00:01:27.940> go<00:01:28.600> through<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:28.960> staple<00:01:29.409> around<00:01:29.620> the

my good part at all so you can see how
well<00:01:35.860> it's<00:01:36.190> held<00:01:36.550> how<00:01:36.940> tight<00:01:37.300> it<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.540> I<00:01:37.780> go<00:01:38.080> to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
well it's held how tight it is I go to

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.680 
well it's held how tight it is I go to
the<00:01:38.260> bandsaw<00:01:38.740> I'd<00:01:39.220> cut<00:01:39.550> this<00:01:39.760> edge<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.360> little

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
the bandsaw I'd cut this edge a little

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.630 
the bandsaw I'd cut this edge a little
bit<00:01:40.960> away<00:01:41.170> from<00:01:41.200> my<00:01:41.380> pencil<00:01:41.710> mark<00:01:41.890> go<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.490> my

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
bit away from my pencil mark go to my

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.070 
bit away from my pencil mark go to my
edge<00:01:42.820> sander<00:01:43.390> wherever<00:01:43.690> you<00:01:43.720> guys<00:01:43.840> got<00:01:44.049> your

edge<00:01:44.260> and<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.560> seat<00:01:44.740> over<00:01:44.890> there<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.310> I'd<00:01:45.580> sand

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
edge and I seat over there and I'd sand

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.760 
edge and I seat over there and I'd sand
this<00:01:46.210> one<00:01:46.420> side<00:01:46.720> there's<00:01:46.900> nothing<00:01:47.560> better

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
this one side there's nothing better

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.530 
this one side there's nothing better
than<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.040> sanded<00:01:48.460> edge<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.729> veneer<00:01:49.000> nothing

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
than a sanded edge of veneer nothing

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.690 
than a sanded edge of veneer nothing
better<00:01:49.690> than<00:01:49.900> sanded<00:01:50.320> veneer<00:01:50.620> so<00:01:51.400> now<00:01:51.520> this

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
better than sanded veneer so now this

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.190 
better than sanded veneer so now this
one<00:01:51.909> side<00:01:52.180> sanded<00:01:52.570> but<00:01:52.659> it's<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.870> little<00:01:53.020> bit

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
one side sanded but it's a little bit

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.149 
one side sanded but it's a little bit
loose<00:01:53.350> because<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.650> cut<00:01:53.799> off<00:01:53.890> all<00:01:54.040> those

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
loose because I cut off all those

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.370 
loose because I cut off all those
staples<00:01:54.670> so<00:01:55.360> i'll<00:01:55.479> come<00:01:55.659> back<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.020> wrap<00:01:56.200> my

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
staples so i'll come back and wrap my

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.140 
staples so i'll come back and wrap my
tape<00:01:56.740> around<00:01:57.070> this<00:01:57.310> side<00:01:57.520> holding<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:57.970> tight

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
tape around this side holding it tight

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.060 
tape around this side holding it tight
then<00:01:58.840> i'll<00:01:58.930> go<00:01:58.960> back<00:01:59.200> over<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.619> bandsaw

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
then i'll go back over to the bandsaw

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.890 
then i'll go back over to the bandsaw
again<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:00.640> now<00:02:00.850> i'll<00:02:00.940> cut<00:02:01.119> this<00:02:01.360> side<00:02:01.659> and

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
again and now i'll cut this side and

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.510 
again and now i'll cut this side and
then<00:02:02.170> sand<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.950> then<00:02:03.040> I<00:02:03.100> could<00:02:03.250> pop<00:02:03.400> it

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
then sand that and then I could pop it

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.310 
then sand that and then I could pop it
back<00:02:03.549> apart<00:02:03.790> and<00:02:04.090> everyone<00:02:04.390> on<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:04.659> right<00:02:05.200> on

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
back apart and everyone on this right on

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.500 
back apart and everyone on this right on
the<00:02:05.409> money<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.610> most<00:02:07.090> people<00:02:07.330> don't<00:02:07.360> have

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
the money but most people don't have

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.469 
the money but most people don't have
edge<00:02:07.659> Sanders<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:09.129> once<00:02:09.939> it's<00:02:10.090> marked<00:02:10.360> out

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
edge Sanders so once it's marked out

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.020 
edge Sanders so once it's marked out
i'll<00:02:10.629> just<00:02:10.810> take<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.959> straight<00:02:11.409> edge<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.030> i'll

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
i'll just take a straight edge and i'll

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.509 
i'll just take a straight edge and i'll
go<00:02:13.180> way<00:02:13.420> beyond<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.049> tip<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:14.769> i'll<00:02:15.220> start<00:02:15.489> my

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
go way beyond the tip and i'll start my

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.850 
go way beyond the tip and i'll start my
cut<00:02:15.849> all<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> way<00:02:16.239> up<00:02:16.330> here<00:02:16.540> again<00:02:17.409> I'll<00:02:17.709> make

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
cut all the way up here again I'll make

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.500 
cut all the way up here again I'll make
my<00:02:18.010> cuts<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.819> this<00:02:18.939> would<00:02:19.060> be<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> better<00:02:19.390> place

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
my cuts and this would be a better place

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.540 
my cuts and this would be a better place
to<00:02:19.870> use

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
to use

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.640 
to use
something<00:02:21.030> like<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> Stanley<00:02:21.960> utility<00:02:22.500> knife

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
something like a Stanley utility knife

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.350 
something like a Stanley utility knife
because<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.070> won't<00:02:23.250> flex<00:02:23.490> much<00:02:23.880> because<00:02:24.180> we're

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
because it won't flex much because we're

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.330 
because it won't flex much because we're
going<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.510> cut<00:02:24.780> literally<00:02:25.290> through<00:02:25.950> all<00:02:26.130> these

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
going to cut literally through all these

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.700 
going to cut literally through all these
pieces<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:27.060> people<00:02:27.900> who<00:02:27.960> come<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.230> my<00:02:28.380> class

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
pieces I people who come to my class

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.740 
pieces I people who come to my class
when<00:02:28.950> we<00:02:29.040> do<00:02:29.160> my<00:02:29.310> veneering<00:02:29.730> they<00:02:30.390> do<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.660> with

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
when we do my veneering they do it with

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.090 
when we do my veneering they do it with
an<00:02:30.780> exacto<00:02:31.170> knife<00:02:31.500> because<00:02:31.620> that's<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.920> tool

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
an exacto knife because that's the tool

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.070 
an exacto knife because that's the tool
I<00:02:32.130> tell<00:02:32.400> them<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.550> bring<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.270> that's<00:02:33.420> okay<00:02:33.720> but

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
I tell them to bring and that's okay but

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.420 
I tell them to bring and that's okay but
you<00:02:34.200> just<00:02:34.350> got<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.530> take<00:02:34.710> your<00:02:34.860> time<00:02:35.100> until<00:02:35.370> you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
you just got to take your time until you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.130 
you just got to take your time until you
get<00:02:35.520> all<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.700> way<00:02:35.790> through<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:36.990> keep

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
get all the way through so you just keep

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.270 
get all the way through so you just keep
making<00:02:37.410> more<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.680> more<00:02:37.800> cuts<00:02:38.160> you

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
making more and more cuts you

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.530 
making more and more cuts you
concentrate<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:38.940> keeping<00:02:39.150> your<00:02:39.330> knife

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
concentrate on keeping your knife

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.030 
concentrate on keeping your knife
straight<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.140> down<00:02:40.170> again<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:40.740> would<00:02:40.890> be

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
straight up and down again this would be

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.790 
straight up and down again this would be
much<00:02:41.220> much<00:02:41.400> better<00:02:42.200> but<00:02:43.200> once<00:02:43.410> i<00:02:43.470> get<00:02:43.620> through

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
much much better but once i get through

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.620 
much much better but once i get through
all<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.070> these<00:02:44.460> on<00:02:44.700> this<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.390> side<00:02:47.600> then<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
all of these on this one side then the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.880 
all of these on this one side then the
next<00:02:48.870> thing<00:02:48.990> I'm<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.350> do<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.650> I'm<00:02:49.800> going

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.770 
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:02:49.980> come<00:02:50.160> back<00:02:50.280> over<00:02:50.580> i'll<00:02:50.940> take<00:02:51.150> some<00:02:51.330> tape<00:02:51.570> if

to come back over i'll take some tape if
i<00:02:51.870> can<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.290> retype<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.800> back<00:02:53.010> together<00:02:53.160> on

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
i can and retype it back together on

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.440 
i can and retype it back together on
that<00:02:54.210> side<00:02:54.590> I'll<00:02:55.590> come<00:02:55.770> back<00:02:55.950> through<00:02:56.450> and

that side I'll come back through and

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.080 
that side I'll come back through and
I'll<00:02:57.600> physician<00:02:58.080> myself<00:02:58.260> up<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:59.700> make<00:02:59.850> my<00:03:00.030> next

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
I'll physician myself up to make my next

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.780 
I'll physician myself up to make my next
cut<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:01.290> where<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.710> have<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.160> do<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:02.460> I'm<00:03:02.640> doing

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
cut to where I have to do this I'm doing

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.330 
cut to where I have to do this I'm doing
it<00:03:03.140> left-handed<00:03:04.140> here<00:03:04.320> but<00:03:04.800> again<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.040> want<00:03:05.280> to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
it left-handed here but again I want to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.880 
it left-handed here but again I want to
start<00:03:05.550> my<00:03:05.640> cut<00:03:06.030> going<00:03:06.360> into<00:03:06.750> my<00:03:06.900> tip<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.470> not

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
start my cut going into my tip and not

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.890 
start my cut going into my tip and not
let<00:03:08.070> my<00:03:08.190> knife<00:03:08.370> come<00:03:08.640> out<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:09.120> my<00:03:09.300> tip<00:03:09.570> again

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
let my knife come out of my tip again

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.690 
let my knife come out of my tip again
because<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> don't<00:03:10.530> want<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.740> lose<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.890> tip<00:03:11.160> so

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
because I don't want to lose a tip so

like<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.110> top<00:03:19.290> piece<00:03:19.530> might<00:03:19.770> be<00:03:19.950> a

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
like this the top piece might be a

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.350 
like this the top piece might be a
little<00:03:20.250> narrower<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.820> bottom<00:03:21.060> piece<00:03:21.180> might

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
little narrower the bottom piece might

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.630 
little narrower the bottom piece might
be<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.510> little<00:03:21.630> bit<00:03:21.780> wider<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:22.340> they<00:03:23.340> won't<00:03:23.520> go

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
be a little bit wider and they won't go

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.979 
be a little bit wider and they won't go
together<00:03:23.790> quite<00:03:24.240> right<00:03:24.450> there's<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.810> couple

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
together quite right there's a couple

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.199 
together quite right there's a couple
little<00:03:25.230> catches<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.890> first<00:03:26.190> one<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.670> before

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
little catches the first one is before

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.479 
little catches the first one is before
you<00:03:27.330> move<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:28.320> absolute<00:03:28.890> best<00:03:29.190> thing<00:03:29.370> to

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
you move on the absolute best thing to

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.580 
you move on the absolute best thing to
do<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.880> take<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.209> sanding<00:03:30.690> block<00:03:30.690> again<00:03:31.410> it's

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
do is to take a sanding block again it's

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.780 
do is to take a sanding block again it's
just<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.800> block<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.190> wood<00:03:32.220> with<00:03:33.090> some<00:03:34.790> contact

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
just a block of wood with some contact

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.140 
just a block of wood with some contact
on<00:03:36.920> sandpaper<00:03:37.920> one<00:03:38.190> sides<00:03:38.430> got<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.640> coarser

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
on sandpaper one sides got a coarser

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.780 
on sandpaper one sides got a coarser
side<00:03:39.780> than<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.110> other<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.470> at<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.430> point<00:03:41.670> in

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
side than the other and at this point in

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.940 
side than the other and at this point in
time<00:03:41.820> with<00:03:42.150> all<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.450> my<00:03:42.570> veneers<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:43.860> have

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
time with all of my veneers that have

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.370 
time with all of my veneers that have
been<00:03:44.070> cut<00:03:44.340> I'll<00:03:45.270> take<00:03:45.420> my<00:03:45.630> straight<00:03:45.959> edge<00:03:45.989> and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
been cut I'll take my straight edge and

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.260 
been cut I'll take my straight edge and
just<00:03:46.500> hold<00:03:46.770> up<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.070> keep<00:03:47.250> them<00:03:47.370> compress<00:03:48.000> down

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
just hold up to keep them compress down

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.199 
just hold up to keep them compress down
and<00:03:49.020> I'll<00:03:49.230> take<00:03:49.440> this<00:03:49.770> it'll<00:03:50.730> ride<00:03:50.880> right<00:03:51.090> on

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
and I'll take this it'll ride right on

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.660 
and I'll take this it'll ride right on
my<00:03:51.360> table<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:51.930> stay<00:03:52.320> at<00:03:52.380> 90<00:03:52.680> degrees<00:03:52.739> I'll

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
my table and stay at 90 degrees I'll

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.000 
my table and stay at 90 degrees I'll
just<00:03:53.820> take<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:54.270> against<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.750> edge<00:03:55.010> but

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
just take that up against the edge but

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.949 
just take that up against the edge but
again<00:03:56.220> it's<00:03:56.340> very<00:03:56.550> important<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.090> I'm<00:03:57.330> not

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
again it's very important that I'm not

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.690 
again it's very important that I'm not
just<00:03:58.709> standing<00:03:59.310> these<00:03:59.430> where<00:03:59.580> they're

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
just standing these where they're

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.460 
just standing these where they're
flopping<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.239> wind<00:04:00.300> up<00:04:01.020> getting<00:04:01.380> my

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
flopping in the wind up getting my

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.080 
flopping in the wind up getting my
straight<00:04:01.739> edge<00:04:01.770> will<00:04:02.040> hold<00:04:02.280> them<00:04:02.489> down<00:04:02.520> flat

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
straight edge will hold them down flat

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.600 
straight edge will hold them down flat
while<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:03.780> go<00:04:03.989> through<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.350> sand<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.040> I'll

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
while I go through and sand and I'll

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.380 
while I go through and sand and I'll
sand<00:04:06.000> until<00:04:06.209> all<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.660> those<00:04:07.170> pieces<00:04:07.560> look<00:04:08.489> good

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
sand until all of those pieces look good

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.810 
sand until all of those pieces look good
and<00:04:09.510> tight<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:09.959> clean<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.380> straight<00:04:10.730> it's<00:04:11.730> a

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
and tight and clean and straight it's a

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.210 
and tight and clean and straight it's a
it's<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.209> very<00:04:12.630> easy<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.380> visual<00:04:13.800> thing<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.130> do

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
it's a very easy and visual thing to do

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.949 
it's a very easy and visual thing to do
then<00:04:14.400> I'll<00:04:14.489> go<00:04:14.640> back<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:14.820> if<00:04:15.330> you<00:04:15.420> look<00:04:15.600> here

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
then I'll go back and if you look here

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.800 
then I'll go back and if you look here
you<00:04:16.560> can<00:04:16.739> see<00:04:17.010> that<00:04:17.250> definitely<00:04:18.239> they're<00:04:18.630> all

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
you can see that definitely they're all

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.990 
you can see that definitely they're all
nice<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:19.530> flat<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:19.830> straight<00:04:20.160> and<00:04:20.400> in<00:04:20.730> line

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
nice and flat and straight and in line

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.300 
nice and flat and straight and in line
after<00:04:21.630> I<00:04:21.959> cut<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.320> with<00:04:22.380> an<00:04:22.500> exacto<00:04:22.830> knife<00:04:23.130> they

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
after I cut it with an exacto knife they

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.070 
after I cut it with an exacto knife they
won't<00:04:23.460> look<00:04:23.640> that<00:04:23.700> way<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.510> want<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.780> sand

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
won't look that way and I want to sand

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.450 
won't look that way and I want to sand
them<00:04:25.200> until<00:04:25.470> they<00:04:25.590> come<00:04:25.800> back<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:26.190> looking

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
them until they come back to looking

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.990 
them until they come back to looking
like<00:04:26.610> that

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
like that

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.520 
like that
now<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.960> issue<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.470> couple<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.130> things<00:04:32.470> what<00:04:33.470> do

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
now the issue a couple of things what do

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.230 
now the issue a couple of things what do
you<00:04:33.590> think<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.800> chances<00:04:33.830> are<00:04:34.460> but<00:04:34.970> when<00:04:35.210> I

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
you think the chances are but when I

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.030 
you think the chances are but when I
drew<00:04:35.780> this<00:04:35.960> out<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.380> I<00:04:36.440> cut<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:36.950> I'm

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
drew this out and I cut it that I'm

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.310 
drew this out and I cut it that I'm
going<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.190> get<00:04:37.340> exactly<00:04:37.430> 30<00:04:38.030> degrees<00:04:38.420> you<00:04:39.230> know

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
going to get exactly 30 degrees you know

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.960 
going to get exactly 30 degrees you know
how<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.500> guys<00:04:39.770> struggle<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:40.430> sit<00:04:40.820> there<00:04:40.910> and

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
how you guys struggle you sit there and

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:41.920 
how you guys struggle you sit there and
you<00:04:41.090> try<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.300> figure<00:04:41.480> out<00:04:41.600> how<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.720> set<00:04:41.900> up

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
you try to figure out how to set up

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.220 
you try to figure out how to set up
exactly<00:04:42.140> a<00:04:42.560> 90-degree<00:04:43.310> angle<00:04:43.730> or<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.360> 45-degree

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
exactly a 90-degree angle or a 45-degree

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.550 
exactly a 90-degree angle or a 45-degree
angle<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:46.100> we<00:04:46.160> can't<00:04:46.430> get<00:04:46.580> there<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:48.440> the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
angle that we can't get there so the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.870 
angle that we can't get there so the
same<00:04:48.740> thing<00:04:48.770> for<00:04:49.130> me<00:04:49.280> trying<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.670> think<00:04:49.820> i'm

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
same thing for me trying to think i'm

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.280 
same thing for me trying to think i'm
going<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.060> get<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:50.270> at<00:04:50.390> exactly<00:04:50.720> 30<00:04:50.990> degrees

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
going to get this at exactly 30 degrees

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.220 
going to get this at exactly 30 degrees
this<00:04:51.410> is<00:04:51.560> going<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.800> happen<00:04:52.840> what<00:04:53.840> i<00:04:53.870> need<00:04:54.200> to

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.810 
do is I need to cut each one of those
two<00:04:56.090> like<00:04:56.410> 31<00:04:57.410> degrees<00:04:57.590> just<00:04:58.130> a<00:04:58.400> little<00:04:58.670> bit

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
two like 31 degrees just a little bit

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.280 
two like 31 degrees just a little bit
over<00:04:59.090> so<00:04:59.540> if<00:04:59.690> this<00:04:59.870> is<00:05:00.110> my<00:05:01.240> angle<00:05:02.240> when<00:05:02.990> I<00:05:03.110> go<00:05:03.260> to

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
over so if this is my angle when I go to

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.530 
over so if this is my angle when I go to
cut<00:05:03.680> I'll<00:05:04.310> cut<00:05:04.610> right<00:05:04.640> on<00:05:04.880> my<00:05:04.970> pencil<00:05:05.390> line

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
cut I'll cut right on my pencil line

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.659 
cut I'll cut right on my pencil line
here<00:05:05.930> but<00:05:06.350> I'll<00:05:06.500> cut<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:06.919> little<00:05:07.130> bit<00:05:07.340> further

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
here but I'll cut a little bit further

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.850 
here but I'll cut a little bit further
away<00:05:07.820> down<00:05:08.240> here<00:05:08.270> on<00:05:08.600> this<00:05:08.750> side<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.230> just<00:05:09.680> a

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
away down here on this side and just a

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.159 
away down here on this side and just a
fraction<00:05:10.550> of<00:05:10.820> an<00:05:10.970> inch<00:05:11.090> but<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:11.900> definitely

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
fraction of an inch but I definitely

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.860 
fraction of an inch but I definitely
want<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.919> widest<00:05:13.520> part<00:05:13.850> of<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.180> to<00:05:14.360> be<00:05:14.510> wider

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
want the widest part of it to be wider

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.400 
want the widest part of it to be wider
than<00:05:15.370> narrower<00:05:16.990> what<00:05:17.990> do<00:05:18.050> you<00:05:18.110> think<00:05:18.169> the

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
than narrower what do you think the

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:30.000 
than narrower what do you think the
chances<00:05:18.440> are<00:05:19.010> by<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.060> time<00:05:20.120> i<00:05:20.330> go<00:05:20.690> through<00:05:28.270> of

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
chances are by the time i go through of

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.610 
chances are by the time i go through of
taking<00:05:31.010> again<00:05:31.610> this<00:05:31.790> first<00:05:32.120> piece<00:05:32.560> by<00:05:33.560> the

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
taking again this first piece by the

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.810 
taking again this first piece by the
time<00:05:33.830> i<00:05:33.860> get<00:05:33.979> all<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.220> way<00:05:34.340> around<00:05:34.400> this<00:05:34.610> last

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
time i get all the way around this last

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.440 
time i get all the way around this last
piece<00:05:35.060> fitting<00:05:35.390> perfectly<00:05:35.600> in<00:05:36.340> none<00:05:37.340> so<00:05:38.300> when

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
piece fitting perfectly in none so when

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.610 
piece fitting perfectly in none so when
we<00:05:38.540> put<00:05:38.750> this<00:05:38.870> thing<00:05:39.050> together<00:05:39.229> we're<00:05:39.590> going

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
we put this thing together we're going

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.550 
we put this thing together we're going
to<00:05:39.770> put<00:05:39.890> it<00:05:40.010> together<00:05:40.130> in<00:05:40.340> halves<00:05:41.380> so<00:05:42.380> as<00:05:42.440> you

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
to put it together in halves so as you

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.640 
to put it together in halves so as you
take<00:05:42.860> your<00:05:42.940> packet<00:05:43.940> of<00:05:44.030> 12<00:05:44.419> pieces<00:05:44.780> apart

that pile next to the very bottom piece

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.650 
that pile next to the very bottom piece
right<00:06:05.900> here<00:06:05.930> at<00:06:06.200> this<00:06:06.350> seam<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:07.310> with<00:06:08.150> all<00:06:08.419> the

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
right here at this seam and with all the

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.810 
right here at this seam and with all the
veneers<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.380> pattern<00:06:09.830> changes<00:06:10.370> from<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.640> top

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.310 
veneers the pattern changes from the top
to<00:06:10.850> the<00:06:11.030> bottom<00:06:11.090> so<00:06:11.419> there's<00:06:11.570> no<00:06:11.750> way<00:06:11.960> this

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
to the bottom so there's no way this

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.080 
to the bottom so there's no way this
joint<00:06:12.740> here<00:06:12.800> is<00:06:12.979> going<00:06:13.130> to<00:06:13.190> look<00:06:13.310> right<00:06:13.520> we

joint here is going to look right we

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.330 
joint here is going to look right we
have<00:06:14.210> to<00:06:14.300> rotate<00:06:14.600> even<00:06:15.050> an<00:06:15.140> odds<00:06:15.320> so<00:06:16.100> we'll<00:06:16.250> go

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
have to rotate even an odds so we'll go

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.839 
have to rotate even an odds so we'll go

were in the original cutting of the

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:32.899 
were in the original cutting of the
lungs<00:06:30.509> there's<00:06:31.319> one<00:06:31.379> other<00:06:31.589> thing<00:06:31.789> what<00:06:32.789> you

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909 
lungs there's one other thing what you

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:34.699 
lungs there's one other thing what you
saw<00:06:33.179> in<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.419> mirror<00:06:33.749> when<00:06:33.990> we<00:06:34.139> looked<00:06:34.379> at<00:06:34.559> it

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:34.709 
saw in the mirror when we looked at it

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:37.730 
saw in the mirror when we looked at it
was<00:06:35.249> a<00:06:35.279> book<00:06:35.759> matched<00:06:36.119> image<00:06:36.659> so<00:06:37.259> every<00:06:37.619> other

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
was a book matched image so every other

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.529 
was a book matched image so every other
piece<00:06:38.009> has<00:06:38.219> to<00:06:38.339> be<00:06:38.459> flipped<00:06:38.789> and<00:06:39.059> it<00:06:39.360> doesn't

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 
piece has to be flipped and it doesn't

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:41.029 
piece has to be flipped and it doesn't
matter<00:06:39.689> which<00:06:40.020> one<00:06:40.319> you<00:06:40.349> can<00:06:40.619> start<00:06:40.860> anywhere

matter which one you can start anywhere
you<00:06:41.249> want<00:06:41.429> but<00:06:41.729> if<00:06:41.849> you're<00:06:41.999> going<00:06:42.089> to<00:06:42.149> start

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
you want but if you're going to start

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.239 
you want but if you're going to start
anywhere<00:06:43.169> you<00:06:43.349> have<00:06:43.379> to<00:06:43.619> make<00:06:43.770> sure<00:06:43.800> that

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:44.249 
anywhere you have to make sure that

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:46.850 
anywhere you have to make sure that
every<00:06:44.669> other<00:06:44.789> piece<00:06:45.119> gets<00:06:45.419> rotated<00:06:45.860> upside

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
every other piece gets rotated upside

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.919 
every other piece gets rotated upside
down<00:06:47.099> to<00:06:47.279> get<00:06:47.399> exactly<00:06:47.789> what<00:06:47.879> you<00:06:48.089> saw<00:06:48.300> if<00:06:48.569> you

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:48.929 
down to get exactly what you saw if you

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:51.529 
down to get exactly what you saw if you
don't<00:06:49.139> you'll<00:06:49.319> end<00:06:49.349> up<00:06:49.499> with<00:06:49.649> a<00:06:49.679> with<00:06:50.399> a<00:06:50.539> slip

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
don't you'll end up with a with a slip

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.629 
don't you'll end up with a with a slip
match<00:06:51.719> look<00:06:51.990> which<00:06:52.289> is<00:06:52.409> really<00:06:52.619> cool<00:06:52.919> but<00:06:53.490> it's

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
match look which is really cool but it's

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.040 
match look which is really cool but it's
not<00:06:53.789> what<00:06:53.909> you<00:06:53.999> saw<00:06:54.179> in<00:06:54.269> the<00:06:54.330> mirror<00:06:54.539> what

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
not what you saw in the mirror what

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.600 
not what you saw in the mirror what
we'll<00:06:55.229> do<00:06:55.469> you're<00:06:56.099> going<00:06:56.279> to<00:06:56.339> put<00:06:56.459> this

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 
we'll do you're going to put this

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:07.809 
we'll do you're going to put this
together<00:06:57.379> as<00:06:58.379> we<00:06:58.559> put<00:07:00.589> two<00:07:01.589> halves<00:07:01.830> together

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:07.819 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:11.439 

okay<00:07:08.819> so<00:07:08.879> let's<00:07:09.209> just<00:07:09.360> say<00:07:09.449> that<00:07:09.479> this<00:07:09.689> is<00:07:09.749> 1<00:07:10.169> 3

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:11.449 
okay so let's just say that this is 1 3

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:20.959 
okay so let's just say that this is 1 3
5<00:07:12.449> 7<00:07:13.199> and<00:07:13.499> 9<00:07:13.559> and<00:07:14.129> 11<00:07:15.059> and<00:07:15.539> 2<00:07:16.439> 4<00:07:17.009> 6<00:07:17.459> 8<00:07:17.809> 10<00:07:18.809> 12<00:07:19.969> so

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:20.969 
5 7 and 9 and 11 and 2 4 6 8 10 12 so

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:23.719 
5 7 and 9 and 11 and 2 4 6 8 10 12 so
the<00:07:21.089> idea<00:07:21.119> is<00:07:21.599> the<00:07:22.169> hope<00:07:22.379> is<00:07:22.740> by<00:07:23.309> the<00:07:23.399> time<00:07:23.610> we

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:23.729 
the idea is the hope is by the time we

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:25.819 
the idea is the hope is by the time we
get<00:07:23.819> done<00:07:23.879> this<00:07:24.659> is<00:07:24.839> a<00:07:24.869> little<00:07:25.169> bit<00:07:25.289> wider<00:07:25.529> and

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:25.829 
get done this is a little bit wider and

00:07:25.829 --> 00:07:27.589 
get done this is a little bit wider and
this<00:07:25.979> is<00:07:26.129> a<00:07:26.159> little<00:07:26.430> bit<00:07:26.519> wider<00:07:26.729> and<00:07:26.999> this<00:07:27.419> is<00:07:27.569> a

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 
this is a little bit wider and this is a

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:28.850 
this is a little bit wider and this is a
little<00:07:27.839> bit<00:07:28.019> wider<00:07:28.199> and<00:07:28.379> this<00:07:28.499> is<00:07:28.649> a<00:07:28.680> little

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 
little bit wider and this is a little

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.559 
little bit wider and this is a little
bit<00:07:29.009> wider<00:07:29.219> here<00:07:29.490> because<00:07:29.729> we<00:07:29.879> tried<00:07:30.449> to<00:07:30.539> have

00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:30.569 
bit wider here because we tried to have

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:35.719 
bit wider here because we tried to have
30<00:07:31.229> point<00:07:31.769> five<00:07:32.550> degrees<00:07:33.559> so<00:07:34.559> now<00:07:34.800> this<00:07:35.430> half

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:35.729 
30 point five degrees so now this half

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:37.939 
30 point five degrees so now this half
and<00:07:36.059> this<00:07:36.269> half<00:07:36.479> we'll<00:07:37.110> bring<00:07:37.439> them<00:07:37.589> and<00:07:37.769> lap

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:37.949 
and this half we'll bring them and lap

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:39.739 
and this half we'll bring them and lap
them<00:07:38.159> over<00:07:38.430> and<00:07:38.610> cut<00:07:38.789> both<00:07:39.089> pieces<00:07:39.389> at<00:07:39.629> one

00:07:39.739 --> 00:07:39.749 
them over and cut both pieces at one

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:41.899 
them over and cut both pieces at one
time<00:07:39.930> together<00:07:40.110> hopefully<00:07:40.499> not<00:07:41.279> cutting<00:07:41.819> off

00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:41.909 
time together hopefully not cutting off

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:43.819 
time together hopefully not cutting off
the<00:07:42.089> tips<00:07:42.360> but<00:07:43.199> it<00:07:43.319> was<00:07:43.409> the<00:07:43.529> other<00:07:43.619> way<00:07:43.709> around

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:43.829 
the tips but it was the other way around

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:45.350 
the tips but it was the other way around
if<00:07:44.189> our<00:07:44.249> angles<00:07:44.610> were<00:07:44.699> a<00:07:44.729> little<00:07:44.879> bit<00:07:45.059> short

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 
if our angles were a little bit short

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.859 
if our angles were a little bit short
then<00:07:45.719> we<00:07:45.809> end<00:07:45.930> up<00:07:46.050> with<00:07:46.079> a<00:07:47.360> two<00:07:48.360> halves<00:07:48.599> that

00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:48.869 
then we end up with a two halves that

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:51.379 
then we end up with a two halves that
end<00:07:49.079> up<00:07:49.339> with<00:07:50.339> this<00:07:50.550> type<00:07:50.729> of<00:07:50.759> shape<00:07:51.029> and<00:07:51.269> when

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:51.389 
end up with this type of shape and when

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:52.699 
end up with this type of shape and when
we<00:07:51.509> overlap<00:07:51.929> and<00:07:52.139> we<00:07:52.229> end<00:07:52.319> up<00:07:52.379> cutting<00:07:52.559> away

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:52.709 
we overlap and we end up cutting away

00:07:52.709 --> 00:07:54.589 
we overlap and we end up cutting away
our<00:07:52.919> tips<00:07:53.159> as<00:07:53.369> to<00:07:53.759> having<00:07:54.209> them<00:07:54.329> where<00:07:54.509> they

00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 
our tips as to having them where they

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:58.370 
our tips as to having them where they
come<00:07:54.809> over

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.380 

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.480 

so<00:07:59.380> now<00:07:59.560> it<00:07:59.650> makes<00:07:59.770> it<00:07:59.920> a<00:07:59.950> lot<00:08:00.070> easier<00:08:00.130> to

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:00.490 
so now it makes it a lot easier to

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.040 
so now it makes it a lot easier to
maintain<00:08:00.670> your<00:08:01.030> tips<00:08:01.330> when<00:08:01.510> you<00:08:01.570> overlap<00:08:01.870> your

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.050 
maintain your tips when you overlap your

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.620 
maintain your tips when you overlap your
two<00:08:02.200> pieces
