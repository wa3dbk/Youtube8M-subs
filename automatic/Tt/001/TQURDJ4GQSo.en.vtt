00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.970 
phase manufacture this is a watch from a
brand<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.300> defining<00:00:28.050> accessible<00:00:28.590> luxury

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
brand that is defining accessible luxury

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.190 
brand that is defining accessible luxury
not<00:00:29.250> affordability<00:00:29.850> but<00:00:30.300> accessible<00:00:30.750> luxury

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
not affordability but accessible luxury

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.659 
not affordability but accessible luxury
I<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.980> it's<00:00:32.099> important<00:00:32.400> to<00:00:32.460> draw<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
I think it's important to draw a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.220 
I think it's important to draw a
distinction<00:00:33.060> between<00:00:33.239> affordability<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
distinction between affordability and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.960 
distinction between affordability and
accessibility<00:00:34.350> when<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.250> say<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> watch<00:00:35.820> is

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
accessibility when we say a watch is

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.270 
accessibility when we say a watch is
affordable<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.989> cheap<00:00:37.200> watch<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:38.100> know

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
affordable it's a cheap watch I know

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
affordable it's a cheap watch I know
that's<00:00:38.550> all<00:00:38.700> relative<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.350> know<00:00:40.440> 500

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
that's all relative but you know 500

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.460 
that's all relative but you know 500
bucks<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.250> less<00:00:41.280> 1,000<00:00:42.120> bucks<00:00:42.270> or<00:00:42.420> less<00:00:42.600> maybe

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
bucks or less 1,000 bucks or less maybe

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.540

that's<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> cheap<00:00:44.010> watch

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that's a cheap watch

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.240 
that's a cheap watch
but<00:00:45.090> accessible<00:00:45.780> luxury<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.470> about<00:00:46.770> taking

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
but accessible luxury is about taking

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.119 
but accessible luxury is about taking
the<00:00:47.370> high-end<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.180> then<00:00:48.930> trying<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.769> find<00:00:50.040> a

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the high-end and then trying to find a

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.890 
the high-end and then trying to find a
way<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.339> make<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:50.820> piece<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.570> more

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
way to make a piece of that more

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.410 
way to make a piece of that more
available<00:00:52.350> at<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.559> more<00:00:52.739> sensible<00:00:53.100> price<00:00:53.420> so

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
available at a more sensible price so

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.970 
available at a more sensible price so
when<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.690> look<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.080> Fredrik<00:00:55.470> constant

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
when you look at the Fredrik constant

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.640 
when you look at the Fredrik constant
Sunline<00:00:56.760> moon<00:00:56.940> phase<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:58.230> know<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.379> see

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
Sunline moon phase and you know you see

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.079 
Sunline moon phase and you know you see
it<00:00:58.680> has<00:00:58.860> an<00:00:58.980> in-house<00:00:59.220> movement<00:00:59.790> and<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.940> see

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
it has an in-house movement and you see

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.759 
it has an in-house movement and you see
the<00:01:00.210> level<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.570> attention<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.050> detail<00:01:01.470> and

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
the level and attention to detail and

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.950 
the level and attention to detail and
and<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> fit<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.400> finish<00:01:02.489> on<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> watch<00:01:03.030> it's

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and the fit and finish on the watch it's

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.479 
and the fit and finish on the watch it's
something<00:01:04.440> that<00:01:04.620> that<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.280> see

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
something that that you're going to see

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.740 
something that that you're going to see
on<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> higher-end<00:01:05.940> watch<00:01:06.300> that's<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.690> to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
on a higher-end watch that's going to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.390 
on a higher-end watch that's going to
cost<00:01:06.960> about<00:01:07.110> eight<00:01:07.409> thousand<00:01:07.860> dollars<00:01:08.070> plus

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
cost about eight thousand dollars plus

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.630 
cost about eight thousand dollars plus
and<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.540> federer<00:01:10.320> constant<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.159> trying<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and so federer constant is not trying to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.160 
and so federer constant is not trying to
make<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> cheap<00:01:12.120> box<00:01:12.360> around<00:01:12.750> trying<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:12.990> sell

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
make a cheap box around trying to sell

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.540 
make a cheap box around trying to sell
watch<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.680> five<00:01:13.830> hundred<00:01:13.920> bucks<00:01:14.250> they're

as<00:01:56.190> you<00:01:56.670> hold<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.090> watch<00:01:57.330> at<00:01:57.480> different

as you hold the watch at different

as you hold the watch at different
angles<00:01:57.870> and<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.320> catches<00:01:58.500> different

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.970 
angles and it catches different
different<00:01:59.760> light<00:02:00.630> sources<00:02:00.990> due<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
sunburst nature of the dial and the fact

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.780 
sunburst nature of the dial and the fact
that<00:02:03.900> it's<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.140> little<00:02:04.230> bit<00:02:04.320> domed<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.550> sort

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
that it's a little bit domed it can sort

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.479 
that it's a little bit domed it can sort
of<00:02:05.880> throw<00:02:06.180> different<00:02:06.960> shades<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.710> blue<00:02:07.890> across

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the dial at different moments so it sort

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.369 
the dial at different moments so it sort

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
I was worried about legibility with this

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.160 
I was worried about legibility with this
watch<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.130> thought<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.550> with<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.170> polished

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
watch I thought that with the polished

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.610 
watch I thought that with the polished
our<00:02:34.620> markers<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.790> hands<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.780> there

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
our markers and the hands that there

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.110 
our markers and the hands that there
wouldn't<00:02:37.860> be<00:02:37.920> enough<00:02:38.160> contrast<00:02:38.700> against<00:02:39.030> a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
wouldn't be enough contrast against a

wouldn't be enough contrast against a

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
dark dial however they're so mirror

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.660 
dark dial however they're so mirror
polish<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.840> they<00:02:43.020> catch<00:02:43.290> light<00:02:43.680> easily<00:02:44.460> and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
polish that they catch light easily and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.090

so<00:02:45.120> at<00:02:45.210> any<00:02:45.300> point<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.750> time<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.530> hour<00:02:46.770> and

watch<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.900> think<00:03:37.140> it's<00:03:37.470> tastefully<00:03:38.010> done

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
watch I think it's tastefully done

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.060 
watch I think it's tastefully done
there's<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.480> good<00:03:39.630> execution<00:03:39.930> here<00:03:40.530> it's<00:03:40.770> just

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
there's a good execution here it's just

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.160 
there's a good execution here it's just
sighs<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:42.090> little<00:03:42.270> more<00:03:42.360> modern<00:03:42.780> li<00:03:42.930> and

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
sighs and a little more modern li and

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.110 
sighs and a little more modern li and
and<00:03:43.800> maybe<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.190> don't<00:03:44.280> like<00:03:44.520> that<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.970> that's

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
and maybe you don't like that and that's

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.930 
and maybe you don't like that and that's
okay<00:03:45.450> but<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.750> know<00:03:45.960> certainly<00:03:46.380> on<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:47.070> the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
okay but you know certainly on on the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.990 
okay but you know certainly on on the
wrist<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.810> not<00:03:49.110> big<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.650> think<00:03:50.070> if<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.430> take

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
wrist it's not big I think if you take

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.610 
wrist it's not big I think if you take
into<00:03:51.270> account<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.900> way<00:03:52.020> they've<00:03:52.260> done<00:03:52.290> the

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
into account the way they've done the

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.160 
into account the way they've done the
lugs<00:03:52.890> I<00:03:53.280> think<00:03:53.820> you'll<00:03:53.970> agree<00:03:54.210> so<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.930> lugs

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
lugs I think you'll agree so the lugs

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.160 
lugs I think you'll agree so the lugs
come<00:03:55.650> out<00:03:55.770> straight<00:03:56.220> from<00:03:56.490> the<00:03:56.610> case<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.170> the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
come out straight from the case and the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.600 
come out straight from the case and the
lugs<00:03:58.380> are<00:03:58.530> pretty<00:03:58.710> short<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.430> know<00:03:59.490> I<00:03:59.520> think

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
lugs are pretty short you know I think

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.550 
lugs are pretty short you know I think
owing<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.210> the<00:04:00.300> shape<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.690> case<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.440> know

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
owing to the shape of the case you know

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.290 
owing to the shape of the case you know
the<00:04:01.680> way<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.220> case<00:04:02.460> is<00:04:02.610> sort<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.850> angled

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
the way the the case is sort of angled

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.900 
the way the the case is sort of angled
you<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.750> connect<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:05.010> strap<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.460> little<00:04:05.640> bit

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
you can connect the strap a little bit

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.400 
you can connect the strap a little bit
closer<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.540> case<00:04:06.750> than<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.260> would

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
closer to the case than you would

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.510 
closer to the case than you would
otherwise

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
otherwise

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.520 
otherwise
and<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.880> means<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.270> don't<00:04:09.420> eat<00:04:09.570> as<00:04:09.690> long<00:04:09.840> and

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
and that means you don't eat as long and

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.830 
and that means you don't eat as long and
if<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.070> think<00:04:11.280> about<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.700> lugs<00:04:11.970> are<00:04:12.300> really<00:04:12.810> a

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
if you think about it lugs are really a

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.050 
if you think about it lugs are really a
contributing<00:04:13.770> factor<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.220> how<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.460> watch<00:04:14.700> wears

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
contributing factor to how a watch wears

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.720 
contributing factor to how a watch wears
because<00:04:15.390> either<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.620> lugs<00:04:16.859> are<00:04:17.040> too<00:04:17.190> long<00:04:17.370> or

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
because either the lugs are too long or

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.750 
because either the lugs are too long or
the<00:04:18.570> case<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:18.810> too<00:04:19.049> big<00:04:19.200> itself<00:04:19.560> in<00:04:20.370> other<00:04:20.520> case

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
the case is too big itself in other case

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.130 
the case is too big itself in other case
it<00:04:20.910> doesn't<00:04:21.030> really<00:04:21.180> matter<00:04:21.420> because<00:04:21.810> it's<00:04:21.989> to

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
it doesn't really matter because it's to

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.600 
it doesn't really matter because it's to
let<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.500> lugs<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.860> are<00:04:22.980> hanging<00:04:23.220> over<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
let the lugs that are hanging over the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.690 
let the lugs that are hanging over the
edge<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.790> your<00:04:23.880> wrist<00:04:24.620> and<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:25.830> we<00:04:26.430> know<00:04:26.550> when

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
edge of your wrist and so we know when

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.490 
edge of your wrist and so we know when
it<00:04:26.790> comes<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.210> watch<00:04:27.450> it's<00:04:28.320> not<00:04:28.470> a

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
it comes to this watch it's not a

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.890 
it comes to this watch it's not a
problem<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.310> find<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.880> size<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.450> 42

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
problem and so I find the size of 42

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.690 
problem and so I find the size of 42
millimeters<00:04:31.410> is<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.920> know<00:04:32.010> it<00:04:32.160> wears<00:04:32.370> pretty

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
millimeters is you know it wears pretty

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.240 
millimeters is you know it wears pretty
well<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:34.050> know<00:04:34.110> if<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.380> hand<00:04:34.590> polished<00:04:35.010> case

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
well you know if the hand polished case

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.890 
well you know if the hand polished case
and<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.550> design<00:04:35.820> wasn't<00:04:36.090> enough<00:04:36.480> for<00:04:36.720> you

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
and the design wasn't enough for you

from my you know standpoint that is a
