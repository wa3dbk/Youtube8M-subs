 I can 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.690
 when looked three years ago 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.940

 minisport in fact it is absolutely not 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.670
 So 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.670
 it's terribly embarrassing 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.930
 for the first time before that totally 3 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.120
 you just go 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.260
 not accepted at all 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.690
 stunned by the situation think schools 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.690
 all this first 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.820
 it's all over 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.830
 Sophia only 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.890
 that is, if nothing depends on you 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.440
 in response it depends on gaddafi most likely 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.480
 for clients as above all 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.750
 in the city council 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.880
 first time 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.080
 You start 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.820
 George for the fifth time when you go 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 then you get scared 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.920
 the most important thing 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.600
 psychological 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 before the start passes imk 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.860
 prepared 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.050

 that is, the network is running 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.280
 also psychologically worth 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.390
 tuning in on bobsled 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.850

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.919
 fleet 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.019
 the explosion very much depends on them 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.229
 who to come from smoothly 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.549
 here he is 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.219
 because there will be two 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.919
 and you as one should be realized 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.829
 its show the best start because 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.989
 celsius 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.499
 no start no finish 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.129
 I ride blocks and in the fourth that year 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.129

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:57.769
 the first place 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.829
 and then 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.089
 join in 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.369
 four is completely different 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.479

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.389
 and here surrounds the complete team 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.389
 and here not everything depends 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.729
 and conveniently there very successfully 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.729
 procession sit percent 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.959
 as reported by the mayor was pressed percentage 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.029
 Fours are much more risky than 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.269
 twice 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.889

 in any case achieved 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:12.979
 no other way 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.159
 and the method is 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.299
 people 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.239
