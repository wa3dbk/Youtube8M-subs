the<00:00:47.140> handle<00:00:47.530> real<00:00:47.710> quick<00:00:47.949> it's<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.489> t6<00:00:48.940> anodized

the handle real quick it's a t6 anodized
aluminum<00:00:50.140> handle<00:00:50.589> I<00:00:50.789> think<00:00:51.789> it<00:00:51.940> feels<00:00:52.300> like<00:00:52.539> a

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
aluminum handle I think it feels like a

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.200 
aluminum handle I think it feels like a
powder<00:00:52.839> coating<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:54.159> doesn't<00:00:54.699> have<00:00:54.909> any

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
powder coating it doesn't have any

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.959 
powder coating it doesn't have any
checkering<00:00:55.899> none<00:00:56.289> of<00:00:56.409> that<00:00:56.440> so<00:00:56.949> you'd<00:00:57.579> expect

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
checkering none of that so you'd expect

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.489 
checkering none of that so you'd expect
it<00:00:58.059> would<00:00:58.179> be<00:00:58.300> very<00:00:58.449> Griffey<00:00:58.719> but<00:00:58.989> it<00:00:59.050> is<00:00:59.199> it'll

00:00:59.489 --> 00:00:59.499 
it would be very Griffey but it is it'll

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:01.319 
it would be very Griffey but it is it'll

that<00:01:13.690> just<00:01:13.960> because<00:01:14.230> you<00:01:14.410> know<00:01:14.500> the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
that just because you know the

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.850 
that just because you know the
durability<00:01:15.010> it<00:01:15.370> adds<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.960> purple<00:01:17.350> line<00:01:17.380> in

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
coating on the clip clip itself is still

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.960 
coating on the clip clip itself is still
very<00:02:29.500> durable<00:02:29.890> very<00:02:30.190> thick<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.940> know

madewell<00:02:31.630> like<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.530> expect<00:02:32.920> from<00:02:33.010> a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
madewell like you expect from a

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.240 
madewell like you expect from a
benchmade<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.590> there's<00:02:35.770> no<00:02:35.860> problems

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
benchmade and so there's no problems

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.440 
benchmade and so there's no problems
with<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.760> like<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.030> paint<00:02:37.300> is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450

chipping off on the clip which

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.790 
chipping off on the clip which
personally<00:02:40.210> is<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.390> problem<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.080> not<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.320> problem

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.380 
can see there and I know what normal
tanto<00:02:53.560> for<00:02:53.890> comparison<00:02:54.400> bringing<00:02:55.270> the

tanto for comparison bringing the
kershaw<00:02:56.110> blur<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:59.790> eliminates<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:01.000> angle

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
kershaw blur just eliminates this angle

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.890 
kershaw blur just eliminates this angle
here<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:02.820> just<00:03:03.820> gives<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.150> like<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.420> big<00:03:04.690> belly
