00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
didn't really like the gamepad controls

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.670 
didn't really like the gamepad controls
they<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.550> didn't<00:02:29.819> feel<00:02:30.239> right<00:02:30.630> or<00:02:31.170> even<00:02:31.440> that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
they just didn't feel right or even that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.430 
they just didn't feel right or even that
good<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.160> me<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.580> even<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> PC<00:02:33.569> controls<00:02:34.019> felt

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
good to me and even the PC controls felt

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.949 
good to me and even the PC controls felt
a<00:02:34.560> little<00:02:34.830> clunky<00:02:35.160> at<00:02:35.430> times<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:36.209> often<00:02:36.720> fond

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
a little clunky at times I often fond

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.020 
a little clunky at times I often fond
myself<00:02:37.440> either<00:02:37.739> not<00:02:38.160> being<00:02:38.430> able<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.610> find<00:02:38.849> my

the<00:02:41.310> environment<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:41.940> wish<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.299> checked<00:02:42.599> my

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the environment I wish I checked my

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.180 
the environment I wish I checked my
settings<00:02:43.080> more<00:02:43.290> before<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.620> played<00:02:43.950> though

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
settings more before I played though

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.009 
settings more before I played though
because<00:02:44.790> there's<00:02:45.090> actually<00:02:45.269> an<00:02:45.629> option<00:02:45.780> to

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
because there's actually an option to

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.660 
because there's actually an option to
change<00:02:46.230> across<00:02:46.650> their<00:02:46.830> color<00:02:47.069> and<00:02:47.130> shape<00:02:47.489> and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
change across their color and shape and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.970 
change across their color and shape and
the<00:02:47.730> options<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.390> may<00:02:49.049> have<00:02:49.200> remedied<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> lot

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
the options that may have remedied a lot

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.069 
the options that may have remedied a lot
of<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.160> problems<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.640> had<00:02:50.819> while<00:02:51.030> playing<00:02:51.299> but

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
of the problems I had while playing but

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.449 
of the problems I had while playing but
it<00:02:52.170> wouldn't<00:02:52.470> have<00:02:52.560> stopped<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.950> camera<00:02:53.160> from

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
it wouldn't have stopped the camera from

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.460 
it wouldn't have stopped the camera from
being<00:02:53.700> awkwardly<00:02:54.269> placed<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.930> blocking<00:02:55.319> my

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
being awkwardly placed and blocking my

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.199 
being awkwardly placed and blocking my
view<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.860> few<00:02:56.040> times<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.400> did<00:02:56.579> oh<00:02:56.760> and

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
view the few times it did oh and

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.280 
view the few times it did oh and
speaking<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.900> problems<00:02:59.030> surprisingly<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.360> only

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
speaking of problems surprisingly I only

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.780 
speaking of problems surprisingly I only
encountered<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.829> single<00:03:02.069> glitch<00:03:02.489> while

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
encountered a single glitch while

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.559 
encountered a single glitch while
playing<00:03:03.090> that's<00:03:03.930> like<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.500> record<00:03:05.489> for<00:03:05.790> me<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
playing that's like a record for me the

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.630 
playing that's like a record for me the
game<00:03:06.750> took<00:03:06.989> me<00:03:07.230> about<00:03:07.470> four<00:03:07.860> hours<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.430> beat

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
game took me about four hours to beat

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.059 
game took me about four hours to beat
mostly<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.230> damn<00:03:10.530> hard<00:03:10.860> in

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
mostly because it's so damn hard in

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.990 
mostly because it's so damn hard in
later<00:03:11.250> sections

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
later sections

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.660 
later sections
maybe<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:12.780> think<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.709> but<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.459> was

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
maybe I just think it it but I was

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.580 
maybe I just think it it but I was
tempted<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.090> turn<00:03:15.450> down<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.780> difficulty<00:03:16.349> just

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
tempted to turn down the difficulty just

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.530 
tempted to turn down the difficulty just
so<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.769> could<00:03:16.860> finish<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.310> I'm<00:03:17.730> glad<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.090> didn't

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
so I could finish it I'm glad I didn't

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.150 
so I could finish it I'm glad I didn't
because<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.959> later<00:03:19.170> sections<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:19.920> game

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
because the later sections of this game

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.009 
because the later sections of this game
were<00:03:20.609> my<00:03:20.760> favorite<00:03:21.299> parts<00:03:21.600> due<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.930> this

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
were my favorite parts due to this

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.750 
were my favorite parts due to this
difficulty<00:03:22.590> curve<00:03:22.769> which<00:03:23.340> seemed<00:03:23.639> to

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
difficulty curve which seemed to

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.970 
difficulty curve which seemed to
slightly<00:03:24.450> fall<00:03:24.870> off<00:03:25.079> towards<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> climax<00:03:25.739> of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
slightly fall off towards the climax of

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.420 
slightly fall off towards the climax of
the<00:03:26.040> game<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.579> man<00:03:27.359> oh<00:03:27.389> man<00:03:27.750> hey<00:03:28.739> its<00:03:28.889> dialogue
