00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
one which was really the development

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.800 
one which was really the development
period<00:02:10.440> from<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.480> design<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.540> the

interesting part of the bug their

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.660 
interesting part of the bug their
computer<00:02:22.230> museum<00:02:22.920> these<00:02:23.160> are<00:02:23.310> not<00:02:23.430> really

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
computer museum these are not really

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.580 
computer museum these are not really
computers<00:02:24.270> but<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> tube<00:02:25.110> collection

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
computers but this is a tube collection

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.270 
computers but this is a tube collection
and<00:02:25.709> we<00:02:25.770> acquired<00:02:26.100> several<00:02:26.340> years<00:02:26.730> ago<00:02:26.910> and

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
and we acquired several years ago and

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.770 
and we acquired several years ago and
amber<00:02:29.280> set<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.610> up<00:02:29.730> here<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.450> don't<00:02:30.630> know

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
amber set it up here and I don't know

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.720 
amber set it up here and I don't know
there's<00:02:30.989> about<00:02:31.140> 40<00:02:31.800> tubes<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.459> there<00:02:32.640> are

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
there's about 40 tubes and there are

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.470 
there's about 40 tubes and there are
various<00:02:33.030> kinds<00:02:33.200> some<00:02:34.200> Edison<00:02:35.060> original<00:02:36.060> lamps

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
various kinds some Edison original lamps

various kinds some Edison original lamps
and<00:02:36.660> other<00:02:36.750> vacuum<00:02:37.200> tubes<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.850> can<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:38.880> say

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and other vacuum tubes and can you say

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.370 
and other vacuum tubes and can you say
anything<00:02:39.269> about<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.660> collection<00:02:39.900> amber<00:02:40.319> I

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
anything about this collection amber I

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.140 
anything about this collection amber I
know<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.560> had<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.830> favor<00:02:41.130> 21<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.819> money<00:02:42.000> were

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
correct you there are over 70 toots in

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.330 
correct you there are over 70 toots in
here<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:48.230> rina<00:02:49.230> van<00:02:49.440> work<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.799> other<00:02:49.950> intern

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
here we rina van work the other intern

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.610 
here we rina van work the other intern
and<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.610> went<00:02:51.000> through<00:02:51.120> all<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.450> boxes<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:52.080> had

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
and I went through all the boxes and had

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.800 
and I went through all the boxes and had
to<00:02:52.769> remember<00:02:53.160> them<00:02:53.340> but<00:02:54.030> my<00:02:54.180> favorite<00:02:54.600> one<00:02:54.780> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
to remember them but my favorite one is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.830 
to remember them but my favorite one is
number<00:02:55.680> 58<00:02:56.160> right<00:02:56.370> here<00:02:56.670> because<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.540> think<00:02:57.750> it

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
number 58 right here because I think it

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.440 
number 58 right here because I think it
looks<00:02:57.989> like<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.110> UFO<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.890> really<00:02:59.549> small<00:03:00.060> went

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
looks like a UFO it's really small went

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.670 
looks like a UFO it's really small went
up<00:03:00.540> there<00:03:00.720> turn<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:00.930> down<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.260> get<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.530> here

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
up there turn it down I get it here

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.280 
up there turn it down I get it here
point<00:03:02.040> right<00:03:02.190> at<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.489> right<00:03:03.450> there<00:03:03.660> we're<00:03:04.260> very

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
point right at it right there we're very

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.500 
point right at it right there we're very
interesting-looking<00:03:05.180> def<00:03:06.180> definitely

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
interesting-looking def definitely

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.360 
interesting-looking def definitely
different<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.739> then<00:03:07.859> what<00:03:08.070> do<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.220> have<00:03:08.310> a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
different and then what do we have a

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.849 
different and then what do we have a
brother<00:03:08.670> big<00:03:09.030> teaching<00:03:09.420> slide<00:03:09.720> rule<00:03:09.959> yeah<00:03:10.530> but

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
brother big teaching slide rule yeah but

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.930 
brother big teaching slide rule yeah but
back<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.730> tubes<00:03:12.680> there<00:03:13.680> are<00:03:13.829> also<00:03:14.040> actual

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
back to the tubes there are also actual

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.680 
back to the tubes there are also actual
Edison<00:03:15.890> tubes<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.130> here<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:18.350> believe<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:20.690> pick

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
Edison tubes in here I believe it pick

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.090 
Edison tubes in here I believe it pick
down<00:03:21.900> in<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.140> lower<00:03:22.290> right<00:03:22.560> isn't<00:03:22.829> that<00:03:22.890> one

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
down in the lower right isn't that one

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.729 
down in the lower right isn't that one
down<00:03:23.250> there<00:03:23.400> maybe<00:03:24.140> maybe<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.440> her<00:03:25.530> would<00:03:25.709> be

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
down there maybe maybe and her would be

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.050 
down there maybe maybe and her would be
another<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.340> think<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.640> one<00:03:26.850> right<00:03:27.000> here

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
another one I think this one right here

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.830 
another one I think this one right here
is<00:03:27.570> one<00:03:28.519> hmm<00:03:29.519> but<00:03:30.120> you're<00:03:30.269> right<00:03:30.390> there's<00:03:30.660> some

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
is one hmm but you're right there's some

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.030 
is one hmm but you're right there's some

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
three storyboards and tell us a little

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.490 
three storyboards and tell us a little
bit<00:03:38.519> about<00:03:38.730> this<00:03:38.970> one<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.959> different

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
bit about this one this is a different

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
one this way board gives information

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.699 
one this way board gives information
about<00:03:43.609> all<00:03:44.609> of<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:45.060> computers<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.959> we<00:03:46.590> have

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
about all of the computers that we have

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.090 
about all of the computers that we have
placed<00:03:47.069> in<00:03:47.370> these<00:03:48.030> two<00:03:48.980> cases<00:03:50.450> right<00:03:51.450> here

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
placed in these two cases right here

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.039 
placed in these two cases right here
okay<00:03:53.100> we<00:03:53.220> just<00:03:53.250> took<00:03:54.239> some<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.600> Morrisons

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
okay we just took some of the Morrisons

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.319 
okay we just took some of the Morrisons
historically<00:03:55.859> significant<00:03:56.549> computers<00:03:57.120> and

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
historically significant computers and

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.759
