basic texting it might look a little bit
sloppy<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:36.899> my<00:00:37.140> man<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.440> still<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:37.950> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
sloppy because my man is still kind of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.549 
sloppy because my man is still kind of
nerdy<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.750> let's<00:00:39.750> go<00:00:39.899> ahead<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.290> get<00:00:40.410> into

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.430 
nerdy but let's go ahead and get into
this<00:00:41.090> basic<00:00:42.379> axioms<00:00:46.969> it's<00:00:47.969> pretty<00:00:48.690> easy<00:00:49.020> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
this basic axioms it's pretty easy it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.209 
this basic axioms it's pretty easy it
doesn't<00:00:49.770> take<00:00:49.920> any<00:00:50.390> staking<00:00:51.710> whatsoever<00:00:52.710> it

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
doesn't take any staking whatsoever it

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.450 
doesn't take any staking whatsoever it
just<00:00:53.489> takes<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.090> bit<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.199> strength<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
just takes a bit of strength like just a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.500 
just takes a bit of strength like just a
little<00:00:56.699> bit<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.850> strength<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.239> coordination

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
little bit of strength and coordination

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.580 
little bit of strength and coordination
that's<00:00:58.079> about<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.480> let's<00:01:00.480> go<00:01:00.570> ahead<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.199> start

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
that's about it let's go ahead and start

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.779 
that's about it let's go ahead and start
this<00:01:01.770> we're<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> start<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.430> our<00:01:02.550> right

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
sit down whenever they stop touching so

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.560 
sit down whenever they stop touching so
much<00:01:58.610> you<00:01:58.790> pick<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.120> up

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
much you pick it up

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:22.350 
much you pick it up
stop<00:02:01.690> so<00:02:18.940> an<00:02:19.940> eight<00:02:20.480> count<00:02:20.810> an<00:02:21.530> eight<00:02:21.710> count

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
stop so an eight count an eight count

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.600 
stop so an eight count an eight count
five<00:02:23.360> six<00:02:23.660> seven<00:02:23.960> eight<00:02:24.020> one<00:02:24.290> two<00:02:24.710> three<00:02:25.220> four

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
five six seven eight one two three four

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.750 
five six seven eight one two three four
five<00:02:25.970> six<00:02:26.360> seven<00:02:26.810> eight<00:02:27.050> each<00:02:27.620> hex<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.490> I

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
five six seven eight each hex is I

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.300 
five six seven eight each hex is I
believe<00:02:29.000> two<00:02:29.900> counts<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:31.100> it's<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.800> we're

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
believe two counts so it's so we're

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.340 
believe two counts so it's so we're
gonna<00:02:34.490> do<00:02:34.700> about<00:02:35.030> four<00:02:36.040> four<00:02:37.040> per<00:02:37.910> foot<00:02:38.510> so

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
gonna do about four four per foot so

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.340 
gonna do about four four per foot so
let's<00:02:39.890> go<00:02:40.010> ahead<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:40.280> I'm<00:02:41.000> going<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.780> say<00:02:42.110> five

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
let's go ahead and I'm going to say five

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.920 
let's go ahead and I'm going to say five
six<00:02:42.530> seven<00:02:42.860> eight<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.459> start<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:44.060> one<00:02:44.390> so

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
six seven eight and you start on one so

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.759 
six seven eight and you start on one so
ready<00:02:45.320> five<00:02:45.830> six<00:02:46.090> seven<00:02:47.090> eight

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.330 

all<00:02:52.769> right<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.549> is<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.819> basic<00:02:54.650> sorry<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:56.069> was

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
all right that is a basic sorry this was

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.459 
all right that is a basic sorry this was
boring<00:02:58.219> boring<00:02:59.219> but<00:02:59.969> it<00:03:00.810> was<00:03:00.959> impressive<00:03:01.170> and

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
boring boring but it was impressive and

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.319 
boring boring but it was impressive and
do<00:03:01.650> some<00:03:01.829> groundwork<00:03:02.219> and<00:03:02.700> don't<00:03:02.879> do<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> lot<00:03:03.299> of

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
do some groundwork and don't do a lot of

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.020 
do some groundwork and don't do a lot of
groundwork<00:03:03.659> like<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.019> said<00:03:04.439> but<00:03:05.189> this<00:03:05.790> was

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
groundwork like I said but this was

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.709 
groundwork like I said but this was
basic<00:03:06.629> axiom<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:08.359> check<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.510> other<00:03:09.629> videos

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
basic axiom and check the other videos

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.349 
basic axiom and check the other videos
are<00:03:10.170> going<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.409> be<00:03:10.469> a<00:03:10.500> couple<00:03:10.709> variations<00:03:11.359> so

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
are going to be a couple variations so

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.280
