00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.830 
problem there as far as I know there max
hit<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.079> around<00:01:43.320> 300<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.909> are<00:01:45.119> pretty<00:01:45.570> safe

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
hit is around 300 so you are pretty safe

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.569 
hit is around 300 so you are pretty safe
if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.560> know<00:01:46.680> keep<00:01:46.860> your<00:01:47.009> health<00:01:47.280> up

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
if you do you know keep your health up

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.160 
if you do you know keep your health up

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
so there's nothing to worry about there

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.539 
so there's nothing to worry about there

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
so you can use this to kind of figure

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.599 
so you can use this to kind of figure
out<00:03:17.910> where<00:03:18.180> she<00:03:18.359> has<00:03:18.510> gone<00:03:18.599> in<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.500> room<00:03:20.099> so

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
out where she has gone in the room so

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.009 
out where she has gone in the room so
it's<00:03:20.730> not<00:03:20.849> hard<00:03:21.090> at<00:03:21.180> all<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.510> it's<00:03:21.630> very<00:03:21.840> easy

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
it's not hard at all and it's very easy
