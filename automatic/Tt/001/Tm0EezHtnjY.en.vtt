this<00:00:00.840> will<00:00:01.079> be<00:00:01.230> a<00:00:01.260> standard<00:00:01.800> soft<00:00:02.340> hackle<00:00:02.820> wet

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:03.830 
this will be a standard soft hackle wet

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:11.830 
this will be a standard soft hackle wet
but<00:00:04.830> with<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.190> split<00:00:06.180> thread<00:00:06.540> rib<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.109> thorax

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.870 

we'll<00:00:12.840> start<00:00:13.139> fly<00:00:14.130> by<00:00:14.570> tying<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.839> hackle

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
we'll start fly by tying in the hackle

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.480 
we'll start fly by tying in the hackle
in<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.060> case<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.740> whiting<00:00:19.740> cocked<00:00:20.070> Leon

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
in this case it's a whiting cocked Leon

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.349 
in this case it's a whiting cocked Leon
hand<00:00:20.960> hackle<00:00:22.340> which<00:00:23.340> will<00:00:23.609> tie<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.060> as<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
hand hackle which will tie in as the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:34.640 
hand hackle which will tie in as the
first<00:00:24.570> material<00:00:26.029> to<00:00:27.029> go<00:00:27.180> on

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.350 

then<00:00:35.650> it<00:00:35.800> becomes<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.370> matter<00:00:36.550> of<00:00:36.700> simply

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
then it becomes a matter of simply

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.380 
then it becomes a matter of simply
rapping<00:00:37.840> touching<00:00:38.260> turns<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.760> form<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.210> body

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
rapping touching turns to form the body

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:49.170 
rapping touching turns to form the body
of<00:00:40.750> this<00:00:41.590> fly<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:44.500> where<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.460> bark<00:00:48.730> would<00:00:49.030> be

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
of this fly to where the bark would be

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.060 
of this fly to where the bark would be
if<00:00:49.390> this<00:00:49.570> were<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.989> barbed<00:00:50.440> hook<00:00:50.620> which<00:00:51.190> is<00:00:51.370> not

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
if this were a barbed hook which is not

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.880 
if this were a barbed hook which is not
next<00:00:54.390> take<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.420> little<00:00:55.690> bit<00:00:55.900> of<00:00:56.580> beaver<00:00:57.580> dubbing

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
next take a little bit of beaver dubbing

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.010 
next take a little bit of beaver dubbing
sorry<00:00:59.890> I<00:00:59.949> have<00:01:00.100> to<00:01:00.280> pluck<00:01:01.030> off<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.390> belt<00:01:01.600> here

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:10.460 

to<00:01:05.020> get<00:01:05.170> it<00:01:05.290> ready

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:22.080 

split<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.649> thread<00:01:11.950> by<00:01:12.310> untwisting<00:01:13.240> it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:31.450 

flattening<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.270> that's<00:01:24.260> not<00:01:24.470> so-called<00:01:30.460> good

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
flattening it that's not so-called good

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:40.140 
flattening it that's not so-called good
behavior<00:01:32.000> studies

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:49.840 

sometimes<00:01:41.150> they<00:01:41.420> don't

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.289 

like<00:01:50.420> so

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:03.940 

insert<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:55.039> little<00:01:56.039> bit<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.280> dubbing

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:14.200 

and<00:02:04.950> then<00:02:05.540> spin

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.070

an open spiral to form the start of the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.030 
an open spiral to form the start of the
rib<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:24.540> gets<00:02:24.810> fuzzier<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.560> come<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.920> the

rib it gets fuzzier as you come to the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.420 
rib it gets fuzzier as you come to the
front<00:02:26.370> then<00:02:27.170> touching<00:02:28.170> turns<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.860> build<00:02:29.190> up

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
easy pliers start dropping touching

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.500 
easy pliers start dropping touching
turns<00:02:47.230> towards<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.410> bend<00:02:50.920> drop<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.130> tip<00:02:52.510> cut

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
turns towards to bend drop the tip cut

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.240 
turns towards to bend drop the tip cut
through<00:02:54.100> snap<00:02:55.100> off<00:02:55.340> tip<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:57.319> finish<00:02:57.709> off<00:02:57.980> with
