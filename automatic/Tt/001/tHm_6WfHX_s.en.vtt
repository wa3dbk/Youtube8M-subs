00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
any sniper game plays but lately i've

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
any sniper game plays but lately i've
been<00:01:50.970> i've<00:01:51.119> been<00:01:51.600> enjoying<00:01:51.869> sniping<00:01:52.590> quite<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
been i've been enjoying sniping quite a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.850 
been i've been enjoying sniping quite a
bit<00:01:53.040> especially<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> DSR<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> ballista

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
bit especially with the DSR the ballista

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.889 
bit especially with the DSR the ballista
the<00:01:55.860> ballista<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.600> just<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the ballista is just it's just a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.630 
the ballista is just it's just a
hitmarker<00:01:58.200> machine<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.770> i<00:01:58.829> don't<00:01:59.009> quite<00:01:59.310> like

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
hitmarker machine so i don't quite like

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.190 
hitmarker machine so i don't quite like
it<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.880> much<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.270> feels<00:02:00.360> more<00:02:00.630> consistent

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
it as much it feels more consistent

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.990 
it as much it feels more consistent
think<00:02:01.619> it'd<00:02:01.710> be<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> really<00:02:02.009> good<00:02:02.159> sniper<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.729> i

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
think it'd be a really good sniper but i

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.969 
think it'd be a really good sniper but i
just<00:02:03.630> gets<00:02:03.810> way<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> medium<00:02:04.439> markers<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:04.890> I've

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
just gets way to medium markers but I've

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.510 
just gets way to medium markers but I've
been<00:02:05.070> tearing<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.549> with<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> DSR<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:07.520> just

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
been tearing it up with the DSR and just

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.859 
been tearing it up with the DSR and just
I<00:02:08.729> don't<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.569> been<00:02:09.690> enjoying
