 After training, make the most of them 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.700
 The advantage of the biological clock for

 recover glycogen stores 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.720

 some is about training for others 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.360
 it is not, but if the same group works 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.909
 muscle more than twice a week or 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.710
 more than fifteen sl per group during 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.530
 a prolonged period of time is 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.250

 attack the muscle without risk of injury
