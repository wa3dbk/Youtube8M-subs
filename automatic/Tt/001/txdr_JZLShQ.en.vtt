00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.330
 Hello friends, I have salt phone 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.190
 lenovo s 90 with the letter u where it stands 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.990
 original chinese firmware exactly 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.810
 that firmware from which came to me with 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.309
 aliexpress and probably the most to whom 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.990
 he will come here too 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.640
 original chinese firmware where 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.249
 only english chinese and 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.019
 nothing else but the first thing is that people 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.550
 want to do it on this machine 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.369
 get root rights in order to 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.989
 leave gapps well or there for others 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.939
 nuances but root rights are normal 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.980
 programs can not get because 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.539
 that it has a locked bootloader for 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.309
 In order to get root rights you need 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:40.250
 unlock bootloader first 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.469
 that's what I show in this video is not 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.660
 hurry for now nothing to do just too 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.940
 Watch this video and then if 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.920
 you will need to do this you start 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.090
 there is an umbrella just watch it 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.070
 for information 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.359
 so what we need first we need 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.250
 install drivers 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.710
 how to do it I showed here in this 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.390
 here's a video look do it all later 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.539
 move on we need to install 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.189
 I have already shown this program 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.659
 how to do it but now i will take a piece 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.250
 from this video and just paste it here 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.570
 so you can see it 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.659
 so install the program to start 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.350
 we need to install visual c 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.290
 after that we will need 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.180
 restart the computer in general I 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.060
 I guess it will not all show that 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.930
 I will show the result and no , I do not need 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.610
 restart computer everything is fine i am 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.100
 when the first time I had to bet 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.439
 restart the computer I have it all now 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.440
 I will do on windows 8.1 64 bit before 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.820
 i did the same on 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.380
 windows 32 bits on windows 7 and i don't have 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.660
 It turned out to install the driver 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.260
 I have not earned anything so 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.720
 I switched to windows 64 and everything is already there 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.090
 ok for earned but there is one 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.710
 nuance that is all the program we 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.570
 set now what nuance is for 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:07.570
 64-bit windows we open this one 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:09.760
 Here is the program and in the properties you need 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.010
 indicate that we run in mode 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:17.500
 compatibility with windows 7 to run 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.840
 program in compatibility mode and from 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.060
 administrator name here you are the same 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.240
 put after we installed 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.390
 this program we need to run this 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.040
 program and feed and here's this file 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.040
 well let's do it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.030
 from have opened a program from a cow and this one 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.030
 here is the folder 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.130
 and now also in this folder we feed 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.980
 she has these two xml everything is ready with us 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.980
 now connect the phone to the hut 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.880
 enable usb debug mode 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.040
 Be sure to tick what to allow 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.560
 permanent connections for this 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.239
 computer until we see 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.000
 no device program 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.760
 does not see us so that she 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.310
 I saw it you need to call the number only 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.380
 asterisk lattice asterisk lattice two 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.970
 eights two nines trellis asterisk 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.459
 sprocket asterisk but it's all easy 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.230
 remembered 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.209
 here they appeared at us com ports 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.670
 if we correctly install the driver but 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.239
 and here it is immediately visible here lenovo 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.480
 beating up 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.730
 diagnostics but press the download button 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.540
 the phone should go on reboot but also 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.010
 look carefully here status and 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.190
 now goes into this mode now 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:57.190
 It appears here a new device that's it 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.190
 9008 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.570
 well, everything was all done not phone 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.270
 restarted well what happens is that 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.950
 This program simply rewrote 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.019
 bootloader which was this phone 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.120
 which was blocked by another 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.500
 bootloader which is already unlocked 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.480
 now you can safely receive 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.980
 root-rights how to do it I showed here 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.590
 in this here is a video can go and 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.420
 look but if you want to get 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.400
 root rights to install 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.460
 Hans to set languages 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.300
 that makes no sense because you 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.480
 can immediately not unlock 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.560
 bootloader run one batch file I will show 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.750
 it is in the following form 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.550
 and he immediately do everything put and gaps 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.440
 and root and tongues 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.990
 so if you need the original 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.810
 firmware but also root rights then see 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.550
 the next video is about root if you just 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.720
 want to get 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.540
 and root languages ​​and 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.690
 gapps and then go to this one 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.640
 video smooth gapps about everything else and 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:08.160
 See how to make you have 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.160
 ok but all thanks to everyone
