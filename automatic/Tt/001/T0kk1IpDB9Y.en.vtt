 I always have to have organic baking powder like that 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:09.549
 give in a bit more and ten 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:15.560
 seconds four to five mixed 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:19.400

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.280
 namely then also remembered how 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:53.560
 it's not called in the last video 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.710
 I knew that here in here 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.190
 knead and then on the one hand and small ones 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.750
 just pull up the edge 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.530
 the mixed if a bit clean here 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:12.519

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:14.950
 now 500 plan milk needs the most active 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.989
 Here, unfortunately, you have the stroke that 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.989
 would have to be 500 then 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.090
 the scales a little bit two packets 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.980

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.160
 I may the past days but 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.530

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.239
 you do not actually use it 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.239
 That's why it's exactly 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:53.300
 doctor well you do not have two eggs 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.300
 150 grams of sugar 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.099
 I'll put that aside for you 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:16.560
 Put the lid on it and then six 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:18.299
 minutes 90 degrees 1 cook and 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.519

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.519

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:30.269
 that means I make music for sure 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.840
 that I just drip off normal 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.840
 bowl 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:51.020
 I will bowl myself 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.070
 I do not need so suddenly 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.990
 a bit small and then here at the moment 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:03.250
 she is already two co klÃ¶co 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:06.400

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.400

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.489

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.630
 So mixed after anyway a 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.830
 half a minute ran and then I have 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.950
 put back on 1 and I have 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.630
 just 20 minutes more on it 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:38.710
 Maybe it was because of that 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:40.720

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.600

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.600

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.889
 good 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.480
 I was very scared because of the dough 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.070
 already extreme and the liquid 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.830
 on top of that was almost until 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.660
 Stop this link but it is 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.640

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.020
 curious as it tastes so well 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.020

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.100
 to build 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.450
 in 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:15.500
 with this very refreshing of this mass 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.500
 of course also very low-fat 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:27.390
 I would have it so icy but so completely 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:29.430
 it is not yes 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.050

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.330
 age 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.770
 he was still very light I can do it 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:39.710
 I just do not have to try it 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:42.979
 You can wait here until it gets cold 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.979
 nice concept 

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:49.369
