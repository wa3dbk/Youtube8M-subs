today's<00:00:12.150> weapon<00:00:12.990> review<00:00:13.170> we're<00:00:13.560> looking<00:00:13.920> at

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
today's weapon review we're looking at

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.929 
today's weapon review we're looking at
the<00:00:14.280> g36c<00:00:15.240> are<00:00:15.960> buying<00:00:16.310> reason<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.460> have

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
the g36c are buying reason I have

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.330 
the g36c are buying reason I have
decided<00:00:18.450> to<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.750> a<00:00:18.810> little<00:00:18.870> look<00:00:19.440> at<00:00:19.590> this<00:00:19.770> is

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
decided to have a little look at this is

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.520 
decided to have a little look at this is
because<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.240> just<00:00:21.510> been<00:00:21.630> updated<00:00:21.780> it's<00:00:22.350> just

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:22.530 
because it's just been updated it's just

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.580 
because it's just been updated it's just
how<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.680> buff<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.520> latest<00:00:23.760> patch<00:00:24.450> so<00:00:25.260> what

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
how to buff in the latest patch so what

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.540 
how to buff in the latest patch so what
have<00:00:25.830> they<00:00:25.980> actually<00:00:26.160> done<00:00:26.789> through<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> g36c

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
have they actually done through the g36c

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.330 
have they actually done through the g36c
well<00:00:29.550> they<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.240> reduced<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.410> side<00:00:31.859> side

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
well they have reduced the side side

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.170 
well they have reduced the side side
recoil<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.570> first<00:00:33.930> shot<00:00:34.470> recoil<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:35.880> and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
recoil and the first shot recoil to and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.260 
recoil and the first shot recoil to and
I<00:00:36.390> quote<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:37.230> lowest<00:00:38.010> side-to-side<00:00:38.610> recoil

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
I quote the lowest side-to-side recoil

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.750 
I quote the lowest side-to-side recoil
of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.899> carbines<00:00:40.559> giving<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.130> clear<00:00:41.520> and

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
of the carbines giving it a clear and

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.940 
of the carbines giving it a clear and
controllable<00:00:42.480> low<00:00:42.840> rate<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> fire<00:00:43.590> role

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
controllable low rate of fire role

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.569 
controllable low rate of fire role
especially<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:45.390> compared<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.500> AK<00:00:46.980> 5c

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
especially when compared to the AK 5c

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.430 
especially when compared to the AK 5c
type<00:00:47.969> 95<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:49.020> one<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.649> aku<00:00:50.550> 12<00:00:51.329> end<00:00:51.780> coins

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
type 95 be one and the aku 12 end coins

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.630 
type 95 be one and the aku 12 end coins
yes<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.079> g36<00:00:55.079> seen<00:00:55.350> our<00:00:55.649> beast<00:00:56.100> since

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
yes so it's the g36 seen our beast since

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.600 
yes so it's the g36 seen our beast since
it's<00:00:56.820> been<00:00:57.000> buffed<00:00:57.329> hmm<00:00:57.930> possibly<00:00:58.530> not<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.430> my

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
it's been buffed hmm possibly not in my

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.049 
it's been buffed hmm possibly not in my
opinion<00:01:00.410> so<00:01:01.410> I'd<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.129> put<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> weapon

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
opinion so I'd like to put the weapon

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.450 
opinion so I'd like to put the weapon
stats<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:04.199> I've<00:01:04.379> had<00:01:04.649> a<00:01:04.890> look<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.250> some

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
stats up but I've had a look at some

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.940 
stats up but I've had a look at some
thick<00:01:05.729> NRL<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.659> tell<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
thick NRL so I can tell it's not up to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.660 
thick NRL so I can tell it's not up to
date<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.729> latest<00:01:08.820> stats<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.810> g36c

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
date with the latest stats of the g36c

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.399 
date with the latest stats of the g36c
but<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> base<00:01:11.970> stats<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.600> its<00:01:12.750> still<00:01:12.990> remain

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
but the base stats of its still remain

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.310 
but the base stats of its still remain
the<00:01:13.619> same<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.340> has<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.820> reload<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.720> 2.1

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the same so it has a reload of 2.1

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.950 
the same so it has a reload of 2.1
seconds<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.460> has<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> vertical<00:01:18.030> recoil<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
seconds it has a vertical recoil of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.260 
seconds it has a vertical recoil of
naught<00:01:19.290> point<00:01:19.530> 25<00:01:20.100> which<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.700> completely

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
naught point 25 which is completely

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.160 
naught point 25 which is completely
controllable<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.619> has<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.000> 650<00:01:24.000> rate<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.540> fire<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
controllable it has a 650 rate of fire I

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.710 
controllable it has a 650 rate of fire I
don't<00:01:25.830> know<00:01:26.280> what<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> side-to-side<00:01:27.180> recoil

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
don't know what the side-to-side recoil

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
don't know what the side-to-side recoil
is<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.799> say<00:01:29.100> those<00:01:29.310> stats<00:01:29.670> aren't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
is because as I say those stats aren't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.480 
is because as I say those stats aren't
up<00:01:30.390> there<00:01:30.689> yet<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.680> when<00:01:31.860> we're<00:01:32.070> looking<00:01:32.189> at

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
up there yet so when we're looking at

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.120 
up there yet so when we're looking at
the<00:01:32.549> g36c<00:01:33.420> as<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.080> carbine<00:01:34.619> we're<00:01:34.860> really

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the g36c as a carbine we're really

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.719 
the g36c as a carbine we're really
comparing<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.090> say<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.140> AK<00:01:37.500> 5<00:01:37.830> see<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> aku

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
comparing it to say the AK 5 see the aku

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.749 
comparing it to say the AK 5 see the aku
12<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:40.170> maybe<00:01:40.380> even<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> certain<00:01:41.400> extent

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
12 and maybe even to a certain extent

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.560 
12 and maybe even to a certain extent
the<00:01:41.939> 852<00:01:42.680> cqb<00:01:43.680> which<00:01:44.280> has<00:01:44.640> exactly<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.420> same

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the 852 cqb which has exactly the same

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.490 
the 852 cqb which has exactly the same
rate<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.500> fire<00:01:47.210> now<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> s<00:01:48.509> two<00:01:48.990> weapons<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
rate of fire now it s two weapons that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.310 
rate of fire now it s two weapons that
have<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.920> same<00:01:50.159> rate<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.880> fire<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.420> g36c

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
have the same rate of fire but g36c

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.560 
have the same rate of fire but g36c
doesn't<00:01:52.979> come<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.610> very<00:01:53.640> well<00:01:54.240> because

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
doesn't come out of it very well because

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.240 
doesn't come out of it very well because
the<00:01:55.380> ace<00:01:55.560> 52<00:01:56.450> whilst<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.689> only<00:01:57.869> has<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.680> 25

minimum<00:02:17.880> damage<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.600> minimum<00:02:19.260> damage<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.830> 20

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
minimum damage a minimum damage of 20

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.730 
minimum damage a minimum damage of 20
where's<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> minimum<00:02:21.630> damage<00:02:21.840> of<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.170> g30

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.420 
where's the minimum damage of the g30
succeeds<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.610> 15.4<00:02:24.650> now<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.890> minimum

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
succeeds the 15.4 now that minimum

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.930 
succeeds the 15.4 now that minimum
damage<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.940> 20<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.960> 50<00:02:28.680> meters<00:02:29.160> away<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.490> it

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
damage of 20 is 50 meters away so it

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.190 
damage of 20 is 50 meters away so it
does<00:02:30.120> take<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> little<00:02:30.660> while<00:02:30.930> for<00:02:31.140> that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
does take a little while for that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.920 
does take a little while for that
minimum<00:02:31.680> damage<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.460> kick<00:02:32.670> him<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.810> there

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
minimum damage to kick him so is there

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.530 
minimum damage to kick him so is there
really<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.500> role<00:02:34.860> for<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.280> g36c<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
really a role for the g36c and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.990 
really a role for the g36c and
battlefield<00:02:37.080> 4<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.620> mean<00:02:38.130> particularly<00:02:38.760> since

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
battlefield 4 I mean particularly since

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.390 
battlefield 4 I mean particularly since
this<00:02:39.270> buff<00:02:39.600> well<00:02:40.410> I'll<00:02:40.530> go<00:02:40.710> as<00:02:40.800> far<00:02:41.040> as<00:02:41.160> saying

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
this buff well I'll go as far as saying

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.030 
this buff well I'll go as far as saying
this<00:02:41.660> it's<00:02:42.660> never<00:02:43.050> gonna<00:02:43.230> be<00:02:43.320> my<00:02:43.470> favorite

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
this it's never gonna be my favorite

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.120 
this it's never gonna be my favorite
cowboy<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.640> fact<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:45.270> did<00:02:45.930> really<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.410> this

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
cowboy in fact I did really like this

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.480 
cowboy in fact I did really like this
weapon<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.850> battlefield<00:02:48.210> 3<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.290> really<00:02:50.250> wish

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
weapon in battlefield 3 so I really wish

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.150 
weapon in battlefield 3 so I really wish
it<00:02:50.760> had<00:02:51.030> more<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.600> role<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:52.020> battlefield<00:02:52.530> 4<00:02:52.620> I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
it had more of a role in battlefield 4 I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.910 
it had more of a role in battlefield 4 I
just<00:02:54.030> think<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.690> there<00:02:55.020> are<00:02:55.050> other<00:02:55.380> weapons

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
just think that there are other weapons

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920 
just think that there are other weapons
out<00:02:56.100> there<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.670> just<00:02:56.850> hold<00:02:57.210> themselves<00:02:57.480> a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
out there that just hold themselves a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.110 
out there that just hold themselves a
little<00:02:58.170> bit<00:02:58.500> better<00:02:58.650> than<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.100> one<00:02:59.430> for

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
little bit better than this one for

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.280 
little bit better than this one for
example<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.690> ak-12<00:03:01.730> can<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.540> significant

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
example the ak-12 can have a significant

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.070 
example the ak-12 can have a significant
increase<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.550> use<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.210> versafine<00:03:06.630> mode

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
increase if you use it in versafine mode

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.470 
increase if you use it in versafine mode
of<00:03:07.560> course<00:03:08.130> if<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.400> don't<00:03:08.430> get<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.000> with<00:03:09.210> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
of course if you don't get that with the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.720 
of course if you don't get that with the
g36c<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.880> AK<00:03:12.239> 5<00:03:12.510> see<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.410> has<00:03:13.680> better<00:03:14.190> rate<00:03:14.580> of

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
g36c the AK 5 see it has better rate of

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.390 
g36c the AK 5 see it has better rate of
fire<00:03:15.000> as<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.540> quick<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.200> reload<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:17.220> has

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
fire as a quick and reload it has

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.460 
fire as a quick and reload it has
exactly<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.970> same<00:03:18.060> damage<00:03:18.540> model<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.260> why

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
exactly the same damage model so why

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.410 
exactly the same damage model so why
would<00:03:19.770> you<00:03:19.890> use<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.790> AK<00:03:21.180> 5<00:03:21.450> see<00:03:21.720> over<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.200> g36c

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
would you use the AK 5 see over the g36c

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.960 
would you use the AK 5 see over the g36c
the<00:03:24.420> only<00:03:24.630> thing<00:03:24.870> in<00:03:24.989> my<00:03:25.020> minds<00:03:25.410> were<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:26.070> mean<00:03:26.520> I

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
the only thing in my minds were I mean I

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.390 
the only thing in my minds were I mean I
will<00:03:27.270> still<00:03:27.510> use<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.930> g36c<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.160> still

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
will still use the g36c and it's still

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.810 
will still use the g36c and it's still
fun<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.760> use<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:31.080> I<00:03:31.140> think<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:32.070> could<00:03:32.160> be<00:03:32.550> more

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
fun to use but I think it could be more

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.270 
fun to use but I think it could be more
of<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.060> choice<00:03:33.300> for<00:03:33.660> console<00:03:34.590> gamers<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.190> I

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
of a choice for console gamers and I

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.550 
of a choice for console gamers and I
think<00:03:35.459> that's<00:03:35.640> something<00:03:35.850> we<00:03:36.750> as<00:03:36.870> youtubers

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
think that's something we as youtubers

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.890 
think that's something we as youtubers
have<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:37.950> consider<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.670> can't<00:03:39.209> be<00:03:39.360> peace<00:03:39.630> here

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
have to consider I can't be peace here

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.650 
have to consider I can't be peace here
latest<00:03:40.170> about<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.130> think<00:03:41.550> recoil<00:03:42.510> is

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
latest about this I think recoil is

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.170 
latest about this I think recoil is
clearly<00:03:43.050> harder<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.739> control<00:03:43.920> on<00:03:44.250> consoles<00:03:44.880> so

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
clearly harder to control on consoles so

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.680 
clearly harder to control on consoles so
a<00:03:45.420> choice<00:03:45.900> like<00:03:46.260> for<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.530> g36c<00:03:47.400> where<00:03:48.360> it<00:03:48.480> is

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
a choice like for the g36c where it is

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.430 
a choice like for the g36c where it is
laser<00:03:49.230> accurate<00:03:50.190> might<00:03:50.580> be<00:03:51.030> might<00:03:51.930> be<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.140> nice

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
laser accurate might be might be a nice

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.280 
laser accurate might be might be a nice
choice<00:03:52.890> for<00:03:53.250> console<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.390> really<00:03:54.750> do<00:03:54.930> think

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
choice for console and I really do think

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.199 
choice for console and I really do think
with<00:03:55.620> this<00:03:55.830> patch<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.910> role<00:03:57.180> that

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
with this patch and the role that

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.470 
with this patch and the role that
they're<00:03:57.630> trying<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.050> give<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.160> g36c<00:04:00.090> and

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
they're trying to give the the g36c and

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.660 
they're trying to give the the g36c and
battlefield<00:04:01.020> I<00:04:01.080> feel<00:04:01.320> like<00:04:01.590> dice<00:04:02.190> are<00:04:02.430> saying

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
battlefield I feel like dice are saying

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.330 
battlefield I feel like dice are saying
we<00:04:03.120> are<00:04:03.150> trying<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.690> give<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.320> really<00:04:04.769> laser

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
we are trying to give you a really laser

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.759 
we are trying to give you a really laser
accurate<00:04:06.030> carbine<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.750> I've<00:04:07.140> got<00:04:07.290> no<00:04:07.470> doubt<00:04:07.500> I

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
accurate carbine and I've got no doubt I

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.250 
accurate carbine and I've got no doubt I
think<00:04:08.280> that's<00:04:08.489> what<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.820> g36c<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:10.019> now

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
think that's what the g36c is now

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.190 
think that's what the g36c is now
because<00:04:10.709> clearly<00:04:11.640> if<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.209> has<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.930> lowest

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
because clearly if it has the lowest

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.039 
because clearly if it has the lowest
side-to-side<00:04:13.950> recoil<00:04:14.490> of<00:04:14.910> any<00:04:15.180> carbine<00:04:15.810> it

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
side-to-side recoil of any carbine it

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.940 
side-to-side recoil of any carbine it
must<00:04:16.410> be<00:04:16.590> really<00:04:17.039> low

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
must be really low

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.150 
must be really low
because<00:04:18.130> if<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.370> look<00:04:18.610> at<00:04:18.730> say<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.780> ACE<00:04:19.990> 21<00:04:20.950> it

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
because if you look at say the ACE 21 it

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.790 
because if you look at say the ACE 21 it
has<00:04:21.340> naught<00:04:21.610> point<00:04:21.850> 15<00:04:22.540> to<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.870> left<00:04:23.110> nor

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
has naught point 15 to the left nor

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.980 
has naught point 15 to the left nor
point<00:04:24.190> 25<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.120> right<00:04:25.270> so<00:04:25.450> it's<00:04:25.540> got<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:25.810> be

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
point 25 to the right so it's got to be

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.230 
point 25 to the right so it's got to be
even<00:04:26.410> lower<00:04:26.620> than<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:27.130> so<00:04:27.790> they're<00:04:27.970> trying

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
even lower than that so they're trying

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.720 
even lower than that so they're trying
to<00:04:28.270> solve<00:04:28.540> carve<00:04:28.930> out<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.170> niche<00:04:29.500> for<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.950> g36c

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
to solve carve out a niche for the g36c

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.380 
to solve carve out a niche for the g36c
and<00:04:31.290> maybe<00:04:32.290> yeah<00:04:32.680> maybe<00:04:32.760> they're<00:04:33.760> taken<00:04:34.150> into

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
and maybe yeah maybe they're taken into

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.290 
and maybe yeah maybe they're taken into
account<00:04:34.420> the<00:04:34.930> fact<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.530> it's<00:04:36.370> not<00:04:36.610> just<00:04:36.670> pc

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
account the fact that it's not just pc

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.270 
account the fact that it's not just pc
gamers<00:04:37.840> you've<00:04:38.050> got<00:04:38.230> a<00:04:38.260> balance<00:04:38.650> weapons<00:04:39.070> for

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
gamers you've got a balance weapons for

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.300 
gamers you've got a balance weapons for
consoles<00:04:39.880> so<00:04:40.600> therefore<00:04:41.200> maybe<00:04:41.680> this<00:04:42.100> would

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
consoles so therefore maybe this would

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.490 
consoles so therefore maybe this would
be<00:04:42.340> an<00:04:42.550> excellent<00:04:42.730> choice<00:04:43.360> for<00:04:43.750> consoles

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
be an excellent choice for consoles

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.460 
be an excellent choice for consoles
