momentum carrying the upper body form so

momentum carrying the upper body form so
what<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.850> mean<00:00:47.969> by<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.930> when<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.230> run<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
what I mean by that is when you run a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680 
what I mean by that is when you run a
football<00:00:50.160> land<00:00:50.520> without<00:00:51.120> glutes<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
football land without glutes and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.869 
football land without glutes and
hamstrings<00:00:52.199> didn't<00:00:52.530> work<00:00:52.680> upper<00:00:53.460> body<00:00:53.670> will

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
hamstrings didn't work upper body will

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.610 
hamstrings didn't work upper body will
just<00:00:53.910> fall<00:00:54.329> forward<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> glutes

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
just fall forward so the glutes

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.549 
just fall forward so the glutes
controlled<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.460> movement<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:58.170> second

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
controlled that movement the second

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.200 
controlled that movement the second
movement<00:00:58.829> occurs<00:00:59.219> when<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.670> land

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
movement occurs when we land

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.750 
movement occurs when we land
there's<00:01:00.809> sideways<00:01:01.320> fashion<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.520> land

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
there's sideways fashion so as we land

left<00:01:45.780> hand<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.259> reach<00:01:46.770> down<00:01:47.329> across<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.780> around

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
left hand I reach down across and around

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.750 
left hand I reach down across and around
so<00:01:49.670> looks<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.909> that

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
so looks like that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.820 
so looks like that
now<00:01:53.760> we<00:01:53.820> want<00:01:54.120> to<00:01:54.210> emphasize<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:55.050> rotational

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
now we want to emphasize the rotational

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.920 
now we want to emphasize the rotational
aspect<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.580> take<00:01:56.730> our<00:01:56.850> front<00:01:57.090> foot<00:01:57.270> turn

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
aspect we can take our front foot turn

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.100 
aspect we can take our front foot turn
it<00:01:58.050> in<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.650> do<00:01:58.770> exactly<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.280> same<00:01:59.340> thing<00:02:00.110> do

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
it in and do exactly the same thing do

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.750 
it in and do exactly the same thing do
all<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.380> emphasize<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.070> sideways<00:02:02.550> with

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
all that emphasize the sideways with

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.970 
all that emphasize the sideways with
take<00:02:03.450> your<00:02:03.480> front<00:02:03.810> foot<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.590> move<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.890> across

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
take your front foot and move it across

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
take your front foot and move it across
to<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.460> side<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.660> do<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.870> same<00:02:07.050> thing<00:02:08.000> so

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to the side and do the same thing so

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.660 
to the side and do the same thing so
we'll<00:02:09.180> emphasize<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.960> forward<00:02:10.950> component<00:02:11.460> of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
we'll emphasize the forward component of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.670 
we'll emphasize the forward component of
the<00:02:11.820> stretch<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.870> put<00:02:13.110> our<00:02:13.200> foot<00:02:13.380> up<00:02:13.410> with<00:02:13.650> a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the stretch we put our foot up with a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.090 
the stretch we put our foot up with a
block<00:02:14.120> like<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.600> once<00:02:16.170> again<00:02:16.290> do<00:02:16.740> exactly

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
block like so and once again do exactly

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.230 
block like so and once again do exactly
the<00:02:17.220> same<00:02:17.250> thing<00:02:19.670> now<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.820> can<00:02:20.940> make<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.210> a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
the same thing now it can make that a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.940 
the same thing now it can make that a
lot<00:02:21.420> more<00:02:21.570> dynamic<00:02:21.750> by<00:02:22.260> adding<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> step<00:02:22.770> into

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
lot more dynamic by adding a step into

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.150 
lot more dynamic by adding a step into
it<00:02:23.220> sit<00:02:23.820> event<00:02:24.090> legs<00:02:24.330> think<00:02:24.660> fixed<00:02:25.160> step

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
it sit event legs think fixed step

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.980 
it sit event legs think fixed step
forward<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.090> would<00:02:27.180> look<00:02:27.270> like<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:29.990> once

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
forward so it would look like that once

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.290 
forward so it would look like that once
again<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.710> foot<00:02:31.980> turned<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:33.150> can

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
again we can go a foot turned in you can

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.750 
again we can go a foot turned in you can
go<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.480> put<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.720> cross<00:02:33.950> we<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:35.100> step<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.430> onto<00:02:35.700> a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
go to put a cross we can step up onto a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.060 
go to put a cross we can step up onto a
block<00:02:35.970> we'll<00:02:36.930> make<00:02:37.080> an<00:02:37.200> even<00:02:37.350> more<00:02:37.560> than<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.860> mix

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
block we'll make an even more than a mix

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.620 
block we'll make an even more than a mix
then<00:02:38.250> they<00:02:38.340> can<00:02:38.460> add<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.580> stride<00:02:38.940> into<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.390> so

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
then they can add a stride into it so

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.510 
then they can add a stride into it so
it'll<00:02:39.780> look<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:43.340> jumping<00:02:44.340> forward

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
it'll look like that jumping forward

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.290 
it'll look like that jumping forward
from<00:02:45.000> one<00:02:45.900> leg<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.320> other<00:02:46.350> leg<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.940> reaching

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
from one leg the other leg and reaching

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.580 
from one leg the other leg and reaching
across<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.690> around<00:02:48.870> because<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.290> let<00:02:49.440> those

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
across it around because to let those

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.260 
across it around because to let those
tweaks<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:50.310> they<00:02:50.400> can<00:02:50.520> still<00:02:50.670> jump<00:02:50.880> forward

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
tweaks in so they can still jump forward

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.720 
tweaks in so they can still jump forward
and<00:02:51.810> then<00:02:51.990> we<00:02:52.110> put<00:02:52.320> turned<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.800> or<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.520> jump

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
and then we put turned in or we can jump

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.660 
and then we put turned in or we can jump
forward<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.480> across<00:02:55.140> what<00:02:55.950> can<00:02:56.100> jump<00:02:56.310> forward

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
forward and across what can jump forward

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.210 
forward and across what can jump forward
up<00:02:56.760> until<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.060> step<00:02:57.330> their<00:02:58.260> progression<00:02:58.680> what

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
up until a step their progression what

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.800 
up until a step their progression what
you<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.700> start<00:02:59.940> off<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.209> your<00:03:00.330> feet<00:03:00.510> fix

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
you do is start off with your feet fix

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.229 
you do is start off with your feet fix
and<00:03:01.320> just<00:03:01.530> ease<00:03:01.800> into<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.250> stretch<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.820> a

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
and just ease into the stretch and a

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.199 
and just ease into the stretch and a
slow<00:03:03.660> tempo<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.070> as<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.520> start<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.880> warm-up

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
slow tempo and as you start to warm-up

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.150 
slow tempo and as you start to warm-up
into<00:03:06.420> what<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.989> can<00:03:07.140> start<00:03:07.380> speeding<00:03:07.739> up<00:03:07.890> that

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
into what you can start speeding up that

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.420 
into what you can start speeding up that
movement<00:03:09.000> then<00:03:09.570> you<00:03:09.750> can<00:03:09.900> step<00:03:10.170> into<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.709> and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
movement then you can step into it and

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.270 
movement then you can step into it and
then<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.580> can<00:03:11.820> jump<00:03:12.000> into<00:03:12.209> work<00:03:13.100> now<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.130> the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
then you can jump into work now that the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.800 
then you can jump into work now that the
roots<00:03:14.550> thing<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.910> not<00:03:15.120> only<00:03:15.360> going<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.570> stretch

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
roots thing is not only going to stretch

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.350 
roots thing is not only going to stretch
the<00:03:15.959> glute<00:03:16.170> muscles<00:03:16.700> improve<00:03:17.700> performance<00:03:18.239> of

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
the glute muscles improve performance of

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.580 
the glute muscles improve performance of
them<00:03:18.540> it's<00:03:18.690> going<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.870> fire<00:03:19.080> them<00:03:19.290> up<00:03:19.380> more

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
them it's going to fire them up more

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.160 
them it's going to fire them up more

generally make you a better run so

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.590 
generally make you a better run so
something<00:03:26.550> I'd<00:03:26.670> advise<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.269> before

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
is all it takes just going through that

little<00:03:31.320> routine<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:32.880> should<00:03:33.060> notice<00:03:33.360> a

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
little routine you should notice a

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.960 
little routine you should notice a
significant<00:03:33.989> difference

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
significant difference

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.930
