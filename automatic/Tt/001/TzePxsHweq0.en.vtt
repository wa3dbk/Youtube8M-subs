00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.889
 but everyone in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.830
 teach how to update your iPad ipod or 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.540
 ipod touch to version 8.3 which is the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.960
 more growing right now let's go 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.000
 first adjustments or settings within 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.170
 hence I want to make a backup us 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.720
 they're going to go to this option down here 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.529
 where iCloud says and in there I want 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.849
 that they make their support of in any 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.679
 update that they do for smaller 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.660
 that they always do a backup in 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.760
 its icloud and if it is a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.800
 update a little bit bigger as 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.050
 this one that is a bit big is a 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.510
 intermediate then I recommend you do 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.340
 an endorsement also in itunes in his 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.800
 computer 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.050
 but at least do it even in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.719
 icloud 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.540
 after they do that we're going to go to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.610
 general within general have to do 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.530
 this option is the second option that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.270
 says software update and install the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.030
 upgrade 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.339
 have an ipod touch or an iphone with 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.170
 jailbreak or an ipad even if you have 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.030
 about what I do not recommend to update 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.220
 the ones in this way because they just do not 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.840
 it will be fine then in this case 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 If they want to update, they're going to have to 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.820
 connect itunes if they are not 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.680
 well and you can go here where it says 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.010
 update and just squeezing 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.240
 where it says installed or installed right now 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.080
 then they have to obviously put the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.670
 green 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.670
 all this put a green 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.210
 then first it's going to go down all 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.280
 download the entire application and then 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.140
 is going to be installed for this they need 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.270
 even have 50% battery in their 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.310
 devices if they do not have 50% 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.060
 battery I do not recommend doing it the same 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.590
 They will not let you do it if they have 49 % 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.240
 then for this mouse that is that 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.360
 they have 100 percent battery 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.980
 I recommend connecting it before pressing 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.770
 install 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.710
 to electricity because if they are 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.980
 goes the battery is turned off by any 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.260
 reason during x is given of the installation 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.680
 is going to create an error in the system and 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.180
 will touch restore and download your 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.130
 backing and that's what I told you 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.010
 make your backup first because 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.110
 can happen any of those things in 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.450
 any update something can go 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.280
 wrong also when they update their 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.220
 mark if they want more they will see a new 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.290
 update make a backup with time 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.330
 machine I recommend time machine and 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.190
 which is very good at keeping all your 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.750
 things automatically 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.370
 equally manually you can 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.770
 enter the subject without getting things 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.800
 then before updating your mac 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.040
 they also want to do that what they are going 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.460
 to see on mac that is a change they will see 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.980
 photos photos replaces there forum that is 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.390
 an application and here inside the aeb 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:00.790
 is 8.3 they will see small changes 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.379
 there is also this from photos 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.840
 photos simply want like icloud 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:11.950
 make them support you 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.930
 indeed within icloud then in 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.370
 I do not recommend this case to all of you 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.590
 the backups just always 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.019
 use print forums and other things that 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.209
 it does not take up so much space since videos 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.799
 and all those things take up a lot 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.470
 space and the 5 gigas that gives them support 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.480
 is going to fill up very quickly because it's not 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.400
 I recommend activating that part of icloud 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.720
 but do the update if you 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.659
 18.3 also fix other problems 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.849
 then it is not just this from the photos 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.829
 but it 's with bigger than that support 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.120
 within this update well this 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.450
 it's all for this video if they have 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.769
 any problems with anything me 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.959
 can you write down my channel 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.230
 simply the following screens that 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.389
 they are going to see they are going to be the logo of support with 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.970
 a little bar carrying this is going to 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.220
 take or if they have an average internet 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.569
 slow 30 minutes and have the average 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.730
 about 10 minutes 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.069
 is the provencio of 10 minutes then 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.060
 do not do this if you have to 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.620
 use any of your things 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.950
 just leave it there stop doing 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.320
 your thing and already the maximum should be taken 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.910
 one hour if you spend one hour have 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.780
 some problem is going to touch them to restore 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.180
 and put upload their support they did 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.310
 in icloud or in itunes and that's what they did 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.570
 the data that I recommend them well that 's 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.550
 everything for this video if you have any 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.900
 question or comment can you write me 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.729
