00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.810
 two 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.740
 well, youtube squirrels like 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.540
 They walk I hope they walk very well once 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.120
 more are given no to whom he returned 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.489
 with a commented play wii and the gameplay 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.200
 who will be watching casting kinder 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:51.140
 machine gamer playing with the pw a 47 a 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.840
 3 If I'm not mistaken, it seems I think 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.199
 it's a good day in play to play dyes 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.120
 more good grip 47 lows because it was in 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.070
 terrestrial war but I still think that 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.570
 it's very good so that's why I decided 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.400
 bring it is a gameplay that I already had 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.670
 saved for a long time I think it was 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.960
 when it was prestige 9 if I'm not wrong 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.450
 the truth I do not remember very well there what 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.100
 will see when they go rather they saw it at 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.080
 beginning of the video and if they did not see it 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.670
 will see at the end and what happens is that 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.650
 these last days I've been when 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.409
 many times to the target of the reasons 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.630
 they are many but we will summarize in what 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.880
 it's a bit boring and that's why I 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.040
 I have put registered guards is a game 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.380
 that had always caught my attention 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.140
 but I had never played it until penalties 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.650
 that a compass or the inscribers 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.010
 I do not know if it's a continuation of those of 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.010
 part 1 and part 2 but the part 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.630
 3 has been made very good has good 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.460
 it's the kind of light game that pleases me 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.409
 not that apart from finishing the mission 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.259
 you can come play it by doing 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.020
 transmissions and it's a very long game already 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.170
 it took like two logical days not two days 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.229
 there are 24 hours stuck 48 hours there goes no 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.900
 let's say about 8 hours 9 hours in 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.850
 has between 10 hours let's put it between 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.500
 the two days playing what also not 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.360
 I finish it then it becomes very small 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.489
 of the game for that reason the game either 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.040
 many black ops but I will continue 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.560
 bringing whites I have a good 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.300
 jobs saved here I have modern 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.060
 warfare 3 I will also try to 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.950
 take us maps with the weapons that I 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.200
 they missed because they will remember that 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.290
 many weapons were missing to take as a 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.780
 skin of what I love most on the street I know 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.340
 that I do not remember others and in the morbid 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.830
 for two, I've also seen that 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.180
 have liked the nuclear ones well 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.220
 that I will continue to bring nuclear 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.440
 I have another saved there 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.000
 afterwards and I also wanted to thank you 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.070
 for the support they gave to the video of 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.070
 find the truth I did not think I received 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.190
 so many likes have like 210 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.890
 likes and then what good is a video that is 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.680
 it occurred to me to do so for doing it is not 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.780
 a series but I will try to bring 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.630
 videos like this when you walk around places 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.220
 so I do not seem flashy or 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.930
 more or less guys like to record a 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.720
 video out there I have another second part 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.300
 like the video that went up yesterday but I know 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.520
 I will upload later and I also wanted 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.950
 thank you for the 9,000 subs already 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.660
 we are 9 thousand 22 if I'm never wrong 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.120
 I made a special that I remember 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.090
 but I'm going to do a special for the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.070
 10,000 believe me nothing good rather to see 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.020
 what happened to me to see what comes out in the 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.350
 but you know that always 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.660
 I thank you one of one or another way 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.300
 and also clarifies some doubts about the 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.400
 streams that I did was my first boss was 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.190
 my first stream and the truth the quality 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.470
 Well, it was not so good. 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.910
 quality preserve because now I first is 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.250
 they have the truth I do not have 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.370
 knowledge about how to do anything 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.230
 there are some tips later he was out there 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.780
 he closed it helping me there in a private 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.490
 when the first end is finished in 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.530
 second and she help me neither with men 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.180
 to those who follow that by the way 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.740
 I'm not in play state when I start 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.170
 a greeting for her 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.050
 I'll be bringing streams I do not know yo 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.940
 I think / not weekend because between 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.650
 week for most of you are going to 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.120
 the school I imagine then then 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.520
 the action comes in the task and you say 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.760
 but then to do a little more 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.010
 let's say more accessible and more visible by 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.959
 which wants such a weekend 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.120
 once a Friday a Saturday a Sunday no 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.610
 I know maybe you should report here to the best 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.290
 can with tops maybe not but I 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.390
 I think if I'm going to walk when with his because 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.419
 in joke of the strings I believe is 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.669
 have fun so they were nothing else 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.020
 a few seeds that I had to 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.530
 talk about Spain and how they see the gameplay 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.150
 it's a little bit short a team 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.090
 to have quick I thought it was good 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.190
 I bring them 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.110
 I think that nothing good from now on 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.370
 songs that put the videos on them 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.050
 I'm going to leave my description because 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.220
 always in comments on the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.370
 songs 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.570
 the songs of the last video I do not know by 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.580
 there I also saw comments that I 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.840
 they said they did not find them that way 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.060
 they call but the truth is that I do not remember 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.370
 where I downloaded it but how do I know 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.680
 gang someone hurry out I hope that 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.930
 they liked it says yes it was then what 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.210
 well, I say goodbye, have a good time and we 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.210
