00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.450
 as we saw the fractions express a part of a whole 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.980
 but we have to keep in mind that if everything 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.860
 it can be continuous 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 one meter of fabric for example 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.280
 We could believe it as the last point of pencils can balls 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.280
 has been the so-called unit 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
 For example, a piece of cheese is a unit 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.910
 if we take a part of that part jesus lastra pointed 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.720
 depends on the parties have obtained income 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.740
 to know situations 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.889
 if we divide the cheese into four parts and take only 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.970
 we are taking 4 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.430
 -28 cents 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.720
 one part we are taking 1 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.100
 j 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.830
 but if we take the parts 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.870
 we are taking other states 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.420
 nor processed it turns out that a quarter of the eighths are equivalent 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.530
 your particular case is presented 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.530
 when the unit is divided into three parts 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.370
 each of its parties and its tournament neighbors 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.920
 if each part can be given to indi indi is one hundredth of the unit is obtained 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.630
 that was a wish 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.560
 so you can continue the division by ten of each of those that the parties 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.410
 we do not say 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.710
 you measure it in two 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.710
 and much more 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.490
 it is amazing how the regions are represented 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.000
 that allows greater 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.499
 generality 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:09.360
 the model of 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.360
 reactions on the number line 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.459
 let's see how 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.649
 we take a strip of paper 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:23.689
 and we mark in the first line of a work that valued from the margin 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.299
 drying fountains 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.299
 the numbered 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.249
 it has been a long polemic actress repeats the procedure on costa rica 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.280
 marking in the successive agreements 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.929
 the anonymity to be desired 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.929
 but respecting the order 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.699
 Sunday is done with the profile 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:48.679
 fifth 6 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:49.490
 eighth 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.569
 Perez 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.359
 two 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.080
 your message of this model 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.920
 the one they are having possible 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.699
 the representation of pensions 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.229
 He mentioned that the unit 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.229
 and of those that are equivalent to 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.799
 and any other whole number signals 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.799
 considered that for example 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.069
 quarter past eleven 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.129
 nine of these 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.949
 photo j 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:22.809
 Fifteen neighbors have been silent for the same amount 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.549
 it is a family of equivalent prices and all those of 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.549
 Match 1 points on the goal line 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:33.929
 as you can see 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:36.820
 some actions like a quarter 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.909
 two basements 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:40.599
 for years 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.329
 were left is also the same lie companies fail to comply 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.589
 they say that revenge 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:52.900
 if we divide the viewpoints of each one with their respective denominators 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.889
 let's discover 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.170
 that everything is 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.159
 the same result 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.180
 4 of vido 1 is equality 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.180
 6 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.220
 divided 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.220
 it's equality 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.079
 12 min 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:12.950
 dont wait 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.509
 is equal 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.509
 end yes adriÃ¡ 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.680
 echo in the rest 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.310
 and of the conaculta
