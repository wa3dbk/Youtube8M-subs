00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.090
 hi today i want you to see how 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.500
 finish our placemat from 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.690
 use with our cups 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.529
 prefer coffee when we have 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.170
 started 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.790
 we started May 30th and implemented 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.430
 our first edge in garter st 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.590
 working 9 iron straight and then we have 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.600
 continued with the perforated part 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.190
 combining 2 meshes together with straight and 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.090
 threw the pass passes the crime 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.120
 thrown for nine irons with iron of 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.430
 return worked with 5 straight stitch and 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.070
 the central meshes reversed up to 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.930
 last five jerseys straight when 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.820
 we realized this by repeating 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.460
 these two irons nine times there 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.070
 we find at this point where we repeat 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.610
 once again the round the iron of 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.489
 our pierced so we start and 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:03.110
 we work and five the first five 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.390
 knit a straight 45 so we make a 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.600
 thrown in we work two together with 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.430
 straight another threw the two meshes 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.070
 together with straight 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.640
 continuing up to the last nine shirts 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.229
 always working straight and here i think of 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.450
 my grandmother's sweater arrived 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:27.740
 check 2 4 6 8 9 perfect then 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.390
 I make the pass pass straight combined 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.849
 threw him another pass goes straight 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.240
 always thrown when I'm done 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:39.410
 worked the last five stitches straight 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.110
 I'm on what my iron is 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.060
 return work all the stitches straight 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.099
 to create what is our edge 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.149
 final then the beginning 23 45 which are 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.979
 always the ones I've always worked 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.679
 straight but here instead of backhand 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:00.009
 so I remember and work straight too 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:03.200
 those who are thrown so he arrived 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.080
 eventually working for nine servants 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.170
 these nine irons and straight comes that one 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.009
 that my final design with the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.480
 bordeaux 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.489
 here he is in garter when I'm here 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.349
 I want to close harmoniously in 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.390
 such that the initial part with the 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.640
 humps also corresponds to the final one 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.710
 so what did my shirts do? 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.440
 I will close them on what the reverse 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.959
 of work and how I do it 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.720
 I have to be careful and check that 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.600
 the stockinette stitch back this side 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.450
 here it is towards me 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:42.020
 in this way I work two shirts and 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.000
 to then close the horses by doing 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.030
 be careful of maintaining a tension 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.500
 constant because if I pull too much thing 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.350
 happens my job will tend to 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.440
 squeeze while mine is too soft 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.690
 placemat will remain undulating on the edge 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.489
 so it's not pretty so i do 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.700
 attention and work the shirts 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.920
 exactly as I was working on them 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.590
 while I worked the whole body 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.769
 arrived at the end I take mine 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:18.500
 scissors and cut the thread and what I do 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:20.830
 I pull the big one out and now I am 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.090
 ready to hide my tails 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:28.430
 I take lake and went through those 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.560
 that mine are on the flip side of work 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.220
 small hunchbacks to hide it so 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.700
 homogeneous 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:42.709
 when finished cut all the tails and 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.570
 my placemat is over and so is there 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.910
 we give an appointment to many others 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.010
 projects to be carried out together 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.360
 now we continue to close together 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.360
 good job
