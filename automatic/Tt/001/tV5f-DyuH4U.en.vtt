we're<00:00:36.640> dealing<00:00:37.059> with<00:00:37.270> exponents<00:00:38.079> and<00:00:38.559> not

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
we're dealing with exponents and not

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.880 
we're dealing with exponents and not
just<00:00:39.370> any<00:00:39.610> old<00:00:39.760> exponents<00:00:40.600> guess<00:00:41.440> what<00:00:41.650> we're

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
just any old exponents guess what we're

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.460 
just any old exponents guess what we're
dealing<00:00:42.309> with<00:00:42.339> the<00:00:42.730> funky<00:00:43.120> exponents<00:00:43.870> we<00:00:44.290> got

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
dealing with the funky exponents we got

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.649 
dealing with the funky exponents we got
a<00:00:44.500> negative<00:00:44.739> five<00:00:45.250> here<00:00:45.940> we<00:00:46.180> got<00:00:46.360> a<00:00:46.390> negative

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
a negative five here we got a negative

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.590 
a negative five here we got a negative
we<00:00:47.110> have<00:00:47.140> a<00:00:47.409> positive<00:00:47.680> 2/3<00:00:48.460> here<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.420> then

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
we have a positive 2/3 here and then

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.819 
we have a positive 2/3 here and then
we've<00:00:49.720> got<00:00:49.809> all<00:00:49.960> these<00:00:50.170> crazy<00:00:50.470> answers<00:00:51.040> here

you<00:00:53.829> know<00:00:53.949> I<00:00:53.980> don't<00:00:54.250> want<00:00:54.370> you<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:54.550> like<00:00:54.670> get

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
you know I don't want you to like get

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.229 
you know I don't want you to like get
caught<00:00:55.150> up<00:00:55.329> in<00:00:55.480> that<00:00:55.629> I<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:56.920> what<00:00:57.309> it<00:00:57.430> all<00:00:57.640> we

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
caught up in that I think what it all we

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.790 
caught up in that I think what it all we
need<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.420> do<00:00:58.719> with<00:00:58.899> this<00:00:59.020> video<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.410> make<00:00:59.620> it<00:00:59.680> a

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
need to do with this video to make it a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.590 
need to do with this video to make it a
little<00:00:59.920> clearer<00:01:00.250> is<00:01:00.879> we<00:01:01.090> need<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.359> just

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
little clearer is we need to just

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.959 
little clearer is we need to just
address<00:01:02.039> how<00:01:03.039> to<00:01:03.070> deal<00:01:03.370> with<00:01:03.430> negative

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
address how to deal with negative

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.290 
address how to deal with negative
exponents<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.899> how<00:01:05.500> to<00:01:05.560> deal<00:01:05.830> with<00:01:06.300> exponents

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
exponents and how to deal with exponents

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.020 
exponents and how to deal with exponents
in<00:01:07.420> fractional<00:01:07.960> form<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:09.250> we<00:01:09.369> can<00:01:09.580> solve<00:01:09.789> it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
in fractional form and we can solve it

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.510 
in fractional form and we can solve it
because<00:01:10.899> really<00:01:11.170> what<00:01:11.440> it's<00:01:11.590> asking<00:01:11.800> it's<00:01:12.369> not

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
because really what it's asking it's not

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.669 
because really what it's asking it's not
asking<00:01:12.880> me<00:01:12.970> even<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.479> answer<00:01:13.990> that<00:01:14.140> solve<00:01:14.530> a

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
asking me even to answer that solve a

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.370 
asking me even to answer that solve a
question<00:01:14.920> it's<00:01:15.910> saying<00:01:16.210> which<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.050> following

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
question it's saying which the following

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.790 
question it's saying which the following
expressions<00:01:18.160> is<00:01:18.399> equivalent<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.479> this<00:01:20.140> so

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
expressions is equivalent to this so

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.440 
expressions is equivalent to this so
it's<00:01:20.950> just<00:01:21.070> asking<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.789> look<00:01:22.030> at<00:01:22.240> these

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
it's just asking you to look at these

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.620 
it's just asking you to look at these
terms<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.910> identify<00:01:24.910> which<00:01:25.179> one<00:01:25.420> of<00:01:25.450> them

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
terms and identify which one of them

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.020 
terms and identify which one of them
says<00:01:25.929> the<00:01:26.170> same<00:01:26.350> thing<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:27.369> just<00:01:27.610> want<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.880> be

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
says the same thing you just want to be

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.380 
says the same thing you just want to be
able<00:01:28.119> to<00:01:28.270> interpret<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.020> read<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:30.240> first<00:01:31.240> let's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
able to interpret it read it first let's

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.350 
able to interpret it read it first let's
start<00:01:31.540> with<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.869> negative<00:01:32.049> exponents<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:34.180> I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
start with the negative exponents if I

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.980 
start with the negative exponents if I
had<00:01:34.600> two<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.070> negative<00:01:36.579> let's<00:01:37.030> say<00:01:37.270> second

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
had two to the negative let's say second

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.630 
had two to the negative let's say second
power<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:41.740> be<00:01:41.829> expressed<00:01:42.250> as<00:01:42.369> just

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
power is really can be expressed as just

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.830 
power is really can be expressed as just
one<00:01:42.970> over<00:01:43.750> two<00:01:44.649> squared<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:45.369> if<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.210> was<00:01:46.299> two

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
one over two squared and if it was two

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.920 
one over two squared and if it was two
to<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.259> negative<00:01:47.590> third<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.220> I<00:01:49.210> put<00:01:49.600> everything

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
to the negative third I I put everything

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.459 
to the negative third I I put everything
under<00:01:50.829> one<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.820> get<00:01:52.780> rid<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.110> negative

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
under one and get rid of the negative

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.510 
under one and get rid of the negative
exponent<00:01:54.009> two<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.969> third<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.920> how<00:01:57.310> would<00:01:57.369> I

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
exponent two to the third so how would I

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.149 
exponent two to the third so how would I
do<00:01:57.640> this<00:01:57.820> one<00:01:58.439> well<00:01:59.439> if<00:01:59.560> I'm<00:01:59.710> following<00:02:00.040> the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
do this one well if I'm following the

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.490 
do this one well if I'm following the
same<00:02:00.369> idea<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.899> negative<00:02:02.049> fifth

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
same idea this a to the negative fifth

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.109 
same idea this a to the negative fifth
could<00:02:03.130> be<00:02:03.250> re-written<00:02:03.520> as<00:02:03.969> 1<00:02:05.040> divided<00:02:06.040> by<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.490> to

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
could be re-written as 1 divided by a to

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.090 
could be re-written as 1 divided by a to
the<00:02:07.600> fifth<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.289> get<00:02:08.470> rid<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.769> negative

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
the fifth and I get rid of the negative

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.610 
the fifth and I get rid of the negative
exponent<00:02:09.690> now<00:02:10.690> let's<00:02:10.869> just<00:02:10.989> see<00:02:11.140> if<00:02:11.170> we<00:02:11.260> can<00:02:11.470> do

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
exponent now let's just see if we can do

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.490 
exponent now let's just see if we can do
that<00:02:11.769> just<00:02:12.250> just<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.820> one<00:02:13.120> change<00:02:14.110> on<00:02:14.350> this

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
that just just that one change on this

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.360 
that just just that one change on this
problem<00:02:15.030> what<00:02:16.030> would<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.180> do<00:02:17.190> well<00:02:18.190> if<00:02:18.280> I

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
problem what would that do well if I

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.500 
problem what would that do well if I
know<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.790> how<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.060> deal<00:02:19.299> with<00:02:19.360> these

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
know that how to deal with these

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.660 
know that how to deal with these
negative<00:02:19.780> exponents<00:02:20.130> by<00:02:21.130> taking<00:02:21.519> everything

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
negative exponents by taking everything

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.630 
negative exponents by taking everything
and<00:02:22.299> putting<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.840> under<00:02:23.019> one<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.859> changing

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
and putting it under one and changing

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.910 
and putting it under one and changing
the<00:02:24.730> value<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.299> exponent<00:02:25.570> this<00:02:26.440> this

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
the value of the exponent this this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.099 
the value of the exponent this this
first<00:02:27.220> term<00:02:27.519> here<00:02:28.000> could<00:02:28.390> really<00:02:28.600> be<00:02:28.870> thought

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
first term here could really be thought

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:37.200 
first term here could really be thought
of<00:02:29.140> as<00:02:29.380> 1<00:02:29.820> over<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.959> fifth<00:02:32.260> times

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.820 

some<00:02:37.360> value<00:02:37.810> B<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.210> 2/3<00:02:40.210> and<00:02:40.680> since<00:02:41.680> this

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
some value B to the 2/3 and since this

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.100 
some value B to the 2/3 and since this
is<00:02:42.070> this<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.520> fraction<00:02:43.060> here<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.420> could<00:02:43.750> make

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
is this is a fraction here I could make

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.170 
is this is a fraction here I could make
this<00:02:44.260> another<00:02:44.680> fraction<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.490> if<00:02:45.940> we<00:02:46.030> were<00:02:46.120> to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
this another fraction and if we were to

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.970 
this another fraction and if we were to
multiply<00:02:46.330> these<00:02:46.660> two<00:02:46.990> fractions<00:02:47.200> out<00:02:47.530> doing

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
multiply these two fractions out doing

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.770 
multiply these two fractions out doing
the<00:02:48.550> tops<00:02:48.820> times<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.270> tops<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.750> bottoms

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the tops times the tops and the bottoms

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.960 
the tops times the tops and the bottoms
times<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.440> bottoms<00:02:50.800> we<00:02:51.430> would<00:02:51.550> get<00:02:51.670> some

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
times the bottoms we would get some

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.590 
times the bottoms we would get some
value<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.860> right<00:02:54.000> times<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.240> bottoms

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
value this right times the bottoms

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.060 
value this right times the bottoms
because<00:02:55.810> when<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.080> multiply<00:02:56.290> fractions<00:02:56.560> you

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
because when you multiply fractions you

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.310 
because when you multiply fractions you
just<00:02:57.370> multiply<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.850> tops<00:02:58.180> out<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:59.230> the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
just multiply the tops out and the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.460 
just multiply the tops out and the
bottoms<00:02:59.620> out<00:02:59.770> I'm<00:03:00.670> gonna<00:03:00.790> get<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.290> now<00:03:02.290> let

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
bottoms out I'm gonna get that now let

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.350 
bottoms out I'm gonna get that now let
me<00:03:02.560> just<00:03:02.710> put<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.160> this<00:03:03.370> what's<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.150> box

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
me just put in this what's in the box

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.860 
me just put in this what's in the box
that<00:03:04.660> should<00:03:04.870> be<00:03:05.050> B<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.750> 2/3<00:03:07.750> power<00:03:09.840> well<00:03:10.840> I

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
that should be B to the 2/3 power well I

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.380 
that should be B to the 2/3 power well I
look<00:03:11.140> at<00:03:11.230> my<00:03:11.320> answer<00:03:11.680> choices<00:03:12.240> there's<00:03:13.240> only

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
look at my answer choices there's only

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.440 
look at my answer choices there's only
one<00:03:13.660> answer<00:03:13.900> choice<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:15.370> has<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.880> to<00:03:16.120> the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
one answer choice that has a to the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.800 
one answer choice that has a to the
fifth<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:16.960> in<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.350> denominator<00:03:18.220> right

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
fifth and that in the denominator right

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.380 
fifth and that in the denominator right
and<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:20.290> that's<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.770> answer

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
and so that's the answer

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.330 
and so that's the answer
but<00:03:22.390> how<00:03:22.570> could<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.900> how<00:03:23.170> could<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.440> be<00:03:23.680> how<00:03:24.190> could

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
but how could I how could I be how could

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.410 
but how could I how could I be how could
I<00:03:24.430> work<00:03:24.610> this<00:03:24.850> out<00:03:25.030> online<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:27.150> if<00:03:28.150> I'm

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
I work this out online this if I'm

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.810 
I work this out online this if I'm
dealing<00:03:28.570> with<00:03:28.810> two<00:03:29.380> squared<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:30.190> know<00:03:30.550> how<00:03:30.760> to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
dealing with two squared I know how to

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.150 
dealing with two squared I know how to
work<00:03:31.090> with<00:03:31.270> that<00:03:31.480> but<00:03:32.380> if<00:03:32.470> I'm<00:03:32.620> dealing<00:03:32.800> with

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
work with that but if I'm dealing with

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.750 
work with that but if I'm dealing with
two<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.120> one-third<00:03:34.710> well<00:03:35.710> this<00:03:35.980> 1/3<00:03:36.520> is

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
two to the one-third well this 1/3 is

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.760 
two to the one-third well this 1/3 is
another<00:03:37.060> way<00:03:37.210> of<00:03:37.330> saying<00:03:37.830> cube<00:03:38.830> root<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:39.160> up<00:03:39.460> -

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
another way of saying cube root of up -

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.570 
another way of saying cube root of up -
well<00:03:41.770> if<00:03:41.890> I'm<00:03:42.010> combining<00:03:42.250> them<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:45.280> know<00:03:45.400> and

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
well if I'm combining them you know and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.260 
well if I'm combining them you know and
I<00:03:45.670> have<00:03:45.910> 2<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.900> 2/3<00:03:47.530> power

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
I have 2 to the 2/3 power

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.690 
I have 2 to the 2/3 power
that<00:03:49.270> means<00:03:49.600> I'm<00:03:50.040> finding<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.220> one<00:03:51.490> way<00:03:51.640> to

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
that means I'm finding I one way to

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.240 
that means I'm finding I one way to
think<00:03:51.790> about<00:03:51.970> it<00:03:52.270> is<00:03:52.420> I'm<00:03:52.600> finding<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:53.250> cube

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
think about it is I'm finding the cube

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.750 
think about it is I'm finding the cube
root<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:55.570> 2<00:03:55.840> squared<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:57.280> that's<00:03:57.370> going<00:03:57.550> to<00:03:57.700> be

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
root of 2 squared and that's going to be

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:06.360 
root of 2 squared and that's going to be
also<00:03:57.940> equal<00:03:58.300> to<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:01.690> cube<00:04:02.110> D<00:04:02.530> loops<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:05.830> cube

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
also equal to the cube D loops the cube

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.440 
also equal to the cube D loops the cube
root<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:07.050> 2<00:04:08.050> squared<00:04:11.910> what<00:04:12.910> does<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.210> mean

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
root of 2 squared what does this mean

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.780 
root of 2 squared what does this mean
well<00:04:14.110> let's<00:04:14.260> go<00:04:14.380> back<00:04:14.410> to<00:04:14.710> our<00:04:14.800> base<00:04:14.950> what<00:04:15.760> I

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
well let's go back to our base what I

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.710 
well let's go back to our base what I
have<00:04:16.090> here<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:18.690> 1<00:04:19.690> over<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.830> the<00:04:21.100> 5th<00:04:21.720> times

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
have here is 1 over a to the 5th times

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.420 
have here is 1 over a to the 5th times
and<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:24.640> could<00:04:24.880> interpret<00:04:25.330> this<00:04:25.510> as<00:04:26.880> B<00:04:27.880> squared

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
and I could interpret this as B squared

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.920 
and I could interpret this as B squared
finding<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.490> cube<00:04:30.850> root<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:31.150> whatever<00:04:31.720> B

finding the cube root of whatever B

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.980 
finding the cube root of whatever B
squared<00:04:32.290> is<00:04:32.440> I'm<00:04:33.400> raising<00:04:33.760> the<00:04:34.120> B<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.510> 2nd

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
squared is I'm raising the B to the 2nd

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.050 
squared is I'm raising the B to the 2nd
power<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.860> I'm<00:04:35.980> finding<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.430> cube<00:04:36.700> root<00:04:36.910> of

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
power and I'm finding the cube root of

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.230 
power and I'm finding the cube root of
it<00:04:37.240> at<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.480> same<00:04:37.720> time<00:04:38.280> again<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.520> have<00:04:39.850> two

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
it at the same time again I have two

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.410 
it at the same time again I have two
fractions<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:41.500> multiply<00:04:41.950> the<00:04:42.010> tops<00:04:42.420> multiply

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
fractions and multiply the tops multiply

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.270 
fractions and multiply the tops multiply
the<00:04:43.480> bottoms<00:04:43.930> or<00:04:44.350> a<00:04:44.410> numerator<00:04:44.920> times

and<00:04:48.070> I<00:04:48.850> get<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.240> cube

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
and I get the cube

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.650 
and I get the cube
be<00:04:51.840> squared<00:04:52.320> all<00:04:52.740> over<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.510> fifth<00:04:56.660> okay
