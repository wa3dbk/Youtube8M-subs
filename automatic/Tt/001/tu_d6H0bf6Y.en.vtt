selling was the display quality yeah it
sounded<00:00:21.970> like<00:00:22.029> though<00:00:22.990> that<00:00:23.289> it's<00:00:23.740> really

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
sounded like though that it's really

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.040 
sounded like though that it's really
similar<00:00:24.340> to<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.669> myth<00:00:24.910> color<00:00:25.150> display<00:00:25.660> is<00:00:25.869> it

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
similar to the myth color display is it

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.319 
similar to the myth color display is it
exactly<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.650> same<00:00:26.739> or<00:00:27.160> has<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.789> process<00:00:28.150> been

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
exactly the same or has the process been

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.850 
exactly the same or has the process been
different<00:00:28.720> for<00:00:28.779> creating<00:00:29.259> with<00:00:29.380> this<00:00:29.500> way<00:00:29.650> cuz

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
different for creating with this way cuz

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.410 
different for creating with this way cuz
enough<00:00:30.070> have<00:00:30.540> some<00:00:31.540> go<00:00:31.660> back<00:00:31.869> to<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.739> hardware

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
enough have some go back to the hardware

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.700 
enough have some go back to the hardware
it's<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.600> same<00:00:34.809> right<00:00:35.110> now<00:00:35.140> then<00:00:35.440> we<00:00:35.559> use<00:00:35.649> the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
it's the same right now then we use the

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.510 
it's the same right now then we use the
same<00:00:36.420> lamination<00:00:37.420> no<00:00:37.629> air<00:00:37.780> gap<00:00:38.110> okay<00:00:38.890> um<00:00:39.250> the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
same lamination no air gap okay um the

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.240 
same lamination no air gap okay um the
combination<00:00:40.329> of<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.930> faster<00:00:41.350> memory<00:00:41.620> and

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
combination of the the faster memory and

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.680 
combination of the the faster memory and
we<00:00:43.059> have<00:00:43.300> you<00:00:43.930> know<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.890> faster<00:00:45.579> processor<00:00:46.270> okay

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
we have you know a faster processor okay

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.010 
we have you know a faster processor okay
that<00:00:47.079> kind<00:00:47.469> of<00:00:47.530> augments<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.250> whole<00:00:49.060> lot<00:00:49.989> of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
that kind of augments the whole lot of

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.900 
that kind of augments the whole lot of
things<00:00:50.140> that<00:00:50.560> we've<00:00:50.800> done<00:00:50.829> in<00:00:51.460> terms<00:00:51.730> of

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
things that we've done in terms of

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.090 
things that we've done in terms of
software<00:00:52.360> unique<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.840> display<00:00:53.200> provides<00:00:53.829> a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
software unique the display provides a

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.470 
software unique the display provides a
much<00:00:54.280> better<00:00:54.520> experience<00:00:54.579> so<00:00:55.120> this<00:00:55.270> is<00:00:55.390> an

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
much better experience so this is an

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.590 
much better experience so this is an
example<00:00:55.649> lamination<00:00:56.649> IPS<00:00:57.160> display<00:00:57.640> that<00:00:58.300> all

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
example lamination IPS display that all

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.870 
example lamination IPS display that all
that<00:00:58.810> stuff<00:00:59.140> then<00:00:59.380> no<00:00:59.920> air<00:01:00.130> gap<00:01:00.340> that<00:01:00.579> was<00:01:00.730> all

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
that stuff then no air gap that was all

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.310 
that stuff then no air gap that was all
on<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.149> new<00:01:01.270> color<00:01:01.480> as<00:01:01.660> well<00:01:01.720> okay<00:01:02.410> okay

believe that's the way it's going to go
huh<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> kind<00:01:51.300> of<00:01:51.360> future<00:01:51.660> proofing<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
huh and be a kind of future proofing the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.139 
huh and be a kind of future proofing the
device<00:01:52.440> but<00:01:52.890> i'm<00:01:53.039> actually<00:01:53.460> having<00:01:53.910> the

device but i'm actually having the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.270 
device but i'm actually having the
built-in<00:01:54.479> memory<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:55.110> expandable<00:01:55.619> memory<00:01:55.680> so

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
built-in memory and expandable memory so

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.880 
built-in memory and expandable memory so
the<00:01:56.789> future<00:01:57.030> people<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:58.080> make<00:01:58.410> use<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.740> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the future people can make use of the

the future people can make use of the
services<00:01:59.430> to<00:02:00.210> download<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.869> take<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> videos

actually really wondering why was in the
color<00:02:07.050> when<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:07.500> first<00:02:07.830> came<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.820> word

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
color when it first came out the word

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.029 
color when it first came out the word
tablet<00:02:09.509> wasn't<00:02:09.959> really<00:02:10.140> attached<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
tablet wasn't really attached to it and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.410 
tablet wasn't really attached to it and
I<00:02:11.130> don't<00:02:11.489> remember<00:02:11.610> really<00:02:11.940> being<00:02:12.150> called

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
I don't remember really being called

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.910 
I don't remember really being called
tablet<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.019> what<00:02:13.170> makes<00:02:13.320> this<00:02:13.500> more<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.830> a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
tablet so what makes this more of a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.430 
tablet so what makes this more of a
tablet<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.420> new<00:02:15.540> color<00:02:15.780> was<00:02:16.019> because

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
tablet then the new color was because

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.170 
tablet then the new color was because
they<00:02:16.590> do<00:02:16.920> most<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.459> same<00:02:17.610> things<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
they do most of the same things and the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.580 
they do most of the same things and the
colors<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.840> an<00:02:18.930> update<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.230> gets

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
colors you can get an update that gets

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.890 
colors you can get an update that gets
most<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.370> same<00:02:20.549> features<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.720> has<00:02:21.810> a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
most of the same features it has a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.690 
most of the same features it has a
faster<00:02:22.230> processor<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.769> more<00:02:22.920> memory<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.459> is

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
faster processor and more memory but is

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.069 
faster processor and more memory but is
there<00:02:23.790> anything<00:02:24.000> beyond<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.810> makes<00:02:24.989> a

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
there anything beyond that that makes a

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.170 
there anything beyond that that makes a
more<00:02:25.200> tablet<00:02:25.530> like<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:25.920> your<00:02:26.040> guys<00:02:26.250> line<00:02:26.549> in

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
more tablet like in your guys line in

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.460 
more tablet like in your guys line in
the<00:02:27.799> thing<00:02:28.799> that<00:02:28.980> this<00:02:29.130> enables<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:30.470> much

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
the thing that this enables is much

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.979 
the thing that this enables is much
faster<00:02:31.620> processor<00:02:32.250> Gator<00:02:32.670> memory<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.840> in

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
faster processor Gator memory so in

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.259 
faster processor Gator memory so in
terms<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:35.130> content<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:35.940> get<00:02:36.120> in

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
terms of the content that you can get in

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.479 
terms of the content that you can get in
in<00:02:36.390> terms<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.720> whether<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.019> apps<00:02:37.230> content<00:02:37.799> it

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
in terms of whether the apps content it

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.340 
in terms of whether the apps content it
belongs<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.269> same<00:02:39.450> category<00:02:39.600> as<00:02:40.079> any

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
belongs in the same category as any

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.340 
belongs in the same category as any
other<00:02:40.440> tablet<00:02:41.190> like<00:02:41.430> right<00:02:41.880> right<00:02:42.060> I<00:02:42.510> think

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
other tablet like right right I think

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.600 
other tablet like right right I think
that's<00:02:43.500> what<00:02:43.680> makes<00:02:43.920> us<00:02:44.160> little<00:02:44.459> bit

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
that's what makes us little bit

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.539 
that's what makes us little bit
different<00:02:45.329> right<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.540> combined<00:02:46.350> with<00:02:46.650> we<00:02:47.459> have

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
different right a combined with we have

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.130 
different right a combined with we have
a<00:02:47.579> microphone<00:02:48.000> here<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.079> a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
a microphone here so you can get a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.720 
a microphone here so you can get a
little<00:02:49.230> bit<00:02:49.440> more<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.860> some<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.489> no

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
little bit more of some of the no

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.100 
little bit more of some of the no
company<00:02:51.090> news<00:02:51.329> and<00:02:51.540> there's<00:02:51.690> no<00:02:51.810> microphone
