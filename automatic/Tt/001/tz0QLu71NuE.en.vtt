cold and you know spring is right around
the<00:00:25.769> corner<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.640> right<00:00:26.789> after<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:26.970> is

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the corner and then right after that is

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.880 
the corner and then right after that is
summer<00:00:27.480> which<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.779> my<00:00:28.170> favorite<00:00:28.529> time<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.710> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
summer which is my favorite time of the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.660 
summer which is my favorite time of the
year

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
year

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.420 
year
I<00:00:29.699> spend<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> lot<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:31.019> my<00:00:31.109> time<00:00:31.320> where<00:00:32.189> as<00:00:32.279> much

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
I spend a lot of my time where as much

I spend a lot of my time where as much
as<00:00:32.880> much<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.360> time<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.489> in<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> summer

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
as much as time as I can in the summer

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.310 
as much as time as I can in the summer
at<00:00:36.180> down<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> beach

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
at down the beach

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.549 
at down the beach
it's<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:38.040> probably<00:00:38.430> my<00:00:38.489> favorite<00:00:38.850> place<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.210> be

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
it's my probably my favorite place to be

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.680 
it's my probably my favorite place to be
especially<00:00:40.559> when<00:00:41.190> hurricane<00:00:42.030> seasons<00:00:42.450> around

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
especially when hurricane seasons around

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.410 
especially when hurricane seasons around
I'm<00:00:43.530> always<00:00:43.940> watching<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.239> surf<00:00:45.450> reports<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
I'm always watching the surf reports and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.290 
I'm always watching the surf reports and
when<00:00:48.420> those<00:00:48.600> swells<00:00:49.260> come<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.579> know<00:00:50.670> three

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
when those swells come in you know three

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
I can hold me back from that but so this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.109 
I can hold me back from that but so this
getting<00:01:04.710> back<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> drawing<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.519> bit<00:01:05.670> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
getting back to the drawing a bit I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.060 
getting back to the drawing a bit I
started<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.049> sky<00:01:07.260> off<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.890> light

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
started the sky off with just a light

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.490 
started the sky off with just a light
hatching<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.930> blended<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> whole

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
hatching and then just blended the whole

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.800 
hatching and then just blended the whole
thing<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.760> took<00:01:11.880> an<00:01:12.030> eraser<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
thing out and just took an eraser and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.289 
thing out and just took an eraser and
just<00:01:13.650> lightly<00:01:13.860> erased<00:01:14.280> everything<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:15.240> know

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
just lightly erased everything you know

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.060 
just lightly erased everything you know
just<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.509> get<00:01:15.570> some<00:01:15.750> nice<00:01:15.900> general<00:01:16.770> clouds

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
just to get some nice general clouds

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.990 
just to get some nice general clouds
going<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.930> here's<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.790> horizon<00:01:20.790> line<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
going and here's the horizon line and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.340 
going and here's the horizon line and
I'm<00:01:21.270> starting<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> draw<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> water<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
I'm starting to draw in the water and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
I'm starting to draw in the water and
with<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.729> used<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.150> lighter<00:01:24.600> pencil

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
with that I just used a lighter pencil

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.999 
with that I just used a lighter pencil
probably<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> HB<00:01:26.070> 2b<00:01:26.430> range<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.380> I've

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
probably the HB 2b range and just I've

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.730 
probably the HB 2b range and just I've
made<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.400> very<00:01:29.610> horizontal<00:01:30.030> strokes<00:01:30.780> pretty

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
made some very horizontal strokes pretty

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.080 
made some very horizontal strokes pretty
hard<00:01:32.040> strokes<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.520> want<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> lot<00:01:33.210> of

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
hard strokes I want to get a lot of

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.760 
hard strokes I want to get a lot of
different<00:01:35.090> tones<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:35.900> extras<00:01:36.380> out<00:01:36.560> there

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
different tones and extras out there

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.370 
different tones and extras out there
just<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.130> kind<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.400> simulate<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.510> the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
just to kind of simulate that the the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.920 
just to kind of simulate that the the
wind<00:01:39.619> was<00:01:39.830> kind<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.250> whipping<00:01:41.210> out<00:01:41.360> there<00:01:41.630> and

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
wind was kind of whipping out there and

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.469 
wind was kind of whipping out there and
you<00:01:42.650> know<00:01:42.710> much<00:01:42.950> like<00:01:43.100> white<00:01:43.369> caps<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.060> things

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
you know much like white caps and things

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.910 
you know much like white caps and things
like<00:01:44.659> that<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.140> you'll<00:01:45.409> see<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.650> lot<00:01:45.860> of

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
like that and you'll see a lot of

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.490 
like that and you'll see a lot of
texture<00:01:46.550> out<00:01:46.580> in<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.850> water<00:01:47.060> one<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:48.080> wind<00:01:48.350> is

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
texture out in the water one the wind is

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.090 
texture out in the water one the wind is
really<00:01:48.680> cranking<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:50.440> spent<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.530> lot<00:01:51.680> of<00:01:51.710> time<00:01:51.950> in

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
really cranking I spent a lot of time in

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.080 
really cranking I spent a lot of time in
the<00:01:52.159> beginning<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.580> this<00:01:52.670> drawing<00:01:52.970> just

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
the beginning of this drawing just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.540 
the beginning of this drawing just
blocking<00:01:53.869> in<00:01:54.080> general<00:01:54.560> shapes<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.280> things

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
blocking in general shapes and things

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.790 
blocking in general shapes and things
like<00:01:55.729> that<00:01:55.930> just<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.050> get<00:01:57.259> everything<00:01:57.500> in

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
like that just to get everything in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.680 
like that just to get everything in
place<00:01:58.100> before<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:58.670> actually<00:01:58.940> start<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.479> dive

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
this but but I don't mind I I just like

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.990 
this but but I don't mind I I just like
to<00:03:26.049> keep<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.379> underneath<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:27.099> the<00:03:27.459> 20-minute

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000

videos<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.579> concerned<00:03:32.609> here<00:03:33.609> I'm<00:03:33.819> drawing<00:03:34.180> in

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
videos to concerned here I'm drawing in

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.690 
videos to concerned here I'm drawing in
like<00:03:34.629> a<00:03:34.659> distant<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.470> want<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.459> call<00:03:36.609> it<00:03:36.670> a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
like a distant I want to call it a

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.460 
like a distant I want to call it a
mountain<00:03:37.030> but<00:03:37.180> it's<00:03:37.329> definitely<00:03:37.659> a<00:03:37.720> larger

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
mountain but it's definitely a larger

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.420 
mountain but it's definitely a larger
rock<00:03:38.680> formation<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:40.379> had<00:03:41.379> quite<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.040> bit<00:03:42.310> of

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
rock formation I had quite a bit of

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.280 
rock formation I had quite a bit of
trouble<00:03:42.670> with<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.060> at<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.359> very<00:03:43.510> beginning

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
trouble with this at the very beginning

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.580 
trouble with this at the very beginning
I<00:03:44.500> was<00:03:45.280> trying<00:03:45.609> to<00:03:45.879> simulate<00:03:46.299> texture<00:03:47.260> of

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
I was trying to simulate texture of

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.729 
I was trying to simulate texture of
rocks<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.879> it<00:03:49.299> really<00:03:49.810> wasn't<00:03:50.230> working<00:03:50.590> for

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
rocks and it really wasn't working for

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.330 
rocks and it really wasn't working for
me<00:03:50.980> at<00:03:51.159> all<00:03:51.629> at<00:03:52.629> the<00:03:52.750> beginning<00:03:53.019> stages<00:03:53.349> it's

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
me at all at the beginning stages it's

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.780 
me at all at the beginning stages it's
not<00:03:54.519> until<00:03:54.849> I<00:03:54.879> really<00:03:56.159> block<00:03:57.159> in<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.400> lot<00:03:57.670> of

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
not until I really block in a lot of

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.089 
not until I really block in a lot of

problems like this is first off I

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.339 
problems like this is first off I
usually<00:04:11.680> get<00:04:12.280> up<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.639> walk<00:04:12.849> away<00:04:13.199> because<00:04:14.199> if

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
usually get up and walk away because if

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.979 
usually get up and walk away because if
I<00:04:14.440> keep<00:04:14.709> on<00:04:14.949> struggling<00:04:15.849> with<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.690> trying

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
I keep on struggling with it and trying

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.930 
I keep on struggling with it and trying
to<00:04:17.079> work<00:04:17.289> it<00:04:17.470> into<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.799> you<00:04:18.340> know<00:04:18.370> what<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:18.549> have

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
to work it into the you know what I have

to work it into the you know what I have
envisioned<00:04:19.449> in<00:04:19.539> my<00:04:19.570> mind<00:04:19.900> it's<00:04:20.680> gonna<00:04:20.859> drive

envisioned in my mind it's gonna drive
me<00:04:21.130> absolutely<00:04:21.220> nuts<00:04:21.639> oh<00:04:21.880> I'm<00:04:21.970> probably

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
me absolutely nuts oh I'm probably

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.270 
me absolutely nuts oh I'm probably
saying<00:04:22.449> get<00:04:22.630> frustrated<00:04:23.169> so<00:04:23.320> like<00:04:24.099> I<00:04:24.190> said

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
saying get frustrated so like I said

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.830 
saying get frustrated so like I said
first<00:04:24.610> thing<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:24.849> do<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.360> get<00:04:25.539> up<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:25.780> walk

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
first thing I do is I get up and walk

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.990 
first thing I do is I get up and walk
away<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:26.440> I'll<00:04:26.860> usually<00:04:27.039> come<00:04:27.310> back<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.639> it<00:04:27.789> in

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
away and I'll usually come back to it in

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.210 
away and I'll usually come back to it in
about<00:04:28.150> 20<00:04:28.690> or<00:04:28.780> 30<00:04:28.960> minutes<00:04:29.110> or<00:04:29.320> so<00:04:29.349> just<00:04:29.680> to

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
about 20 or 30 minutes or so just to

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.939 
about 20 or 30 minutes or so just to
kind<00:04:30.490> of<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:31.300> know<00:04:31.330> cool<00:04:32.199> off<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.440> bit<00:04:32.530> you<00:04:32.800> not

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
kind of you know cool off a bit you not

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.740 
kind of you know cool off a bit you not
that<00:04:33.130> it's<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.400> complete<00:04:33.880> like<00:04:34.060> mind<00:04:34.330> stressor

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
that it's a complete like mind stressor

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.080 
that it's a complete like mind stressor
but<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:36.310> helps<00:04:36.849> a<00:04:36.910> lot<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.479> just<00:04:37.930> take<00:04:38.139> breaks

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
but it helps a lot to just take breaks

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.360 
but it helps a lot to just take breaks
they<00:04:40.090> keep<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.389> kind<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.720> heat<00:04:41.139> and<00:04:41.289> keeps<00:04:42.220> your

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
they keep to kind of heat and keeps your

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.800 
they keep to kind of heat and keeps your
sanity<00:04:42.789> there<00:04:43.440> sometimes<00:04:44.550> drawing<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.820> kind

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
sanity there sometimes drawing and kind

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.469 
sanity there sometimes drawing and kind
of<00:04:46.900> frustrate<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.860> little<00:04:48.159> bit<00:04:48.479> especially

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
of frustrate you a little bit especially

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.189 
of frustrate you a little bit especially
if<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.630> get<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.780> little<00:04:49.990> impatient

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
if you get a little impatient

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.170 
if you get a little impatient
and<00:04:53.199> as<00:04:53.349> you<00:04:53.500> can<00:04:53.620> see<00:04:53.680> I've<00:04:54.190> really<00:04:54.699> advanced

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
and as you can see I've really advanced

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.510 
and as you can see I've really advanced
through<00:04:55.419> this<00:04:55.599> and<00:04:55.930> added<00:04:56.889> quite<00:04:57.099> a<00:04:57.160> bit<00:04:57.400> of

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
through this and added quite a bit of

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.059 
through this and added quite a bit of
detail<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:59.380> took<00:04:59.560> me<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.710> little<00:04:59.800> while<00:04:59.949> to

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
detail it took me a little while to

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.680 
detail it took me a little while to
actually<00:05:00.699> get<00:05:00.819> the<00:05:00.910> contours<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.569> way<00:05:01.660> I

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
actually get the contours the way I

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.920 
actually get the contours the way I
wanted<00:05:01.990> to<00:05:02.050> but<00:05:02.800> it's<00:05:02.979> just<00:05:03.870> trying<00:05:04.870> to

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
wanted to but it's just trying to

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.659 
wanted to but it's just trying to
imagine<00:05:05.410> where<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:05.979> light<00:05:06.130> would<00:05:06.250> be<00:05:06.370> hitting

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
imagine where the light would be hitting

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.279 
imagine where the light would be hitting
and<00:05:07.030> you<00:05:07.389> know<00:05:07.449> if<00:05:07.810> you<00:05:07.900> want<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:08.139> create

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
and you know if you want to create

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.650 
and you know if you want to create
different<00:05:08.380> shapes<00:05:08.680> and<00:05:09.069> dimensions<00:05:09.610> and<00:05:09.789> how

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
different shapes and dimensions and how

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.110 
different shapes and dimensions and how
you<00:05:10.720> would<00:05:11.020> go<00:05:11.169> about<00:05:11.199> doing<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.970> in<00:05:12.970> this

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
you would go about doing that in this

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.600 
you would go about doing that in this
case<00:05:13.330> I<00:05:13.479> just<00:05:13.509> added<00:05:13.870> a<00:05:14.110> few<00:05:14.349> more<00:05:14.610> smaller

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
case I just added a few more smaller

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.450 
case I just added a few more smaller
rocks<00:05:15.880> in<00:05:16.569> front<00:05:16.750> of<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.830> big<00:05:17.979> formation

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
rocks in front of the the big formation

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.600 
rocks in front of the the big formation
just<00:05:18.610> don't<00:05:18.849> give<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:19.240> a<00:05:19.300> lot<00:05:19.389> more<00:05:19.539> depth<00:05:19.810> and

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
just don't give it a lot more depth and

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.350 
just don't give it a lot more depth and
here<00:05:21.610> we<00:05:21.699> are<00:05:21.729> back

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
here we are back

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.809 
here we are back
zoomed<00:05:22.630> out<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:24.130> see<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.400> overall<00:05:24.639> picture

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
zoomed out to see the overall picture

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.469 
zoomed out to see the overall picture
again<00:05:25.380> then<00:05:26.380> I'm<00:05:26.500> just<00:05:26.650> filling<00:05:26.889> in<00:05:27.159> a<00:05:28.120> few

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
again then I'm just filling in a few

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.029 
again then I'm just filling in a few
more<00:05:28.569> rocks<00:05:28.870> that<00:05:29.050> are<00:05:29.110> scattered<00:05:29.710> here<00:05:29.979> and

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
more rocks that are scattered here and

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.670 
more rocks that are scattered here and
there<00:05:30.159> on<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.340> beach<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:31.960> formation<00:05:32.289> on

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
there on the beach and the formation on

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.409 
there on the beach and the formation on
the<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:33.400> right<00:05:33.550> side<00:05:33.789> of<00:05:33.909> the<00:05:33.970> screen<00:05:34.180> on<00:05:34.330> the

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
the the right side of the screen on the

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.240 
the the right side of the screen on the
bottom<00:05:34.539> that's<00:05:35.380> also<00:05:35.680> going<00:05:35.770> to<00:05:35.830> another<00:05:35.979> rock

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
bottom that's also going to another rock

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.960 
bottom that's also going to another rock
formation<00:05:36.789> that<00:05:36.819> I<00:05:37.060> will<00:05:37.270> be<00:05:37.419> drawing<00:05:37.810> in<00:05:38.970> also

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
formation that I will be drawing in also

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.790 
formation that I will be drawing in also
while<00:05:40.479> I'm<00:05:40.539> doing<00:05:40.780> that<00:05:40.930> take<00:05:41.169> a<00:05:41.229> look<00:05:41.440> at<00:05:41.620> the

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
while I'm doing that take a look at the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.700 
while I'm doing that take a look at the
in<00:05:42.099> front<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.430> the<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.880> wave<00:05:43.710> department

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
in front of the the wave department

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.909 
in front of the the wave department
there<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.520> you'll<00:05:45.729> see<00:05:46.380> that<00:05:47.380> there's<00:05:47.650> some

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
there and you'll see that there's some

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.089 
there and you'll see that there's some
foam<00:05:48.520> coming<00:05:49.360> in<00:05:49.479> over<00:05:49.960> there<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.289> that<00:05:50.530> I<00:05:50.800> did

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
foam coming in over there and that I did

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:52.860 
foam coming in over there and that I did
that<00:05:51.280> to<00:05:51.520> indicate<00:05:52.000> that<00:05:52.060> there<00:05:52.449> is<00:05:52.539> a<00:05:52.569> wave

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
that to indicate that there is a wave

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.439 
that to indicate that there is a wave
that<00:05:53.169> has<00:05:53.289> crashed<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:54.520> is<00:05:54.669> already<00:05:54.940> washing

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
that has crashed and is already washing

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.730 
that has crashed and is already washing
up<00:05:55.630> just<00:05:56.380> to<00:05:56.469> kind<00:05:56.710> of<00:05:57.419> help<00:05:58.419> to<00:05:58.690> show<00:05:59.530> the

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
up just to kind of help to show the

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.330 
up just to kind of help to show the
motion<00:05:59.949> of<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.699> ocean<00:06:00.840> the<00:06:01.840> motion<00:06:02.169> of<00:06:02.340> the

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
motion of the ocean the motion of the

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.659 
motion of the ocean the motion of the
motion<00:06:03.699> of<00:06:03.880> the<00:06:04.030> ocean<00:06:04.979> so<00:06:05.979> it<00:06:06.190> just<00:06:06.400> helped<00:06:06.550> to

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
motion of the ocean so it just helped to

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.410 
motion of the ocean so it just helped to
do<00:06:06.820> that

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 
do that

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.990 
do that
so<00:06:09.350> from<00:06:09.590> here<00:06:09.620> on<00:06:09.770> out<00:06:09.950> the<00:06:10.160> drawing<00:06:10.730> is

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
so from here on out the drawing is

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.180 
so from here on out the drawing is
pretty<00:06:11.720> much<00:06:11.870> in<00:06:11.990> the<00:06:12.050> homestretch<00:06:12.440> it's<00:06:12.890> just

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
pretty much in the homestretch it's just

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.010 
pretty much in the homestretch it's just
a<00:06:13.280> matter<00:06:13.460> of<00:06:13.580> filling<00:06:13.820> in<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.090> last<00:06:14.300> chunk<00:06:14.660> of

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
a matter of filling in the last chunk of

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.990 
a matter of filling in the last chunk of
the<00:06:15.380> drawing<00:06:15.770> and<00:06:16.040> I<00:06:16.220> always<00:06:16.400> find<00:06:16.760> that<00:06:16.910> I

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
the drawing and I always find that I

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.090 
the drawing and I always find that I
have<00:06:17.150> just<00:06:17.360> one<00:06:17.660> quarter<00:06:18.230> of<00:06:18.380> a<00:06:18.530> page<00:06:18.770> that<00:06:19.010> I

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
have just one quarter of a page that I

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.770 
have just one quarter of a page that I
just<00:06:19.130> never<00:06:19.490> touch<00:06:19.850> until<00:06:20.090> the<00:06:20.210> very<00:06:20.360> end<00:06:20.450> and

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
just never touch until the very end and

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.810 
just never touch until the very end and
usually<00:06:21.740> when<00:06:21.830> I<00:06:21.890> get<00:06:22.040> to<00:06:22.220> it<00:06:22.370> just<00:06:22.490> like<00:06:22.670> I

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
usually when I get to it just like I

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.060 
usually when I get to it just like I
don't<00:06:23.570> know<00:06:23.690> what<00:06:23.840> even<00:06:23.960> to<00:06:24.110> put<00:06:24.260> there<00:06:24.440> so<00:06:25.040> I

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
don't know what even to put there so I

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.680 
don't know what even to put there so I
just<00:06:25.280> wanted<00:06:25.460> to<00:06:25.550> keep<00:06:25.610> it<00:06:25.760> simple<00:06:26.090> because<00:06:26.510> I

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
just wanted to keep it simple because I

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.790 
just wanted to keep it simple because I
really<00:06:26.960> liked<00:06:27.110> what<00:06:27.260> was<00:06:27.350> happening<00:06:27.650> in<00:06:27.740> the

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
really liked what was happening in the

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.060 
really liked what was happening in the
drawing<00:06:28.100> and<00:06:28.310> I<00:06:29.030> just<00:06:29.270> added<00:06:29.660> a<00:06:29.870> toe<00:06:30.800> in<00:06:30.950> there

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
drawing and I just added a toe in there

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.230 
drawing and I just added a toe in there
just<00:06:31.190> to<00:06:31.340> kind<00:06:31.520> of<00:06:31.580> make<00:06:31.820> it<00:06:31.850> look<00:06:32.060> like<00:06:32.180> a

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
just to kind of make it look like a

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.110 
just to kind of make it look like a
beach<00:06:32.680> which<00:06:33.680> is<00:06:34.160> what<00:06:34.640> it<00:06:34.730> is

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
beach which is what it is

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.240 
beach which is what it is
but<00:06:35.840> I<00:06:36.230> would<00:06:36.530> really<00:06:36.710> want<00:06:36.950> to<00:06:36.980> keep<00:06:37.100> it

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
but I would really want to keep it

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.540 
but I would really want to keep it
simple<00:06:37.630> but<00:06:38.630> um<00:06:38.980> this<00:06:39.980> one's<00:06:40.220> pretty<00:06:40.370> much

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
simple but um this one's pretty much

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.280 
simple but um this one's pretty much
done<00:06:40.760> and<00:06:40.940> I<00:06:41.210> just<00:06:41.450> darken<00:06:41.750> in<00:06:41.870> the<00:06:41.960> main<00:06:42.110> draw

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
done and I just darken in the main draw
