00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.560
 from the world of the anses guide and welcome 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.290
 to a trick of the multiplayer mode of 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.480
 grand theft auto 5 and this trick is for 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.580
 to be basically a ghost we can 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.950
 to transfer most things 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.550
 walls can not be transferred some 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.349
 if people the vehicles all 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.230
 you can transfer everything that breaks 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.770
 can be transferred and with this we could 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.689
 then trolling in a mission game 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.790
 because these are missions can not be 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.559
 in a normal game what 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.390
 I'm sorry but you can only 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.920
 missions to trolling then people who 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.679
 invite our departure to do 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.179
 the mission and first of all I would like 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.589
 tell you that in the secondary channel I'm going to 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.410
 go up how to get the cars 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:47.359
 collectors in the free game other 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.129
 I'll leave in the description of the video 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.079
 because I will upload it to you in the channel 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.699
 secondary I do not know if I'll have gone up anymore 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.519
 I think you have not uploaded it since a 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.260
 little later but during the day then 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.329
 I'm going to spend it, I'm going to upload it better 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.059
 said and the cars we will be 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.400
 passing by way it's worth and if I'm talking 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.440
 de jonay yes k meleon because the bike that 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.150
 It sucks or in a few words 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.250
 so good for everything first 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.710
 we will have to do is get into 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.900
 our own car we lower them worth 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.240
 it has to be our own car and 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.400
 we started to mess it up we'll have to get 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.830
 Well, a few stars and finish 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.960
 dying by the police then our 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.820
 car will have taken it then to the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.980
 comisarÃ­a so to speak the car 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.900
 ours and at this moment then what 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.790
 we had to go is to our own 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.040
 garage I have been walking you are going 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.170
 as you want and then we will need 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.150
 request a mission as you see then no 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.420
 I have none then I will call 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.850
 gerald to request it there you see it 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.560
 what happens now in a moment then I 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.390
 come to a mission from the sea you can 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.490
 catch that same one but I prefer the one 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.650
 gerald there are you see that to the left has 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.330
 the mission came out but well I call it 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.370
 just in case so you can see how it's done 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.260
 we request the activity because there 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.210
 times we do not have any activity and 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.520
 We do not know how to get it 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.020
 get the activities well and as you see 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.390
 because there I have the sea but I do not 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.890
 I'm interested I hope the side arrives and 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.450
 while we have to climb 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.560
 in a car you have seen the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.810
 left that has already reached me 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.940
 vision then we get on any 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.160
 car I climbed in this very 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.620
 and then as we get mobile here not 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.360
 you have to start, we take out the mobile phone and 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.820
 we requested the mission to get there what 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.090
 You see we use them, we give them yes and 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.880
 remember you do not have to leave the garage 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.410
 we just ask for it and here 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.240
 we do not touch anything we give you to confirm 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.940
 adjustments we put it closed if we want 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.360
 or invite a friend and as you will see 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.030
 Well, here we will be in our garage 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.130
 for our garage in the warehouse of the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.450
 police where they left the car and 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.860
 then we will be so to speak 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.830
 invisible you see that some things are 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.650
 can pass other not those that do not 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.140
 they can break because you can not 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.600
 transfer as you see then the two sticks 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.280
 these cars can be transferred 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.770
 you see that this stick can not really be 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.920
 break in life a real life in the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.500
 normal game can not be transferred but 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.880
 on the other hand yes and the cars 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.830
 also because we can hit the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.410
 opposites and end up destroying them 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.810
 can be transferred, so to speak, with 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.120
 the trains also happens this although in 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.160
 they can not be broken but I do not know 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.480
 why but directly because it's because 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.519
 it's a moving object 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.890
 and say it in the game and that's why you can 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.049
 to go through I would say I do not know if that's why 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.310
 but I think that 's why and as you see 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.349
 because most things can be 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.260
 pass the people everything can be 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.790
 trespass in the most curious and long 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.709
 he's pretty handsome so good 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.510
