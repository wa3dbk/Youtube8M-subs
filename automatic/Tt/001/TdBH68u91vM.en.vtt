00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
which I still do I just fancied a bit

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.590 
which I still do I just fancied a bit
for<00:00:38.250> change<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.790> my<00:00:38.940> hair<00:00:39.090> was<00:00:39.210> looking<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.450> bit

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
for change and my hair was looking a bit

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.119 
for change and my hair was looking a bit
limp<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> needed<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> bit<00:00:40.410> more<00:00:40.559> volume<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
limp and needed a bit more volume so I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.709 
limp and needed a bit more volume so I
thought<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.520> found<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.910> switch<00:00:42.180> off<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> shampoo

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
thought I found a switch off the shampoo

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.569 
thought I found a switch off the shampoo
and<00:00:42.840> conditioner<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.350> once<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.160> my<00:00:44.219> life<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
and conditioner for once in my life and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.959 
and conditioner for once in my life and
so<00:00:45.149> I'm<00:00:45.239> now<00:00:45.390> using<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.260> hydrating<00:00:47.250> macadamia

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
so I'm now using the hydrating macadamia

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.850 
so I'm now using the hydrating macadamia
oil<00:00:48.120> shampoo<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.570> conditioner<00:00:48.930> combo<00:00:49.230> which

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
oil shampoo and conditioner combo which

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.889 
oil shampoo and conditioner combo which
I<00:00:50.010> actually<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.210> would<00:00:51.660> say<00:00:51.870> I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
prefer the conditioner to the shampoo I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.150 
prefer the conditioner to the shampoo I
think<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.899> hydrating<00:00:55.110> which<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.710> really

you will know that the shampoo has about
this<00:01:01.079> much<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> conditioner

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
this much in it and then the conditioner

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.979 
this much in it and then the conditioner
has<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:02.879> much<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.570> need<00:01:03.809> so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
much more sort of moisture and I don't

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.429 
much more sort of moisture and I don't
find<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.720> much<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.110> these<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.260> don't

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
find that so much with these I don't

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.289 
find that so much with these I don't
need<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.860> much<00:01:07.950> conditioner<00:01:08.460> because<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.909> so

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
need as much conditioner because it's so

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.780 
need as much conditioner because it's so
hydrating<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.900> itself<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:11.520> say

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
hydrating in itself and what I will say

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.310 
hydrating in itself and what I will say
is<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.570> shampoo<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.020> little<00:01:13.200> bit

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
is I think the shampoo is a little bit

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.080 
is I think the shampoo is a little bit
heavy<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.740> my<00:01:13.890> hair<00:01:14.130> I'm<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.549> entirely<00:01:14.970> sure

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
heavy for my hair I'm not entirely sure

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.999 
heavy for my hair I'm not entirely sure
why<00:01:15.450> maybe<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.229> need<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.560> sort<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
why maybe I just need to sort of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.219 
why maybe I just need to sort of
introduce<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.939> clarifying<00:01:18.390> shampoo<00:01:18.479> into<00:01:18.990> my

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
introduce a clarifying shampoo into my

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.899 
introduce a clarifying shampoo into my
hair<00:01:19.680> routine<00:01:19.979> instead<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.400> losing<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.790> all

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.700 
hair routine instead of losing this all
the<00:01:21.000> time<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.689> yeah<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.560> really

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the time but yeah really really really

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
the time but yeah really really really
liking<00:01:23.009> these<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:23.850> say<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.479> they

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750

liking these and I would say that they
are<00:01:24.780> more<00:01:25.640> defining<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.759> terms<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.119> defining

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
are more defining in terms of defining

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.510 
are more defining in terms of defining
the<00:01:27.659> curls<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> john<00:01:29.340> frieda

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520

the curls and then the john frieda
products<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.659> they're<00:01:30.840> definitely<00:01:31.020> more

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
products and they're definitely more

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.200 
products and they're definitely more
moisturizing<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.220> definitely<00:01:32.909> worth<00:01:33.030> picking

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
moisturizing so definitely worth picking

you<00:03:01.780> can<00:03:01.990> kind<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.290> get<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.500> work<00:03:02.680> as<00:03:02.890> if<00:03:03.100> you

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
you can kind of get it to work as if you

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.270 
you can kind of get it to work as if you
use<00:03:03.580> heat<00:03:03.930> but<00:03:04.930> this<00:03:05.080> really<00:03:05.470> lightweight<00:03:05.770> and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
use heat but this really lightweight and

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.980 
use heat but this really lightweight and
I've<00:03:06.459> been<00:03:06.640> very<00:03:06.820> impressed<00:03:06.970> as<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.660> can<00:03:07.810> hear

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
I've been very impressed as you can hear

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.530 
I've been very impressed as you can hear
there's<00:03:08.170> nothing<00:03:08.890> really<00:03:09.100> left<00:03:09.310> in<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.700> and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
there's nothing really left in it and

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.699 
there's nothing really left in it and
you're<00:03:10.660> just<00:03:10.930> supposed<00:03:11.080> to<00:03:11.260> apply<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:11.530> to

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
you're just supposed to apply it to

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.730 
you're just supposed to apply it to
towel-dried<00:03:12.459> hair<00:03:12.490> and<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.600> often<00:03:14.500> use<00:03:14.709> a

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
towel-dried hair and I often use a

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.979 
towel-dried hair and I often use a
diffuser<00:03:15.130> when<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.640> use<00:03:15.850> this<00:03:16.090> but<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.540> can<00:03:16.840> leave

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
diffuser when I use this but I can leave

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.960 
diffuser when I use this but I can leave
it<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.140> dry<00:03:17.290> naturally<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:18.070> it<00:03:18.459> does<00:03:18.640> sort<00:03:18.880> of

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
it to dry naturally and it does sort of

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.970 
it to dry naturally and it does sort of
limit<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.420> frizz<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.900> think<00:03:20.200> especially<00:03:20.769> if

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
limit the frizz I think especially if

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.680 
limit the frizz I think especially if
you<00:03:21.100> use<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.250> hair<00:03:21.550> oil<00:03:21.580> before<00:03:22.209> hand<00:03:22.420> it

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
you use a hair oil before hand it

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.270 
you use a hair oil before hand it
doesn't<00:03:23.080> leave<00:03:23.320> your<00:03:23.530> hair<00:03:23.739> sort<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:23.950> crispy

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
doesn't leave your hair sort of crispy

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.680 
doesn't leave your hair sort of crispy
either<00:03:24.519> so<00:03:24.790> I'm<00:03:24.880> really<00:03:25.090> liking<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.630> if

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
either so I'm really liking that and if

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.270 
either so I'm really liking that and if
you're<00:03:25.780> looking<00:03:26.019> for<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.230> sort<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.530> high<00:03:27.010> street

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280
