00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.299
 Today is again on lap driving 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.949
 do a cops three and we'll enjoy this 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.619
 coverage on multiplayer mode with 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.930
 new leaks yes new releases 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 coming from the same source that comes to leaking 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.019
 Tongue but I had to bring it to you. 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.140
 on the latest videos through youtube 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.160
 long in 6 chan and this time what the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.610
 people are going to leak 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.680
 information on special weapons 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.200
 of the special characters that people 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.390
 will have in the multiplayer of xbox 360 already 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.469
 must have heard if you guys are 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.989
 following my videos mainly 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.789
 of the specimens means that it will be a 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.980
 news is not the biggest 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.930
 news of the multiplayer Sunday 3 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.059
 these fish want them to have a 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.610
 special ability and a special weapon 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.620
 you will be able to choose one of the two to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.930
 use in a match I already did a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.449
 video covering is all supposed 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.829
 special abilities is a marriage with 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.449
 all special abilities to people 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.580
 will have and now in this video of today I will 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.200
 talk about all nine weapons 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.600
 special things that we will have 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.189
 sure you already know that four is 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.229
 are the characters who had already been 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.200
 revealed that those strikes are country 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.450
 that kind of Geday sword that the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.020
 face gives a peralta pulse and stuck in the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.119
 floor 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.340
 in it gives a very interesting rhythm 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.140
 apparently another track also 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.729
 I told you about that gun. 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.619
 which is nickel from any distance 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.409
 at least so far it may be that 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.500
 they change it then you have the sites that 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.090
 it is the one with the robotic arm that the 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.540
 people saw in the trailer including also 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 that the guy turns his arm and a 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.140
 sort of machine gun and start to shoot 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.170
 very powerful and we have already 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.200
 knows the champion crossbow that is that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.970
 bow and arrow is the one that shoots the arrow 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.380
 explosive power that they imposed 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.090
 back and things like 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.070
 So we have five weapons to 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.719
 know the first one is the most 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.299
 at which time she was not appointed 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.399
 will have a name chosen later 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.250
 It's but one more at the time it shoots. 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.740
 bullets of 30 millimeters and exploding 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.599
 members of the body then this is enough 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.220
 interesting sky that is coming back in 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.250
 We're going to get motivated again. 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.440
 is part of group c 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.320
 exploded and falling from the body of 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.040
 character existed in codex 5 the code 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.780
 to act 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.700
 Okay, just the interesting agreement here. 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.110
 in multiplayer the only weapons capable 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.280
 to do this kind of thing will be 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.110
 these special areas 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.700
 certain now more normal that we're going 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.560
 have inside the game unless you can 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.070
 use any time in your kingdom to 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.160
 class 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.260
 they will not end up with legs 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.750
 arms and everything else the characters are 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.150
 and this sniper is one of them 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.770
 seemed to be an interesting weapon as well. 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.470
 after one of the nine special we 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.330
 will be going to be the ballistics and naife 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.700
 exactly the classic balich naify 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.950
 only this time she will have a question 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.270
 and some explosive medium I'm not sure is that 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.850
 it will work but you will probably go 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.040
 take the knife and where it hits her 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.150
 also explodes in the then maybe it is 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.670
 interesting 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.380
 I do not think it works or works 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.200
 the same way as the original and worth pon 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.540
 it works, so it must also be a 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.430
 special weapon the third one that we have 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.040
 where is actually the eighth that people 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.660
 I already knew when it is actually the seventh 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.810
 We already knew four I said 2 is 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.820
 the seventh is the power plant is this is just one 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.920
 Provisional name also can not know 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.530
 what will be the final name and the description is 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.450
 What are you going to give a punch? 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.540
 in enemies like super part a super 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.730
 So there's the doubt and maybe it's 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.250
 this is the text - background and this is a 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.150
 trailer scene is a campaign scene 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.739
 huh 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.209
 and I thought it would not appear in the 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.470
 multiplayer but then had this 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.000
 skill I got this flea 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.280
 behind the ear also said power point 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.900
 It's just this blow, this is it. 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.390
 quite the apl is far to damn 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.250
 You give it a dash time for the guy. 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.250
 maybe it's not so strong maybe 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.989
 powerpoint is just a one stack the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.910
 even stabbed like I already told you 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.320
 there is no more stabbing stock 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.769
 the crash that unless you are 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.420
 equipped with the combativity in the 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.340
 hand but you have a gun in your hand 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.690
 You do not kill the guy with only trash . 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.940
 suddenly the powerpoint causes you to 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.489
 re-kill with lithium I do not think 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.769
 they will put it and cissokho if it gives 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.510
 gigantic deficit in the campaign and 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.820
 multiplayer or less I hope they 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.040
 do not put it later we have the plasma 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.169
 that canon also looks interesting 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.050
 according to the description it is a cannon of 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.970
 plasma that you support on the shoulders it 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.650
 mounted on your shoulders 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.690
 it is quite similar similar to 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.980
 I am the producer I 've seen and 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.780
 several other cuts 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.220
 Is this also reporting that you left me 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.020
 with a flea behind the ear not 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.180
 I fully understood how it will work 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.620
 because by the inscription million of mine 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.560
 impression that it would be a kind of 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.160
 plasma mortar a basmani cannon 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.960
 Nee and that you will use it as is and will 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.360
 to be almost like a tic quiz but not 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.440
 You can really be sure it's for being. 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.480
 a normal show to have they talk or 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.970
 whether you use your shoulder and 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.950
 must really be like a one 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.660
 missile launcher is one as if it were 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.730
 a billboard, right? 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.380
 but what intrigues me is this final part 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.290
 which is similar to a producer I do not know if 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.060
 You throw him up or something. 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.220
 if the project was better and it was a show 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.840
 Normal everything must shoot to the top only 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.360
 you have no way of knowing where it will fall 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.710
 have to be a bit lucky or else 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.990
 have a laser that will stay where you are 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.490
 will fall but at last maybe not a 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.530
 That's a good weapon so maybe it's the best. 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.419
 of all due to the plant but 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.730
 is one of the areas we will have and 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.970
 finally we will have the flash wars 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.980
 in is back oo bid funk flame 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.520
 I cried everybody liked it in core i5 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:40.130
 Nobel was also present and because she 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.240
 will come back as a special weapon will not 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.460
 has a lot to talk about him 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.190
 basically a flat or you shoot and leave 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.320
 fire and you burn your enemies alive 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.700
 then maybe it's a relationship 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.950
 interesting and promises to be quite 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.950
 cool and use it I'm sure 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.650
 will be good enough I do not know anymore 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.660
 these are the nine special weapons that the 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.880
 people will have in black multiplayer 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.410
 ops 3 each one is for a class 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.140
 different we do not know yet which 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.820
 class is belong to which the gun 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.169
 because we do not know all nine 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.720
 classes until the moment you only know 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.090
 four and these four people already know 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.290
 what weapons do you own but the other five 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.250
 classes have not yet been 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.169
 leaks 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.850
 We still do not know which weapons 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.810
 not even have the skills of 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.550
 any way as it came out 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.960
 information I bring to you commented 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.880
 below you found about these 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.620
 news about these new weapons and 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.729
 you liked the video game lic show and 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.169
 possible your favorite 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:35.590
 I'm going to stay here a hug to 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.590
 everyone is God and is up to the
