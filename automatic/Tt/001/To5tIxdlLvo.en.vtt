that<00:01:30.150> was<00:01:30.479> because<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> cap<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.799> could<00:01:31.979> pull

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that was because the cap you could pull

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.190 
that was because the cap you could pull
off<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> four<00:01:32.759> bolt

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079

absolutely beautiful trick it's just so
beautiful<00:01:48.689> how<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.409> mounts<00:01:49.560> right<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
beautiful how it mounts right on the

cover which has got no bolt so it's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.690

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
seen too many of these anywhere when I

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.000 
seen too many of these anywhere when I
looked<00:02:25.239> online<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:26.380> when<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.500> called<00:02:26.830> alloy

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
looked online but when I called alloy

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.740

art for their grips and the riser I

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.840 
art for their grips and the riser I
ended<00:02:29.140> up<00:02:29.200> finding<00:02:29.440> these<00:02:29.739> mirrors<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.550> this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
ended up finding these mirrors and this

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.520 
ended up finding these mirrors and this
is<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> relatively<00:02:31.510> new<00:02:31.600> design<00:02:32.110> that's<00:02:32.410> out

is a relatively new design that's out
this<00:02:32.769> year<00:02:33.069> slightly<00:02:33.910> different<00:02:34.330> than<00:02:34.450> what

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
this year slightly different than what

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.530 
this year slightly different than what
I've<00:02:34.720> seen<00:02:34.930> online<00:02:35.319> but<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.880> absolutely

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540

few bikes on HD forum boards that I

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.000 
few bikes on HD forum boards that I
really<00:04:28.360> liked<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.960> couple<00:04:29.260> on<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.500> Google

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
really liked and a couple on the Google

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.560 
really liked and a couple on the Google
that<00:04:30.130> I<00:04:30.160> did<00:04:30.340> an<00:04:30.430> image<00:04:30.580> search<00:04:30.700> look<00:04:31.330> really

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
that I did an image search look really

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.390 
that I did an image search look really
sharp<00:04:31.840> so<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:32.080> left<00:04:32.289> the<00:04:32.410> stock<00:04:32.740> black<00:04:32.950> switches

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
sharp so I left the stock black switches

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.400 
sharp so I left the stock black switches
inside<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.389> chrome<00:04:34.570> housing<00:04:35.080> instead<00:04:35.289> of

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
inside the chrome housing instead of

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.020 
inside the chrome housing instead of
going<00:04:35.590> with<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.830> chrome<00:04:36.070> switches<00:04:36.850> that<00:04:36.970> you

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
going with the chrome switches that you

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.150 
going with the chrome switches that you
see<00:04:37.180> a<00:04:37.210> lot<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.449> guys<00:04:37.570> go<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.810> we<00:04:38.500> have<00:04:38.680> it

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.920 
see a lot of guys go to we have it
basically<00:04:39.729> like<00:04:39.910> I<00:04:40.030> said<00:04:40.060> essentially<00:04:40.570> this

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
basically like I said essentially this

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.690 
basically like I said essentially this
kit<00:04:41.289> this<00:04:41.530> chrome<00:04:41.860> hardware<00:04:42.280> kit<00:04:42.430> you<00:04:42.610> can

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
kit this chrome hardware kit you can

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.520 
kit this chrome hardware kit you can
pick<00:04:42.850> up<00:04:42.970> Mackay<00:04:43.210> Harley<00:04:43.510> Davidson<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.110> you

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
pick up Mackay Harley Davidson and you

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.930 
pick up Mackay Harley Davidson and you
can<00:04:44.650> order<00:04:44.919> it<00:04:44.950> online<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:45.520> have<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.639> shipped

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
can order it online and have it shipped

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.430 
can order it online and have it shipped
to<00:04:46.030> any<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.300> your<00:04:46.419> local<00:04:46.690> dealers<00:04:46.960> or<00:04:47.139> ship<00:04:47.320> it

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
to any of your local dealers or ship it

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.060 
to any of your local dealers or ship it
there<00:04:47.620> but<00:04:48.220> it's<00:04:48.700> exactly<00:04:49.590> identical<00:04:50.590> to

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
there but it's exactly identical to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.890 
there but it's exactly identical to
stock<00:04:51.340> so<00:04:51.669> all<00:04:52.060> we've<00:04:52.300> done<00:04:52.330> is<00:04:52.599> it<00:04:52.690> likely<00:04:52.810> to

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
stock so all we've done is it likely to

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.510 
stock so all we've done is it likely to
go<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.110> chrome<00:04:53.380> now<00:04:53.830> it's<00:04:54.010> time<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.400> actually

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
go to chrome now it's time to actually

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.390 
go to chrome now it's time to actually
