card<00:04:13.650> Adobe<00:04:14.010> 71<00:04:14.490> that<00:04:14.640> I<00:04:14.670> mentioned<00:04:14.940> here<00:04:15.360> for

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
card Adobe 71 that I mentioned here for

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.500 
card Adobe 71 that I mentioned here for
the<00:04:15.630> lead<00:04:15.870> but<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:17.520> is<00:04:17.730> really<00:04:17.910> optimized

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
the lead but this is really optimized

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.170 
the lead but this is really optimized
for<00:04:18.690> tournament<00:04:19.290> gaming<00:04:19.620> ok<00:04:20.040> so<00:04:20.340> it's<00:04:20.489> double

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
for tournament gaming ok so it's double

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.780 
for tournament gaming ok so it's double
enclosure<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.620> sound<00:04:22.830> card<00:04:23.100> itself<00:04:23.490> or

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
enclosure so the sound card itself or

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.790 
enclosure so the sound card itself or
the<00:04:23.850> drivers<00:04:24.390> itself<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.410> know<00:04:25.470> they<00:04:25.650> have

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
the drivers itself you know they have

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.440 
the drivers itself you know they have
the<00:04:25.950> molding<00:04:26.340> in<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.490> plastic<00:04:26.910> in<00:04:27.060> there<00:04:27.240> and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
the molding in the plastic in there and

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.090 
the molding in the plastic in there and
then<00:04:27.570> there's<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.780> pocket<00:04:28.200> of<00:04:28.260> air<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.740> then

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
then there's a pocket of air and then

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.680 
then there's a pocket of air and then
the<00:04:29.190> outside<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:29.850> bolded<00:04:30.210> it's<00:04:30.390> just<00:04:30.540> like<00:04:30.660> a

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
the outside and bolded it's just like a

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.120 
the outside and bolded it's just like a
sound<00:04:30.990> reporting<00:04:31.380> city<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:31.800> it's<00:04:31.950> basically

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
sound reporting city so it's basically

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.710 
sound reporting city so it's basically
really<00:04:32.550> insulating<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.150> sound<00:04:33.420> really

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
really insulating the sound really

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.750 
really insulating the sound really
really<00:04:33.840> insulating<00:04:34.530> right<00:04:34.830> it's<00:04:35.130> a<00:04:35.250> very<00:04:35.640> very

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
really insulating right it's a very very

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.160 
really insulating right it's a very very
very<00:04:36.060> flat<00:04:37.820> curve<00:04:38.820> sound<00:04:39.210> /<00:04:39.420> ok<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:39.840> it's

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
very flat curve sound / ok so it's

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.900 
very flat curve sound / ok so it's
really<00:04:40.410> optimized<00:04:40.980> for<00:04:41.010> competitive<00:04:41.670> gaming
