this<00:00:20.240> particular<00:00:20.779> project<00:00:21.260> is<00:00:21.439> basically<00:00:22.090> the

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
this particular project is basically the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.780 
this particular project is basically the
cube<00:00:23.480> or<00:00:23.840> balloon<00:00:24.290> design<00:00:24.740> with<00:00:25.189> a<00:00:25.220> number<00:00:25.640> on

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
cube or balloon design with a number on

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.450 
cube or balloon design with a number on
it<00:00:25.939> and<00:00:26.289> my<00:00:27.289> idea<00:00:27.590> behind<00:00:27.740> it<00:00:28.039> was<00:00:28.070> thinking

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
it and my idea behind it was thinking

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.830 
it and my idea behind it was thinking
that<00:00:28.610> you<00:00:28.700> could<00:00:28.820> make<00:00:29.060> basically<00:00:29.450> a<00:00:29.570> desk

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
that you could make basically a desk

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.700 
that you could make basically a desk
calendar<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:31.010> I've<00:00:31.760> got<00:00:32.000> two<00:00:32.180> variations<00:00:32.900> so

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
calendar and I've got two variations so

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.320 
calendar and I've got two variations so
you<00:00:33.830> can<00:00:34.010> kind<00:00:34.220> of<00:00:34.250> mix<00:00:34.430> things<00:00:34.730> up<00:00:34.910> there's<00:00:35.239> a

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
you can kind of mix things up there's a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.210 
you can kind of mix things up there's a
zero<00:00:35.750> through<00:00:36.020> nine<00:00:36.199> so<00:00:36.590> there's<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:36.980> ten

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
zero through nine so there's the ten

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.020 
zero through nine so there's the ten
digits<00:00:37.879> and<00:00:38.300> then<00:00:38.449> you<00:00:38.570> can<00:00:38.750> mix<00:00:38.989> them<00:00:39.140> up<00:00:39.320> so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
digits and then you can mix them up so

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.509 
digits and then you can mix them up so
for<00:00:41.030> example<00:00:41.390> if<00:00:41.629> you<00:00:41.720> were<00:00:41.840> doing<00:00:42.250> this<00:00:43.250> month

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
for example if you were doing this month

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.969 
for example if you were doing this month
right<00:00:43.640> now<00:00:43.790> you<00:00:43.970> could<00:00:44.390> do<00:00:44.510> zero<00:00:44.750> one<00:00:45.019> and<00:00:45.409> use

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
right now you could do zero one and use

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.770 
right now you could do zero one and use
that<00:00:46.159> in<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.519> gray<00:00:46.729> with<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.150> white<00:00:47.180> numbers

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
that in the gray with the white numbers

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.320 
that in the gray with the white numbers
and<00:00:48.050> then<00:00:48.620> do<00:00:48.920> your<00:00:49.040> date<00:00:49.309> in<00:00:49.580> the<00:00:49.940> white<00:00:50.120> with

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
and then do your date in the white with

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.810 
and then do your date in the white with
the<00:00:50.420> black<00:00:50.570> numbers<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:51.979> have<00:00:52.460> them<00:00:52.640> on<00:00:52.729> your

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
the black numbers and have them on your

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.340 
the black numbers and have them on your
desk<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:53.780> can<00:00:53.900> have<00:00:54.019> them<00:00:54.140> just

when you cut it out and I've already

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.030 
when you cut it out and I've already
folded<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.780> once<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.110> has<00:01:57.260> all<00:01:57.409> my<00:01:57.440> creases<00:01:57.770> in

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
folded it once it has all my creases in

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.500 
folded it once it has all my creases in
it<00:01:58.159> but<00:01:58.310> I'll<00:01:58.580> just<00:01:58.790> show<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.000> guys<00:01:59.090> again

here<00:01:59.750> how<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:00.050> goes<00:02:00.200> we're<00:02:00.740> just<00:02:00.890> making<00:02:01.130> a

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
here how it goes we're just making a

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.860 
here how it goes we're just making a
standard<00:02:01.640> balloon<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.390> then<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.690> just

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
standard balloon and then you just

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.510 
standard balloon and then you just
crease<00:02:03.140> off<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.560> pinch<00:02:03.770> off<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.100> edges<00:02:04.220> to

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
crease off and pinch off the edges to

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.890 
crease off and pinch off the edges to
make<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.700> more<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.120> cube<00:02:05.390> shape<00:02:05.420> when<00:02:05.780> you're

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
make it more of a cube shape when you're

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.880 
make it more of a cube shape when you're
finished<00:02:06.260> so<00:02:06.950> um<00:02:08.050> I'm<00:02:09.050> gonna<00:02:09.200> start<00:02:09.440> off<00:02:09.590> here

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
finished so um I'm gonna start off here

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.059 
finished so um I'm gonna start off here
by<00:02:10.099> doing<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.670> water<00:02:11.420> balloon<00:02:11.629> base<00:02:12.050> so<00:02:12.500> with

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
by doing a water balloon base so with

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.830 
by doing a water balloon base so with
the<00:02:13.340> tape<00:02:13.879> part<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.300> has<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.510> numbers

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
the tape part that has the numbers

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.330 
the tape part that has the numbers
facing<00:02:15.379> down<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.739> just<00:02:15.860> want<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.159> go<00:02:16.250> ahead

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
facing down you just want to go ahead

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.119 
facing down you just want to go ahead
and<00:02:16.550> fold<00:02:16.849> your<00:02:17.060> paper<00:02:17.330> into<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.140> big<00:02:18.440> triangle

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.110 
pattern side facing up go ahead and fold
in<00:02:29.250> half<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:30.740> then<00:02:31.740> open<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.459> fold<00:02:32.910> it

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
in half and then open it up and fold it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.860 
in half and then open it up and fold it
in<00:02:33.300> half<00:02:33.330> again<00:02:35.450> from<00:02:36.450> there<00:02:36.630> go<00:02:36.720> ahead<00:02:36.780> and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
in half again from there go ahead and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.360 
in half again from there go ahead and
open<00:02:37.200> things<00:02:37.410> up<00:02:37.620> look<00:02:37.980> at<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:38.340> a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
open things up look at it like a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.550 
open things up look at it like a
diamonds<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.239> kind<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.600> pinch<00:02:39.959> everything<00:02:40.440> in

each side you want to make sure you're
looking<00:02:50.790> at<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.940> side<00:02:51.209> where<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.420> can<00:02:51.510> see

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
looking at the side where you can see

that<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.270> number<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.870> hiding<00:02:55.410> inside<00:02:56.360> from

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
that the number is hiding inside from

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.420 
that the number is hiding inside from
here<00:02:57.390> we're<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.870> take<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.560> bottom

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
here we're going to take this bottom

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.180 
here we're going to take this bottom
right<00:02:59.790> corner<00:03:00.360> fold<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.170> up<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.950> top<00:03:02.160> point

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
right corner fold it up to the top point

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.699 
right corner fold it up to the top point
and<00:03:02.820> crease<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.660> down<00:03:03.690> into<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.230> nice<00:03:04.410> little

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
and crease it down into a nice little

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.490 
and crease it down into a nice little
triangle<00:03:05.420> do<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.570> same<00:03:06.810> thing<00:03:07.080> on<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.470> other

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
triangle do the same thing on the other

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.100 
triangle do the same thing on the other
side<00:03:07.680> here<00:03:08.190> too<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.850> we<00:03:08.940> cover<00:03:09.390> up<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.660> QR

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
side here too so that we cover up the QR

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.770 
side here too so that we cover up the QR
code<00:03:10.350> in<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.680> process<00:03:11.100> flip<00:03:12.030> things<00:03:12.239> over<00:03:12.569> do

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
code in the process flip things over do

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.770 
code in the process flip things over do
the<00:03:12.810> same<00:03:13.110> thing<00:03:13.319> on<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.500> other<00:03:13.530> side<00:03:13.980> too<00:03:14.280> so

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
the same thing on the other side too so

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.059 
the same thing on the other side too so
you<00:03:15.780> wind<00:03:15.989> up<00:03:16.110> getting<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.500> nice<00:03:16.709> little

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
you wind up getting this nice little

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.240 
you wind up getting this nice little
diamond<00:03:17.489> shape<00:03:17.519> here<00:03:18.950> now<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.040> wanna<00:03:20.220> make

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
diamond shape here now you wanna make

those flaps open at the top and I'm

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.960 
those flaps open at the top and I'm
gonna<00:03:24.330> take<00:03:24.720> each<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.620> these<00:03:25.860> sides<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.670> fold

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
gonna take each of these sides and fold

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.610 
gonna take each of these sides and fold
straight<00:03:27.600> over<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.140> kind<00:03:28.320> of<00:03:28.350> imagine

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
straight over and just kind of imagine

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.020 
straight over and just kind of imagine
you're<00:03:29.010> following<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.549> line<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:29.970> goes

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
you're following a line that goes

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.789 
you're following a line that goes
straight<00:03:30.299> through<00:03:30.480> from<00:03:30.870> point<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.440> point

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
straight through from point to point

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.310 
straight through from point to point
keeping<00:03:32.489> this<00:03:32.730> new<00:03:32.940> creases<00:03:33.480> parallel<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:34.200> the

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
keeping this new creases parallel to the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.710 
keeping this new creases parallel to the
center<00:03:34.620> as<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.769> can<00:03:35.100> do<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.209> same<00:03:36.390> thing<00:03:36.630> on

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
center as you can do the same thing on

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.039 
center as you can do the same thing on
this<00:03:36.900> side<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.970> flip<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.090> over<00:03:39.180> do<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.750> same

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
this side to flip it over do the same

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.449 
this side to flip it over do the same
thing<00:03:40.230> on<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.440> back<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:43.220> then<00:03:44.220> what<00:03:44.370> we're

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
thing on the back and then what we're

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.430 
thing on the back and then what we're
gonna<00:03:44.579> do<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.880> take<00:03:45.150> these<00:03:45.390> little<00:03:45.630> flaps<00:03:46.019> and

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
gonna do is take these little flaps and

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.250 
gonna do is take these little flaps and
tuck<00:03:46.950> them<00:03:47.220> inside<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.510> pocket<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.140> we've

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
tuck them inside the pocket that we've

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.349 
tuck them inside the pocket that we've
created<00:03:49.530> by<00:03:49.860> folding<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.489> part<00:03:50.790> over<00:03:50.970> and

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
created by folding this part over and

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.910 
created by folding this part over and
you<00:03:51.450> can<00:03:51.600> kind<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.840> open<00:03:52.140> things<00:03:52.320> up<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.680> poof

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
you can kind of open things up and poof

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.229 
you can kind of open things up and poof
it<00:03:53.070> open<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.370> little<00:03:53.489> bit<00:03:53.609> to<00:03:53.850> make<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.180> a

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
it open a little bit to make this a

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.900 
it open a little bit to make this a
little<00:03:54.420> easier<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:55.530> gonna<00:03:55.769> slide<00:03:56.160> this<00:03:56.459> tip

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
little easier just gonna slide this tip

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.780 
little easier just gonna slide this tip
right<00:03:57.090> into<00:03:57.600> there<00:03:57.780> push<00:03:58.620> down<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.310> basically

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
right into there push down and basically

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.729 
right into there push down and basically
you're<00:04:00.060> smooshing<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.900> over<00:04:01.320> so<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.650> it

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
you're smooshing it over so that it

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.620 
you're smooshing it over so that it
lines<00:04:01.950> up<00:04:02.160> as<00:04:02.310> close<00:04:02.579> to<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:02.910> edge<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.390> gets

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
lines up as close to this edge and gets

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.690 
lines up as close to this edge and gets
in<00:04:03.780> as<00:04:03.930> deep<00:04:04.140> as<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.380> can<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:04.890> then<00:04:05.400> just<00:04:05.549> make

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
in as deep as it can and then just make

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.400 
in as deep as it can and then just make
a<00:04:05.730> good<00:04:06.000> crease<00:04:06.269> right<00:04:06.540> down<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.930> edge<00:04:07.049> there

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
a good crease right down the edge there

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.699 
a good crease right down the edge there
and<00:04:07.590> I'll<00:04:08.579> do<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.850> same<00:04:09.090> thing<00:04:09.359> on<00:04:09.630> all<00:04:09.720> the

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
and I'll do the same thing on all the

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.500 
and I'll do the same thing on all the
four<00:04:10.980> parts<00:04:11.400> here<00:04:11.579> so<00:04:11.790> if<00:04:11.940> you're<00:04:12.209> gonna<00:04:12.299> do<00:04:12.420> it

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
four parts here so if you're gonna do it

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.440 
four parts here so if you're gonna do it
four<00:04:12.690> times<00:04:13.880> doing<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:14.970> front<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.810> back

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
four times doing the front and the back

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.450 
four times doing the front and the back
to<00:04:18.450> get<00:04:18.600> this<00:04:18.780> part<00:04:19.049> tucked<00:04:19.320> away<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:23.190> I

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
to get this part tucked away and I

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.860 
to get this part tucked away and I
already<00:04:23.610> crease<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:24.419> it's<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.660> little

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
already crease this so it's a little

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.480 
already crease this so it's a little
easier<00:04:25.200> for<00:04:25.229> me<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.500> do<00:04:25.740> but<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.100> should<00:04:26.310> wind

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
easier for me to do but you should wind

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.590 
easier for me to do but you should wind
up<00:04:26.610> with<00:04:26.760> something<00:04:26.940> then<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.330> looks<00:04:27.419> like

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
up with something then that looks like

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.399 
up with something then that looks like
this<00:04:28.700> then<00:04:29.700> if<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.210> kind<00:04:30.510> of<00:04:30.599> open<00:04:30.960> things<00:04:31.229> up

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
this then if you kind of open things up

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.219 
this then if you kind of open things up
to<00:04:31.680> look<00:04:31.860> like<00:04:32.039> a<00:04:32.070> little<00:04:32.370> cross<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:34.050> should

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
to look like a little cross you should

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.010 
to look like a little cross you should
and<00:04:34.349> you<00:04:34.380> flip<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.860> over<00:04:34.979> so<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.370> your

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
and you flip it over so that your

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.020 
and you flip it over so that your
number<00:04:36.349> is<00:04:36.379> upside<00:04:36.919> down<00:04:37.099> you<00:04:37.729> should<00:04:37.849> have<00:04:38.000> a

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
number is upside down you should have a

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.999 
number is upside down you should have a
nice<00:04:38.270> little<00:04:38.660> hole<00:04:39.110> that<00:04:39.410> appears<00:04:39.740> there<00:04:39.919> in

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
nice little hole that appears there in

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.140 
nice little hole that appears there in
the<00:04:40.099> middle<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.490> we're<00:04:40.580> just<00:04:40.639> going<00:04:40.819> to<00:04:40.849> blow

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
the middle and we're just going to blow

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.330 
the middle and we're just going to blow
air<00:04:41.330> into<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:41.900> until<00:04:42.139> this<00:04:42.229> poops<00:04:42.560> out<00:04:42.770> into<00:04:43.310> a

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
air into it until this poops out into a

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:53.170 
air into it until this poops out into a
balloon<00:04:51.069> first<00:04:52.069> time<00:04:52.400> around<00:04:52.669> might<00:04:52.879> not<00:04:53.060> look

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
balloon first time around might not look

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.850 
balloon first time around might not look
all<00:04:53.389> that<00:04:53.419> great<00:04:53.870> but<00:04:53.900> you<00:04:54.409> want<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.620> try<00:04:54.770> to

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
all that great but you want to try to

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.770 
all that great but you want to try to
push<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.340> down<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.879> blow<00:04:56.150> a<00:04:56.180> couple<00:04:56.539> times

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
push it down and blow a couple times

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.990 
push it down and blow a couple times
until<00:04:56.990> you<00:04:57.289> can<00:04:57.440> get<00:04:57.620> these<00:04:57.830> sides<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.789> poof

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
until you can get these sides to poof

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.399 
until you can get these sides to poof
out<00:04:59.210> and<00:04:59.479> then<00:04:59.659> we're<00:04:59.840> going<00:04:59.960> to<00:05:00.020> put<00:05:00.229> little

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:00.409 
out and then we're going to put little

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.260 
out and then we're going to put little
creases<00:05:00.889> on<00:05:01.039> the<00:05:01.069> edges<00:05:01.520> till<00:05:01.849> it<00:05:01.940> looks<00:05:02.120> like

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
creases on the edges till it looks like

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.710 
creases on the edges till it looks like
a<00:05:02.300> cube<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:07.000> because<00:05:08.000> I've<00:05:08.120> already<00:05:08.330> creased

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
a cube and because I've already creased

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.059 
a cube and because I've already creased
mine<00:05:08.930> off<00:05:09.080> it's<00:05:09.259> a<00:05:09.319> little<00:05:09.530> easier<00:05:09.830> but

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
mine off it's a little easier but

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.499 
mine off it's a little easier but
basically<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.580> just<00:05:10.639> want<00:05:10.909> to<00:05:11.000> put<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.360> little

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
basically you just want to put a little

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.499 
basically you just want to put a little
pressure<00:05:11.720> and<00:05:12.229> pinch<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:13.190> it<00:05:14.030> should<00:05:14.240> kind<00:05:14.449> of

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:14.509 
pressure and pinch and it should kind of

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:15.999 
pressure and pinch and it should kind of
come<00:05:14.690> pretty<00:05:14.870> naturally<00:05:15.409> just<00:05:15.500> pinch<00:05:15.800> around
