it's<00:03:53.989> something<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.079> you<00:03:55.199> make<00:03:55.379> I<00:03:55.530> believe

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
it's something that you make I believe

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.909 
it's something that you make I believe
by<00:03:55.979> I<00:03:56.190> think<00:03:57.090> she<00:03:57.209> went<00:03:57.389> to<00:03:58.079> all<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:58.620> cards

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
by I think she went to all you cards

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.009 
by I think she went to all you cards
says<00:03:59.190> two<00:03:59.459> XYZ<00:03:59.970> monsters<00:04:00.090> with<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.540> same<00:04:00.599> rank

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
says two XYZ monsters with the same rank

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.899 
says two XYZ monsters with the same rank
except<00:04:01.409> for<00:04:01.560> number<00:04:01.769> of<00:04:01.799> monsters<00:04:01.949> so<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:02.790> think

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
except for number of monsters so I think

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.059 
except for number of monsters so I think
two<00:04:03.120> audio<00:04:03.359> cards<00:04:03.629> made<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:03.959> card<00:04:04.199> and<00:04:04.349> its

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
two audio cards made this card and its

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.149 
two audio cards made this card and its
original<00:04:05.609> rank<00:04:06.449> is<00:04:06.599> always<00:04:07.440> treated<00:04:07.859> as<00:04:07.949> one

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
original rank is always treated as one

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.680 
original rank is always treated as one
even<00:04:08.459> though<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:08.549> technically<00:04:09.209> shows<00:04:09.479> two

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
even though it technically shows two

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.569 
even though it technically shows two
level<00:04:10.019> kind<00:04:10.229> of<00:04:10.349> interesting<00:04:10.799> card<00:04:11.010> but

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
level kind of interesting card but

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:12.830 
level kind of interesting card but
anyways<00:04:11.819> it<00:04:11.970> can't<00:04:12.180> be<00:04:12.269> short<00:04:12.479> battle<00:04:12.750> and

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
anyways it can't be short battle and

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.119 
anyways it can't be short battle and
neither<00:04:13.019> play<00:04:13.169> takes<00:04:13.379> any<00:04:13.590> battle<00:04:13.979> damage

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
neither play takes any battle damage

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.069 
neither play takes any battle damage
from<00:04:14.669> attacks<00:04:14.970> involving<00:04:15.359> this<00:04:15.449> card<00:04:15.720> at<00:04:15.900> the

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.200 
there which I thought was going to try
to<00:04:53.720> help<00:04:53.840> me<00:04:53.930> survive<00:04:54.229> but<00:04:55.060> there's<00:04:56.060> one

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
to help me survive but there's one

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.529 
to help me survive but there's one
really<00:04:56.389> cool<00:04:56.600> play<00:04:56.810> up<00:04:57.050> when<00:04:57.680> she<00:04:58.539> attacked

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
really cool play up when she attacked

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.120 
really cool play up when she attacked
with<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.870> future<00:05:00.169> hope<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.590> she<00:05:00.830> stole<00:05:01.010> my

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
with the future hope and she stole my

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.240 
with the future hope and she stole my
monster<00:05:01.550> because<00:05:02.120> I<00:05:02.360> gained<00:05:03.169> 500<00:05:03.470> ko<00:05:03.949> against

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
monster because I gained 500 ko against

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.490 
monster because I gained 500 ko against
500<00:05:04.669> attack<00:05:04.760> for<00:05:04.940> each<00:05:05.060> monster<00:05:05.870> my<00:05:06.169> opponent

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
500 attack for each monster my opponent

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.159 
500 attack for each monster my opponent
controls<00:05:06.650> I<00:05:06.949> vanished<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.780> master<00:05:08.780> ass<00:05:08.990> and

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
controls I vanished the master ass and

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.110 
controls I vanished the master ass and
so<00:05:09.229> would<00:05:09.350> reduce<00:05:09.590> my<00:05:09.650> attack<00:05:10.039> by<00:05:10.280> I<00:05:10.550> think<00:05:10.910> it

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
so would reduce my attack by I think it

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.159 
so would reduce my attack by I think it
reduces<00:05:11.449> it<00:05:11.690> by<00:05:11.720> 26<00:05:12.289> and<00:05:12.500> then<00:05:13.160> I<00:05:13.850> only<00:05:14.630> had<00:05:14.900> I

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
reduces it by 26 and then I only had I

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.960 
reduces it by 26 and then I only had I
think<00:05:15.229> 400<00:05:15.830> attack<00:05:16.070> but<00:05:16.370> when<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:16.699> went<00:05:16.850> back

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
think 400 attack but when it went back

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.810 
think 400 attack but when it went back
to<00:05:17.000> her<00:05:17.270> field<00:05:17.539> because<00:05:17.990> I<00:05:18.560> have<00:05:19.370> no<00:05:19.580> monsters

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
to her field because I have no monsters

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.460 
to her field because I have no monsters
on<00:05:20.270> my<00:05:20.360> side<00:05:20.539> of<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.810> board<00:05:20.960> she<00:05:21.139> controls

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
on my side of the board she controls

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.890 
on my side of the board she controls
that<00:05:21.560> card<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:22.639> changed<00:05:23.060> so<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:23.240> carnet<00:05:23.690> zero

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
that card it changed so that carnet zero

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.240 
that card it changed so that carnet zero
attack<00:05:24.110> those<00:05:24.350> counters<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.740> cool<00:05:24.919> play<00:05:25.100> was

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
attack those counters the cool play was

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.500 
attack those counters the cool play was
kind<00:05:25.490> of<00:05:25.550> unnecessary<00:05:28.030> well<00:05:29.030> I<00:05:29.060> mean<00:05:29.240> I<00:05:29.300> could

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
kind of unnecessary well I mean I could

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.300 
kind of unnecessary well I mean I could
have<00:05:29.599> taken<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.930> damage<00:05:30.260> but<00:05:30.410> I<00:05:30.680> don't<00:05:31.160> think

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
have taken the damage but I don't think

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.850 
have taken the damage but I don't think
I<00:05:31.340> wanted<00:05:31.580> to<00:05:31.700> take<00:05:31.849> was<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.360> like<00:05:32.860> 2500

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
I wanted to take was it like 2500

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.680 
I wanted to take was it like 2500
believed<00:05:34.010> his<00:05:34.130> attack<00:05:34.400> for<00:05:35.300> nothing<00:05:35.570> when<00:05:35.660> I

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
believed his attack for nothing when I

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.600 
believed his attack for nothing when I
could<00:05:35.840> have<00:05:35.960> banished<00:05:36.229> this<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:37.250> really

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
could have banished this and I really

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.120 
could have banished this and I really
think<00:05:37.789> this<00:05:37.880> card<00:05:38.240> was<00:05:38.630> necessary<00:05:39.139> because

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
think this card was necessary because

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.860 
think this card was necessary because
I'm<00:05:40.370> at<00:05:40.520> zero<00:05:40.820> it<00:05:41.000> still<00:05:41.240> couldn't<00:05:41.539> deal<00:05:41.750> with

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
I'm at zero it still couldn't deal with

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.120 
I'm at zero it still couldn't deal with
this<00:05:41.990> card<00:05:42.229> like<00:05:42.440> this<00:05:42.590> car<00:05:42.830> was<00:05:43.010> the
