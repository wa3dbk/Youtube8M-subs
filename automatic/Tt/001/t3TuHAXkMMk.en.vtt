playing<00:00:00.780> the<00:00:01.050> Chinese<00:00:01.680> tier<00:00:02.429> 10<00:00:02.790> medium<00:00:03.300> tank

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
playing the Chinese tier 10 medium tank

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.210 
playing the Chinese tier 10 medium tank
the<00:00:04.460> 121<00:00:05.460> here<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.480> test<00:00:06.720> server<00:00:06.930> as<00:00:07.589> you

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
the 121 here on the test server as you

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.430 
the 121 here on the test server as you
can<00:00:08.340> see<00:00:08.460> it<00:00:08.580> looks<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:09.000> lot<00:00:09.120> like<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.389> type<00:00:09.929> 59

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
can see it looks a lot like a type 59

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.070 
can see it looks a lot like a type 59
it's<00:00:10.889> just<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.490> little<00:00:11.700> bit<00:00:11.880> skinnier<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.780> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
it's just a little bit skinnier and the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.670 
it's just a little bit skinnier and the
holes<00:00:13.290> longer<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.759> frontal<00:00:15.059> armor<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.690> 120

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
holes longer the frontal armor is 120

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.800 
holes longer the frontal armor is 120
millimeters<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> tier<00:00:18.060> 10<00:00:18.270> heavy<00:00:18.480> tank

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
millimeters like the tier 10 heavy tank

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.710 
millimeters like the tier 10 heavy tank
but<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.710> upper<00:00:20.189> glacis<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.880> only<00:00:21.060> at<00:00:21.240> 60

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
but the upper glacis is only at 60

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.929 
but the upper glacis is only at 60
degrees<00:00:21.750> which<00:00:22.590> does<00:00:23.160> give<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.519> decent

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
degrees which does give it decent

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.880 
degrees which does give it decent
protection<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> medium<00:00:25.019> tank<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:25.619> tier

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
protection for a medium tank but tier

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.330 
protection for a medium tank but tier
nine<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.480> still<00:00:27.480> won't<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.810> enough<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.439> stop

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
nine it still won't be enough to stop

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.179 
nine it still won't be enough to stop
many<00:00:29.699> shells<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.960> turret<00:00:31.260> front<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.769> really

many shells the turret front is really

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.000 
many shells the turret front is really
strong<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.360> size<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.960> turn<00:00:34.170> are<00:00:34.440> decently

armored<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> want<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.510> worry<00:00:36.690> about<00:00:36.809> being

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
armored so you want to worry about being

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.139 
armored so you want to worry about being
penetrated<00:00:37.559> too<00:00:38.010> much<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> front<00:00:38.850> unless

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
penetrated too much in the front unless

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.150 
penetrated too much in the front unless
if<00:00:39.450> they<00:00:39.600> hit<00:00:39.750> those<00:00:39.989> hatches<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.829> top<00:00:43.160> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
if they hit those hatches on top the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
if they hit those hatches on top the
main<00:00:44.370> issue<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.120> tank<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.780> see

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
main issue with this tank as you see

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.260 
main issue with this tank as you see
here<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:47.250> far<00:00:47.520> as<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.000> aim

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
here is that's as far as you can aim

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.660 
here is that's as far as you can aim
down<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.550> that's<00:00:50.550> only<00:00:50.870> around<00:00:52.010> 23<00:00:53.010> degrees

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
down and that's only around 23 degrees

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.590 
down and that's only around 23 degrees
of<00:00:53.850> gun<00:00:53.969> depression<00:00:54.239> which<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.870> very<00:00:55.170> bad<00:00:56.600> as

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
of gun depression which is very bad as

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.260 
of gun depression which is very bad as
far<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.109> gun<00:00:58.500> elevation<00:00:58.710> goes<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.670> elevation

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
far as gun elevation goes the elevation

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.810 
far as gun elevation goes the elevation
isn't<00:01:00.629> too<00:01:00.840> great<00:01:01.050> either<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.039> an<00:01:02.160> it's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
isn't too great either but it's an it's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.140 
isn't too great either but it's an it's
enough<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.270> where<00:01:03.830> it<00:01:04.830> won't<00:01:05.400> limit<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.939> too

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
enough to where it won't limit you too

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.890 
enough to where it won't limit you too
much<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.200> mobility<00:01:07.909> it's<00:01:08.909> actually<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.390> little

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
much the mobility it's actually a little

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.590 
much the mobility it's actually a little
bit<00:01:10.200> slower<00:01:10.560> than<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> Chinese<00:01:11.670> heavy<00:01:11.909> tank<00:01:12.240> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
bit slower than a Chinese heavy tank I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.440 
bit slower than a Chinese heavy tank I
hate<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.710> say<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.280> top<00:01:14.640> speed<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> little

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
hate to say the top speed is a little

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.749 
hate to say the top speed is a little
bit<00:01:15.540> higher<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.680> far<00:01:16.890> as<00:01:16.950> mobility<00:01:17.369> goes

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
bit higher but as far as mobility goes

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.810 
bit higher but as far as mobility goes
the<00:01:18.750> medium<00:01:19.140> tank<00:01:19.439> does<00:01:19.860> move<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.340> bit<00:01:20.490> slower

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
the medium tank does move a bit slower

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
the medium tank does move a bit slower
than<00:01:21.299> heavy<00:01:21.689> tank<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.770> power-to-weight

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
than heavy tank the power-to-weight

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
than heavy tank the power-to-weight
ratio<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.299> worse<00:01:24.920> even<00:01:25.920> though<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.159> weighs<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
ratio is worse even though it weighs a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.460 
ratio is worse even though it weighs a
little<00:01:26.549> bit<00:01:26.759> lighter<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.360> engine<00:01:28.229> horsepower

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
little bit lighter the engine horsepower

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:37.969 
little bit lighter the engine horsepower
is<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> lot<00:01:29.280> lower<00:01:30.650> but<00:01:34.280> then<00:01:35.280> II<00:01:36.619> anyway<00:01:37.619> beats

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
is a lot lower but then II anyway beats

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.450 
is a lot lower but then II anyway beats
the<00:01:38.159> heavy<00:01:38.310> tank<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.329> top<00:01:39.540> speed<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.460> that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the heavy tank is the top speed but that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.639 
the heavy tank is the top speed but that
isn't<00:01:42.299> something<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.290> rely<00:01:43.619> on

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
isn't something that you want to rely on

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.520 
isn't something that you want to rely on
since<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.340> can't<00:01:44.549> always<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:45.000> down<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> hill

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.850 

it<00:01:50.530> does<00:01:50.800> fire<00:01:51.190> faster<00:01:51.880> than<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.600> new<00:01:53.320> tier<00:01:53.590> 10

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
it does fire faster than the new tier 10

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.360 
it does fire faster than the new tier 10
heavy<00:01:54.100> tank<00:01:54.400> and<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:56.170> does<00:01:56.380> it<00:01:56.740> roughly<00:01:57.160> has

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
heavy tank and it does it roughly has

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.890 
heavy tank and it does it roughly has
the<00:01:57.520> same<00:01:57.760> gun<00:01:58.000> these<00:01:58.270> have<00:01:58.540> slightly

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
the same gun these have slightly

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:13.949 
the same gun these have slightly
different<00:01:59.020> names

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.539 

and<00:02:14.959> even<00:02:15.170> though<00:02:15.290> they<00:02:15.440> share<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.069> same<00:02:16.099> guns

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
and even though they share the same guns

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.050 
and even though they share the same guns
the<00:02:16.909> two<00:02:17.120> tier<00:02:17.569> 10<00:02:17.840> Chinese<00:02:18.290> thanks<00:02:18.849> as<00:02:19.849> you

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
the two tier 10 Chinese thanks as you

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.780 
the two tier 10 Chinese thanks as you
can<00:02:20.150> see<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.980> accuracy<00:02:21.980> on<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.190> move<00:02:22.370> on<00:02:22.610> this

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
can see the accuracy on the move on this

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.670 
can see the accuracy on the move on this
is<00:02:23.000> pretty<00:02:23.239> decent<00:02:23.450> along<00:02:24.019> with<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:24.409> same

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
is pretty decent along with the same

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.250 
is pretty decent along with the same
time<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.819> heavy<00:02:26.000> tank<00:02:26.299> does<00:02:26.599> have<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.959> little

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
time the heavy tank does have a little

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.220 
time the heavy tank does have a little
bit<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.680> problem<00:02:27.950> with<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.670> on<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:30.019> move

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
bit of a problem with the on the move

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:40.870 
bit of a problem with the on the move
accuracy<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.069> the<00:02:31.160> aim<00:02:31.340> time

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.480 

I<00:02:41.000> always<00:02:41.540> forget<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:42.080> there's<00:02:42.290> hearty<00:02:42.710> des

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
I always forget that there's hearty des

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.900 
I always forget that there's hearty des

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
around a while just focus on driving

00:02:46.910 --> 00:03:10.390 
around a while just focus on driving
tanks<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:47.510> guess

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.910 

went<00:03:11.400> right<00:03:11.610> through

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:28.230 

I'm<00:03:15.490> gonna<00:03:15.730> run<00:03:15.910> away<00:03:16.470> he's<00:03:17.470> gonna<00:03:17.709> be<00:03:17.800> shot

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:36.040 

fuck<00:03:33.910> see<00:03:34.910> as<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.150> can<00:03:35.270> see<00:03:35.420> even<00:03:35.600> in<00:03:35.840> close

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
fuck see as you can see even in close

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.140 
fuck see as you can see even in close
ranges<00:03:36.530> like<00:03:36.740> this<00:03:36.950> it's<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.400> bit<00:03:37.580> hard<00:03:37.819> to<00:03:37.910> aim

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150

that<00:03:43.750> lag<00:03:44.750> got<00:03:45.020> me<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.200> little<00:03:45.410> bit<00:03:45.590> but<00:03:46.400> as<00:03:46.550> you

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
that lag got me a little bit but as you

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.490 
that lag got me a little bit but as you
can<00:03:46.819> see<00:03:47.030> they're<00:03:47.239> trying<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.720> aim<00:03:47.870> down<00:03:48.140> that

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
can see they're trying to aim down that

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.440 
can see they're trying to aim down that
was<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.770> furthest<00:03:49.430> i<00:03:49.610> could<00:03:49.790> aim<00:03:49.970> down<00:03:50.180> on

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
was the furthest i could aim down on

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.559 
was the furthest i could aim down on
that<00:03:50.569> object<00:03:51.790> even<00:03:52.790> though<00:03:52.850> my<00:03:52.970> gunner<00:03:53.180> is<00:03:53.390> out

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
that object even though my gunner is out

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.070

this guy dies pretty quickly while this

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.620 
this guy dies pretty quickly while this
tank<00:04:26.150> is<00:04:27.100> pretty<00:04:28.100> good<00:04:28.280> medium<00:04:28.729> since<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:29.479> has

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
tank is pretty good medium since it has

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.570 
tank is pretty good medium since it has
the<00:04:29.930> increased<00:04:30.560> alpha<00:04:31.040> over<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.490> other

the increased alpha over to other

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.080 
the increased alpha over to other

mediums the limitations of it are a

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.930 
mediums the limitations of it are a
little<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.810> little<00:04:36.590> bit<00:04:36.710> concerning<00:04:37.190> since<00:04:37.700> as

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
little a little bit concerning since as

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.300 
little a little bit concerning since as
you<00:04:37.970> can<00:04:38.210> see<00:04:38.330> here<00:04:38.630> weighs<00:04:39.020> 40<00:04:39.440> tons<00:04:39.710> but<00:04:40.130> the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
you can see here weighs 40 tons but the

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.450 
you can see here weighs 40 tons but the
engine<00:04:40.729> power<00:04:40.940> is<00:04:41.180> under<00:04:41.570> 600<00:04:41.930> horsepower<00:04:42.560> so

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
engine power is under 600 horsepower so

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.330 
engine power is under 600 horsepower so
the<00:04:43.520> powder<00:04:43.760> rate<00:04:44.440> weight<00:04:45.440> ratio<00:04:45.890> isn't<00:04:46.100> that

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
the powder rate weight ratio isn't that

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.750 
the powder rate weight ratio isn't that
good<00:04:46.610> so<00:04:47.479> it's<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.870> celebration<00:04:48.700> isn't<00:04:49.700> that

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
good so it's a celebration isn't that

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.900 
good so it's a celebration isn't that
great<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.360> going<00:04:50.600> up<00:04:50.720> hills<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:51.140> stuff<00:04:51.380> is

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
great and going up hills and stuff is

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.630 
great and going up hills and stuff is
bad<00:04:52.910> speed<00:04:53.479> wise<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:54.169> gun<00:04:55.010> depression<00:04:55.280> wise

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
bad speed wise and gun depression wise

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.219 
bad speed wise and gun depression wise
since<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.150> can't<00:04:56.360> point<00:04:56.570> down<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:57.020> shoot

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
since you can't point down to shoot

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.279 
since you can't point down to shoot
anything<00:04:58.360> where<00:04:59.360> it<00:04:59.450> does<00:04:59.600> make<00:04:59.810> up<00:05:00.020> for<00:05:00.260> a

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
anything where it does make up for a

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.320 
anything where it does make up for a
little<00:05:00.560> bit<00:05:00.740> as<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:01.010> whole<00:05:01.160> armor<00:05:01.340> is<00:05:01.760> decent

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
little bit as the whole armor is decent

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.960 
little bit as the whole armor is decent
and<00:05:02.419> since<00:05:03.380> it's<00:05:03.560> flat<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:04.160> can<00:05:04.280> angle<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.820> bit

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
and since it's flat you can angle a bit

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.180 
and since it's flat you can angle a bit
and<00:05:05.180> get<00:05:05.330> a<00:05:05.360> few<00:05:05.600> bounces<00:05:05.930> against<00:05:06.500> like<00:05:06.860> teary

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
and get a few bounces against like teary

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.050 
and get a few bounces against like teary
tier<00:05:07.789> 9<00:05:08.000> tanks<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.720> then<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.919> tower<00:05:10.310> armor<00:05:10.820> is

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
tier 9 tanks and then the tower armor is

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.570 
tier 9 tanks and then the tower armor is
240<00:05:12.050> in<00:05:12.110> front<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:12.950> it<00:05:13.039> does<00:05:13.220> provide

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
240 in front so it does provide

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.850 
240 in front so it does provide
protection<00:05:14.300> except<00:05:14.810> for<00:05:14.990> these<00:05:15.080> two<00:05:15.140> hatches

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
protection except for these two hatches

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.790 
protection except for these two hatches
and<00:05:16.330> tier<00:05:17.330> 10<00:05:17.600> guns<00:05:17.840> can<00:05:18.200> go<00:05:18.380> through<00:05:18.650> this

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
and tier 10 guns can go through this

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.700 
and tier 10 guns can go through this
flat<00:05:19.280> part<00:05:19.640> right<00:05:19.910> here<00:05:19.940> these<00:05:20.690> holes<00:05:21.020> don't

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
flat part right here these holes don't

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.010 
flat part right here these holes don't
add<00:05:22.190> any<00:05:22.490> weak<00:05:22.729> spots<00:05:22.760> but<00:05:23.479> they<00:05:23.690> are<00:05:23.870> the

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
add any weak spots but they are the

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.830 
add any weak spots but they are the
flattest<00:05:24.470> part<00:05:24.710> so<00:05:25.490> you<00:05:25.580> can<00:05:25.789> go<00:05:25.970> with<00:05:26.180> go

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
flattest part so you can go with go

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.760 
flattest part so you can go with go

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.680 
through them with hypen guns and touched
on<00:05:30.919> it<00:05:31.070> before<00:05:31.190> but<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.729> upper<00:05:31.970> glacis<00:05:32.180> is

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
on it before but the upper glacis is
only<00:05:32.870> 60<00:05:33.470> degrees<00:05:34.030> so<00:05:35.030> it's<00:05:35.450> roughly<00:05:35.840> two

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
only 60 degrees so it's roughly two

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.670 
only 60 degrees so it's roughly two
and<00:05:37.190> 40<00:05:37.940> millimeters<00:05:38.510> of<00:05:38.570> effective<00:05:39.470> armor

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
and 40 millimeters of effective armor

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.630 
and 40 millimeters of effective armor
and<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:41.350> armor<00:05:42.350> against<00:05:42.560> ap<00:05:42.920> shells<00:05:43.250> is<00:05:43.610> a

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
and the armor against ap shells is a

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.810 
and the armor against ap shells is a
little<00:05:44.120> bit<00:05:44.210> over<00:05:44.330> to<00:05:44.690> Hunter<00:05:44.990> it<00:05:45.110> most<00:05:45.290> likely

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.240 

so<00:05:49.820> overall<00:05:50.060> it's<00:05:50.630> a<00:05:51.020> decent<00:05:51.590> medium<00:05:51.920> tank

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
so overall it's a decent medium tank

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.130 
so overall it's a decent medium tank
especially<00:05:53.150> if<00:05:53.270> you're<00:05:53.420> not<00:05:53.600> fighting<00:05:53.870> on

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
especially if you're not fighting on

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.330 
especially if you're not fighting on
hilly<00:05:54.650> areas<00:05:55.570> but<00:05:56.570> when<00:05:57.470> it<00:05:57.560> comes<00:05:57.740> down<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:57.980> it

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
hilly areas but when it comes down to it

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
hilly areas but when it comes down to it
the<00:05:59.590> high<00:06:00.590> it<00:06:00.920> does<00:06:01.190> have<00:06:01.370> high<00:06:01.550> crew<00:06:01.940> damage

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
the high it does have high crew damage

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
the high it does have high crew damage
to<00:06:02.630> with<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.410> gunner<00:06:03.740> and<00:06:04.070> the<00:06:04.930> driver<00:06:05.930> as<00:06:06.230> you

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
to with the gunner and the driver as you

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.290 
to with the gunner and the driver as you
saw<00:06:06.560> there<00:06:06.590> especially<00:06:07.280> the<00:06:07.550> driver<00:06:07.880> the

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
saw there especially the driver the

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.580 
saw there especially the driver the
driver<00:06:08.540> will<00:06:08.990> die<00:06:09.260> a<00:06:09.290> very<00:06:10.100> lot<00:06:10.370> in<00:06:10.550> this<00:06:10.730> tank

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
driver will die a very lot in this tank

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.590 
driver will die a very lot in this tank
the<00:06:12.590> main<00:06:12.980> limitations<00:06:13.700> as<00:06:13.880> I<00:06:14.120> touched<00:06:14.450> on

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
the main limitations as I touched on

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.110 
the main limitations as I touched on
before<00:06:14.720> is<00:06:15.050> a<00:06:15.140> gun<00:06:15.320> depression<00:06:15.590> which<00:06:16.120> holds

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
before is a gun depression which holds

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.770 
before is a gun depression which holds
it<00:06:17.210> back<00:06:17.240> a<00:06:17.420> lot<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:17.990> then<00:06:18.430> mobility<00:06:19.430> wise

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
it back a lot and then mobility wise

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.140 
it back a lot and then mobility wise
even<00:06:20.780> at<00:06:20.900> speed<00:06:21.230> limits<00:06:21.590> 56<00:06:22.280> you'll<00:06:22.790> be<00:06:22.970> going

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
even at speed limits 56 you'll be going

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.450 
even at speed limits 56 you'll be going
under<00:06:23.480> 40<00:06:23.930> most<00:06:24.140> times<00:06:24.500> since<00:06:24.950> the

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
under 40 most times since the

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.930 
under 40 most times since the
power-to-weight<00:06:25.850> ratio<00:06:26.540> is<00:06:26.810> very<00:06:27.050> bad<00:06:27.940> so

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
power-to-weight ratio is very bad so

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.630 
power-to-weight ratio is very bad so
while<00:06:29.060> it's<00:06:29.240> a<00:06:29.270> good<00:06:29.480> tank<00:06:29.750> if<00:06:30.230> you<00:06:31.130> can<00:06:31.310> limit

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
while it's a good tank if you can limit

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.880 
while it's a good tank if you can limit
the<00:06:31.900> negative<00:06:32.900> sides<00:06:33.140> of<00:06:33.350> the<00:06:33.410> tank<00:06:33.560> it<00:06:33.770> is

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890 
the negative sides of the tank it is

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.700 
the negative sides of the tank it is
very<00:06:34.100> good<00:06:34.400> but<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:35.780> negative<00:06:36.170> sides<00:06:36.380> of<00:06:36.620> the

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
very good but the negative sides of the

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.260 
very good but the negative sides of the
tank<00:06:36.920> does<00:06:37.790> limit<00:06:38.300> its<00:06:38.600> use<00:06:38.750> a<00:06:38.900> bit
