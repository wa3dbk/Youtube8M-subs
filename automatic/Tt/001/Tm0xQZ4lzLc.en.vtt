black<00:00:36.730> camera<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:39.040> basically<00:00:39.520> what<00:00:39.700> happens

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
black camera but basically what happens

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.000 
black camera but basically what happens
and<00:00:40.420> you<00:00:40.480> can<00:00:40.660> see<00:00:40.870> now<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.110> camera<00:00:41.649> is<00:00:41.770> off

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
and you can see now the camera is off

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.970 
and you can see now the camera is off
and<00:00:42.660> before<00:00:43.660> I<00:00:43.690> continue<00:00:43.960> all<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:44.590> everyone

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
and before I continue all that everyone

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.760 
and before I continue all that everyone
know<00:00:45.160> I've<00:00:45.309> checked<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.700> firmware<00:00:45.910> version

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
know I've checked the firmware version

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.170 
know I've checked the firmware version
it<00:00:47.770> is<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:48.160> most<00:00:48.370> current<00:00:48.670> up-to-date

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
it is the most current up-to-date

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:58.410 
it is the most current up-to-date
firmware<00:00:49.930> as<00:00:50.020> HD<00:00:51.420> 3.0<00:00:53.430> 3.0<00:00:56.070> 1.8<00:00:57.070> 9<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:57.820> then

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
firmware as HD 3.0 3.0 1.8 9 and then

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.130 
firmware as HD 3.0 3.0 1.8 9 and then
the<00:00:58.510> Wi-Fi<00:00:58.960> version<00:00:59.020> is<00:01:00.180> 3.2<00:01:01.200> dot<00:01:03.000> 3.1<00:01:04.000> 2<00:01:04.269> so

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
the Wi-Fi version is 3.2 dot 3.1 2 so

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.539 
the Wi-Fi version is 3.2 dot 3.1 2 so
with<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.409> most<00:01:05.590> current<00:01:05.860> firmware<00:01:06.220> on<00:01:06.520> the

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
with the most current firmware on the

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.630 
with the most current firmware on the
camera<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.060> by<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.270> way<00:01:07.450> I<00:01:07.479> confirm<00:01:07.990> that<00:01:08.640> by

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
camera and by the way I confirm that by

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.190 
camera and by the way I confirm that by
browsing<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.299> my<00:01:10.420> camera<00:01:10.720> I<00:01:10.780> use<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.960> Mac

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
browsing to my camera I use a Mac

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.859 
browsing to my camera I use a Mac
computer<00:01:11.380> so<00:01:11.920> I<00:01:11.979> went<00:01:12.220> into<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.750> the

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
computer so I went into the to the

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.740 
computer so I went into the to the
camera<00:01:14.200> when<00:01:14.290> I<00:01:14.409> plugged<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:14.799> in<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:16.330> there

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
camera when I plugged it in and there

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.719 
camera when I plugged it in and there
was<00:01:16.869> a<00:01:16.930> text<00:01:17.530> file<00:01:17.770> in<00:01:18.070> there<00:01:18.280> that<00:01:18.520> that

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
was a text file in there that that

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.510 
was a text file in there that that
displays<00:01:19.479> this<00:01:19.630> firmware<00:01:19.869> version<00:01:20.409> so<00:01:20.680> I'd

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
displays this firmware version so I'd

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.429 
displays this firmware version so I'd
already<00:01:21.850> contact<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.450> GoPro<00:01:22.810> tech<00:01:23.049> support

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
already contact the GoPro tech support

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.240 
already contact the GoPro tech support
on<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.619> phone<00:01:23.770> they<00:01:23.920> walked<00:01:24.100> me<00:01:24.220> through

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
on the phone they walked me through

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.969 
on the phone they walked me through
manually<00:01:24.939> updating<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.510> firmware<00:01:25.979> even

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
manually updating the firmware even

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.590 
manually updating the firmware even
though<00:01:27.070> I'd<00:01:27.220> automatically<00:01:28.119> updated<00:01:28.540> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
though I'd automatically updated the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.859 
though I'd automatically updated the
firmware<00:01:28.750> by<00:01:29.110> way<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.320> their<00:01:29.500> website<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:31.030> so

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
firmware by way of their website but so

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.060 
firmware by way of their website but so
now<00:01:31.990> we<00:01:32.049> know<00:01:32.259> we've<00:01:32.409> got<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.560> most<00:01:32.740> current

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
now we know we've got the most current

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.300 
now we know we've got the most current
firmware<00:01:33.340> on<00:01:33.549> here<00:01:33.670> but<00:01:33.850> what<00:01:34.000> happens<00:01:35.310> with

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
firmware on here but what happens with

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.859 
firmware on here but what happens with
the<00:01:36.430> camera<00:01:36.790> off<00:01:36.970> as<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.330> can<00:01:37.479> see<00:01:37.600> it's<00:01:37.750> not

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
the camera off as you can see it's not

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.969 
the camera off as you can see it's not
powered<00:01:38.259> on<00:01:38.939> when<00:01:39.939> I<00:01:39.970> plug<00:01:40.299> in<00:01:40.570> my<00:01:40.720> USB<00:01:40.979> cable

even after disconnecting the USB cable

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:43.069 
even after disconnecting the USB cable
if<00:02:34.859> I<00:02:35.040> try<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.340> power<00:02:35.609> it<00:02:35.879> on<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:42.450> camera<00:02:42.750> fails

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
if I try to power it on the camera fails

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.009 
if I try to power it on the camera fails
to<00:02:43.290> power<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.099> light<00:02:44.849> stays<00:02:45.180> illuminated

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
to power on the light stays illuminated

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.379 
to power on the light stays illuminated
and<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.639> only<00:02:47.639> way<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.819> get<00:02:48.030> rid<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.269> that

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
and the only way to get rid of that

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:58.849 
and the only way to get rid of that
light<00:02:48.599> is<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.260> remove<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.250> battery<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:57.859> then

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
light is to remove the battery and then

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:07.830 
light is to remove the battery and then
reseat<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.489> battery

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.140 

now<00:03:08.410> if<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.680> turn<00:03:08.739> the<00:03:09.010> camera<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:12.700> turns<00:03:12.940> on

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
now if I turn the camera it turns on

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.500 
now if I turn the camera it turns on
fine<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:13.690> that's<00:03:13.750> because<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.140> didn't<00:03:15.239> plug<00:03:16.239> in

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
fine but that's because I didn't plug in

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.470 
fine but that's because I didn't plug in
the<00:03:16.810> USB<00:03:17.410> cable<00:03:17.950> before<00:03:18.670> attempting<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.330> turn

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
it down but curiously enough with the

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:32.759 
it down but curiously enough with the
Cameroon<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:24.730> I<00:03:24.940> plug<00:03:25.180> in<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.390> USB<00:03:25.569> cable<00:03:31.769> it

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
Cameroon if I plug in the USB cable it

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.000 
Cameroon if I plug in the USB cable it
starts<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.310> charge<00:03:34.230> but<00:03:35.230> it<00:03:35.349> does<00:03:35.530> not<00:03:35.680> lock

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
starts to charge but it does not lock

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.930 
starts to charge but it does not lock
anything<00:03:36.550> up<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:38.340> there's<00:03:39.340> something<00:03:39.670> really
