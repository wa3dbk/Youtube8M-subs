test of the internal recording of the
zoom<00:02:40.330> h1<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:41.230> then<00:02:41.860> next<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.970> will<00:02:43.060> be<00:02:43.390> doing<00:02:43.569> a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
zoom h1 and then next I will be doing a

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.100 
zoom h1 and then next I will be doing a
test<00:02:44.170> using<00:02:45.069> this<00:02:45.280> secant<00:02:45.790> cable<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.599> an

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
test using this secant cable and an

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.550 
test using this secant cable and an
extension<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:49.120> plug<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:49.780> off-camera<00:02:50.410> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
extension to plug it in off-camera and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.650 
extension to plug it in off-camera and
but<00:02:53.560> still<00:02:53.920> be<00:02:54.069> using<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.670> zoom<00:02:55.120> as<00:02:55.330> an

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
but still be using the zoom as an

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.949 
but still be using the zoom as an
external<00:02:57.180> preamp<00:02:59.280> so<00:03:00.280> here's<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:00.940> test<00:03:01.269> check

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
external preamp so here's a test check

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.670 
external preamp so here's a test check
check<00:03:02.290> one<00:03:02.650> two<00:03:02.920> check<00:03:03.340> check<00:03:03.790> one<00:03:04.420> two<00:03:04.680> and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
check one two check check one two and

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.790 
check one two check check one two and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
the zoom h1 plugged with this secant

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.350 
the zoom h1 plugged with this secant
cable<00:03:25.720> straight<00:03:26.720> into<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.680> Nikon<00:03:28.040> d610<00:03:28.610> the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
cable straight into the Nikon d610 the

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.200 
cable straight into the Nikon d610 the
d610<00:03:29.960> is<00:03:30.230> set<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:31.180> one<00:03:32.180> notch<00:03:32.780> above<00:03:33.050> zero<00:03:34.210> so

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.210 
d610 is set to one notch above zero so

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.260 
d610 is set to one notch above zero so
set<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.570> one<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.110> then<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:37.190> level<00:03:37.430> input<00:03:38.030> of

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
set to one and then the level input of

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.590 
set to one and then the level input of
the<00:03:38.600> zoom<00:03:38.840> h1<00:03:39.020> is<00:03:39.470> set<00:03:39.710> to<00:03:39.980> 25<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.090> output

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
the zoom h1 is set to 25 and the output

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.660 
the zoom h1 is set to 25 and the output
is<00:03:41.810> set<00:03:42.170> to<00:03:42.470> volume<00:03:43.160> 90<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.950> might<00:03:46.160> produce<00:03:46.430> a

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
is set to volume 90 that might produce a

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.570 
is set to volume 90 that might produce a
little<00:03:46.820> bit<00:03:46.940> noise<00:03:47.210> with<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.690> output<00:03:48.580> preamps

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
little bit noise with the output preamps

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.260 
little bit noise with the output preamps
of<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.510> zoom<00:03:50.720> h1<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.860> little<00:03:52.700> bit<00:03:52.790> skeptical

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
of the zoom h1 so a little bit skeptical

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.360 
of the zoom h1 so a little bit skeptical
of<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:55.450> but<00:03:56.450> anyways<00:03:57.170> here's<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.500> test<00:03:57.740> check

of that but anyways here's a test check

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.450 
of that but anyways here's a test check
check<00:03:58.670> one<00:03:58.910> two<00:03:59.090> check<00:03:59.240> check<00:03:59.600> one<00:04:00.140> two<00:04:00.460> and
