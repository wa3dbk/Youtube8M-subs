00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
America and what looked to be Hawkeye

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.540 
America and what looked to be Hawkeye
who<00:02:24.030> actually<00:02:24.300> has<00:02:24.750> wings<00:02:25.110> now<00:02:25.550> they're

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
who actually has wings now they're

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.830 
who actually has wings now they're
actually<00:02:26.730> trying<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.120> stop<00:02:27.330> these<00:02:27.450> people

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840

that<00:02:27.930> are<00:02:28.050> stealing<00:02:28.440> some<00:02:28.590> gems<00:02:28.980> now<00:02:29.910> I

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
that are stealing some gems now I

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.460 
that are stealing some gems now I
actually<00:02:30.420> thought<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.870> these<00:02:31.170> could<00:02:31.410> have

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
actually thought that these could have

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.230 
actually thought that these could have
been<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.770> Infinity<00:02:32.280> stones<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.820> infinity

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
been the Infinity stones the infinity

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.000 
been the Infinity stones the infinity
gems<00:02:33.510> but<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.110> remembered<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.590> they

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
gems but then I remembered that they

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.040 
gems but then I remembered that they
were<00:02:35.190> actually<00:02:35.370> destroyed<00:02:36.090> when<00:02:36.390> 6-1-6

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
were actually destroyed when 6-1-6

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.110 
were actually destroyed when 6-1-6
Captain<00:02:37.410> America<00:02:37.800> was<00:02:38.280> preventing<00:02:38.970> an

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
Captain America was preventing an

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.480 
Captain America was preventing an
incursion<00:02:39.750> from<00:02:39.960> happening<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:41.100> Infinity

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
incursion from happening so the Infinity

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.520 
incursion from happening so the Infinity
stones<00:02:41.760> no<00:02:42.240> longer<00:02:42.570> exist<00:02:42.930> they<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.320> been

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
stones no longer exist they have been

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.490 
stones no longer exist they have been
broken<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:45.180> kind<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.570> rules<00:02:45.840> them<00:02:46.110> out<00:02:46.290> so

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
broken so that kind of rules them out so

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
you get like the sense that the Iron Man

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.900 
you get like the sense that the Iron Man
is<00:03:00.150> very<00:03:00.990> similar<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.620> our<00:03:02.100> Iron<00:03:02.640> Man<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:02.880> know

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
is very similar to our Iron Man you know

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.430 
is very similar to our Iron Man you know
Tony<00:03:03.270> Stark<00:03:03.600> he's<00:03:03.750> got<00:03:03.900> kind<00:03:04.050> of<00:03:04.170> like<00:03:04.290> that

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
Tony Stark he's got kind of like that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.800 
Tony Stark he's got kind of like that
cocky<00:03:04.980> attitude<00:03:05.220> as<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.270> could<00:03:06.390> see<00:03:06.570> here<00:03:06.720> he

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
cocky attitude as you could see here he

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.810 
cocky attitude as you could see here he
also<00:03:06.960> says<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.350> oh<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:08.070> takes<00:03:08.340> his<00:03:08.520> for

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
also says that oh it takes his for

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.610 
also says that oh it takes his for
accurate<00:03:09.450> shots<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:10.020> take<00:03:10.260> down<00:03:10.440> these

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
accurate shots to take down these

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.230 
accurate shots to take down these
enemies<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.610> just<00:03:11.790> seems<00:03:11.940> something

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
enemies and that just seems something

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.390 
enemies and that just seems something
like<00:03:12.420> Tony<00:03:12.930> Stark<00:03:13.230> would<00:03:13.470> say<00:03:13.680> now<00:03:13.890> obviously

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
like Tony Stark would say now obviously

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.700 
like Tony Stark would say now obviously
this<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.000> not<00:03:15.180> Tony<00:03:15.660> Stark<00:03:16.050> in<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.410> Iron<00:03:16.560> Man

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
this is not Tony Stark in the Iron Man

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.500 
this is not Tony Stark in the Iron Man
suit<00:03:16.770> so<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.220> wonder<00:03:17.580> who<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.850> could<00:03:18.030> be<00:03:18.060> from

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
suit so I wonder who it could be from

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.140 
suit so I wonder who it could be from
west<00:03:19.080> in<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.410> year<00:03:19.500> 2099<00:03:20.070> Iron<00:03:20.670> Man<00:03:21.000> is

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
west in the year 2099 Iron Man is

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.510 
west in the year 2099 Iron Man is
actually<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.960> robot<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.770> he's<00:03:22.890> not<00:03:23.040> actually<00:03:23.490> a

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
actually a robot and he's not actually a

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.620 
actually a robot and he's not actually a
man<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.120> suit

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
man in a suit

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.960 
man in a suit
that'd<00:03:25.050> be<00:03:25.080> interesting<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.620> see<00:03:25.800> but<00:03:26.310> as<00:03:26.700> we

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
that'd be interesting to see but as we

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.490 
that'd be interesting to see but as we
got<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.210> a<00:03:27.240> little<00:03:27.480> bit<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> surprise<00:03:27.960> here

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
got like a little bit of a surprise here

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.590 
got like a little bit of a surprise here
Captain<00:03:29.370> America<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:29.970> 2099<00:03:30.570> universe

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
Captain America of the 2099 universe

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.860 
Captain America of the 2099 universe
also<00:03:31.260> has<00:03:31.680> like<00:03:31.860> these<00:03:32.040> Hawkeye<00:03:32.850> wings<00:03:33.270> that

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
also has like these Hawkeye wings that

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.990 
also has like these Hawkeye wings that
she<00:03:34.020> can<00:03:34.170> kind<00:03:34.380> of<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.620> use<00:03:34.920> as<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.220> guess<00:03:35.820> is

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
she can kind of just use as I guess is

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.860 
she can kind of just use as I guess is
an<00:03:36.090> emergency<00:03:36.870> procedure<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.920> stop<00:03:38.190> her<00:03:38.310> from

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
an emergency procedure to stop her from

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.470 
an emergency procedure to stop her from
situations<00:03:39.870> like<00:03:40.080> this<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.680> suppose<00:03:41.070> but<00:03:41.670> what

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
situations like this I suppose but what

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.000 
situations like this I suppose but what
I<00:03:42.510> really<00:03:42.780> love<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.080> actually<00:03:43.440> also<00:03:43.620> has

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
I really love this actually also has

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.630 
I really love this actually also has
like<00:03:44.190> this<00:03:44.660> extreme<00:03:45.660> similarity<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.830> Captain

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
like this extreme similarity to Captain

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.390 
like this extreme similarity to Captain
Steve<00:03:47.880> Rogers<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.570> our<00:03:48.810> universe<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.770> our<00:03:49.980> time

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
Steve Rogers of our universe of our time

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.460 
Steve Rogers of our universe of our time
and<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:51.000> think<00:03:51.360> that's<00:03:51.480> brilliant<00:03:51.600> because<00:03:51.870> it

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
and I think that's brilliant because it

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.470 
and I think that's brilliant because it
just<00:03:52.590> kind<00:03:52.860> of<00:03:52.920> shows<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.520> is<00:03:53.700> kind<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.270> the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
just kind of shows that is kind of the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.800 
just kind of shows that is kind of the
Captain<00:03:55.320> America<00:03:55.380> role<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.880> makes<00:03:57.540> these

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
Captain America role that makes these

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.830 
Captain America role that makes these
characters<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:58.560> noble<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.420> caring<00:04:00.420> mr.<00:04:00.690> fire

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
bar of the year 2099 and we find out

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.790 
bar of the year 2099 and we find out
that<00:06:01.270> he's<00:06:01.510> been<00:06:01.540> drinking<00:06:02.170> quite<00:06:02.350> a<00:06:02.470> lot

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
that he's been drinking quite a lot

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.700 
that he's been drinking quite a lot
because<00:06:03.160> his<00:06:03.730> family<00:06:04.270> or<00:06:04.510> some<00:06:05.110> children

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.230 
thought of the Avengers like of the year
2099<00:06:53.260> I<00:06:53.380> mean<00:06:53.650> there<00:06:54.520> are<00:06:54.550> think<00:06:54.880> they<00:06:54.970> lived

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
2099 I mean there are think they lived

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.700 
2099 I mean there are think they lived

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
up to the name a bit but I think that

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.860 
up to the name a bit but I think that
they've<00:06:56.830> still<00:06:57.100> got<00:06:57.220> a<00:06:57.250> little<00:06:57.520> bit<00:06:57.640> of

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
they've still got a little bit of

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.550 
they've still got a little bit of
learning<00:06:58.870> to<00:06:58.990> do<00:06:59.110> I<00:06:59.140> think<00:06:59.260> they're<00:06:59.470> gonna

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
learning to do I think they're gonna
