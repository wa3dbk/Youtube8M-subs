00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.880
 who can do too much magic 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
 percent 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.900
 it does not have to be disinclined at the moment that will not be enough 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.380

 Here also appropriate slight delays too 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.390
 then you have the Volksbank 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.940
 there is the work of these stripes 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.940
 two variants once with Dr 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.229
 Reichenau 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.720

 the investigators go 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.510
 whether to go with the store where 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.730

 that's almost everything 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.880

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.340
 variants 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.550
 there is once the variant with the cooks Abbitte I show you now 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.659
 the diversity has been massively expanded 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.079
 and 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.579

 but Montreal is missing 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.310
 so now for the outsider, exemplary here along 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.139
 Nevertheless, Poss said 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.309

 do under master gt in the network 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.139
 about the added value again 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.919

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:25.379
 Zuvo that does not work now of course because I'm here 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.379

 both can be cited now 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:40.279
