our<00:00:02.020> research<00:00:02.620> focuses<00:00:03.160> on<00:00:03.550> marine<00:00:04.180> sponges

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:05.579 
our research focuses on marine sponges

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:08.850 
our research focuses on marine sponges
we<00:00:06.579> chose<00:00:06.910> marine<00:00:07.839> sponges<00:00:08.380> because<00:00:08.620> they

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
we chose marine sponges because they

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.050 
we chose marine sponges because they
produce<00:00:09.430> an<00:00:10.240> incredible<00:00:10.990> array<00:00:11.170> of<00:00:12.060> chemical

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.060 
produce an incredible array of chemical

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.380 
produce an incredible array of chemical
compounds<00:00:13.840> and<00:00:13.960> we<00:00:14.050> hope<00:00:14.980> these<00:00:15.610> might<00:00:16.090> be

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
compounds and we hope these might be

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.040 
compounds and we hope these might be
eventually<00:00:17.429> developed<00:00:18.749> into<00:00:19.749> new

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
eventually developed into new

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:29.460 
eventually developed into new
anti-cancer<00:00:20.679> drugs

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.480 

why<00:01:04.059> are<00:01:04.120> we<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:04.720> interested<00:01:04.989> in<00:01:05.650> sponges

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
why are we so interested in sponges

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.040 
why are we so interested in sponges
well<00:01:07.260> sponges<00:01:08.260> are<00:01:08.440> sessile<00:01:09.210> organisms<00:01:10.210> which

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
well sponges are sessile organisms which

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.140 
well sponges are sessile organisms which
means<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.560> they<00:01:11.680> cannot<00:01:12.010> move<00:01:12.280> they<00:01:12.790> are<00:01:12.970> not

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
means that they cannot move they are not

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.750 
means that they cannot move they are not
able<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.540> escape<00:01:14.140> predators<00:01:14.590> for<00:01:15.340> instance

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
able to escape predators for instance

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.810 
able to escape predators for instance
and<00:01:16.060> there<00:01:17.050> are<00:01:17.110> filter<00:01:17.530> feeders<00:01:17.560> it<00:01:18.490> means

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
and there are filter feeders it means

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.230 
and there are filter feeders it means
that<00:01:19.180> they<00:01:19.450> feed<00:01:20.080> on<00:01:20.940> suspended<00:01:21.940> food

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
that they feed on suspended food

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.790 
that they feed on suspended food
suspended<00:01:23.140> particles<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.040> particles<00:01:24.970> maybe

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
suspended particles and particles maybe

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.420 
suspended particles and particles maybe
bacteria<00:01:26.800> viruses<00:01:27.640> even<00:01:28.300> pathogenic<00:01:28.930> ones<00:01:29.430> so

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
bacteria viruses even pathogenic ones so

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.300 
bacteria viruses even pathogenic ones so
these<00:01:30.729> organisms<00:01:31.360> have<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.500> defend

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
these organisms have to defend

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.540 
these organisms have to defend
themselves<00:01:33.810> from<00:01:34.810> predators<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.710> from

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
themselves from predators and from

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.740 
themselves from predators and from
potential<00:01:37.240> pathogens<00:01:37.890> how<00:01:38.890> do<00:01:38.950> they<00:01:39.340> do<00:01:39.750> they

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
potential pathogens how do they do they

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.040 
potential pathogens how do they do they
have<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.080> vast<00:01:41.440> array<00:01:41.649> of<00:01:42.160> weapons<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:43.050> many

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
have a vast array of weapons and many

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.790 
have a vast array of weapons and many
are<00:01:44.380> chemically<00:01:45.160> based<00:01:45.690> that's<00:01:46.690> why<00:01:46.990> when<00:01:47.680> we

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
are chemically based that's why when we

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.130 
are chemically based that's why when we
look<00:01:47.979> for<00:01:48.190> new<00:01:48.250> compounds<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.630> might<00:01:49.899> be

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
look for new compounds that might be

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.670 
look for new compounds that might be
useful<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:51.070> fight<00:01:51.720> diseases<00:01:53.220> cancer<00:01:54.220> or<00:01:54.460> other

useful to fight diseases cancer or other
sicknesses<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.880> do<00:01:58.119> look<00:01:58.390> for<00:01:58.930> sponges<00:02:01.020> there

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
sicknesses we do look for sponges there

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.260 
sicknesses we do look for sponges there
are<00:02:02.140> really<00:02:02.470> many<00:02:03.009> different<00:02:03.610> species<00:02:03.910> of

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
are really many different species of

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.479 
are really many different species of
sponges<00:02:04.929> and<00:02:05.640> each<00:02:06.640> may<00:02:07.150> produce<00:02:07.769> the<00:02:08.769> drug<00:02:09.130> we

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
sponges and each may produce the drug we

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.310 
sponges and each may produce the drug we
look<00:02:09.700> for<00:02:11.489> sampling<00:02:12.489> sponges<00:02:13.269> for<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.049> kind

you<00:02:21.579> need<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.970> be<00:02:22.180> quite<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.079> good<00:02:23.320> diver<00:02:23.590> of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
you need to be quite a good diver of

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.740 
you need to be quite a good diver of
course<00:02:24.549> and<00:02:25.410> then<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.709> need<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.760> know<00:02:28.360> about

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
course and then you need to know about

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.390 
course and then you need to know about
sponges<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.390> recognize<00:02:31.780> them<00:02:32.560> to

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
sponges you have to recognize them to

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.160 
sponges you have to recognize them to
understand<00:02:33.790> whether<00:02:34.060> you're<00:02:34.360> ready<00:02:34.600> sample

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
understand whether you're ready sample

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.819 
understand whether you're ready sample
some<00:02:35.799> sponges<00:02:36.340> or<00:02:36.489> not<00:02:37.019> you<00:02:38.019> do<00:02:38.170> not<00:02:38.290> want<00:02:38.620> to

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
some sponges or not you do not want to

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.470 
some sponges or not you do not want to
over<00:02:39.100> exploit<00:02:39.579> the<00:02:40.030> marine<00:02:40.299> environment

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
over exploit the marine environment

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.310 
over exploit the marine environment
that's<00:02:41.350> why<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.680> always<00:02:42.220> leave<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:43.000> good<00:02:43.989> part

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
that's why you always leave a good part

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.650 
that's why you always leave a good part
of<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.620> sponge<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:45.100> touch<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:48.360> also<00:02:49.360> you
