00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 It's personal, it's okay. 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.629
 hard news and welcome to another 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.880
 video not today because the color but the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.410
 justice has 50 is a source with 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.210
 certified try bronze 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.219
 we can be your next choice 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.549
 Cost Benefit Do not Quit Find Out 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.549
 because 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.020
 talking here by your house answered 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.060
 cooler master sends this source 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.190
 cardboard box that describes a 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.989
 space product point is with per 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.600
 example its power certificates 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.910
 bronze five year warranty and its lightning 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.309
 long power with up to 60 skin 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.080
 then of course your support to process 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.140
 s / n which forces your account have at 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.910
 least four psyche press connections 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.190
 It's on the side of the box, we'll have 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.550
 detailed all of her cables not you 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.770
 have a connection is ps4 the main 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.989
 teams of the new f-1 connection e-sata three 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.110
 connections and one for the cup is 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.540
 connector of the 24-pin connector on the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.090
 behind the house not to be detailed all 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.550
 its power is because if it continues from 60 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.100
 lock peak or peak power 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.700
 its division of labor is not 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.500
 power is up to 720 more or 60 skin 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.420
 12 one because it is a source 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.220
 cost-effective approach will not 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.229
 find a lot inside a can 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.780
 but will have to have your screws for the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.060
 manual installation lin 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.780
 the power cord is already in the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.429
 Brazilian and of course the source 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.429
 plus a warranty certificate 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.940
 speaking now teaches at source and can 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.679
 perceive the entire metal and this comes 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.569
 black finish 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.789
 is an ounce that does not exaggerate 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.610
 dimensions and therefore has its part 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:02:01.360
 greater than 90 11 and 12 'which will 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:04.119
 50 in that part that will appear 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.580
 in his office and across the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:12.280
 power ratio on the bridge is the same as 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:14.590
 that we saw in the box in 2012 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.120
 furthermore, our backside is 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.550
 only the power lead and one 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.470
 keys linked to the bridge 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.480
 besides all cars only consume 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.900
 well dimensioned in length 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.819
 ranging from 50 to 75 cm which 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.920
 also allows this source to accommodate 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.940
 even in front offices and without the least 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.319
 problem 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.480
 Another interesting factor is that all 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.640
 cables afonso covered by this mark 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.800
 not as fair as some other sources 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.800
 but it provides protection for the 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.060
 compared to us it is from here that the new 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:51.939
 2011 platform is the core i7 39 attack 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.829
 together with two red bulls 92 90 in 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.859
 that parents have a configuration already 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.970
 pulled around 1 600 and 700 but 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.519
 we see how the source of 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.530
 information behaves for our 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.379
 success will run that game angry two 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.659
 nor as the excess of 9 to 4 with five 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.400
 agents that the two regions in the 90 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.099
 also a counting package sent more 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.450
 I was risking a country where I'm going to 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:20.530
 infinity 5.760 per 6 84 x 20 they in 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.239
 all game settings at most 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.310
 in addition at the table that we can see 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.010
 the vate showing me current consumption in 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.799
 kills and a voltmeter connected at 12 volts 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.030
 her here is now counting 11.98 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.919
 volts 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.280
 so let's see how it behaves in the 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.280
 team 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.880
 the staff then this is it things 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.190
 never again on the test street 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.830
 quietly, with average feet 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.590
 87 is that it is a very high rate for this 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.570
 solution for the weight of this game and consumption 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.880
 external or that is the matine consumption 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:39.110
 ranging from 780 800 to a peak of 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.870
 900 neighborhood 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.470
 considering efficiency 80 the grogs 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.850
 this source with 156 votes it is even 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.370
 to two goals also did not vary much 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.980
 very important was in the house of the 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.880
 12 2 points 0 5 point that is very good 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.740
 also 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.840
 the staff with that there we because afonso 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.550
 with the masters of this success really 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.290
 keep what promises a lot 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.760
 quietly in your setup 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.680
 this is a source with excellent 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.500
 cost-benefit she suffered working 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.040
 there is between 300 and 400 reais in 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.980
 doubt 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.870
 good price a source of this caliber 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.550
 the staff, that's it, you liked it 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.440
 our video click you are in our 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.030
 channel the company does not know that I'm going 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.550
 post the full review of the photos as well 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.060
 That's until the next video a hug 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.060
 went
