00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.490
 smartphone on his cell phone with 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.619
 playstation 4 for this are due 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.470
 ensure they have an ipod iphone or 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.840
 ipad or any apple device or 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.850
 some android since there is only one 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.650
 official application of playstation 4 for 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.270
 these devices now good what is it 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.730
 that we are going to do the first thing we have 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.070
 what to do is on our tablet or our 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.859
 iphone ipod ipad whatever we have to 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.579
 look for the playstation application here 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.469
 on iphone ipod ipad is in the app store 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.499
 but if they have an android then it's going to 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.630
 be the application I say sorry the google 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:49.170
 play then here we're going to look 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.170
 leinster 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.520
 sad 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.140
 we have station to the we go down since 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.870
 we have it here we have to make sure 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.930
 first before anything else that both our 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.700
 device like the playstation 4 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.830
 they need to be connected in the same 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.630
 network is not done in other words if you 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.119
 are connecting by wifi that both 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.190
 are connected in the same wifi that 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.350
 by the way the playstation 4 I would 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.450
 I recommend that you do not connect it via wifi 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.640
 because they're going to have it in the games of 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.710
 multiplayer as well as small gay guy 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.710

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.780

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.010

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.510

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.460
 our mind gives us the play station 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.430

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.130

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.440

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.020

 they have to click like this 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.749
 and they will ask for a number there is hungry 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.900
 but is that what good number are we going to 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:23.999
 go here in the play to setup 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.030

 what to put here on our device 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.050

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.480
 use the keyboard here of our 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.060
 device in the peit then by 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.400
