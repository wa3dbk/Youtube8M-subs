I<00:00:04.879> when<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:05.940> was<00:00:06.000> doing<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.270> review<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.750> was

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
I when I was doing the review I was

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.629 
I when I was doing the review I was
talking<00:00:07.440> about<00:00:07.649> how<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.950> canes<00:00:08.250> seen<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> thing

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
talking about how the canes seen a thing

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.919 
talking about how the canes seen a thing
was<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.880> complete<00:00:09.000> waste<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.450> time<00:00:09.630> at<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.840> end

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
was a complete waste of time at the end

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.629 
was a complete waste of time at the end
and<00:00:10.290> at<00:00:10.830> least<00:00:10.950> it's<00:00:11.160> better<00:00:11.280> than<00:00:11.400> running

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
and at least it's better than running

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.860 
and at least it's better than running
another<00:00:11.880> commercial<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.509> then<00:00:12.660> they<00:00:12.780> went

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
another commercial and then they went

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.999 
another commercial and then they went
right<00:00:13.080> into<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.290> commercial<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> rock

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
which was a five minute time waster so I

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.390

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.210 
cared about three brothers yeah 3
announcers<00:01:36.689> which<00:01:37.079> will<00:01:37.439> probably<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.070> into

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
announcers which will probably get into

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.520 
announcers which will probably get into
that<00:01:38.400> later<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.600> expecting<00:01:39.930> Brodus<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that later but I was expecting Brodus to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
that later but I was expecting Brodus to
have<00:01:40.650> some<00:01:40.829> sort<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.250> major<00:01:41.520> spot<00:01:41.939> in

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
have some sort of you know major spot in

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.999 
have some sort of you know major spot in
the<00:01:42.150> rumble<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.750> didn't<00:01:43.200> happen<00:01:43.320> that

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the rumble and that didn't happen that

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.160 
the rumble and that didn't happen that
was<00:01:44.220> very<00:01:44.250> disappointing<00:01:45.090> well<00:01:45.720> supposedly

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
was very disappointing well supposedly

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.510 
was very disappointing well supposedly
one<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> reasons<00:01:46.890> why<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.189> didn't<00:01:47.430> do

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
one of the reasons why they didn't do

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.910 
one of the reasons why they didn't do
that<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.909> because<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:48.479> thought<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.380> he

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that is because they thought that he

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.350 
that is because they thought that he
would<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.189> lost<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> shuffle<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.210> Royal

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
would get lost in the shuffle the Royal

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.300 
would get lost in the shuffle the Royal
Rumble<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.530> kind<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.829> see<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.220> at

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
Rumble and I can kind of see that but at

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.800 
Rumble and I can kind of see that but at
the<00:01:53.369> same<00:01:53.520> time<00:01:53.729> they<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> ability<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the same time they have the ability to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.630 
the same time they have the ability to
book<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.290> Royal<00:01:55.439> Rumble<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.040> they<00:01:56.280> could<00:01:56.490> make

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
book the Royal Rumble so they could make

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.660 
book the Royal Rumble so they could make
it<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.000> he<00:01:57.119> doesn't<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.540> lost<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it so he doesn't get lost in it so I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.170 
it so he doesn't get lost in it so I
don't<00:01:59.880> know<00:02:00.149> why<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.299> kind<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:02.670> logic

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
don't know why that kind of a that logic

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.560 
don't know why that kind of a that logic
sort<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.700> thought<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.790> goes<00:02:06.000> beyond<00:02:06.299> me<00:02:06.540> but

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
sort of thought it goes beyond me but

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.869 
sort of thought it goes beyond me but
especially<00:02:07.020> when<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.530> use<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.489> in

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
especially when you use like you know in

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.600 
especially when you use like you know in
it<00:02:09.360> ooh<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> Jinder<00:02:10.619> Mahal<00:02:10.649> or<00:02:11.250> somebody

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
it ooh so or a Jinder Mahal or somebody

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.080 
it ooh so or a Jinder Mahal or somebody
like<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.270> same

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
like that and the same

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.369 
like that and the same
mohu<00:02:14.090> people<00:02:14.390> already<00:02:14.750> don't<00:02:14.959> really<00:02:15.170> care

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
mohu people already don't really care

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.729 
mohu people already don't really care

Jesse James he had that name because he

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.210

Royal<00:02:59.959> Rumble<00:03:00.230> he<00:03:00.410> was<00:03:00.620> still<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.790> roadie

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030

Jesse<00:03:02.540> James<00:03:02.780> wasn't<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.170> roadog<00:03:03.470> yet<00:03:03.769> so

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
Jesse James wasn't the roadog yet so

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.539 
Jesse James wasn't the roadog yet so
something<00:03:05.180> around<00:03:05.329> 96<00:03:06.250> but<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:07.280> thought<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.489> was

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
something around 96 but I thought it was

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.680 
something around 96 but I thought it was
pretty<00:03:07.730> interesting<00:03:07.940> because<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.420> was<00:03:08.540> like

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
pretty interesting because it was like

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.490 
pretty interesting because it was like
the<00:03:09.379> Road<00:03:09.530> Dogg<00:03:09.560> had<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.810> silly<00:03:11.810> gimmick<00:03:12.140> of

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
the Road Dogg had this silly gimmick of

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.259 
the Road Dogg had this silly gimmick of
being<00:03:13.040> like<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.540> dancer<00:03:14.540> singer<00:03:14.989> showman<00:03:15.500> and

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
being like a dancer singer showman and

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.699 
being like a dancer singer showman and
that<00:03:17.269> didn't<00:03:17.630> get<00:03:17.690> him<00:03:17.810> anywhere<00:03:18.079> and<00:03:18.410> then<00:03:18.590> he

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
that didn't get him anywhere and then he

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.979 
that didn't get him anywhere and then he
switched<00:03:18.920> him<00:03:19.160> over<00:03:19.310> a<00:03:19.370> serious<00:03:19.880> thing<00:03:20.180> with

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
switched him over a serious thing with

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.009 
switched him over a serious thing with
