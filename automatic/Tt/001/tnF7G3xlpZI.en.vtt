00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
everything so for that leaked card

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.350 
everything so for that leaked card
Autobot<00:01:57.509> symbol<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.079> yeah<00:01:58.290> here<00:01:58.500> he<00:01:58.560> is

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
Autobot symbol so yeah here he is

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.609 
Autobot symbol so yeah here he is
looking<00:02:00.360> pretty<00:02:00.600> spiffy<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.799> um<00:02:03.020> but<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.469> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
looking pretty spiffy so um but this is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.200 
looking pretty spiffy so um but this is
how<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.799> display<00:02:05.130> him<00:02:05.310> usually<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.880> standing

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
how I display him usually just standing

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.570 
how I display him usually just standing
but<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.750> want<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.500> display<00:02:07.799> more<00:02:08.069> radical

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
but if you want to display more radical

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.750 
but if you want to display more radical
poses<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.520> rotate<00:02:11.849> his<00:02:12.420> joint<00:02:13.020> Diaz

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
poses you can rotate his joint Diaz

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.990 
poses you can rotate his joint Diaz
a double<00:02:14.239> hinge<00:02:14.390> joint<00:02:15.220> at<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.250> knee<00:02:16.489> and<00:02:16.879> you

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
a double hinge joint at the knee and you

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.460 
a double hinge joint at the knee and you
can<00:02:17.150> rotate<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.629> around<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.260> like<00:02:18.379> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
can rotate it around so it's like the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.979 
can rotate it around so it's like the
standard<00:02:19.000> transformation<00:02:20.000> into<00:02:20.420> his<00:02:20.599> robot

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
standard transformation into his robot

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.990 
standard transformation into his robot
mode<00:02:21.019> where<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.040> wheel<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:22.430> hanging<00:02:22.790> off

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
mode where the wheel is just hanging off

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.550 
mode where the wheel is just hanging off
from<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.299> side<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.810> he<00:02:23.900> has<00:02:23.989> all<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.260> junk

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
from the side and he has all that junk

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.569 
from the side and he has all that junk
but<00:02:25.340> um<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.299> then<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:26.840> allows<00:02:27.079> a<00:02:27.319> bend<00:02:27.709> because

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
but um and then it allows a bend because

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.280 
but um and then it allows a bend because
the<00:02:28.760> other<00:02:28.909> he<00:02:29.659> right<00:02:29.750> here<00:02:29.959> he<00:02:30.079> doesn't

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the other he right here he doesn't

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.319 
the other he right here he doesn't
really<00:02:30.379> Bend<00:02:30.739> at<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.159> because<00:02:31.430> like<00:02:31.819> because

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
really Bend at all because like because

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.740 
really Bend at all because like because
all<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:33.079> wheel<00:02:33.260> junk<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.680> behind<00:02:34.099> his<00:02:34.370> leg

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
all that wheel junk is behind his leg

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.119 
all that wheel junk is behind his leg
instead<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:35.959> front<00:02:35.989> but<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.680> does<00:02:36.860> provide

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
instead of in front but it does provide

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.180 
instead of in front but it does provide
a<00:02:37.190> more<00:02:37.430> uniform<00:02:37.970> look<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.739> looks<00:02:39.739> more<00:02:39.980> like

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
a more uniform look and looks more like

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.640 
a more uniform look and looks more like
he<00:02:40.370> does<00:02:40.549> in<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:40.970> CG<00:02:41.269> model<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:41.900> that's<00:02:42.409> why<00:02:42.620> I

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
he does in the CG model so that's why I

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.490 
he does in the CG model so that's why I
keep<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.010> like<00:02:43.099> that<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:44.750> yeah<00:02:45.109> and<00:02:45.439> then<00:02:46.280> yeah

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
keep it like that but yeah and then yeah

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.899 
keep it like that but yeah and then yeah
it<00:02:48.500> was<00:02:48.680> really<00:02:49.099> fun<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.430> paint<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.819> but

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
it was really fun to paint it but

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.910 
it was really fun to paint it but
surprisingly<00:02:50.540> uh<00:02:50.629> I<00:02:51.109> forgot<00:02:51.409> to<00:02:51.500> do<00:02:51.620> blue

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
surprisingly uh I forgot to do blue

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.759 
surprisingly uh I forgot to do blue
accents<00:02:52.609> in<00:02:52.970> some<00:02:53.269> areas<00:02:53.569> because<00:02:53.690> he's<00:02:54.620> an

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
accents in some areas because he's an

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.119 
accents in some areas because he's an
autobot<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.459> yeah<00:02:55.670> but<00:02:56.209> um<00:02:56.420> this<00:02:57.170> chest<00:02:57.859> part

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
autobot so yeah but um this chest part

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.860 
autobot so yeah but um this chest part
was<00:02:58.370> really<00:02:58.639> fun<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.090> actually<00:02:59.389> build<00:02:59.629> because

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
was really fun to actually build because

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.800 
was really fun to actually build because
of<00:03:00.139> all<00:03:00.260> these<00:03:00.379> curves<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:01.299> just<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.480> just

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
of all these curves and just the just

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.410 
of all these curves and just the just
kind<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:04.159> visual<00:03:05.739> aspect<00:03:06.739> that<00:03:07.099> um<00:03:07.420> sorry

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
kind of the visual aspect that um sorry

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.629 
kind of the visual aspect that um sorry
visual<00:03:09.319> aspect<00:03:09.739> that<00:03:09.859> Transformers<00:03:10.370> Prime

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
visual aspect that Transformers Prime

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.869 
visual aspect that Transformers Prime
provides<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:12.139> definitely<00:03:12.620> widens<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.370> amount

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
provides it definitely widens the amount

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.759 
provides it definitely widens the amount
of<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:15.769> guess<00:03:16.340> like<00:03:17.139> CG<00:03:18.139> like<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.650> definitely

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
of I guess like CG like it definitely

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.750 
of I guess like CG like it definitely
don't<00:03:19.519> like<00:03:19.609> switches<00:03:20.060> of<00:03:20.180> CG<00:03:20.629> a<00:03:20.870> lot<00:03:21.169> and

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
don't like switches of CG a lot and

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.159 
don't like switches of CG a lot and
definitely<00:03:22.760> brings<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.359> more<00:03:24.069> natural<00:03:25.069> look<00:03:25.370> to

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
definitely brings a more natural look to

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.390 
definitely brings a more natural look to
computer-generated<00:03:27.169> graphics<00:03:27.919> as<00:03:28.099> opposed

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
computer-generated graphics as opposed

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.119 
computer-generated graphics as opposed
to<00:03:28.519> Beast<00:03:28.849> Wars<00:03:29.060> or<00:03:29.299> beast<00:03:29.510> machines<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.980> the

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
to Beast Wars or beast machines in the

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.009 
to Beast Wars or beast machines in the
Transformers<00:03:31.730> mythology<00:03:32.359> and<00:03:32.540> our<00:03:32.660> universe

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
Transformers mythology and our universe

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.309 
Transformers mythology and our universe
so<00:03:33.470> yeah<00:03:34.569> he<00:03:35.569> does<00:03:35.720> not<00:03:35.840> come<00:03:36.139> with<00:03:36.290> any

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
so yeah he does not come with any

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.979 
so yeah he does not come with any
accessories<00:03:36.919> he's<00:03:37.370> like<00:03:37.549> oh<00:03:37.699> no<00:03:38.000> I'm<00:03:38.419> unarmed

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
I was planning to make a phase shifter

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.110 
I was planning to make a phase shifter
but<00:03:41.629> I<00:03:41.660> just<00:03:41.870> never<00:03:42.019> got<00:03:42.139> around<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:43.120> yeah

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
but um yeah so basically this figure is

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.160 
but um yeah so basically this figure is
basically<00:04:31.160> built<00:04:31.490> off<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:32.630> first<00:04:32.930> edition

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
basically built off of the first edition

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.160 
basically built off of the first edition
version<00:04:33.920> I<00:04:34.100> have<00:04:34.520> no<00:04:34.940> idea<00:04:35.330> why<00:04:35.630> they<00:04:35.930> would

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
version I have no idea why they would

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.290 
version I have no idea why they would
not<00:04:36.200> just<00:04:37.040> keep<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.460> first<00:04:37.670> edition<00:04:38.090> mold

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
not just keep the first edition mold

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.750 
not just keep the first edition mold
from<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.170> waist<00:04:39.410> down<00:04:39.620> it's<00:04:40.130> pretty<00:04:40.310> much<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
from the waist down it's pretty much the

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.810 
from the waist down it's pretty much the
same<00:04:40.970> as<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.300> first<00:04:41.450> edition<00:04:41.990> mold<00:04:42.200> but<00:04:43.100> they

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
same as the first edition mold but they

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.160 
same as the first edition mold but they
just<00:04:44.030> switched<00:04:44.300> up<00:04:44.480> this<00:04:44.570> whole<00:04:44.780> upper

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
just switched up this whole upper

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.660 
just switched up this whole upper
section<00:04:45.590> which<00:04:45.740> makes<00:04:45.950> it<00:04:46.100> look<00:04:46.220> really<00:04:46.430> ugly

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
section which makes it look really ugly

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.120 
section which makes it look really ugly
and<00:04:47.110> bone<00:04:48.110> B<00:04:48.260> has<00:04:48.410> issues

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
and bone B has issues

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.390 
and bone B has issues
so<00:04:49.420> Bobby<00:04:50.420> is<00:04:50.570> now<00:04:50.810> shorter<00:04:51.380> than<00:04:51.800> smokescreen

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
so Bobby is now shorter than smokescreen

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.070 
so Bobby is now shorter than smokescreen
I<00:04:52.610> don't<00:04:52.820> think<00:04:53.120> that<00:04:53.360> is<00:04:53.540> correct<00:04:53.750> he's

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
I don't think that is correct he's

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.300 
I don't think that is correct he's
they're<00:04:54.350> supposed<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.650> be<00:04:54.740> like<00:04:54.890> around<00:04:55.010> the

they're supposed to be like around the

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.190 
they're supposed to be like around the
same<00:04:55.490> height<00:04:55.700> if<00:04:56.000> not<00:04:56.210> won't<00:04:56.690> be<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:56.900> little

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
same height if not won't be a little

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.060 
same height if not won't be a little
taller<00:04:58.840> but<00:04:59.840> yeah<00:05:00.080> this<00:05:00.290> this<00:05:00.680> was<00:05:00.860> just
