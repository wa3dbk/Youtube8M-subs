one's got a little bit little bit
different<00:01:24.750> receiver<00:01:25.909> and<00:01:26.909> then<00:01:27.030> what<00:01:27.149> you're

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
different receiver and then what you're

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.460 
different receiver and then what you're
normally<00:01:27.539> gonna<00:01:27.720> notice<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.200> I'll<00:01:28.259> show<00:01:28.440> you

normally gonna notice and I'll show you
that<00:01:28.710> when<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:30.110> it's<00:01:31.110> totally

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that when I get to that it's totally

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
that when I get to that it's totally
fine<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.770> most<00:01:33.200> planes<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.729> one

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
fine for most planes you know this one

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.160 
fine for most planes you know this one
has<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.090> lot<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> same<00:01:36.509> features<00:01:36.690> as<00:01:36.990> like

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
has a lot of the same features as like

you'll be able to tell it's gonna it's

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.059 
you'll be able to tell it's gonna it's
gonna<00:01:57.479> react<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.229> little<00:01:58.409> bit<00:01:58.500> different<00:01:58.890> so

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
gonna react a little bit different so

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:00.139 
gonna react a little bit different so
you've<00:01:59.159> got<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> warning<00:01:59.759> note<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.060> your

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
you've got a warning note that your

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.260 
you've got a warning note that your
plane<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.539> falls<00:02:01.020> from<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.289> sky<00:02:01.850> again<00:02:02.850> six

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
plane just falls from the sky again six

plane just falls from the sky again six
channels<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.830> said<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:08.360> looking<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.840> top

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
channels as I said so looking at the top

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.910 
channels as I said so looking at the top
of<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.259> box<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:11.450> I'll<00:02:12.450> flip<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.780> over

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
of the box here I'll flip it over

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.960 
of the box here I'll flip it over
manuals<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.470> pact<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.100> top<00:02:17.340> here<00:02:17.579> it's

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
manuals in the pact on the top here it's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.099 
manuals in the pact on the top here it's
actually<00:02:18.620> quite<00:02:19.620> thick<00:02:20.030> which<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.390> guess<00:02:21.959> is

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
actually quite thick which I guess is

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:28.130 
actually quite thick which I guess is
what<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.500> would<00:02:22.769> expect<00:02:22.859> with<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:27.140> controller

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
what I would expect with a controller

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.110 
what I would expect with a controller
this<00:02:28.350> complex<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.280> will<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:29.880> definitely

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
this complex I will be definitely

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.080 
this complex I will be definitely
spending<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.750> lot<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:30.989> time<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.440> this<00:02:31.910> on<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
spending a lot of time on this on the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.890 
spending a lot of time on this on the
simulator<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.739> hobby<00:02:35.100> store<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.840> spent<00:02:36.840> a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
simulator in the hobby store I spent a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.690 
simulator in the hobby store I spent a
lot<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.079> time<00:02:38.329> crashing<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.769> talked<00:02:41.670> a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
lot of time crashing so I talked a

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.050 
lot of time crashing so I talked a
little<00:02:41.820> bit<00:02:42.000> about<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.420> receiver<00:02:43.079> 2<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:44.060> what

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
little bit about the receiver 2 and what

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.680 
little bit about the receiver 2 and what
you've<00:02:45.180> got<00:02:45.390> here<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:47.060> spectrums<00:02:48.060> micro<00:02:48.480> light

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
you've got here is spectrums micro light

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
the receiver bends down like this a

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.350 
the receiver bends down like this a
little<00:05:04.070> bit<00:05:04.310> which<00:05:04.580> makes<00:05:04.850> moving<00:05:05.090> it<00:05:05.270> around

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
little bit which makes moving it around

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.650 
little bit which makes moving it around
or<00:05:05.810> packing<00:05:06.350> it<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.590> lot<00:05:06.830> easier

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
or packing it a lot easier

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.460 
or packing it a lot easier
other<00:05:09.169> features<00:05:10.330> again<00:05:11.330> so<00:05:11.600> it<00:05:11.750> runs<00:05:11.990> on<00:05:12.169> six

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
other features again so it runs on six

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.010 
other features again so it runs on six

so<00:05:15.200> with<00:05:15.320> six<00:05:15.530> channels<00:05:15.830> you<00:05:16.070> can<00:05:16.250> pretty<00:05:16.700> much

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
so with six channels you can pretty much

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.420 
so with six channels you can pretty much
fly<00:05:17.150> most<00:05:18.100> anything<00:05:19.100> that<00:05:19.220> you<00:05:19.280> would
