 the end 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.790
 we have not been there with the previous one 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.769
 intensity played during the day 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.049
 we were both in front and in the back 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.549
 negligent and that is something we ourselves 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.190
 we can not allow to watch 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.260
 40 minutes to be fully there and everything 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.459
 Give up until the game is over 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.069
 if we do that 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.709
 we also win the games grid 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.199
 turns the part also ends thanks great 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:52.940
 moments of the backshop philipp friedel 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:55.670
 meets two three in a row to 61 61 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.170
 Raster is back in the track and as 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.600
 Finally, the Government of his 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.230
 scoring touch finds the fencers 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.300
 The decisive spurt Haribo has 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.870
 a good hand for whom and when 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.910
 brings 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.770
 if janko thanks him with two completely 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.960
 important distances to the 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.960
 pre-deciding eleven points lead 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.880
 ruby there has now a super game 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.799
 made offensive has us in a phase 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.390
 Of course the two threes have us 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.610
 is always very helpful when you are in the 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.770
 attack makes that much easier 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.070
 everything can be so easy now 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.890
 from beyond the 6 meter 75 off with him 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.350
 anyway chase griffin makes 21 points 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.630
 is almost the entire game on the 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.760
 parquet monster game of shooting 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.050
 Guards grid pulls on its own 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.640
 Hair out of the bind so important a lot 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.550
 very important because yes yes I say 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.230
 in gotha ​​and also in würzburg 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.570
 that we have seven eight points 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.310
 Back then , that was the ship 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.190
 there was no way to save and have there 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.930
 Today we have completely different settings today 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.180
 have laid us down as you already said 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.950
 that pulled on your own head out of it 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.780
 and I think that's very important 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.419
 is to be replenished for the team 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.190
 that even at minus 7 -8 the game 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.930
 is not over but I believe that 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.010
 then came from 778 to +8 that 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.910
 is I guess a very good 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.040
 experience the booty made 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.380
 Score the same after the stutter start 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.150
 five astana double-digit philipp friedel 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.570
 also comes on eight counter 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.910
 the fencers win with 84 72 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.180
 two times high residue of the victory 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.750
 against high 1 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.360
 Of great value, all in the rasta 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.600
 dome itself shown that the hard 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.220
