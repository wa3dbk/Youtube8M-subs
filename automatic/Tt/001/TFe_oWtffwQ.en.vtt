00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
to knit a ribbed scarf first you're

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.120 
to knit a ribbed scarf first you're
gonna<00:00:05.790> cast<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:06.600> an<00:00:07.200> even<00:00:07.770> number<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.040> stitches

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
gonna cast on an even number of stitches

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.919 
gonna cast on an even number of stitches
and<00:00:09.559> the<00:00:10.559> number<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.099> gonna<00:00:11.309> be<00:00:11.910> determined<00:00:12.090> by

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
and the number is gonna be determined by

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.250 
and the number is gonna be determined by
the<00:00:14.030> width<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.509> needle<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.109> you're

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the width of the needle that you're

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.800 
the width of the needle that you're
using<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.830> size<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> needle<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
using the size of the needle and the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
using the size of the needle and the
type<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:18.990> yarn<00:00:20.779> if<00:00:21.779> you're<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.230> following<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
type of yarn if you're not following a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.000 
type of yarn if you're not following a
pattern<00:00:23.070> you're<00:00:23.580> gonna<00:00:23.760> want<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.240> just<00:00:25.010> test

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
pattern you're gonna want to just test

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.200 
pattern you're gonna want to just test
it<00:00:26.189> out<00:00:26.480> potentially<00:00:28.189> knit<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> few<00:00:29.369> rows<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
it out potentially knit a few rows and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.170 
it out potentially knit a few rows and
then<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.260> see<00:00:31.500> how<00:00:31.769> high<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.160> for<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
then you can see how high it is for a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.110 
then you can see how high it is for a
ribbed<00:00:33.630> scarf<00:00:34.250> typically<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> find<00:00:35.790> is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
ribbed scarf typically what I find is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.369 
ribbed scarf typically what I find is
that<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.899> any<00:00:37.829> ribbed<00:00:38.370> pattern<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:40.140> rows

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that for any ribbed pattern the rows

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.250 
that for any ribbed pattern the rows
will<00:00:41.040> tend<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.399> shrink<00:00:41.840> once<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.050> knit

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
will tend to shrink once it's knit

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.220 
will tend to shrink once it's knit
because<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> pattern<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.239> err<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
because of the pattern so err on the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.850 
because of the pattern so err on the
side<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.860> slightly<00:00:47.340> wider<00:00:47.670> than<00:00:48.739> you<00:00:49.739> would

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
side of a slightly wider than you would

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
side of a slightly wider than you would
like<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.210> first<00:00:51.390> scarf<00:00:51.899> that

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
like if this is the first scarf that

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.549 
like if this is the first scarf that
you're<00:00:52.260> knitting<00:00:53.239> okay<00:00:54.350> what<00:00:55.350> you're<00:00:55.469> gonna

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you're knitting okay what you're gonna

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.880 
you're knitting okay what you're gonna
do<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.449> there<00:00:57.449> are<00:00:57.539> two<00:00:57.750> different<00:00:58.079> types<00:00:58.649> of

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
do is there are two different types of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.689 
do is there are two different types of
commonly<00:00:59.399> used<00:00:59.520> rib<00:01:00.059> patterns<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> 2x2

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
commonly used rib patterns one is a 2x2

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.530 
commonly used rib patterns one is a 2x2
and<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:04.260> other<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> 1x1<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and the other is a 1x1 and what that

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.649 
and the other is a 1x1 and what that
means<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.140> you're<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> knit<00:01:07.950> two<00:01:08.659> purl

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
means is you're going to knit two purl

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.640 
means is you're going to knit two purl
two<00:01:10.049> knit<00:01:10.470> two<00:01:11.100> purl<00:01:11.760> two<00:01:12.119> knit<00:01:12.150> two<00:01:12.840> purl<00:01:13.320> two

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650

knit<00:01:13.680> two<00:01:14.189> purl<00:01:14.490> two<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.970> that's<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.720> two<00:01:15.869> by

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
knit two purl two and that's the two by

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.520 
knit two purl two and that's the two by
two<00:01:16.549> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.970> want<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.689> by<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.110> which

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
two if you want to do a one by one which

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.050 
two if you want to do a one by one which
is<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:20.100> finer<00:01:22.100> ribbing<00:01:23.100> pattern<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
is going to be finer ribbing pattern and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.359 
is going to be finer ribbing pattern and
do<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.479> by<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.439> by<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.479> so<00:01:28.070> it<00:01:29.070> really<00:01:29.280> just

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
do one by one by one so it really just

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.740 
do one by one by one so it really just
depends<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> aesthetic<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.540> you're

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
loops here for the pearls and no loops

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
loops here for the pearls and no loops
for<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.680> knits<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.840> whenever<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:14.380> see<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.620> knit

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
for the knits so whenever you see a knit

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.160 
for the knits so whenever you see a knit
you're<00:03:15.460> gonna<00:03:15.640> knit<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.420> whenever<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:16.930> see

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
you're gonna knit and whenever you see

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.520 
you're gonna knit and whenever you see
these<00:03:17.490> horizontal<00:03:18.490> lines<00:03:19.330> those<00:03:19.990> are<00:03:20.020> pearls

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
these horizontal lines those are pearls

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.650 
these horizontal lines those are pearls
you're<00:03:20.740> gonna<00:03:20.860> purl<00:03:21.220> you're<00:03:22.090> gonna<00:03:22.300> want<00:03:22.540> to

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
you're gonna purl you're gonna want to

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.830 
you're gonna purl you're gonna want to
follow<00:03:22.870> this<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:23.710> pattern<00:03:24.600> one<00:03:25.600> thing<00:03:25.750> I

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
follow this in pattern one thing I

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.110 
follow this in pattern one thing I
didn't<00:03:26.110> do<00:03:26.230> here<00:03:26.650> but<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.460> might<00:03:27.670> want<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:27.940> do

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
didn't do here but you might want to do

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.600 
didn't do here but you might want to do
is<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.920> ended<00:03:30.370> with<00:03:30.520> a<00:03:31.200> purl<00:03:32.200> here<00:03:32.770> this<00:03:33.340> ends

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
is this ended with a purl here this ends

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.370 
is this ended with a purl here this ends
with<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.940> knit<00:03:34.209> here<00:03:34.510> if<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.810> wanted<00:03:35.050> to<00:03:35.170> look

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
with a knit here if you wanted to look

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.380 
with a knit here if you wanted to look
symmetrical<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.430> might<00:03:36.970> want<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.209> add<00:03:37.360> a

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
symmetrical you might want to add a

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.310 
symmetrical you might want to add a
couple<00:03:37.690> loops<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.860> make<00:03:38.890> sure<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.670> will

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
couple loops to make sure that it will

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.910 
couple loops to make sure that it will
be<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.470> same<00:03:41.650> pattern<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.520> here<00:03:42.820> we<00:03:42.910> go<00:03:43.920> knit

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
be the same pattern so here we go knit

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.500 
be the same pattern so here we go knit
the<00:03:45.130> knits<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.820> purl<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.930> pearls<00:03:48.510> so

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
the knits and purl the pearls so

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.760 
the knits and purl the pearls so
whenever<00:03:49.660> you<00:03:49.959> see<00:03:49.990> something<00:03:50.380> that<00:03:50.620> says

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
whenever you see something that says

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.970 
whenever you see something that says
knit<00:03:51.100> in<00:03:51.310> pattern<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:52.030> means<00:03:52.620> precisely<00:03:53.620> this

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
knit in pattern it means precisely this

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.630 
knit in pattern it means precisely this
knit<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.610> knits<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:55.209> purl<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.870> pearls<00:03:56.640> you

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
knit the knits and purl the pearls you

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.690 
knit the knits and purl the pearls you
see<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:58.240> vertical<00:03:58.660> lines<00:03:59.110> are<00:03:59.380> knits<00:03:59.650> so<00:04:00.640> I'm

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
see the vertical lines are knits so I'm

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:17.390 
see the vertical lines are knits so I'm
gonna<00:04:00.850> go<00:04:01.060> front<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.510> back

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.470 

to

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.330 

purl<00:04:24.140> two

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
purl two

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.370 
purl two
for<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> chunky<00:04:27.419> yarn<00:04:27.570> you<00:04:27.810> probably<00:04:28.139> don't

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
for a chunky yarn you probably don't

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.520 
for a chunky yarn you probably don't
need<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.889> do<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.280> knit<00:04:29.760> 2<00:04:30.060> purl<00:04:30.090> 2<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:31.440> could

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
need to do a knit 2 purl 2 you could

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.020 
need to do a knit 2 purl 2 you could
probably<00:04:31.680> get<00:04:31.919> away<00:04:32.010> with<00:04:32.130> doing<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.580> knit<00:04:32.790> 1

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
probably get away with doing the knit 1

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.170 
probably get away with doing the knit 1
purl<00:04:33.389> 1<00:04:33.750> it'll<00:04:34.230> look<00:04:34.350> really<00:04:34.560> nice<00:04:34.830> for<00:04:35.820> a

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
purl 1 it'll look really nice for a

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.960 
purl 1 it'll look really nice for a
finer<00:04:36.510> gauge<00:04:36.870> yarn<00:04:37.290> you're<00:04:38.250> gonna<00:04:38.370> want<00:04:38.850> to

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
finer gauge yarn you're gonna want to

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.730 
finer gauge yarn you're gonna want to
try<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.960> try<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:40.590> 2x2<00:04:41.040> first<00:04:42.530> that<00:04:43.530> looks

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
try to try that 2x2 first that looks

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
try to try that 2x2 first that looks
really<00:04:43.919> nice<00:04:49.010> you<00:04:50.010> know<00:04:50.130> you<00:04:50.220> can't<00:04:50.430> see<00:04:50.639> it

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
really nice you know you can't see it

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.010 
really nice you know you can't see it
here<00:04:50.910> yet<00:04:51.120> but<00:04:52.100> pattern<00:04:53.100> will<00:04:53.310> start<00:04:53.490> for<00:04:53.760> me

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.870 

so<00:04:58.020> here<00:04:58.350> I've<00:04:58.620> knit<00:04:58.950> a<00:04:58.979> few<00:04:59.070> more<00:04:59.370> rows<00:04:59.550> of<00:04:59.790> the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
so here I've knit a few more rows of the

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.180 
so here I've knit a few more rows of the
2x2<00:05:00.240> knit<00:05:00.720> just<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.229> give<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.740> sense<00:05:02.040> of

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
2x2 knit just to give you a sense of

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.310 
2x2 knit just to give you a sense of
what<00:05:02.340> that<00:05:02.370> looks<00:05:02.520> like<00:05:03.000> it's<00:05:03.990> actually

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
what that looks like it's actually

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.540 
what that looks like it's actually
pretty<00:05:04.740> wide<00:05:05.010> here<00:05:05.340> because<00:05:07.130> I'm<00:05:08.130> using<00:05:08.400> a

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
pretty wide here because I'm using a

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.090 
pretty wide here because I'm using a
very<00:05:08.729> chunky<00:05:09.000> yarn<00:05:09.530> probably<00:05:10.530> don't<00:05:10.680> need<00:05:10.860> it

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
very chunky yarn probably don't need it

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.350 
very chunky yarn probably don't need it
to<00:05:11.250> be<00:05:13.190> it's<00:05:14.190> probably<00:05:14.669> better<00:05:14.790> to<00:05:14.880> use<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.150> one

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
to be it's probably better to use a one

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.820 
to be it's probably better to use a one
by<00:05:15.510> one<00:05:15.720> if<00:05:15.960> you're<00:05:16.080> gonna<00:05:16.169> use<00:05:16.380> chunky<00:05:16.710> yarn

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
by one if you're gonna use chunky yarn

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.180 
by one if you're gonna use chunky yarn
you<00:05:17.430> can<00:05:17.580> see<00:05:17.760> here<00:05:17.940> it<00:05:18.030> stretches<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:19.680> the

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
you can see here it stretches the the

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.500 
you can see here it stretches the the
2x2<00:05:20.820> knit<00:05:21.270> or<00:05:21.450> any<00:05:21.810> kind<00:05:22.050> of<00:05:22.139> ribbed<00:05:22.530> pattern

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
2x2 knit or any kind of ribbed pattern

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.850 
2x2 knit or any kind of ribbed pattern
is<00:05:24.510> very<00:05:24.780> stretchy<00:05:25.470> so<00:05:26.400> here<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.060> sample<00:05:27.600> of

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
is very stretchy so here is a sample of

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.350 
is very stretchy so here is a sample of
a<00:05:28.860> scarf<00:05:29.250> that's<00:05:30.240> using<00:05:30.660> a<00:05:30.720> 2x2<00:05:31.169> knit<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:33.180> the

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
a scarf that's using a 2x2 knit and the

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.810 
a scarf that's using a 2x2 knit and the
solution<00:05:33.840> is<00:05:34.050> with<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.470> much<00:05:34.860> finer<00:05:35.070> gain<00:05:35.400> gage

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
solution is with a much finer gain gage

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.670 
solution is with a much finer gain gage
are<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.330> can<00:05:36.479> see<00:05:36.510> how<00:05:36.750> it<00:05:36.900> stretches<00:05:39.680> if

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
are and you can see how it stretches if

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.529 
are and you can see how it stretches if
you<00:05:40.860> look<00:05:41.010> closely<00:05:41.910> you<00:05:42.090> can<00:05:42.150> see<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.630> 2x2

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
you look closely you can see the 2x2

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.710 
you look closely you can see the 2x2
two<00:05:45.539> knits<00:05:46.110> and<00:05:46.470> two<00:05:46.919> pearls<00:05:47.570> that's<00:05:48.570> what

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
two knits and two pearls that's what

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.970 
two knits and two pearls that's what
that<00:05:48.870> looks<00:05:49.050> like

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.120 

this<00:05:52.610> is<00:05:52.790> what<00:05:53.060> the<00:05:53.360> 1x1<00:05:54.170> rib<00:05:54.200> looks<00:05:54.620> like<00:05:54.830> so

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
this is what the 1x1 rib looks like so

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.970 
this is what the 1x1 rib looks like so
if<00:05:55.190> you<00:05:55.280> can<00:05:55.460> see<00:05:55.640> here<00:05:58.930> there's<00:05:59.930> one<00:06:00.290> row<00:06:00.830> of

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
if you can see here there's one row of

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.110 
if you can see here there's one row of
knits<00:06:01.340> than<00:06:02.120> pearls<00:06:02.630> in<00:06:03.260> between<00:06:04.120> knits

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
knits than pearls in between knits

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.010 
knits than pearls in between knits
pearls<00:06:06.020> knit<00:06:06.500> purl<00:06:07.480> stretches<00:06:09.250> but<00:06:11.020> collapses

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
pearls knit purl stretches but collapses

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.630 
pearls knit purl stretches but collapses
like<00:06:12.140> that<00:06:12.350> so<00:06:12.560> it<00:06:12.620> looks<00:06:12.800> like<00:06:12.860> it's<00:06:13.130> actually

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
like that so it looks like it's actually

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.470 
like that so it looks like it's actually
a<00:06:13.670> row<00:06:14.330> of<00:06:14.480> just<00:06:14.810> knits<00:06:15.230> on<00:06:15.530> both<00:06:16.490> sides<00:06:16.760> so

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
a row of just knits on both sides so

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.960 
a row of just knits on both sides so
once<00:06:17.690> this<00:06:17.870> done<00:06:18.140> looks<00:06:18.440> pretty<00:06:18.740> neat<00:06:19.670> and<00:06:19.850> it

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
once this done looks pretty neat and it

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.800 
once this done looks pretty neat and it
tends<00:06:20.270> to<00:06:20.360> be<00:06:20.540> a<00:06:20.570> little<00:06:20.720> bit<00:06:20.960> thicker<00:06:21.290> than<00:06:21.640> a

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
tends to be a little bit thicker than a

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.520 
tends to be a little bit thicker than a
garter<00:06:23.810> stitch<00:06:24.280> because<00:06:25.280> it<00:06:25.520> has<00:06:25.760> a<00:06:26.200> it<00:06:27.200> feels

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
garter stitch because it has a it feels

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.270 
garter stitch because it has a it feels
like<00:06:27.680> it's<00:06:27.860> a<00:06:28.010> double<00:06:28.190> there<00:06:28.900> because<00:06:29.900> of<00:06:30.280> its

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
like it's a double there because of its

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.610 
like it's a double there because of its
stretching<00:06:31.790> in<00:06:31.940> like<00:06:32.180> that<00:06:33.460> so<00:06:35.380> this<00:06:36.380> is<00:06:36.500> how

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
stretching in like that so this is how

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.640 
stretching in like that so this is how
you<00:06:36.680> do<00:06:36.920> a<00:06:36.950> 1x1<00:06:37.610> rib
