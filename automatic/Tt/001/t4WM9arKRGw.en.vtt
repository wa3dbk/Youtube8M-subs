00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
now I can say verifiably that it is at

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.430 
now I can say verifiably that it is at
least<00:04:57.050> as<00:04:57.680> good<00:04:58.039> as<00:04:58.099> those<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:59.020> also<00:05:00.020> makes<00:05:00.259> my

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
least as good as those and also makes my

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.680 
least as good as those and also makes my
makeup<00:05:00.740> look<00:05:00.860> awesome<00:05:01.340> also<00:05:01.759> it<00:05:02.000> does<00:05:02.270> lean<00:05:02.660> a

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
makeup look awesome also it does lean a

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.499 
makeup look awesome also it does lean a
little<00:05:02.960> bit<00:05:03.110> on<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.800> drier<00:05:04.190> side<00:05:04.220> so<00:05:05.180> I<00:05:05.210> would

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
little bit on the drier side so I would

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.659 
little bit on the drier side so I would
recommend<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.139> more<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.590> those<00:05:06.800> with<00:05:07.099> oily<00:05:07.400> or

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
recommend a more to those with oily or

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.550 
recommend a more to those with oily or
eyelids<00:05:08.360> but<00:05:08.660> I'm<00:05:08.780> sure<00:05:08.990> it'll<00:05:09.169> work<00:05:09.259> on

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
eyelids but I'm sure it'll work on

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.870 
from Kate Somerville called exfoli Kate
I<00:05:17.599> think<00:05:17.990> that<00:05:18.349> it<00:05:18.530> must<00:05:18.770> be<00:05:18.830> a<00:05:18.919> mixture<00:05:19.460> of

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
I think that it must be a mixture of

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.540 
I think that it must be a mixture of
actual<00:05:20.570> acids<00:05:21.440> or<00:05:21.710> something<00:05:22.070> within<00:05:22.430> the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
actual acids or something within the

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.089 
actual acids or something within the

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
exfoliator that gives a slight burning

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.879 
exfoliator that gives a slight burning
tingling<00:05:25.580> sensation<00:05:26.360> as<00:05:26.570> it's<00:05:26.840> on<00:05:27.139> but<00:05:27.770> it

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
tingling sensation as it's on but it

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.149 
tingling sensation as it's on but it
also<00:05:28.039> has<00:05:28.370> those<00:05:28.610> really<00:05:29.030> really<00:05:29.180> finely

sandy<00:05:32.180> bits<00:05:32.510> that<00:05:32.990> physically<00:05:33.770> exfoliate<00:05:34.310> the

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
sandy bits that physically exfoliate the

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.980 
sandy bits that physically exfoliate the
top<00:05:34.490> layer<00:05:34.849> of<00:05:34.940> your<00:05:35.090> skin<00:05:35.210> as<00:05:35.570> you're

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
feel like it kind of works both ways and

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.879

about using this consistently and seeing

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.999 
about using this consistently and seeing
if<00:05:56.930> the<00:05:57.560> summer<00:05:58.509> mmm<00:05:59.509> flakes<00:05:59.780> and<00:06:00.320> bits<00:06:00.680> and

thicker<00:06:01.490> skin<00:06:01.880> that<00:06:02.060> you<00:06:02.210> get<00:06:02.419> when<00:06:02.990> you're

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
thicker skin that you get when you're

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.930 
thicker skin that you get when you're
exposed<00:06:03.740> to<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:03.919> Sun<00:06:04.159> a<00:06:04.190> little<00:06:04.400> bit<00:06:04.639> more<00:06:04.789> if

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
exposed to the Sun a little bit more if

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.760 
exposed to the Sun a little bit more if
that'll<00:06:05.270> kind<00:06:05.479> of<00:06:05.539> keep<00:06:05.720> that<00:06:05.930> up<00:06:06.080> babe<00:06:06.320> oh<00:06:06.530> and

hair if you're using heat products on a
regular<00:06:58.110> basis<00:06:58.530> which<00:06:58.680> especially<00:06:59.100> because<00:06:59.490> I

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
regular basis which especially because I

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.340 
regular basis which especially because I
cut<00:06:59.820> off<00:06:59.940> so<00:07:00.240> much<00:07:00.450> length<00:07:00.780> I<00:07:00.960> want<00:07:01.140> to<00:07:01.230> make

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
cut off so much length I want to make

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.680 
cut off so much length I want to make
sure<00:07:01.530> that<00:07:02.100> the<00:07:02.310> shorter<00:07:02.760> hair<00:07:02.790> now<00:07:03.180> is<00:07:03.420> very

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690

very<00:07:03.960> healthy<00:07:04.260> so<00:07:05.130> I<00:07:05.160> guess<00:07:05.580> that's<00:07:05.760> the<00:07:05.910> end

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150
