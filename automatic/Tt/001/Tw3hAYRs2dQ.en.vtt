00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
aren't very clear what the differences

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.010 
aren't very clear what the differences
are<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.759> between<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.600> consumer

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
preview and the release preview I'm sure

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.940 
preview and the release preview I'm sure
there's<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.439> differences

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
there's going to be some differences

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.440 
there's going to be some differences
otherwise<00:01:29.549> there<00:01:29.790> wouldn't<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.060> any<00:01:30.180> need<00:01:30.390> for

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
otherwise there wouldn't be any need for

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.399 
otherwise there wouldn't be any need for
it<00:01:31.130> perhaps<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.759> release<00:01:33.030> preview

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
it perhaps the the release preview

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.690 
it perhaps the the release preview
logically<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:35.159> think<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
logically you would think that the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.100 
logically you would think that the
release<00:01:35.970> preview<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.509> going<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.900> much

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
release preview is going to be much

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.710 
release preview is going to be much
closer<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.799> final<00:01:38.159> product<00:01:38.720> certain

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
closer to the final product certain

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.319 
closer to the final product certain
features<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:41.250> Metro<00:01:41.610> style<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> stuff

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
features in the Metro style and stuff

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.800 
features in the Metro style and stuff
the<00:01:42.420> guy<00:01:42.509> are<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.899> working<00:01:43.189> better

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
the guy are going to be working better

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.969 
the guy are going to be working better
but<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.590> being<00:01:46.799> said<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.810> I<00:01:48.810> personally<00:01:49.799> feel

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
but that being said I I personally feel

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.130 
but that being said I I personally feel
that<00:01:50.040> Microsoft<00:01:50.579> perhaps<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.570> I'm<00:01:51.899> hoping

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that Microsoft perhaps and I'm hoping

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.420 
that Microsoft perhaps and I'm hoping
wrong<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.950> feel<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.280> they've

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
wrong on this but I feel that they've

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.980 
wrong on this but I feel that they've
perhaps<00:01:53.790> shot<00:01:54.000> themselves<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.540> foot<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
perhaps shot themselves in the foot a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.179 
perhaps shot themselves in the foot a
little<00:01:55.200> bit<00:01:55.350> by<00:01:55.530> given<00:01:55.950> us<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:57.329> ordinary

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
little bit by given us the ordinary

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.870 
little bit by given us the ordinary
consumers<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.460> too<00:02:00.299> too<00:02:00.750> much<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.880> hook

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
consumers are too too much of a a hook

us<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:15.510> average<00:02:15.840> user<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.910> Microsoft

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
us the the average user if Microsoft

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.110 
us the the average user if Microsoft
hadn't<00:02:18.300> just<00:02:18.480> left<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:20.730> know<00:02:20.850> get

missed them or by phone boat they missed
the<00:03:53.489> tablet<00:03:53.910> boat<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:55.170> they<00:03:55.320> seem<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.560> be

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
the tablet boat but they seem to be

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.960 
the tablet boat but they seem to be
getting<00:03:55.860> themselves<00:03:56.100> back<00:03:56.370> into<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.850> game

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
getting themselves back into the game

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.820

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
with this windows here and I think this

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.650 
with this windows here and I think this
is<00:03:58.980> this<00:03:59.280> could<00:03:59.519> be<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.670> real<00:03:59.940> game-changer<00:04:00.209> for

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
is this could be a real game-changer for

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.920 
is this could be a real game-changer for
them<00:04:00.989> but<00:04:01.739> but<00:04:02.430> these<00:04:02.640> previews<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.480> just<00:04:03.660> fear

that<00:04:03.959> people<00:04:04.290> aren't<00:04:04.620> going<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.860> go<00:04:04.980> out<00:04:05.160> and

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
that people aren't going to go out and

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.660 
that people aren't going to go out and
buy<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.959> operating<00:04:07.440> system<00:04:07.800> in<00:04:07.950> there<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.459> the
