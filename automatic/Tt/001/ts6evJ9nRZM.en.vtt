00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939

mean I died once from the gang which was
in<00:00:25.410> my<00:00:25.619> opinion<00:00:25.830> unexpectable<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:27.060> like

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
in my opinion unexpectable because like

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.839 
in my opinion unexpectable because like
I'm<00:00:27.779> always<00:00:28.019> thinking<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.890> Nocturne<00:00:29.609> can

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
I'm always thinking that Nocturne can

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.640 
I'm always thinking that Nocturne can
never<00:00:30.060> gang<00:00:30.330> early<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.900> always<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.320> that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
never gang early I always have that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.549 
never gang early I always have that
mindset<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.579> was<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.899> don't<00:00:34.290> even

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
mindset so I was just like I don't even

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.190 
mindset so I was just like I don't even
know<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.070> didn't<00:00:35.730> even<00:00:35.760> flash<00:00:36.149> until<00:00:37.050> like

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
know I didn't even flash until like

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.990 
know I didn't even flash until like
really<00:00:37.469> late<00:00:37.590> until<00:00:37.920> after<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.309> got<00:00:38.460> fear<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
really late until after I got fear so it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.780 
really late until after I got fear so it
was<00:00:39.090> really<00:00:39.270> dumb<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:40.800> ended<00:00:41.250> up<00:00:41.370> well<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
was really dumb but it ended up well and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.940 
was really dumb but it ended up well and
Lulu<00:00:42.180> didn't<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> kill<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.800> still

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
Lulu didn't get to kill so it was still

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.490 
Lulu didn't get to kill so it was still
equal<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.520> after<00:00:45.360> i<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> themes<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.200> blue

real<00:01:27.180> good<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:27.630> sore<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.130> mean<00:01:30.079> people

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
real good little sore but I mean people

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
real good little sore but I mean people
haven't<00:01:31.470> really<00:01:31.650> practiced<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.400> long

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
haven't really practiced for that long

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.300 
haven't really practiced for that long
so<00:01:33.110> it's<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.320> hard<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> beat<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.280> now

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
so it's not that hard to beat right now

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.550 
so it's not that hard to beat right now
so<00:01:35.850> maybe<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.390> quick<00:01:36.659> follow-up<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.470> we

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
so maybe a quick follow-up on that if we

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.080 
so maybe a quick follow-up on that if we
talk<00:01:37.710> about<00:01:37.829> Lulu<00:01:38.189> why<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.610> pick<00:01:38.850> Natalie

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
for the pressure you had in the lane

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.330 
for the pressure you had in the lane

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
because it seemed as though you guys

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.430 
because it seemed as though you guys
were<00:03:53.459> playing<00:03:53.610> fairly<00:03:53.850> safe<00:03:54.209> for<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.200> most

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
were playing fairly safe for the most

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.170 
were playing fairly safe for the most
part<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.100> was<00:03:56.220> only<00:03:56.310> when<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.610> dragon<00:03:56.910> was

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
part and it was only when a dragon was

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.760 
part and it was only when a dragon was
available<00:03:57.480> or<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.900> buffers<00:03:58.440> up<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.680> you

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
available or a buffers up that you

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.170 
available or a buffers up that you
wanted<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.130> steal<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.490> you<00:03:59.580> challenged<00:04:00.030> for

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
wanted to steal that you challenged for

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
wanted to steal that you challenged for
was<00:04:00.570> this<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.750> conscious<00:04:01.170> decision

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
was this a conscious decision

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.440 
was this a conscious decision
considering<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:02.459> lost<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.850> alliance<00:04:03.240> playing

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
considering you lost to alliance playing

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.630 
considering you lost to alliance playing
a<00:04:03.540> little<00:04:03.720> risky<00:04:03.990> last<00:04:04.170> week<00:04:04.350> um<00:04:05.190> when<00:04:05.550> we

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
a little risky last week um when we

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.090 
a little risky last week um when we
played<00:04:05.820> against<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.240> Lions<00:04:06.570> our<00:04:07.380> risky<00:04:07.890> place

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
played against the Lions our risky place

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.400 
played against the Lions our risky place
and<00:04:08.459> our<00:04:08.550> aggressive<00:04:09.300> playstyle<00:04:09.780> even

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
and our aggressive playstyle even

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.580 
and our aggressive playstyle even
surprised<00:04:10.770> me<00:04:11.010> like<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:12.000> was<00:04:12.180> thinking<00:04:12.990> wait

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
surprised me like I was thinking wait

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.350 
surprised me like I was thinking wait
what<00:04:13.950> because<00:04:14.490> everyone's<00:04:14.910> making<00:04:15.150> like

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
what because everyone's making like

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.470 
what because everyone's making like
really<00:04:15.720> aggressive<00:04:16.140> calls<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.400> then<00:04:18.030> I'm<00:04:18.180> I'm

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
really aggressive calls and then I'm I'm

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.170 
really aggressive calls and then I'm I'm
thinking<00:04:19.320> for<00:04:19.739> myself<00:04:19.770> what<00:04:20.640> is<00:04:20.760> this<00:04:20.910> we've

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
thinking for myself what is this we've

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.450 
thinking for myself what is this we've
never<00:04:21.359> played<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:21.870> aggressive<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.560> then<00:04:22.710> we

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
never played so aggressive and then we

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.740 
never played so aggressive and then we
started<00:04:23.520> getting<00:04:24.090> hyped<00:04:24.990> and

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
started getting hyped and

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.530 
started getting hyped and
getting<00:04:26.530> unfocused<00:04:27.100> so<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.700> don't<00:04:28.270> know<00:04:28.330> this

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
getting unfocused so I don't know this

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.920 
getting unfocused so I don't know this
game<00:04:28.780> we<00:04:29.080> probably<00:04:29.320> just<00:04:30.330> thought<00:04:31.330> of<00:04:31.540> more

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
game we probably just thought of more

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.380 
game we probably just thought of more
like<00:04:32.620> playing<00:04:32.980> more<00:04:33.160> safe<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.730> doing<00:04:34.270> more

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
like playing more safe and doing more

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.800 
like playing more safe and doing more
safe<00:04:34.600> things<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.170> not<00:04:35.320> become<00:04:36.010> overhyped<00:04:37.000> so

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
safe things to not become overhyped so

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.600 
safe things to not become overhyped so
