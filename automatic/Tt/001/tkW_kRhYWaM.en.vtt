top<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.820> shroud<00:00:12.150> is<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.630> big<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.170> lets

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
top of the shroud is so big that it lets

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.589 
top of the shroud is so big that it lets
grass<00:00:13.710> through<00:00:14.009> there<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:15.120> cleaned<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.480> out

and cleaned it out and cleaned it out a
bunch<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.190> times<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:18.060> apparently<00:00:18.900> wasn't

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
bunch of times but I apparently wasn't

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.260 
bunch of times but I apparently wasn't
diligent<00:00:19.890> enough<00:00:20.070> because<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.580> were<00:00:20.670> mowing<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
diligent enough because we were mowing a

lawn a couple of weeks ago for a friend

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.259 
lawn a couple of weeks ago for a friend
and<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.590> froze<00:00:25.920> up<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.340> my<00:00:26.490> man<00:00:26.670> Lucas<00:00:27.060> here

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
and it froze up on my man Lucas here

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.599 
and it froze up on my man Lucas here
seized<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:28.050> tight<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> took<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
seized up tight and when I took the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.339 
seized up tight and when I took the
shroud<00:00:29.910> off<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.300> found<00:00:30.539> about<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.779> bale<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.140> hay

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
shroud off I found about a bale of hay

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.229 
shroud off I found about a bale of hay
right<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.040> top<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.399> those<00:00:32.520> fins<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.120> it

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
right there on top of those fins and it

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.490 
right there on top of those fins and it
wouldn't<00:00:33.480> work<00:00:33.719> anymore<00:00:33.989> wouldn't<00:00:34.440> even

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
wouldn't work anymore wouldn't even

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.590 
wouldn't work anymore wouldn't even
start<00:00:34.829> up<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.130> it'll<00:00:35.670> start<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.390> only

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
start up it it'll start up but it's only

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.780 
start up it it'll start up but it's only
running<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.320> cylinder<00:00:37.950> then<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
running on that cylinder then the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
running on that cylinder then the
cylinder<00:00:39.480> over<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.079> tell<00:00:40.290> there's

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
cylinder over here you can tell there's

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.959 
cylinder over here you can tell there's
something<00:00:40.530> seriously<00:00:41.190> wrong<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:41.910> I

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
something seriously wrong with it but I

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.569 
something seriously wrong with it but I
took<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.360> plugs<00:00:42.600> out<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.460> rotated<00:00:44.460> this

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
took the plugs out and rotated this

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.029 
took the plugs out and rotated this
flywheel<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.390> bit<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.860> see

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
flywheel a little bit and you can see

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.650 
flywheel a little bit and you can see
that<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> screwdriver<00:00:47.789> still<00:00:48.120> goes<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that the screwdriver still goes up and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.979 
that the screwdriver still goes up and
down<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.110> didn't<00:00:49.379> break<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> connecting<00:00:50.129> rod

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
down so it didn't break a connecting rod

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.260 
down so it didn't break a connecting rod
so<00:00:51.989> I'm<00:00:52.110> guessing<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> seized<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.180> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
so I'm guessing it seized up one of the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.810 
so I'm guessing it seized up one of the
valves<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:56.219> we're<00:00:56.399> enough<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> take

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
valves so I just we're enough to take

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
valves so I just we're enough to take
the<00:00:56.910> head<00:00:57.090> off<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.050> got

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the head off of here and see what we got

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.040 
the head off of here and see what we got
going<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.770> did<00:00:59.370> take<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> took<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> cap<00:01:00.809> off

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
going I did take the took the cap off

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.650 
going I did take the took the cap off
the<00:01:01.440> valve<00:01:01.710> cover<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.579> don't<00:01:03.300> know<00:01:03.510> which

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the valve cover and I don't know which

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.420 
the valve cover and I don't know which
valve<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> connecting<00:01:05.220> rod<00:01:05.400> is

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
valve it is but the connecting rod is

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.310 
valve it is but the connecting rod is
laying<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> bottom<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.659> valve<00:01:07.080> isn't

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
laying in the bottom so that valve isn't

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
laying in the bottom so that valve isn't
moving<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.979> down<00:01:08.040> right<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> spring

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
moving up and down right on the spring

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.990 
moving up and down right on the spring
so<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.450> either<00:01:09.570> bender<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.170> seized<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:11.000> all

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
so it's either bender it's seized up all

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.310 
so it's either bender it's seized up all
right<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.270> isn't<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.659> bad<00:01:12.869> at<00:01:12.990> all<00:01:13.080> here's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
right this isn't going bad at all here's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.920 
right this isn't going bad at all here's
where<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.950> had<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> take<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> shroud<00:01:15.570> off<00:01:15.780> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
where at I had to take the shroud off I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.530 
where at I had to take the shroud off I
took<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.290> bolt<00:01:16.560> off<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:18.180> took<00:01:18.240> this

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
took this bolt off here and I took this

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.840 
took this bolt off here and I took this
bolt<00:01:18.840> off<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.439> there's<00:01:19.890> smaller<00:01:20.549> bolt

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
bolt off here and there's smaller bolt

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.240 
bolt off here and there's smaller bolt
up<00:01:21.060> underneath<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> take<00:01:23.070> off

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
up underneath here you have to take off

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.460 
up underneath here you have to take off
and<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.759> cooling<00:01:24.720> shroud<00:01:24.900> came<00:01:25.259> right

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and then the cooling shroud came right

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.170 
and then the cooling shroud came right
off<00:01:25.909> there<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.860> two<00:01:28.860> bolts<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:30.000> and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
off there was two bolts right here and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.450 
off there was two bolts right here and
one<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> bottom<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> carburetor<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
one on the bottom of the carburetor the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.440 
one on the bottom of the carburetor the
intake<00:01:32.880> tube

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
intake tube

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.780 
intake tube
those<00:01:33.750> came<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.229> out<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.530> well<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
those came right out as well and then I

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the bolts out I put them back in the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.859 
the bolts out I put them back in the
holes<00:01:44.700> they<00:01:44.939> came<00:01:45.119> out<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.720> I've

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
holes they came out of because I've

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.109 
holes they came out of because I've
mastered<00:01:46.350> losing<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.890> stuff<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.060> took

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
mastered losing this stuff but I took

mastered losing this stuff but I took
this<00:01:48.390> took<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> valve<00:01:49.530> cover<00:01:49.799> off<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.009> show

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
this took the valve cover off to show

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.649 
this took the valve cover off to show
you<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> found<00:01:50.790> when<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.060> first<00:01:51.329> took<00:01:51.479> this

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you what I found when I first took this

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.520 
you what I found when I first took this
thing<00:01:51.869> off<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.229> here

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
thing off it here

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.310 
thing off it here
I<00:01:52.560> found<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.549> push<00:01:54.299> rod<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.689> just<00:01:54.869> laying<00:01:55.079> in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
I found this push rod is just laying in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.620 
I found this push rod is just laying in
there<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.490> I'm<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> want<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> stop<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
there and I'm going to want to stop the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.330 
there and I'm going to want to stop the
recording<00:01:58.229> right<00:01:58.649> now<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:58.979> I'm<00:01:59.040> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.219> put

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
recording right now but I'm going to put

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
recording right now but I'm going to put
that<00:01:59.490> push<00:01:59.729> rod<00:01:59.939> back<00:02:00.119> in<00:02:00.299> place<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> show<00:02:00.960> you

that push rod back in place and show you
what<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.350> doing<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.710> suspect<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> valve<00:02:02.549> is

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
what it's doing I suspect the valve is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.209 
what it's doing I suspect the valve is
bent<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.450> there's<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.110> lot<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.500> lot<00:02:05.070> more

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
bent because there's a lot a lot more

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.969 
bent because there's a lot a lot more
play<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:05.820> than<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.090> should<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.979> well

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
play in there than there should be well

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.350 
play in there than there should be well
as<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.280> turns<00:02:08.459> out<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.640> may<00:02:08.849> not<00:02:09.030> be<00:02:09.149> able<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
as it turns out I may not be able to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.550 
as it turns out I may not be able to
show<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:09.959> there's<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.440> much

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
show you this because there's so much

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.110 
show you this because there's so much
slop<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.039> there<00:02:11.160> I've<00:02:11.250> got<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> push<00:02:11.730> rod<00:02:11.970> in

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
slop in there I've got the push rod in

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.340 
slop in there I've got the push rod in
place<00:02:12.150> now<00:02:12.690> I'm<00:02:12.840> just<00:02:13.050> going<00:02:13.170> to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
place now I'm just going to

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.860 
place now I'm just going to
hold<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.090> see<00:02:15.330> over<00:02:15.600> on<00:02:15.630> this

hold that and you can see over on this

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.280 
hold that and you can see over on this
side<00:02:17.570> no<00:02:18.570> where<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.930> it

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
side no where is it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.620 
side no where is it
there's<00:02:20.130> like<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> half<00:02:20.490> inch<00:02:20.640> gap<00:02:20.880> right<00:02:21.270> there

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
there's like a half inch gap right there

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.810 
there's like a half inch gap right there
see<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.990> minute<00:02:22.260> move<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.950> pushrod<00:02:23.520> falls

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
see the minute move it the pushrod falls

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.970 
see the minute move it the pushrod falls
back<00:02:24.060> off<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.450> there<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:25.590> valve<00:02:25.830> is

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
back off of there so that valve is

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.230 
back off of there so that valve is
obviously<00:02:26.400> bent<00:02:26.700> I'm<00:02:26.820> going<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.000> take<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
obviously bent I'm going to take the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.580 
obviously bent I'm going to take the
head<00:02:27.420> off<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.780> I'm<00:02:27.870> pretty<00:02:28.050> sure<00:02:28.140> that's<00:02:28.410> what

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
head off and I'm pretty sure that's what

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.970 
head off and I'm pretty sure that's what
we'll<00:02:28.770> find<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.870> there<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.530> with<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.770> head

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
we'll find and there it is with the head

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.880 
we'll find and there it is with the head
off<00:02:32.360> piston<00:02:33.360> doesn't<00:02:33.660> look<00:02:33.810> distant<00:02:34.740> looks

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
off piston doesn't look distant looks

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.400 
off piston doesn't look distant looks
fine<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:36.330> got<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> little<00:02:36.720> scratch<00:02:36.930> mark<00:02:37.260> where

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
fine you got a little scratch mark where

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.960 
fine you got a little scratch mark where
I<00:02:37.440> had<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.770> screwdriver<00:02:38.190> stuck<00:02:38.520> in<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> spark

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
I had the screwdriver stuck in the spark

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.570 
I had the screwdriver stuck in the spark
plug<00:02:39.150> hole<00:02:39.300> before<00:02:39.510> but<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.130> looked<00:02:41.370> fine

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
plug hole before but that I looked fine

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.280 
plug hole before but that I looked fine
but<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:41.970> laid<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.300> other<00:02:42.420> parts<00:02:42.750> up<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
but I laid the other parts up on the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.600 
but I laid the other parts up on the
tailgate<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.800> truck<00:02:43.860> let<00:02:44.310> me<00:02:44.370> show<00:02:44.520> you

tailgate of the truck let me show you
what<00:02:44.760> happened<00:02:45.150> here<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:46.380> I'm<00:02:46.620> afraid<00:02:46.740> this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
what happened here and I'm afraid this

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.260 
what happened here and I'm afraid this
can<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.310> hard<00:02:47.490> for<00:02:47.520> you<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.790> see<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.150> that's

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
can be hard for you to see but that's

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.390 
can be hard for you to see but that's
exactly<00:02:48.780> what<00:02:48.900> happened<00:02:49.200> up<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.860> top<00:02:50.070> there<00:02:50.250> is

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
exactly what happened up on top there is

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.180 
exactly what happened up on top there is
the<00:02:50.580> exhaust<00:02:50.910> now<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:52.350> on<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.650> bottom<00:02:53.010> is

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
the exhaust now this on the bottom is

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.850 
the exhaust now this on the bottom is
the<00:02:53.870> intake<00:02:54.870> valve<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.350> right<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.740> can

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
the intake valve and right that you can

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.220 
the intake valve and right that you can
see<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.130> bent<00:02:56.430> there's<00:02:56.610> about<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:57.170> 80,000<00:02:58.170> s

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
see it's bent there's about a 80,000 s

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.100 
see it's bent there's about a 80,000 s
maybe<00:02:58.380> 120<00:02:59.190> thousands<00:02:59.610> gap<00:02:59.880> there<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.360> that

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
maybe 120 thousands gap there on that

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.910 
maybe 120 thousands gap there on that
side<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:02.490> was<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.940> push<00:03:03.180> rod<00:03:03.770> for<00:03:04.770> that

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
side this was the push rod for that

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.560 
side this was the push rod for that
valve<00:03:05.190> it's<00:03:05.400> nice<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:05.820> straight<00:03:06.060> but<00:03:06.240> once<00:03:06.450> I

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
valve it's nice and straight but once I

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.290 
valve it's nice and straight but once I
got<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.930> there<00:03:07.460> silver<00:03:08.460> one<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.910> push<00:03:09.090> rod

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
got in there silver one is the push rod

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.790 
got in there silver one is the push rod
for<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.540> exhaust<00:03:09.930> valve<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.380> I'm<00:03:10.440> guessing

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
for the exhaust valve and I'm guessing

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.230 
for the exhaust valve and I'm guessing
the<00:03:10.890> reason<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.280> didn't<00:03:11.550> Bend<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.940> because

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
the reason it didn't Bend is because

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.400 
the reason it didn't Bend is because
that<00:03:12.450> push<00:03:12.720> rod<00:03:12.990> dude

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
that push rod dude

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.880 
that push rod dude
so<00:03:14.330> got<00:03:15.330> one<00:03:15.540> bent<00:03:15.840> pushrod<00:03:16.380> somebody<00:03:16.800> need

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890
