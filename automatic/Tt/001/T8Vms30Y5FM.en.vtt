between<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> fingers<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.199> think<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> kind

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
between the fingers I think it's a kind

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.580 
between the fingers I think it's a kind
of<00:00:22.920> black<00:00:23.160> latex<00:00:23.369> foam<00:00:24.170> not<00:00:25.170> completely<00:00:25.529> sure

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
can also see just there on the corner of

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.299 
can also see just there on the corner of
the<00:00:44.910> palm<00:00:45.120> also<00:00:45.930> features<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.800> extra

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the palm also features this extra

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.490 
the palm also features this extra

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
reinforcement system that the rush built

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.869 
reinforcement system that the rush built
into<00:00:49.800> some<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> gloves<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> Magno

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
into some of the gloves in the Magno

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
into some of the gloves in the Magno
range<00:00:51.120> whether<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.379> because<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.739> is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
range whether you just because this is

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
range whether you just because this is
an<00:00:52.920> area<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.250> takes<00:00:53.550> extra<00:00:54.180> extra

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
an area that takes extra extra

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.840 
an area that takes extra extra
punishment<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.440> they've<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.190> reinforced

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
punishment and they've just reinforced

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.319 
punishment and they've just reinforced
it<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.059> bit<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> extra<00:00:57.510> tough<00:00:57.750> latex<00:00:58.199> there

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
it with a bit of extra tough latex there

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.389 
it with a bit of extra tough latex there
the<00:01:00.329> fit<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> Magna<00:01:01.800> pro-am<00:01:02.190> want

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the fit on the Magna pro-am want

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:11.640 
the fit on the Magna pro-am want
bundesliga<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.359> nice

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.530 

I<00:01:14.520> think<00:01:15.520> all<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.850> gloves<00:01:16.060> in<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.240> Magno

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
I think all of the gloves in the Magno

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.710 
I think all of the gloves in the Magno
range<00:01:16.750> fit<00:01:17.080> very<00:01:17.290> nicely<00:01:17.500> because<00:01:18.510> Roy's<00:01:19.510> do

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
range fit very nicely because Roy's do

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.310 
range fit very nicely because Roy's do
well<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:20.110> make<00:01:20.620> sure<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.610> design<00:01:22.320> allows

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
well to make sure that the design allows

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.320 
well to make sure that the design allows
the<00:01:23.470> hands<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.830> flex<00:01:24.070> really<00:01:24.370> naturally<00:01:24.820> so

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
the hands to flex really naturally so

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.860 
the hands to flex really naturally so
they've<00:01:25.510> used<00:01:25.780> this<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:28.180> difficult<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.690> see<00:01:28.840> I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
they've used this is difficult to see I

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.960 
they've used this is difficult to see I
think<00:01:28.960> on<00:01:29.260> camera<00:01:29.560> but<00:01:29.710> they<00:01:30.250> use<00:01:30.460> this<00:01:30.610> kind

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
think on camera but they use this kind

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.700 
think on camera but they use this kind
of<00:01:31.060> very<00:01:31.480> thin<00:01:31.540> lightweight<00:01:32.140> mesh<00:01:32.530> material

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
of very thin lightweight mesh material

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.700 
of very thin lightweight mesh material
at<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.160> back<00:01:33.400> of<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.610> bottom<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.390> hand

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
at the back of the bottom of the hand

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.520 
at the back of the bottom of the hand
then<00:01:35.710> across<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.190> middle<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.550> glove<00:01:36.820> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
then across the middle of the glove and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.350 
then across the middle of the glove and
then<00:01:38.530> through<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.520> fingers<00:01:39.940> it's<00:01:40.120> difficult

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
then through the fingers it's difficult

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.030 
then through the fingers it's difficult
to<00:01:40.480> see<00:01:40.630> because<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.930> black<00:01:41.170> but<00:01:41.440> their

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
to see because the black but their

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.200 
to see because the black but their
segments<00:01:42.520> there<00:01:42.700> across<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.940> fingers

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
segments there across the fingers

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.300 
segments there across the fingers
crossed<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.750> of<00:01:43.869> course<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.860> just<00:01:44.890> made

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
crossed and of course and it just made

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.600 
crossed and of course and it just made
means<00:01:45.640> that<00:01:45.910> that<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.930> glove<00:01:47.200> flex<00:01:48.070> is<00:01:48.220> very

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
means that that the glove flex is very

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.450 
means that that the glove flex is very
nicely<00:01:48.880> very<00:01:49.270> naturally<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.979> fit<00:01:51.160> to<00:01:51.340> the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
nicely very naturally the fit to the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.620 
nicely very naturally the fit to the
fingers<00:01:51.760> are<00:01:51.850> all<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.030> perfect<00:01:52.450> length

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
fingers are all the perfect length

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.170 
fingers are all the perfect length
you're<00:01:53.380> not<00:01:53.500> going<00:01:53.650> any<00:01:53.770> extra<00:01:54.040> space<00:01:54.310> which

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
you're not going any extra space which

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.469 
you're not going any extra space which
can<00:01:55.330> sometimes<00:01:55.510> have<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.910> negative<00:01:58.270> cut

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
can sometimes have and the negative cut

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.350 
can sometimes have and the negative cut
too<00:01:58.720> nice<00:01:59.380> snug<00:01:59.710> fit<00:01:59.740> by<00:02:00.250> negative<00:02:00.670> cook<00:02:00.880> laws

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.660 

not<00:02:04.360> too<00:02:04.570> tired<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:05.200> really<00:02:05.890> like<00:02:05.979> feeling<00:02:06.430> very

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
not too tired I really like feeling very

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.160 
not too tired I really like feeling very
nice

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.510 

so<00:02:15.170> that's<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.379> brush<00:02:15.590> Magna<00:02:15.980> pro-am<00:02:16.370> one

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
so that's the brush Magna pro-am one

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.190 
so that's the brush Magna pro-am one
from<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.910> ringer<00:02:17.150> goalkeeper<00:02:17.660> gloves<00:02:17.840> really

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
from the ringer goalkeeper gloves really
