00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
actually going to be 25% more cushion

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.720 
actually going to be 25% more cushion
than<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.500> previous<00:00:36.890> model<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.370> that's

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
than the previous model and that's

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.520 
than the previous model and that's
largely<00:00:38.120> in<00:00:38.329> part<00:00:38.479> to<00:00:38.569> the<00:00:38.780> use<00:00:38.960> of<00:00:39.109> the<00:00:39.199> super

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
largely in part to the use of the super

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.939 
largely in part to the use of the super

cushioning super plush feel Bruce keeps

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.750 
cushioning super plush feel Bruce keeps
comparing<00:01:00.559> it<00:01:00.769> to<00:01:00.799> running<00:01:01.159> on<00:01:01.249> clouds

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
comparing it to running on clouds

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.939 
comparing it to running on clouds
but<00:01:02.179> this<00:01:02.389> cushioning<00:01:02.809> is<00:01:02.989> gonna<00:01:03.379> adapt<00:01:03.739> it

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
but this cushioning is gonna adapt it

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.700 
but this cushioning is gonna adapt it
each<00:01:04.339> individual<00:01:05.030> stride<00:01:05.269> you<00:01:05.630> take<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.560> much

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
each individual stride you take so much

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.340 
each individual stride you take so much
like<00:01:06.890> in<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.070> transcend<00:01:07.670> Brooks<00:01:08.330> uses<00:01:09.110> in<00:01:09.260> the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
like in the transcend Brooks uses in the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.860 
like in the transcend Brooks uses in the
glycerin<00:01:09.740> 12<00:01:09.979> a<00:01:10.280> rounded<00:01:10.850> heel<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.600> idea

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
glycerin 12 a rounded heel and the idea

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.390 
glycerin 12 a rounded heel and the idea
behind<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:12.290> is<00:01:12.650> going<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:12.890> help<00:01:12.980> you<00:01:13.130> kind<00:01:13.250> of

behind that is going to help you kind of

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.980 
behind that is going to help you kind of
roll<00:01:13.700> through<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.030> gate<00:01:14.210> cycle<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.600> little<00:01:14.870> bit

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
roll through the gate cycle a little bit

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.140 
roll through the gate cycle a little bit
better<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.470> help<00:01:15.950> promote<00:01:16.430> more<00:01:16.940> of<00:01:17.060> a

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
better and help promote more of a

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.450 
better and help promote more of a
smoother<00:01:17.600> transition<00:01:17.870> from<00:01:18.740> rear<00:01:18.980> foot<00:01:19.190> to

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
smoother transition from rear foot to

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.850 
smoother transition from rear foot to
forefoot<00:01:19.880> yes<00:01:20.360> also<00:01:20.930> helping<00:01:21.500> smooth<00:01:21.770> out

forefoot yes also helping smooth out
your<00:01:21.890> stride<00:01:22.250> is<00:01:22.610> gonna<00:01:22.850> be<00:01:23.000> its<00:01:23.150> new<00:01:23.330> ideal

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
your stride is gonna be its new ideal

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.380 
your stride is gonna be its new ideal
pressure<00:01:24.410> zones<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.400> gonna<00:01:25.490> help<00:01:25.760> absorb

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
pressure zones this is gonna help absorb

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.590 
pressure zones this is gonna help absorb
the<00:01:26.510> shock<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.170> impact<00:01:27.230> while<00:01:28.220> also

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
the shock and impact while also

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.550 
the shock and impact while also
dispersing<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.660> pressure<00:01:29.870> over<00:01:30.290> a<00:01:30.320> wider

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
dispersing the pressure over a wider

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.890 
dispersing the pressure over a wider
surface<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.790> is<00:01:31.940> going<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.150> give<00:01:32.270> you<00:01:32.390> once
