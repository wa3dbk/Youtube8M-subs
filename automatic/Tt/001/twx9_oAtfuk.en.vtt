great<00:00:18.600> club<00:00:19.020> level<00:00:19.350> local<00:00:19.980> musician<00:00:20.869> hardware

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
great club level local musician hardware

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.920 
great club level local musician hardware
it's<00:00:22.350> great<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.449> medium

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
it's great because it's you know medium

it's great because it's you know medium
weight<00:00:25.140> tubing<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> single<00:00:26.970> braised<00:00:27.180> bass

weight tubing with a single braised bass

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.939 
weight tubing with a single braised bass
so<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.810> don't<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.199> lot<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.410> extra<00:00:28.769> weight

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
so you don't have a lot of extra weight

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.439 
so you don't have a lot of extra weight
when<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.460> comes<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.000> night<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.359> when

our hardware we're developing our
motorcycle<00:01:16.860> factory<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.280> Indonesia<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
motorcycle factory in Indonesia so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 
motorcycle factory in Indonesia so
there's<00:01:18.600> where<00:01:18.750> our<00:01:18.960> legendary<00:01:19.619> durability

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
there's where our legendary durability

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.399 
there's where our legendary durability
comes<00:01:20.430> from<00:01:20.700> these<00:01:21.090> castings<00:01:21.689> are<00:01:21.840> cast<00:01:22.170> in

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
comes from these castings are cast in

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.410 
comes from these castings are cast in
the<00:01:22.500> same<00:01:22.680> style<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> motorcycle<00:01:23.670> part<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the same style as a motorcycle part is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.660 
the same style as a motorcycle part is
and<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.689> chrome<00:01:25.290> plating<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> same<00:01:26.430> kind

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and the chrome plating is the same kind

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
and the chrome plating is the same kind
of<00:01:26.790> chrome<00:01:27.000> plating<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:27.869> use<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
of chrome plating that we use on the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
of chrome plating that we use on the
handlebars<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> mufflers<00:01:29.880> on

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
handlebars and the mufflers on

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.149 
handlebars and the mufflers on
motorcycles<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:30.930> very<00:01:31.079> durable<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:31.799> if

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
motorcycles so it's very durable so if

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.760 
motorcycles so it's very durable so if

the little stress points down there you

are<00:02:33.810> hardened<00:02:34.230> steel<00:02:34.530> bolts<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:36.380> if<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.530> do

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
are hardened steel bolts so if you do

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.550 
are hardened steel bolts so if you do
this<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.220> few<00:02:38.880> thousand<00:02:39.480> times<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> mild

this a few thousand times with a mild
steel<00:02:40.950> bolt<00:02:41.310> you'll<00:02:41.550> flatten<00:02:42.030> into<00:02:42.210> that<00:02:42.390> bolt

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
steel bolt you'll flatten into that bolt

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.600 
steel bolt you'll flatten into that bolt
it'll<00:02:42.990> become<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.260> larger<00:02:43.620> diameter<00:02:43.800> when<00:02:44.520> you

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
it'll become a larger diameter when you

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.370 
it'll become a larger diameter when you
back<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.060> out<00:02:45.240> through<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.510> threads<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.170> can
