the first tip I have is actually for
when<00:00:05.920> you're<00:00:06.040> casting<00:00:06.220> on<00:00:06.609> I<00:00:06.850> like<00:00:07.029> to<00:00:07.149> tell

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:07.300 
when you're casting on I like to tell

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.690 
when you're casting on I like to tell
students<00:00:08.260> from<00:00:08.920> teaching<00:00:09.130> them<00:00:09.340> how<00:00:09.370> to<00:00:09.460> do

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
students from teaching them how to do

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.220 
students from teaching them how to do
finishing<00:00:10.240> that<00:00:10.660> you<00:00:10.809> should<00:00:10.960> start<00:00:11.169> thinking

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
finishing that you should start thinking

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.480 
finishing that you should start thinking
of<00:00:11.559> your<00:00:11.679> finishing<00:00:12.070> when<00:00:12.219> you<00:00:12.339> actually

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
of your finishing when you actually

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.129 
of your finishing when you actually
start<00:00:12.730> your<00:00:13.089> project<00:00:13.240> and<00:00:13.690> this<00:00:13.809> is<00:00:13.959> what<00:00:14.110> I

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
start your project and this is what I

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.810 
start your project and this is what I
mean<00:00:14.379> this<00:00:14.740> is<00:00:14.919> just<00:00:14.950> one<00:00:15.280> of<00:00:15.309> the<00:00:15.490> things<00:00:15.639> I

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
mean this is just one of the things I

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.120 
mean this is just one of the things I
mean<00:00:15.999> when<00:00:16.600> you<00:00:16.690> cast<00:00:16.900> on<00:00:17.140> try<00:00:17.860> to<00:00:17.890> leave<00:00:18.100> a

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
mean when you cast on try to leave a

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.189 
mean when you cast on try to leave a
long<00:00:18.369> tail<00:00:18.400> so<00:00:19.179> later<00:00:19.390> you<00:00:19.480> can<00:00:19.720> go<00:00:19.869> and<00:00:20.080> so

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
long tail so later you can go and so

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.109 
long tail so later you can go and so
your<00:00:20.349> scenes<00:00:20.590> up<00:00:20.800> with<00:00:21.070> that<00:00:21.250> tail<00:00:21.490> you<00:00:21.970> don't

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
your scenes up with that tail you don't

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.400 
your scenes up with that tail you don't
have<00:00:22.210> to<00:00:22.300> start<00:00:22.539> a<00:00:22.599> new<00:00:22.779> thing<00:00:22.990> because<00:00:23.199> if<00:00:23.320> you

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
have to start a new thing because if you

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.290 
have to start a new thing because if you
start<00:00:23.619> a<00:00:23.740> new<00:00:23.890> piece<00:00:24.039> of<00:00:24.070> yarn<00:00:24.429> not<00:00:25.000> only<00:00:25.119> do

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
start a new piece of yarn not only do

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.759 
start a new piece of yarn not only do
you<00:00:25.330> have<00:00:25.480> to<00:00:25.539> weave<00:00:25.810> in<00:00:25.839> this<00:00:26.109> one<00:00:26.349> you'll

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
you have to weave in this one you'll

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.279 
you have to weave in this one you'll
have<00:00:26.890> to<00:00:27.009> leave<00:00:27.130> in<00:00:27.279> that<00:00:27.490> end<00:00:27.699> so<00:00:28.570> it<00:00:29.019> just

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
have to leave in that end so it just

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.870 
have to leave in that end so it just
saves<00:00:29.410> some<00:00:29.589> time<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:30.039> a<00:00:30.550> little<00:00:30.759> bit<00:00:30.820> of

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
saves some time and a little bit of

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.640 
saves some time and a little bit of
weaving<00:00:31.210> and<00:00:31.300> effort<00:00:31.630> and<00:00:31.810> looks<00:00:32.169> neater<00:00:32.410> if

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
weaving and effort and looks neater if

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.810 
weaving and effort and looks neater if
you<00:00:32.740> just<00:00:32.920> leave<00:00:33.010> a<00:00:33.070> tail<00:00:33.280> in<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.520> first<00:00:33.700> place

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
you just leave a tail in the first place

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.139 
you just leave a tail in the first place
a<00:00:34.680> good<00:00:35.680> rule<00:00:35.800> of<00:00:35.860> thumb<00:00:35.980> for<00:00:36.190> joining<00:00:37.000> new

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
a good rule of thumb for joining new

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.600 
a good rule of thumb for joining new
yarn<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:37.600> to<00:00:37.780> never<00:00:37.930> not<00:00:38.410> it<00:00:38.649> what<00:00:39.309> we<00:00:39.399> like<00:00:39.579> to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
yarn is to never not it what we like to

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.590 
yarn is to never not it what we like to
do<00:00:39.850> is<00:00:40.180> we<00:00:40.539> cut<00:00:41.050> or<00:00:41.320> pull<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.039> rip<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.489> yarn<00:00:42.670> the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
do is we cut or pull a rip the yarn the

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.150 
do is we cut or pull a rip the yarn the
old<00:00:43.780> one<00:00:43.930> or<00:00:44.140> maybe<00:00:44.410> it's<00:00:44.590> just<00:00:44.649> running<00:00:45.010> out

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
old one or maybe it's just running out

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.560 
old one or maybe it's just running out
but<00:00:45.460> try<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.789> notice<00:00:46.180> when<00:00:46.300> you're<00:00:46.449> running

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
but try to notice when you're running

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.119 
but try to notice when you're running
out<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.750> yarn<00:00:46.989> and<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:47.500> want<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.739> do<00:00:47.829> it<00:00:47.949> at<00:00:48.039> the

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
out of yarn and you want to do it at the

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.610 
out of yarn and you want to do it at the
edges<00:00:48.309> of<00:00:48.489> your<00:00:48.609> Y<00:00:48.760> art<00:00:48.940> of<00:00:49.120> your<00:00:49.239> knitting

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
edges of your Y art of your knitting

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.750 
edges of your Y art of your knitting
we'll<00:00:50.620> talk<00:00:50.800> about<00:00:50.949> if<00:00:51.309> you're<00:00:51.489> knitting<00:00:51.640> a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
we'll talk about if you're knitting a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.459 
we'll talk about if you're knitting a
piece<00:00:51.910> in<00:00:52.059> the<00:00:52.149> round<00:00:52.359> that<00:00:52.539> has<00:00:52.660> no<00:00:52.899> edges<00:00:53.260> in

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
piece in the round that has no edges in

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.439 
piece in the round that has no edges in
just<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.190> second<00:00:54.550> i'll<00:00:54.910> show<00:00:55.090> you<00:00:55.149> what<00:00:55.300> i<00:00:55.390> do

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
just a second i'll show you what i do

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.529 
just a second i'll show you what i do
then<00:00:55.719> so<00:00:56.559> to<00:00:56.920> join<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.219> new<00:00:57.309> yarn<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
then so to join the new yarn you

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.990 
then so to join the new yarn you
probably<00:00:59.469> want<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.649> avoid<00:00:59.739> nuts<00:01:00.100> because<00:01:00.309> they

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
probably want to avoid nuts because they

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.250 
probably want to avoid nuts because they
can't<00:01:01.239> come<00:01:01.359> and<00:01:01.510> done<00:01:01.629> but<00:01:01.780> if<00:01:01.899> you<00:01:02.019> need<00:01:02.170> to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
can't come and done but if you need to

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.380 
can't come and done but if you need to
get<00:01:02.350> started<00:01:02.530> with<00:01:03.160> a<00:01:03.190> knot<00:01:03.370> you<00:01:04.059> can<00:01:04.210> make<00:01:04.360> a

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
get started with a knot you can make a

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.260 
get started with a knot you can make a
loose<00:01:04.770> square<00:01:05.770> knot<00:01:06.630> right<00:01:07.630> there<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:09.270> knit

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
loose square knot right there and knit

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.030 
loose square knot right there and knit
with<00:01:10.390> your<00:01:10.540> new<00:01:10.659> yarn<00:01:10.930> but<00:01:11.740> you're<00:01:11.890> going<00:01:11.979> to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
with your new yarn but you're going to

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.830 
with your new yarn but you're going to
have<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.250> come<00:01:12.400> back<00:01:12.430> later<00:01:12.759> undo<00:01:13.360> this<00:01:13.540> and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
have to come back later undo this and

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.539 
have to come back later undo this and
we've<00:01:14.140> in<00:01:14.259> those<00:01:14.439> ends<00:01:14.650> don't<00:01:15.100> leave<00:01:15.280> them<00:01:15.430> out

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
we've in those ends don't leave them out

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.940 
we've in those ends don't leave them out
there<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:16.630> you<00:01:16.750> leave<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.020> not<00:01:17.170> there<00:01:17.409> most

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
there if you leave the not there most

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.380 
there if you leave the not there most
likely<00:01:18.159> it's<00:01:18.310> going<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.549> loosen<00:01:18.850> up<00:01:18.939> and<00:01:19.150> come

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
likely it's going to loosen up and come

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.940 
likely it's going to loosen up and come
apart<00:01:19.689> while<00:01:20.200> you're<00:01:20.350> wearing<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.740> letter

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
apart while you're wearing this letter

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.390 
apart while you're wearing this letter
you<00:01:21.189> don't<00:01:21.369> want<00:01:21.520> that<00:01:21.670> I<00:01:22.710> don't<00:01:23.710> not<00:01:23.950> my<00:01:24.189> net

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
you don't want that I don't not my net

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.310 
you don't want that I don't not my net
my<00:01:24.610> yarn<00:01:24.909> when<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.299> join<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> new<00:01:25.840> piece<00:01:25.990> of<00:01:26.140> yarn

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
my yarn when I join a new piece of yarn

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.760 
my yarn when I join a new piece of yarn
at<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.619> edge<00:01:27.090> what<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.119> do<00:01:30.899> as<00:01:31.899> I<00:01:32.020> overlap<00:01:32.500> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
at the edge what I do as I overlap the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.580 
at the edge what I do as I overlap the
new<00:01:32.890> yarn<00:01:33.159> and<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.460> old<00:01:34.030> yarn<00:01:34.270> leaving<00:01:35.140> again

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
new yarn and the old yarn leaving again

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.960 
new yarn and the old yarn leaving again
about<00:01:35.799> six<00:01:36.159> inches<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.820> tail<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.759> knit

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
about six inches of the tail and I knit

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.050 
about six inches of the tail and I knit
the<00:01:40.119> first<00:01:40.149> stitch<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.369> sometimes<00:01:42.729> even<00:01:42.850> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
the first stitch and sometimes even the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.639 
the first stitch and sometimes even the
second<00:01:43.390> stitch<00:01:43.540> with<00:01:43.840> both<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.140> those<00:01:44.380> strands

second stitch with both of those strands

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.830 
second stitch with both of those strands
held<00:01:44.860> together<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.460> then<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.119> drop<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.659> old

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
held together and then I drop the old

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.690 
held together and then I drop the old
yarn<00:01:47.079> you<00:01:47.770> want<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:47.979> make<00:01:48.070> sure<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.369> drop<00:01:48.520> the

old yarn I can't tell you how many times

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.990 
old yarn I can't tell you how many times
I've<00:01:50.290> dropped<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.189> wrong<00:01:51.340> one<00:01:51.579> and<00:01:51.610> then<00:01:51.820> run

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
I've dropped the wrong one and then run

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.080 
I've dropped the wrong one and then run
out<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.119> yarn<00:01:52.329> halfway<00:01:52.780> through<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.049> row<00:01:53.200> and

out of yarn halfway through the row and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.160 
out of yarn halfway through the row and
continue<00:01:55.090> knitting<00:01:55.270> with<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.630> new<00:01:55.810> source<00:01:56.049> of

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
continue knitting with the new source of

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.950 
continue knitting with the new source of
yarn<00:01:59.579> you<00:02:00.579> can<00:02:00.700> also<00:02:00.850> do<00:02:01.119> this<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.479> couple

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
yarn you can also do this a couple

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.480 
yarn you can also do this a couple
stitches<00:02:02.259> in<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.770> can<00:02:02.950> knit<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.189> couple

stitches in you can knit a couple

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.190 
stitches in you can knit a couple
stitches<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:03.880> then<00:02:04.119> join<00:02:04.719> in<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.899> new<00:02:05.020> yarn

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
stitches and then join in the new yarn

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.289 
stitches and then join in the new yarn
here<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.680> like<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.640> do<00:02:06.759> it<00:02:06.850> right<00:02:06.939> there<00:02:07.149> at<00:02:07.240> the

here I like to do it right there at the
edge<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.920> will<00:02:09.039> eventually<00:02:09.220> be<00:02:09.520> hidden<00:02:09.789> by<00:02:09.910> a

edge this will eventually be hidden by a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.580 
edge this will eventually be hidden by a
seam<00:02:10.180> if<00:02:10.300> you're<00:02:10.420> going<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.570> be<00:02:10.690> seeming<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.170> so

whether you decide to not the yarn
loosely<00:02:14.470> go<00:02:14.740> back<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.250> unknot

loosely go back and unknot

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.369

you're<00:02:20.410> going<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.620> want<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:20.800> come<00:02:20.920> up<00:02:21.040> with

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
you're going to want to come up with

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.309 
you're going to want to come up with
some<00:02:21.370> way<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.519> keep<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.849> secure<00:02:22.180> because<00:02:22.360> the

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
some way to keep it secure because the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.690 
some way to keep it secure because the
alternative<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.129> just<00:02:24.280> start<00:02:24.430> knitting

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
alternative is to just start knitting

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.670 
alternative is to just start knitting
with<00:02:24.879> your<00:02:25.060> new<00:02:25.180> yarn<00:02:25.450> which<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.349> totally<00:02:26.650> fine

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
with your new yarn which is totally fine

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.860 
with your new yarn which is totally fine
if<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:27.129> can<00:02:27.280> manage<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.700> but<00:02:28.269> I<00:02:28.450> find<00:02:28.750> that

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
if you can manage it but I find that

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.500 
if you can manage it but I find that
when<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.019> do<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:30.790> back<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.209> look<00:02:31.420> at

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
when I do this I go back and I look at

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.360 
when I do this I go back and I look at
that<00:02:31.629> stitch<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.830> tends<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.220> get<00:02:33.310> really

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
that stitch and this tends to get really

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.790 
that stitch and this tends to get really
loose<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:35.110> can<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.349> really<00:02:35.530> hard<00:02:35.680> to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
loose and it can be really hard to

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.199 
loose and it can be really hard to
seeing<00:02:36.099> that<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.459> also<00:02:36.730> can<00:02:36.849> be<00:02:36.880> hard<00:02:37.120> to

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
seeing that it also can be hard to

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.699 
seeing that it also can be hard to
tighten<00:02:37.569> it<00:02:37.630> up<00:02:37.720> you<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.260> tighten<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.650> up

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
tighten it up you can tighten it up

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.280 
tighten it up you can tighten it up
somewhat<00:02:39.099> but<00:02:39.310> it's<00:02:40.180> just<00:02:40.420> not<00:02:40.569> very<00:02:40.599> neat<00:02:41.019> so

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
somewhat but it's just not very neat so

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.559 
somewhat but it's just not very neat so
I<00:02:41.530> recommend<00:02:41.819> finding<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:43.030> way<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.269> you<00:02:43.299> like

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
I recommend finding a way that you like

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.930 
I recommend finding a way that you like
to<00:02:43.780> keep<00:02:44.230> those<00:02:44.440> pretty<00:02:44.830> secure<00:02:45.280> when<00:02:45.819> you're

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
to keep those pretty secure when you're

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.089 
to keep those pretty secure when you're
joining<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.299> new<00:02:46.420> yard<00:02:46.890> let's<00:02:47.890> talk<00:02:47.980> about

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
joining a new yard let's talk about

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.009 
joining a new yard let's talk about
another<00:02:48.370> situation<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.330> I'm<00:02:49.690> going<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.930> keep

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
another situation so I'm going to keep

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.460 
another situation so I'm going to keep
knitting<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.410> row<00:02:51.150> another<00:02:52.150> situation<00:02:52.470> that

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
knitting this row another situation that

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.199 
knitting this row another situation that
you<00:02:53.709> might<00:02:53.890> have<00:02:53.920> is<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.760> need<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.030> join

you might have is that you need to join

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.240 
you might have is that you need to join
new<00:02:55.480> yarn<00:02:55.780> in<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.500> middle<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.829> project<00:02:57.010> that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
you one of my absolute favorite tricks

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.759 
you one of my absolute favorite tricks
and<00:03:09.670> it's<00:03:09.790> called<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.120> spit<00:03:10.360> splice<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.930> yes

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
and it's called the spit splice and yes

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.199 
and it's called the spit splice and yes
it's<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.040> little<00:03:12.280> gross<00:03:12.459> but<00:03:12.519> you<00:03:12.910> don't<00:03:13.090> need

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
it's a little gross but you don't need

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.880 
it's a little gross but you don't need
to<00:03:13.269> use<00:03:13.480> spit<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:14.380> need<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.620> get<00:03:14.739> the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
to use spit you just need to get the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.740 
to use spit you just need to get the
yarn<00:03:15.099> moist<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:15.910> basically<00:03:16.480> what<00:03:16.630> we're

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
yarn moist and basically what we're

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.589 
yarn moist and basically what we're
going<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.930> do<00:03:17.140> is<00:03:17.430> felt<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.519> be<00:03:18.640> on<00:03:18.819> together<00:03:19.090> so

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
going to do is felt to be on together so

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.330 
going to do is felt to be on together so
this<00:03:19.930> obviously<00:03:20.079> will<00:03:20.500> only<00:03:20.650> work<00:03:20.920> with<00:03:21.100> wool

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
this obviously will only work with wool

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.280 
this obviously will only work with wool
fibers<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:22.299> can<00:03:22.510> work<00:03:22.630> with<00:03:22.780> little<00:03:23.049> pack<00:03:23.260> of

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
fibers it can work with little pack of

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.629 
fibers it can work with little pack of
lens<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:23.950> might<00:03:24.069> take<00:03:24.100> me<00:03:24.340> other<00:03:24.459> one

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
lens but it might take me other one

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.610 
lens but it might take me other one
leave<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.540> edges<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.870> little<00:03:26.019> bit<00:03:26.290> rough<00:03:26.440> this

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
leave the edges a little bit rough this

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.289 
leave the edges a little bit rough this
is<00:03:26.769> going<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:26.980> be<00:03:27.069> easier<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.430> felt<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:28.150> can

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
is going to be easier to felt you can

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.660 
is going to be easier to felt you can
tease<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.660> apart<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.959> little<00:03:29.079> bit<00:03:29.310> do<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.459> same

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
tease it apart a little bit do the same

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.629 
tease it apart a little bit do the same
with<00:03:30.819> your<00:03:30.970> other<00:03:31.090> end<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.630> if<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.739> has<00:03:32.889> two

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
with your other end and if it has two

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.670 
with your other end and if it has two
plies<00:03:33.880> like<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.329> Strand<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.840> yarn<00:03:34.900> does<00:03:35.260> you

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
plies like the Strand of yarn does you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.470 
plies like the Strand of yarn does you
can<00:03:35.859> even<00:03:35.980> take<00:03:36.430> away<00:03:36.670> one<00:03:36.850> of<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.030> plies<00:03:37.239> on

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
can even take away one of the plies on

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.750 
can even take away one of the plies on
each<00:03:37.630> side<00:03:37.900> I'm<00:03:38.590> just<00:03:38.920> going<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.190> try<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.370> as

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
each side I'm just going to try this as

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.289 
each side I'm just going to try this as
is<00:03:41.519> overlap<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.760> strands<00:03:43.920> and<00:03:44.940> this<00:03:45.940> is<00:03:46.090> where

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
is overlap the strands and this is where

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.150 
is overlap the strands and this is where
you<00:03:46.780> are<00:03:46.810> going<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.350> want<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.620> get<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.889> sweat

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
you are going to want to get the sweat

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.319 
you are going to want to get the sweat
either<00:03:48.459> with<00:03:48.670> water<00:03:48.910> or<00:03:49.319> spit<00:03:50.319> okay<00:03:51.329> after

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
either with water or spit okay after

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.789 
either with water or spit okay after
you've<00:03:52.450> gotten<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:52.810> wet<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.170> can<00:03:53.470> just<00:03:53.560> let<00:03:53.709> you

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
you've gotten it wet I can just let you

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:54.990 
you've gotten it wet I can just let you
assume<00:03:54.069> that<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:54.280> did<00:03:54.459> it<00:03:54.549> in<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.700> most

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
assume that I did it in the most

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.360 
assume that I did it in the most
ladylike<00:03:55.299> fashion<00:03:55.920> you're<00:03:56.920> going<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.190> rub

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
ladylike fashion you're going to rub

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.559 
ladylike fashion you're going to rub
these<00:03:57.519> strands<00:03:57.819> together<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.389> make<00:03:58.540> sure

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
these strands together and make sure

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.210 
these strands together and make sure
they<00:03:58.780> don't<00:03:58.810> come<00:03:59.049> apart<00:03:59.139> some<00:03:59.739> overlapped<00:04:00.099> in

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
they don't come apart some overlapped in

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.589 
they don't come apart some overlapped in
your<00:04:00.340> hand<00:04:00.519> you<00:04:00.760> can<00:04:00.880> check<00:04:01.000> on<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.299> every<00:04:01.359> once

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
your hand you can check on it every once

your hand you can check on it every once
in<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.780> while<00:04:01.900> just<00:04:02.709> rub<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:02.950> rub<00:04:03.310> your<00:04:03.489> hands

back<00:04:03.819> and<00:04:03.880> forth<00:04:04.440> really<00:04:05.440> fast<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.980> want<00:04:06.160> to

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
back and forth really fast you want to

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.129 
back and forth really fast you want to
build<00:04:06.340> up<00:04:06.489> some<00:04:06.639> heat<00:04:06.900> because<00:04:07.900> what<00:04:08.049> you're

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
build up some heat because what you're

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.020 
build up some heat because what you're
doing<00:04:08.200> is<00:04:08.530> you're<00:04:08.590> felting<00:04:09.069> you're<00:04:09.549> agitating

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
doing is you're felting you're agitating

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.740 
doing is you're felting you're agitating
the<00:04:10.120> fibers<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.630> interlocking<00:04:11.079> them<00:04:11.349> to<00:04:12.099> join

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
the fibers and interlocking them to join

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.620 
the fibers and interlocking them to join
to<00:04:13.750> join<00:04:13.780> them<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:15.190> I'm<00:04:15.430> tugging<00:04:15.760> on<00:04:16.000> it<00:04:16.060> pretty

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
to join them so I'm tugging on it pretty

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.330 
to join them so I'm tugging on it pretty
firmly<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.470> can<00:04:17.620> see<00:04:17.769> that<00:04:17.799> it's<00:04:18.010> felt<00:04:18.220> it

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
firmly you can see that it's felt it

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.150 
firmly you can see that it's felt it
just<00:04:18.549> fine<00:04:18.760> totally<00:04:19.539> secure<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.289> can<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:20.829> see

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
just fine totally secure and can you see

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.210 
just fine totally secure and can you see
the<00:04:21.280> join<00:04:21.489> I<00:04:22.349> mean<00:04:23.349> you<00:04:23.620> might<00:04:23.710> see<00:04:23.979> whether

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
the join I mean you might see whether

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.430 
the join I mean you might see whether
yarn<00:04:24.430> is<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.580> little<00:04:24.849> messy<00:04:25.120> but<00:04:25.150> I<00:04:25.690> can't

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
yarn is a little messy but I can't

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.980 
yarn is a little messy but I can't
really<00:04:26.560> tell<00:04:26.770> where<00:04:26.919> I<00:04:26.950> joined<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.990> once

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
really tell where I joined it once

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.700 
really tell where I joined it once
you're<00:04:29.140> confident

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
you're confident

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.530 
you're confident
that<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.640> fibers<00:04:30.820> have<00:04:31.090> been<00:04:31.210> felted

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
that the fibers have been felted

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.970 
that the fibers have been felted
together<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:33.610> can<00:04:33.760> just<00:04:33.910> continue<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.630> knit

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
together you can just continue to knit

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.110 
together you can just continue to knit
you<00:04:35.980> might<00:04:36.130> have<00:04:36.250> a<00:04:36.280> little<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.730> didn't<00:04:37.030> do<00:04:37.090> it

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
you might have a little I didn't do it

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
you might have a little I didn't do it
that<00:04:37.240> well<00:04:37.510> let's<00:04:37.840> see<00:04:39.030> just<00:04:40.030> make<00:04:40.780> sure<00:04:40.810> that

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
that well let's see just make sure that

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.990 
that well let's see just make sure that
any<00:04:41.380> ends<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:41.920> maybe<00:04:42.190> didn't<00:04:42.460> get<00:04:42.550> belted<00:04:42.850> in

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
tips and tricks I pulled everyone in our

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.340 
tips and tricks I pulled everyone in our
office<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.510> I<00:05:00.570> basically<00:05:00.780> came<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.260> the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
office and I basically came to the

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.440 
office and I basically came to the
conclusion<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.890> you<00:05:02.670> should<00:05:02.850> use<00:05:03.090> what

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
conclusion that you should use what

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.080 
conclusion that you should use what
works<00:05:03.570> for<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.890> your<00:05:05.250> specific<00:05:05.700> project

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
works for you and your specific project

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.790 
works for you and your specific project
and<00:05:06.240> yarn<00:05:06.480> and<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:07.110> probably<00:05:07.320> want<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.650> know<00:05:07.770> a

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
and yarn and you probably want to know a

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.500 
and yarn and you probably want to know a
few<00:05:07.980> methods<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:09.060> i'm<00:05:09.150> going<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.330> show<00:05:09.480> you

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
few methods and i'm going to show you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.690 
few methods and i'm going to show you
with<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:09.870> just<00:05:10.470> so<00:05:10.500> you<00:05:10.620> can<00:05:10.800> figure<00:05:11.040> out<00:05:11.190> you

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
with you just so you can figure out you

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.090 
with you just so you can figure out you
know<00:05:11.730> what<00:05:11.970> works<00:05:12.210> for<00:05:12.450> that<00:05:12.510> specific

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
know what works for that specific

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.070 
know what works for that specific
situation<00:05:14.100> so<00:05:14.820> let's<00:05:15.390> say<00:05:15.540> this<00:05:15.570> is<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.870> wrong

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
situation so let's say this is the wrong

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.810 
situation so let's say this is the wrong
side<00:05:16.350> of<00:05:16.470> stockinette<00:05:16.830> actually<00:05:17.490> I'm<00:05:17.700> going

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
side of stockinette actually I'm going

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.460 
side of stockinette actually I'm going
to<00:05:17.910> get<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.120> yarn<00:05:18.300> up<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:19.140> stockinette

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
to get the yarn up to the stockinette

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.710 
to get the yarn up to the stockinette
portion<00:05:19.980> because<00:05:20.760> right<00:05:20.940> here<00:05:20.970> I've<00:05:21.330> had<00:05:21.510> some

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
portion because right here I've had some

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.590 
portion because right here I've had some
garter<00:05:21.990> on<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.230> edges<00:05:22.940> what<00:05:23.940> I<00:05:23.970> like<00:05:24.210> to<00:05:24.330> do<00:05:24.450> to

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
garter on the edges what I like to do to

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.740 
garter on the edges what I like to do to
hide<00:05:24.750> my<00:05:24.960> ends<00:05:25.290> is<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:26.040> like<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.310> go<00:05:26.640> and<00:05:26.940> I

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
hide my ends is I like to go and I

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.610 
hide my ends is I like to go and I
basically<00:05:27.900> retrace<00:05:29.720> or<00:05:30.720> not<00:05:30.990> retrace<00:05:31.290> I<00:05:31.440> go

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
basically retrace or not retrace I go

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.230 
basically retrace or not retrace I go
into<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:32.040> backs<00:05:32.250> let's<00:05:32.670> see<00:05:32.760> here's<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.030> purl

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
into the backs let's see here's a purl

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.340 
into the backs let's see here's a purl
bump<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.630> go<00:05:34.500> in<00:05:34.830> there<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.990> then<00:05:36.990> there's<00:05:37.170> one

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
bump I go in there and then there's one

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.110 
bump I go in there and then there's one
right<00:05:37.620> next<00:05:37.770> to<00:05:37.950> it<00:05:38.010> I<00:05:38.250> go<00:05:38.460> down<00:05:38.700> through<00:05:38.940> there

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
right next to it I go down through there

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.600 
right next to it I go down through there
so<00:05:39.930> you<00:05:40.320> know<00:05:40.440> these<00:05:40.710> are<00:05:40.860> what<00:05:41.250> i<00:05:41.280> would<00:05:41.460> call

go back and weave in your ends i
actually<00:05:50.580> like<00:05:50.940> to<00:05:51.150> reverse<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.960> direction

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
actually like to reverse the direction

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.600 
actually like to reverse the direction
at<00:05:52.440> some<00:05:52.590> point<00:05:52.770> let's<00:05:52.950> say<00:05:53.010> I've<00:05:53.160> woven<00:05:53.430> in

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
at some point let's say I've woven in

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.810 
at some point let's say I've woven in
for<00:05:53.790> about<00:05:53.940> an<00:05:54.030> inch<00:05:54.180> go<00:05:54.990> back<00:05:55.170> and<00:05:55.700> do<00:05:56.700> the

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
for about an inch go back and do the

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:06.170 
for about an inch go back and do the
same<00:05:57.000> right<00:05:57.270> on<00:05:57.390> top<00:05:57.600> of<00:05:57.870> what<00:05:57.990> you<00:05:58.080> just<00:05:58.110> did

some people like to go down in the

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.059 
some people like to go down in the
diagonal<00:06:09.520> I<00:06:10.380> don't<00:06:11.380> know<00:06:11.440> why<00:06:11.590> something

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
diagonal I don't know why something

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.249 
diagonal I don't know why something
about<00:06:12.250> me<00:06:12.430> just<00:06:12.669> that<00:06:13.030> bothers<00:06:13.389> me<00:06:13.569> could<00:06:14.110> be<00:06:14.229> a

about me just that bothers me could be a

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.920 
about me just that bothers me could be a
Virgo<00:06:14.680> type<00:06:15.039> a<00:06:15.280> linear<00:06:16.000> thing<00:06:16.090> I<00:06:16.539> don't<00:06:16.720> know

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
Virgo type a linear thing I don't know

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.339 
Virgo type a linear thing I don't know
just<00:06:17.710> bugs<00:06:17.979> me<00:06:18.099> to<00:06:18.250> see<00:06:18.449> diagonal<00:06:19.449> and<00:06:19.660> all<00:06:19.870> the

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
just bugs me to see diagonal and all the

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:23.809 
just bugs me to see diagonal and all the
rest<00:06:20.500> of<00:06:20.590> the<00:06:20.710> knitting<00:06:20.949> is<00:06:21.069> so<00:06:21.870> great<00:06:22.870> like

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
rest of the knitting is so great like

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.309 
rest of the knitting is so great like
but<00:06:24.819> you<00:06:25.000> know<00:06:25.120> what<00:06:25.300> if<00:06:25.599> it's<00:06:25.900> a<00:06:25.990> bulky<00:06:26.289> yarn

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
but you know what if it's a bulky yarn

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.629 
but you know what if it's a bulky yarn
that<00:06:26.650> could<00:06:26.830> actually<00:06:26.919> help<00:06:27.190> to<00:06:27.310> hide<00:06:27.520> the

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
that could actually help to hide the

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.189 
that could actually help to hide the
bulk<00:06:27.819> it's<00:06:28.090> not<00:06:28.240> all<00:06:28.360> built<00:06:28.539> up<00:06:28.630> in<00:06:28.810> one<00:06:28.960> spot

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
bulk it's not all built up in one spot

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.050 
bulk it's not all built up in one spot
so<00:06:29.560> maybe<00:06:29.740> I<00:06:29.830> don't<00:06:30.009> mind<00:06:30.160> it<00:06:30.250> that<00:06:30.400> much<00:06:30.580> so

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
so maybe I don't mind it that much so

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.110 
so maybe I don't mind it that much so
we've<00:06:31.360> talked<00:06:31.599> about<00:06:31.840> how<00:06:32.080> to<00:06:32.400> weave<00:06:33.400> in<00:06:33.550> wool

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
we've talked about how to weave in wool

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.120 
we've talked about how to weave in wool
yarns<00:06:34.599> and<00:06:34.810> we'll<00:06:35.349> all<00:06:35.530> Packer<00:06:35.710> blends<00:06:35.979> are

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
yarns and we'll all Packer blends are

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.800 
yarns and we'll all Packer blends are
really<00:06:36.849> they<00:06:37.150> tend<00:06:37.360> to<00:06:37.419> be<00:06:37.539> well-behaved

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
really they tend to be well-behaved

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.010 
really they tend to be well-behaved
because<00:06:38.470> they<00:06:38.830> are<00:06:39.449> naturally<00:06:40.449> sticky<00:06:40.870> and

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
because they are naturally sticky and

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.270 
because they are naturally sticky and
they<00:06:41.110> Stick<00:06:41.349> to<00:06:41.380> themselves<00:06:41.500> and<00:06:42.039> they<00:06:42.099> don't

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
they Stick to themselves and they don't

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.700 
they Stick to themselves and they don't
slide<00:06:43.060> everywhere<00:06:43.570> but<00:06:44.139> let's<00:06:44.320> say<00:06:44.470> you're

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
slide everywhere but let's say you're

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.860 
slide everywhere but let's say you're
working<00:06:44.979> in<00:06:45.070> a<00:06:45.160> cotton<00:06:45.490> or<00:06:45.610> silk<00:06:45.820> blend<00:06:46.120> and

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
working in a cotton or silk blend and

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.200 
working in a cotton or silk blend and
let's<00:06:47.080> say<00:06:47.229> that<00:06:47.380> it's<00:06:47.500> applied<00:06:47.770> and<00:06:48.130> what<00:06:49.120> I'm

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
let's say that it's applied and what I'm

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.490 
let's say that it's applied and what I'm
going<00:06:49.240> to<00:06:49.389> do<00:06:49.599> is<00:06:49.810> I'm<00:06:49.900> going<00:06:49.960> to<00:06:50.110> separate

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
going to do is I'm going to separate

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.080 
going to do is I'm going to separate
those<00:06:50.710> plies<00:06:50.949> let's<00:06:51.490> pretend<00:06:51.789> this<00:06:51.849> is<00:06:52.060> a

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
those plies let's pretend this is a

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.860 
those plies let's pretend this is a
Cotton's<00:06:52.479> love<00:06:52.660> blood<00:06:52.870> and<00:06:53.280> I'm<00:06:54.280> going<00:06:54.669> to<00:06:54.870> see

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
Cotton's love blood and I'm going to see

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.219 
Cotton's love blood and I'm going to see
this<00:06:56.110> is<00:06:56.289> wool<00:06:56.470> so<00:06:56.710> it's<00:06:56.860> sticking<00:06:57.070> together

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
this is wool so it's sticking together

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:00.749 
this is wool so it's sticking together
what<00:06:59.229> you're<00:06:59.349> going<00:06:59.500> to<00:06:59.560> do<00:07:00.070> or<00:07:00.430> if<00:07:00.550> it's<00:07:00.669> a

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 
what you're going to do or if it's a

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.339 
what you're going to do or if it's a
chunky<00:07:01.120> yarn<00:07:01.240> actually<00:07:01.659> this<00:07:01.810> works<00:07:02.020> well<00:07:02.199> for

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349 
chunky yarn actually this works well for

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.950 
chunky yarn actually this works well for
chunky<00:07:02.590> yarns<00:07:02.830> as<00:07:02.979> well<00:07:03.539> you<00:07:04.539> can<00:07:04.659> split<00:07:04.810> the

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
chunky yarns as well you can split the

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.909 
chunky yarns as well you can split the
ply<00:07:05.169> and<00:07:06.810> this<00:07:07.810> is<00:07:07.960> practically<00:07:08.440> roving<00:07:08.800> so

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 
ply and this is practically roving so

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:09.810 
ply and this is practically roving so
I'm<00:07:08.979> going<00:07:09.099> to<00:07:09.159> want<00:07:09.250> to<00:07:09.310> be<00:07:09.430> really<00:07:09.639> careful

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
I'm going to want to be really careful

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.070 
I'm going to want to be really careful
because<00:07:10.030> it's<00:07:10.330> just<00:07:10.539> going<00:07:10.659> to<00:07:10.690> want<00:07:10.870> to<00:07:10.960> come

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
because it's just going to want to come

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.920 
because it's just going to want to come
apart<00:07:11.349> like<00:07:11.650> cotton<00:07:12.099> candy<00:07:12.720> so<00:07:13.720> let's<00:07:13.840> apply

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
apart like cotton candy so let's apply

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.409 
apart like cotton candy so let's apply
and<00:07:14.320> weave<00:07:14.919> in<00:07:15.070> however<00:07:15.430> you<00:07:15.909> are<00:07:15.940> choosing<00:07:16.270> to

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419 
and weave in however you are choosing to

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:21.300 
and weave in however you are choosing to
weave<00:07:16.630> in<00:07:16.780> the<00:07:16.870> ends<00:07:17.020> oops<00:07:19.830> in<00:07:20.830> one<00:07:21.099> direction

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
weave in the ends oops in one direction

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.909 
weave in the ends oops in one direction
with<00:07:21.849> one<00:07:22.000> of<00:07:22.090> the<00:07:22.150> plies<00:07:22.590> you<00:07:23.590> could<00:07:23.740> probably

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 
with one of the plies you could probably

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.570 
with one of the plies you could probably
guess<00:07:24.130> where<00:07:24.340> I'm<00:07:24.430> going<00:07:24.699> with<00:07:24.820> this<00:07:26.370> go<00:07:27.370> back

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:27.580 
guess where I'm going with this go back

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.310 
guess where I'm going with this go back
and<00:07:27.880> we've<00:07:28.060> that<00:07:28.270> other<00:07:28.449> apply<00:07:28.870> in<00:07:29.199> the

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320 
and we've that other apply in the

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.020 
and we've that other apply in the
opposite<00:07:29.650> direction<00:07:29.800> and<00:07:30.370> it<00:07:30.460> just<00:07:30.639> splits<00:07:30.849> up

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.030 
opposite direction and it just splits up

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.209 
opposite direction and it just splits up
the<00:07:31.180> bulk<00:07:31.360> and<00:07:31.630> for<00:07:32.440> cotton<00:07:32.710> and<00:07:32.860> silk<00:07:33.070> it

00:07:33.209 --> 00:07:33.219 
the bulk and for cotton and silk it

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:34.649 
the bulk and for cotton and silk it
makes<00:07:33.400> it<00:07:33.520> a<00:07:33.580> little<00:07:33.699> harder<00:07:34.090> for<00:07:34.330> everything

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:34.659 
makes it a little harder for everything

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:36.959 
makes it a little harder for everything
to<00:07:34.750> come<00:07:34.780> undone<00:07:35.490> another<00:07:36.490> trick<00:07:36.669> people

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:36.969 
to come undone another trick people

00:07:36.969 --> 00:07:38.939 
to come undone another trick people
might<00:07:37.150> recommend<00:07:37.449> for<00:07:37.960> cotton<00:07:38.380> and<00:07:38.530> silk<00:07:38.770> is

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:38.949 
might recommend for cotton and silk is

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:42.060 
might recommend for cotton and silk is
you<00:07:39.729> can<00:07:39.880> actually<00:07:39.909> sew<00:07:40.750> the<00:07:40.960> ends<00:07:41.139> down<00:07:41.409> let's

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.070 
you can actually sew the ends down let's

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.830 
you can actually sew the ends down let's
say<00:07:42.190> you're<00:07:42.340> weaving<00:07:42.550> into<00:07:42.789> a<00:07:42.940> corner<00:07:43.360> you<00:07:43.719> can

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 
say you're weaving into a corner you can

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.719 
say you're weaving into a corner you can
actually<00:07:44.020> get<00:07:44.259> cotton<00:07:44.860> sewing<00:07:45.159> thread<00:07:45.400> and<00:07:45.610> a

regular sewing needle and tack it down a
little<00:07:47.680> bit<00:07:47.889> that'll<00:07:48.219> keep<00:07:48.340> it<00:07:48.490> from<00:07:48.520> sliding

00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:49.409 
little bit that'll keep it from sliding
