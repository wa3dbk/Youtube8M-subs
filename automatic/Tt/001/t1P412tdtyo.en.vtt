00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.990
Yeah I'm going back to India in about 3 weeks.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.040
I opened up a wrestling school.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.840
It's going really good, I have almost 45,
50 students there.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:33.410
So I have plans to put on a wrestling show
in June or July.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.930
So yeah I'm busy all the time bro.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.530
(Who are some of your favorite opponents?

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.330
Favorite Matches)

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.110
I enjoyed matches against the Undertaker.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:58.380
He's a very good wrestler, every time I fight
him I feel very proud.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:12.340
Triple H, Batista, Kane, John Cena...you know
there's a lot of good wrestlers I feel very

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.260
proud to have wrestled such big stars.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.310
(Is there any chance you will go back to WWE?

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.290
Maybe WrestleMania 32 in Dallas next year?)

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.400
I don't think so because I opened my own wrestling
school.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:37.820
I'm there and very busy so I don't think I'm
going back to WWE but you never know.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.060
(Can we just show the comparison?

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.840
I don't have a tiny hand but compared to you
man wow!)

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.800
(Do you have anything to say about the Booker
T show we saw here tonight?)

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.570
I liked the show today.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.240
3-5 matches.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.259
I enjoyed, it was really good.

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.060
Good crowd, audience, management.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.660
I liked the show, it was good.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.959
(Any message to Booker T?)

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.320
Booker T is like my best friend.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.010
He's the best.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:28.010
Good wrestler, good manager, good talker...you
know just a superstar.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.850
(Thank you very much for your time sir)

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.270
Thank you sir.
