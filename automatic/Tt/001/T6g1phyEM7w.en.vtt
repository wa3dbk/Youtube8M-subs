00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello everyone and welcome to 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.410
 doctissimo for your health menu 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.759
 devoted to the education of children and 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.700
 to talk about it I have the pleasure of 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.570
 to receive stÃ©phane clerget child psychiatrist 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.020
 and right away we listen to the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.640
 question of colette colette asks 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
 how much time per day can we 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.750
 let a 4 year old girl look at the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.619
 television 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.090
 it makes a clergy must be honest 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.920
 TV can give us some 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.910
 services to us parents when you have to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.410
 go prepare the meal for example 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.000
 know it's a good nanny because 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.280
 that you are on your child does not 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.260
 no stupidity finally normally 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.190
 so it's pretty good anyway yes 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.899
 knowing that there are others we 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.160
 the fact that they can play everything 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.780
 only if you teach him to play alone 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.890
 it's also good news to have 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.550
 been we are sure he does it anyway 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.020
 less nonsense 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.980
 yes it's true but then after it takes 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.020
 maybe also a little choose his 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.000
 programs that's also putting a cd a 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.930
 name but because that with your much 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.239
 specialists tend to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.850
 to demonize television but is it 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.230
 it's open because it's embarrassing 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.789
 the time spent watching TV actually at 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.420
 beyond content content in general 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.980
 parents are watching 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.149
 but it's the time, but 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.860
 it's true that the more the child goes from 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.970
 time in front of the TV is much more and the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.799
 month time for other activities 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.119
 beneficial to its development four 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.650
 years for example what is the age of the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 little girl from colette should be 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.920
 how much time do I think that 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.700
 I advise it's an hour a year 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.990
 of age per week with a max of 12 so 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 a 4 year old four hours of TV 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.200
 per week okay in the holidays on 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 is a lot more is going fast and that 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.720
 to respond to a child who harasses you 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.560
 to watch TV because 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.990
 it's true that some people have the impression 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.970
 that they do not know how to play alone 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.700
 returns in this edition they have 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.829
 bad to know the one to watch TV 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.049
 the more it indicates that he is 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.520
 dependent on the TV and more there is 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.990
 actually need them 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.979
 learn to play alone and that's true 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.149
 that kids who spend a lot of 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.490
 time in front of the TV precisely a lot 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.229
 struggling to play alone 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.549
 so I think we have to offer him 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.950
 actually other others 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.240
 activities or so if one is available 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.619
 to do things with him if he comes 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.790
 harass us because while we 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.170
 is doing their part to 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.340
 watch TV tell him now 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.920
 come come help me then do not 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.020
 to help me set the table very well 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.380
 citizen kg and thanks for knowing about your 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.380
 question
