what you consider to be better so for

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.530 
what you consider to be better so for
example<00:00:30.570> if<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.160> want<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.730> always

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
example if I have if I want to always

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.850 
example if I have if I want to always
improve<00:00:33.840> my<00:00:34.350> chest<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.130> I'm<00:00:36.120> wearing<00:00:36.989> leather

improve my chest and I'm wearing leather

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.150 
improve my chest and I'm wearing leather
cuz<00:00:38.790> I'm<00:00:38.940> low<00:00:39.149> level<00:00:39.540> right<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:41.010> want

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
cuz I'm low level right now and I want

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.730 
cuz I'm low level right now and I want
to<00:00:41.280> target<00:00:41.489> intellect<00:00:42.059> because<00:00:42.390> I'm<00:00:42.510> hashanah

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.980 

so<00:00:48.340> what's<00:00:48.760> going<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:49.000> happen<00:00:49.360> is<00:00:49.480> every<00:00:49.780> time

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
so what's going to happen is every time

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.970 
so what's going to happen is every time
I<00:00:50.230> Aleut<00:00:50.770> a<00:00:51.070> chest<00:00:51.640> item<00:00:52.060> or<00:00:52.720> a<00:00:52.780> bio<00:00:53.230> test<00:00:53.560> item

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
or a gain one from request r/a bot is

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.270 
or a gain one from request r/a bot is
going<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.630> check<00:00:58.960> your<00:00:59.110> inventory<00:00:59.650> to<00:00:59.860> see<00:01:00.070> if

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
that just item is better than what you

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.560 
that just item is better than what you
have<00:01:02.380> equipped<00:01:02.770> it<00:01:03.370> will<00:01:03.640> check<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.150> see<00:01:04.360> if

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
have equipped it will check to see if

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.750 
have equipped it will check to see if
the<00:01:04.690> material<00:01:05.050> matches<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.950> rule<00:01:06.160> so<00:01:06.460> if<00:01:06.580> you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
the material matches the rule so if you

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.090 
the material matches the rule so if you
loop<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.240> cloth<00:01:07.570> just<00:01:07.840> item<00:01:08.350> it<00:01:08.500> will<00:01:08.530> just<00:01:08.860> skip

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
loop a cloth just item it will just skip

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.850 
loop a cloth just item it will just skip
it<00:01:09.160> it<00:01:09.910> will<00:01:10.090> next<00:01:10.300> check<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:11.020> intellect<00:01:11.590> on

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
it it will next check the intellect on

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.100 
it it will next check the intellect on
both<00:01:12.130> items<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.910> one<00:01:13.120> in<00:01:13.270> your<00:01:13.300> inventory<00:01:13.870> and

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
again this is a level specific and this

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.210 
again this is a level specific and this
won't<00:01:30.340> change<00:01:30.520> very<00:01:30.850> much<00:01:31.270> for<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.720> so<00:01:32.220> most

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
most people are fine setting it 1

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.860 
most people are fine setting it 1
through<00:01:35.890> 40<00:01:36.369> for<00:01:36.580> example

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
through 40 for example

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.870 
through 40 for example
ok<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.860> next<00:01:39.890> thing<00:01:40.130> we<00:01:40.370> have<00:01:40.550> is<00:01:40.730> to

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
ok the next thing we have is to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
and this is where you set rules will you

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.580 
and this is where you set rules will you

create an during healing remember this

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.060 
create an during healing remember this
is<00:05:10.360> level<00:05:10.570> specific<00:05:11.290> so<00:05:11.470> if<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.650> want<00:05:11.830> five

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070
