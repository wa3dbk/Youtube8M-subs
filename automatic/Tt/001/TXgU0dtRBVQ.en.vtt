00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.520
 very good everyone that we have one more day 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.899
 with us on this occasion before 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.639
 you ask what is this that no 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.929
 we are seeing the inconvenience today 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.999
 I come to bring a video of these that 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.440
 I bring very often how 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:14.209
 customize our league of legends 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.970
 we have already taught how to change the music 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.380
 the login screen different things today bng 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.760
 tell you how to change what is the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.010
 launcher physical appearance 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.440
 we have the typical rice here with the 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.970
 links and here the slice out are these 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.700
 images that keep changing informing us 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.990
 of things then let's show how 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.460
 change all this to have something more 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.929
 personalized 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.120
 so what we have to do is 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:37.960
 precarize our watering folder 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.120
 legends here we have it 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.320
 which is usually in riot games discs 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.270
 league of legends and then already 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.850
 we would find the 5 cards that you have 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.070
 here also before you start 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.570
 deepen the first thing you have to do 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.149
 is to download the file that you tell the 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.800
 description of this same video which 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.449
 it's called changing the launcher by teneis 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.670
 gamers what we miss we have this 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.440
 carpetita so I had it all 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.760
 prepared and let's start 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.850
 The first thing you 're going to do is let's 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.619
 remove as I said this the slide shot 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.090
 who are these images because as we go 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.310
 to put a background image that goes to 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.050
 occupy all the box because this we 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.070
 wash lid and it will be a bit ugly if 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.450
 that the first thing to do is that 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.899
 let's close the launcher nothing in 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.470
 any kind of problem let's go there rats 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.240
 let's go to projects 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.280
 let's go to draw blanchett since 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.910
 we are looking for launcher let's go to 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.800
 managed files and here we are going to try 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.900
 look for it we can do two things or 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.570
 look for it in the folder or it's usually 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.360
 this in the last in the last issue of 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.420
 cases on the 29th we will go down and here there will be 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.340
 a small swf file that will be called 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.270
 slideshow these are the advertising to be 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.160
 images we have seen 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.020
 just to not lose it in case 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.630
 we want to use later we are going to put 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.740
 a one back and let's go with this and the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.810
 system does not take it in the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.790
 configuration and it no longer no longer catches it worth 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.500
 let's see how it is going to go back 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.870
 and show how it is simply to 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.820
 that you see that this change has already been made 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.890
 let's see the launcher again and here 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.990
 You see that we have taken away what would be 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.800
 the little box this now there is no longer 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.630
 kind of this shit already and let's start 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.030
 with the theme we are going to change the image of 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.970
 enrique for it already we entered in the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.390
 folder that was made download and here 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.600
 we will find different Launchers 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.400
 to use first basic launcher we are going to 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.780
 go to the width is basic let's grab and 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.520
 we are going to copy the one we want the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.850
 that we like for example I know 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.590
 we're going to copy it from Harvard 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.069
 we are going to minimize this rent and we are going to 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.900
 go to cracks 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:39.799
 projects the launcher 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.200
 managed files and here we are going to look for a 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.000
 file are called swf rats in my house what 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.459
 I have in 17 you just look for it and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.860
 you find it and here we have it before 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.299
 we're going to put a 1 of the 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.730
 same way so that I do not take it as 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.859
 the slide show and we're going to copy it and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.750
 let's rename this file as rats 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.240
 simply 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.790
 once done this we would have our 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.319
 night let's try it out to see if it has 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.239
 caught up to any kind of problem 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.969
 and here we have our garden arrives 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.920
 powerful in which we can already give 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.599
 to play we have the launcher there you have 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.389
 several launcher I have left you 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.430
 different types I will put a handsome 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.499
 this is one that good that is the opposite 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.090
 are going to close we are going to put one that 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.660
 I really like the truth that 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.530
 I also included it in the pack 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.590
 who is in 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.630
 second no launcher op 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.630
 here we have two lounge europe to me 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.040
 like is the gorgeous one that is gorgeous 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.730
 we're not going to copy 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.910
 the same process grands projets launcher 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.150
 managed file in my case on 17 and here 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.720
 we are going to remove this conrad which is the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.060
 hardware and we're going to paste cool rats 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.530
 what we re name we simply put 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.090
 rats and you're going to freak out with coffee 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.400
 launcher that I'm going to leave a little gift 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.830
 from tn pillser we go back there we go to 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.410
 see him 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.150
 we open it 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.520
 and here we have the piece of what 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.160
 they write tremendously handsome to me the 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.630
 I really like this one that 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.220
 is this being launcher is removed 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.830
 totally the advertising of all not you 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.210
 Leave no garbage and set aside in batches to 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.920
 the typical play but leave here the 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.450
 typical login that good to me 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.330
 I really like this launcher for what 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.920
 we are going to cheat separately because 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.050
 you will be asking how safe the 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.150
 more savvy because we have three 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.940
 folders the basic laser is like the one 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.290
 we've seen from harvard that are 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.540
 simply change it already works 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.610
 we have the ope launcher that are these 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.750
 two things left of jacques and one of 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.370
 topic 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.660
 that changed a bit is like this one I've already 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.160
 seen since it changes a lot what 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.050
 it's the lunch and then we have the problem 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.330
 of a design this happens because I've 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.070
 left here other other reds are going to 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.320
 be for example the collapse we are going to 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.240
 copy this is exactly the same 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.289
 process but you have to make a small 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.809
 variation 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.240
 projects that repetitive is doing 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:05:00.020
 this is going to managed file in my case the 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.340
 17 you know, let's run from jacques and 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.540
 we hit the collapse 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.540
 we are going to change it 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.400
 and let's see what is done and now 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.020
 we will see that there is a small problem 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.180
 here we are going to open it 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.729
 and we see that it takes us perfectly 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.680
 which is the launcher rumble but we 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.440
 puts a defined on the finest one 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.090
 defined this is exactly the same if you 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.009
 we give a the fine here it's great that 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.870
 is playing will work for us but if 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.550
 we want to be more pros and remove it what 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.930
 only thing we have to do is in the 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.350
 folder that you have downloaded that is 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.010
 mine 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.750
 within problems are of fainé we have 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.660
 two folders the raid that is where we have 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.070
 taken the sw and the usr here the lunch 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.750
 we just have to copy this that 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.730
 are watching here we are going to copy also 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.200
 and let's go to the folder of our 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.870
 league of legends let's do the 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.480
 process but this time it's rights projects 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.700
 the launcher releases attentive with this 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.730
 then we will serve the last number 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.860
 that we have in my case the 29 deploy and 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.130
 here we will change in the lunches that 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.990
 let's have a 1 at the end 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.670
 and let's just stick the 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.590
 copy with this 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.030
 it replaces what are the letters of a 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.050
 define and we will prove that everything 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.110
 works correctly 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.550
 we open now and now we can see 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.020
 what exactly is the same night that 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.909
 we had before collapsing and it puts us 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.830
 been online and now we take everything 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.539
 well I say beach is authorized and play 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.759
 so I do not expect you liked it 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.770
 it has been a bit quick for us you can put 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.620
 all your comments doubt what 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.930
 you want in a comment you already know that

 with you want and subscribe to channel if still 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.710

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.389
 how many launchers I have many more 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.740
 I do not know if they can be in the description 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.229
