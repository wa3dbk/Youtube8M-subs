00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.340
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.180
 next part of talents reporter on 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:12.179
 My talent today is my talent 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.650
 which certainly the last months everyone 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.560
 football fan out there a concept 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.970
 has become and current number 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.640
 one at the s04 timo wellenreuther 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.829
 Timo Wellenreuther and 19 years young 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.630
 born in karlsruhe there is also before 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:31.109
 that worries came from the u19 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.870
 then has in the u19 at fc schalke 04 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.859
 played and is actually intended 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.570
 been only for the second time 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.399
 team at Schalke in the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.629
 regionalliga west probably also the season 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.600
 already got 16 inserts got there 23 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.449
 Goals and played coach to zero 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.070
 yes now in the first league he came 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.039
 already on seven missions with nine 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.649
 and once again to zero in 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.909
 the champions league with 2 1 sets five 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.280
 Goals and no play at zero 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.589
 timo no waves today 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.979
 national team played so far in the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.960
 Youth area has also stop before 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.750
 Astoria Walldorf is played from there 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.329
 out then to the co2 sc has changed there 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.710
 go through the youth departments and there 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.610
 is as I said now at 04 Schalke 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.329
 actually for the second team 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.869
 provided but due to the 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:31.340
 injury severity at Schalke 04 here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.620
 The keeper number 102 is injured there 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.630
 is the mobile robot number three and 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.750
 happy about that going on of course that 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.070
 he now rages as keeper number Kreyenfeld in 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.810
 the champions league ran for example 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.390
 allowed against real madrid and now too 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.130
 already mentioned nine inserts in the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.620
 got first football league 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.900
 timo wellenreuther what about him 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.420
 say so now appears the first 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.970
 Player where I'm a bit more critical 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.140
 to express the anklamer nasa 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.400
 in positive terms, but to him 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.180
 Wellenreuther now the last game 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.060
 again against hertha bsc berlin 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.980
 It's a bit for me 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:18.490
 makes two patzer sound play there 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:22.330
 will be 22 wave reuther so I see it 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.280
 so if one of the stemkeepers gets fit again 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.680
 then he is not gone quickly 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.600
 then we will not be back from the window 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.160
 to hear a lot from him and with certainty 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.350
 not so much in the future 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.210
 I just see it so he has a lot of light 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.530
 and shadow 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.850
 now in his services yes in 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.489
 Lately, from above he has shadow and 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.130
 that 's easy at schalke level 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:52.900
 Schalke there with the goal of champions 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:57.760
 league at least currently and the kick 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.010
 europe league with yes so are natural 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.200
 not wellenreuther tornow guilty of that 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.760
 There is a clapboard in the Europa League 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.430
 that was certainly synonymous 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.270
 the entire season that is a rather 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.209
 worse performance came about 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.780
 a team effort then but in total 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.780
 wave reuther 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.969
 is already new with players like manual 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.969
 compared in my opinion quite 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:25.469
 Making big mistakes means more 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.129
 from the media that is in the end 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:30.629
 No matter if you have huge pressure on it 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.680
 19-year expansion of the first of the 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:39.239
 year 20 years young 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.950
 but I am clearly of the opinion there 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.239
 is not yet for the bundesliga 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.669
 created second team before 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.919
 played and plays in the regionalliga 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:52.469
 then suddenly three leagues higher against 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:58.290
 the fc bavaria against cristian ronaldo in 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:04:01.069
 the champions league hamburg los 19 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.180
 years but I really see it now 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.889
 behind achievements I now 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.680
 could look in the last few 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:10.650
 I have to play in the champions league 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.040
 honestly , that's not the way to say that 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.939
 huge players are approaching us in the 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.310
 Schalke goal 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.500
 so by no means a next 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.180
 Manuel Neuer 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.830
 in my opinion you can do it yourself 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.259
 Write in the comments as you do that 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.509
 See if he says yes first 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.520
 huge talent from him is the very very 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:33.210
 Great even is said to have a say 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.060
 time and said he sees it that way that 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.310
 he does not really do his services 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.470
 could convince 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.599
 One should not be clear about the 19-year-old 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.370
 so much criticism is still up 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.099
 hard to do that then of course there 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.409
 but he is professional and that is natural 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.810
 Of course he has to do business with it 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.789
 can handle as well as for me 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.340
 I also work in the interviews 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.380
 so listened to see him 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.790
 not really upset there 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.980
 actually always mastered well 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.570
 So from the radiation forth there already 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.750
 that's good but that's just not enough 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:15.130
 his performance in my opinion 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:17.490
 not yet bundesliga level I am 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.530
 curious what schalke intends to do with him 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.560
 if they really keep him that long 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.230
 want and then in front of want to a very 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.790
 becomes really big or really 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.290
 say this in two years' time 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:35.950
 Offer for you from the second third 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.050
 league accepts and then played there 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.570
 at least now with us the regionalliga 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:46.390
 Maybe the risky one is a guy 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.530
 Rensing are therefore also on the roller coaster 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.010
 is really a jump made 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.900
 made a breakthrough on his 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.990
 The inserts did not get that 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.430
 really good at that time were now with 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.930
 a second league at fortuna 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.690
 dÃ¼sseldorf is undisputed 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.130
 coming player 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.840
 yes so what could I look at waves 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.510
 today also has names that I have 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.250
 now done only once in any case 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.780
 but I think it will be quite 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.290
 quickly forget everything again with 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:17.320
 it is my opinion, you have to 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.410
 times eliminated critically expresses so sees 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.760
 the conclusion for me, I guess we 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.600
 but the next year will not be like that 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.250
 quickly something from him again soon 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.620
 Again one of Schalke goalkeepers fit 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.250
 is say I'm off again 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.750
 window 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.450
 First, take a rest 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.210
 which of course was good for him 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.770
 is the pressure on him at the moment? 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.780
 of course is enormous 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.590
 oh so 19-year-old everyone looks natural 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.700
 to him in every game that too 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.700
 underestimate 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.750
 Well that was it to Timo Wellenreuther he 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.120
 you could write the comments 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.530
 Maybe you see the same 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.290
 or you say that 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.300
 absolute rubbish I see it all 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.650
 different 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.410
 then you liked it so far then 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.340
 load thumbs up I would 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.900
 I am very happy 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.520
 yes and maybe write in the 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.540
 comments what I can always improve 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.250
 That helps me alot 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.770
 and then look at the other one too 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:15.000
 talente reports to then on the us im 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.000
 next video again makes it good
