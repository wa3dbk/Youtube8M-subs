00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:14.400
 Hello everyone, I am here at the Magnum tent on the Olympia weekend with WBFF pros Ingrid Romero and Bree Lind. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.200
 And of course they are the fitness girls, so ladies tell me what you are going to do here today. 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400
 And some people you've met. What does Magnum stand for? 4 I am here with my sponsor's Magnum and we are doing the promotion here together with the supplement producer. In fact, I mainly meet people. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.600
 So you are here all weekend at the Magnum tent, 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.900
 welcoming and meeting people, I like that. And Ingrid what do you do? I've seen you walk around here 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.600
 do you have a break? What is happening here? I'm just having fun. I didn't decide this year 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.700
 to work but just enjoy myself and enjoy the shows. And I do that now. We are going to party tonight, 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.400
 we give a party to the fitness girls magazine. It is a new fitness magazine, very hip and Bree is on the 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.300
 front page this month, she is very enthusiastic about it. Party? Where is my invitation, why don't I know anything about this? 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.800
 You can just walk in. See my invitation here. 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.900
 It's from Robert Rich so ... He's welcome everywhere! I have an invitation, I think that's cool. I saw 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.500
 both of you a few weeks ago in Canada. You all looked great on stage. Do you have some 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.500
 tips for winning combinations What made you in shape to climb the stage? Bree? 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.000
 Diet, diet, diet and lots of cardio. probably 3 hours of training per day. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.800
 Wait. 3 hours? 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.300
 Yes and an hour and a half cardio. 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.300
 and an hour and a half with weights. And then we haven't talked about the posing exercises. So it's nice 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.300
 to go back to a more normal routine. Let me throw it out: you just have to work very hard for it, 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.100
 we see all those girls here and on the front pages. And I saw your front page and it looked really good. The 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.100
 looks great and you have to work hard for that. We work 365 days a year. It is not 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.400
 only before and after the show, it goes on all year round. It is a lifestyle, indeed a lifestyle. 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.900
 I know there are a lot of guys out there 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.000
 want to appear in magazines and on stages, be a fitness model. I'm sure there are a lot of girls out there 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.000
 want tips from you 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.100
 that may be above them for some of these girls. I think it's about networking. You want as much as possible 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.700
 build contacts and leave a good impression. You know, being a hard worker and 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.300
 never give up. Keep following your dreams Because someday they will come true. 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.900
 That is great advice. Ingrid, I was wondering something 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.600
 I hear an accent when you talk You don't sound like us, the Americans who are here. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 Sorry. 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.300
 Canadians Europeans ... We have a great mix here. How 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.900
 did you go from spain to america? 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.600
 I still don't understand, to be honest. 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.700
 I have traveled for 9 years. I am originally from Barcelona, ​​Spain. I have traveled all over the world 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.100
 I lived in London for 1 year. I lived in Ireland, Dublin. I have lived in Mexico that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.000
 was great. I lived in Mexico, that was great. And in the end I started to feel at home in America. 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.000
 I am very happy that I am here and all my dreams come true. 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.400
 And it is true, it is because of networking, networking and never giving up. 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.000
 And because we are not liars. I think that rule is number 1: Don't be someone you don't want to be. 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.800
 Say, stay modest ladies. 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.300
 That's great: work hard, train a lot, be consistent, take your supplements and one day you can too 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.100
 there are, on the front page of Fitness Girls or like me, between two WBFF beauties. 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.200
 See you later, this Olympia weekend. 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.000
 Bye!
