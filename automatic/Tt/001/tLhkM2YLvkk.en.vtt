so<00:01:36.140> much<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.380> Memphis<00:01:36.800> but<00:01:36.979> you<00:01:37.130> can<00:01:37.280> do

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
so much a Memphis but you can do

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.919 
so much a Memphis but you can do
everything<00:01:37.520> on<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.970> quarter<00:01:38.240> turn<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.810> I

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
everything on the quarter turn and I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.590 
everything on the quarter turn and I
think<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.520> he<00:01:40.520> figured<00:01:40.850> out<00:01:40.970> that<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.300> have

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
think that he figured out that you have

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.660 
think that he figured out that you have
to<00:01:41.840> take<00:01:42.590> control<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.130> game<00:01:43.250> at<00:01:43.429> the<00:01:43.550> end

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
to take control of the game at the end

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.719 
to take control of the game at the end

help with that experience well I think

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.649 
help with that experience well I think
it's

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
it's

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.800 
it's
we<00:01:56.780> kept<00:01:57.409> us<00:01:57.560> called<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:58.219> 10<00:01:58.969> because<00:01:59.149> in<00:01:59.659> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
we kept us called a 10 because in the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.739 
we kept us called a 10 because in the
third<00:01:59.990> quarter<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.469> believe<00:02:00.829> that<00:02:01.509> much<00:02:02.509> of<00:02:02.689> the

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
third quarter I believe that much of the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:04.179 
third quarter I believe that much of the
things<00:02:03.020> aren't<00:02:03.229> wearing<00:02:03.409> gold<00:02:03.710> friends<00:02:04.039> we

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
things aren't wearing gold friends we

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.240 
things aren't wearing gold friends we
can<00:02:04.369> play<00:02:04.579> offense<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.179> we<00:02:05.420> do<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.409> know<00:02:06.530> we

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
can play offense and we do you know we

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.830 
can play offense and we do you know we
were<00:02:07.399> you<00:02:07.670> were<00:02:07.789> expecting<00:02:08.269> calls<00:02:08.509> that<00:02:08.690> we're

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
were you were expecting calls that we're

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.320 
were you were expecting calls that we're
not<00:02:08.929> supposed<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.679> get<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.340> we<00:02:10.670> got<00:02:10.849> softer

not supposed to get and we got softer
but<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.720> think<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.170> we<00:02:12.590> us<00:02:13.250> stand<00:02:13.640> together<00:02:13.790> as

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
but I think that we us stand together as

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.729 
but I think that we us stand together as
a<00:02:14.180> team<00:02:14.480> by<00:02:14.660> keeping<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.080> boring<00:02:15.470> so

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
a team by keeping the boring so

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.640
