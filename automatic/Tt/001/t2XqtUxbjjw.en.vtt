00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
inside of most of the fleet so we had

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.380 
inside of most of the fleet so we had
first<00:01:42.860> access<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.490> all<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.759> new<00:01:43.880> breeds<00:01:44.210> and

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
first access to all the new breeds and

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.029 
first access to all the new breeds and
we<00:01:44.450> were<00:01:44.539> able<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:44.810> kind<00:01:45.080> of<00:01:45.229> combat<00:01:45.979> the

since<00:02:41.150> we've<00:02:41.420> taken<00:02:41.660> on<00:02:41.900> a<00:02:41.930> pretty<00:02:42.140> pretty<00:02:42.650> big

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
since we've taken on a pretty pretty big

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.560 
since we've taken on a pretty pretty big
restoration<00:02:43.370> project<00:02:43.820> it's<00:02:44.120> an<00:02:44.420> ongoing

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570

project hasn't ended yet probably the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.620 
project hasn't ended yet probably the
most<00:02:47.720> notable<00:02:47.930> thing<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.590> we<00:02:48.800> replaced<00:02:49.250> our

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
most notable thing is we replaced our
