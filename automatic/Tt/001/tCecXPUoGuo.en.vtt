00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.060 
good weather-wise sunny 90-95 very very
hot<00:02:38.990> but<00:02:39.990> we<00:02:40.620> doing<00:02:40.890> well<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:42.020> having<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.890> lot

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
hot but we doing well and having a lot

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.090 
hot but we doing well and having a lot
of<00:02:44.100> fun<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.820> this<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.840> certainly<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.320> lifestyle

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
of fun and this is certainly a lifestyle

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.250 
of fun and this is certainly a lifestyle
but<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.400> think<00:02:47.730> both<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:47.970> us<00:02:48.270> could<00:02:48.540> very<00:02:49.200> much

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
but I think both of us could very much

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.199 
but I think both of us could very much
get<00:02:49.680> used<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.440> saylon<00:02:52.860> has<00:02:53.070> been<00:02:53.400> a

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
get used to and the saylon has been a

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.560

lot<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.110> fun<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.910> it's<00:02:56.910> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.090> be<00:02:57.209> tough<00:02:57.390> to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
lot of fun and it's going to be tough to

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.240 
lot of fun and it's going to be tough to
go<00:02:57.690> back<00:02:57.930> towards<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.380> end<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.739> week<00:02:58.950> but

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250
