00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:02.480
 rock 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.660
 capturing ando present 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.480
 alcatraz 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.879
 5 for a player with 48 different challenges 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:15.269
 in different difficulties the material is this 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:20.319
 everything is very well contained in this house this is a box that we open for you 

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:21.419
 this way 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.339
 already inside contains good month cards for the other challenges 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.739
 and the different walls walls we want ultras needing forgiveness 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.120
 haitham we enter the character the stairs 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.270
 These cards are printed on both sides and here they indicate where 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.270
 we have to place the different walls 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.300
 we are going to show you that we have an armed one here 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.620
 The stairs of the world are indicated by an arrow that tires tiresome and 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.510
 background 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.370
 and the starting point is for us to put our perÃ³n with lemos 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.350
 now this is always in the red 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.700
 i this character can take two or three steps but they are never in the red 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.600
 because if the cameras did not detect it 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.770
 then comes the green will always emerge the same then we go these 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.040
 Two steps 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.390
 i turned once this to emv we have now that is detecting in the green zone 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.780
 we advance you here 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.630
 we turn again 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.730
 now 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.730
 the blue zone is the one that does not have to be 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.260
 now they are not 'the red' so they will continue to play 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
 you have to be very careful that you never finish 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.670
 nor start a step for example here if you set the next one is blue its uses 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.400
 We are going to detect 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.500
 we progress red hacker 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.940
 Yes now 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.840
 for the 1 we can spend 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.250
 we decide what it does and nothing else because I eleven that go from the red that is the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.470
 color yes 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.490
 in such a way that then we keep moving forward 3 remember not one two or three 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.920
 steps of hours and we arrived at the exit 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.090
 I managed to escape from Alcatraz 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.390
 remember that it's like those colors are the cameras that are watching 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.890
 those areas is why it's important not to end up lying in turn in those 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.730
 colors also well this manual where the answers come though to 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.479
 final goods the solutions to all 48 challenges 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.949
 this is the alcatraz game and this is 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:25.989
 playing antad
