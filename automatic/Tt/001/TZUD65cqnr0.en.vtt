exploding<00:01:53.200> from<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.470> gas<00:01:53.650> pressure<00:01:53.860> buildup

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
exploding from the gas pressure buildup

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.800

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:18.480 

always<00:02:10.340> oil<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.729> is<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.739> oil

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.850 

check<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.330> it

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.680 

fortunately<00:02:25.760> our<00:02:26.440> crucible<00:02:27.440> was<00:02:27.680> preheated

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.190 

so<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.470> going<00:02:31.740> very<00:02:31.920> quickly

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:03:19.250 

and<00:02:38.010> off<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.310> camera<00:02:38.670> here<00:02:38.849> in<00:02:38.940> a<00:02:38.970> second

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.580 

our<00:03:19.739> going<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.069> let<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.280> school<00:03:20.519> for<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.909> moment

our going to let the school for a moment

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.130 
our going to let the school for a moment
cool<00:03:22.890> flip<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.430> over<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.700> have<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> he<00:03:24.750> get<00:03:24.989> me

we<00:03:28.480> have<00:03:28.570> allowed<00:03:28.810> our<00:03:29.080> gold<00:03:29.350> bar<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.830> cool<00:03:30.100> now

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
we have allowed our gold bar to cool now

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.200 
we have allowed our gold bar to cool now
we're<00:03:31.840> going<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.080> flip<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.440> over

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.000

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
you see we have the layer of gold and

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.060 
you see we have the layer of gold and
layer<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.280> flux<00:03:41.440> flux<00:03:42.440> pulls<00:03:42.740> all<00:03:42.950> the

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
layer of flux flux pulls all the

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.920 
layer of flux flux pulls all the
impurities<00:03:43.370> out<00:03:43.700> such<00:03:44.060> as<00:03:44.210> the<00:03:44.330> steel<00:03:44.630> that's

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
impurities out such as the steel that's

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.620 
impurities out such as the steel that's
in<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.080> little<00:03:45.320> chains<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:46.070> whatever<00:03:46.250> else

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
in the little chains and whatever else

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:54.330 
in the little chains and whatever else
you<00:03:47.630> put<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:48.020> in<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.260> water<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.680> cool<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:48.950> off

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.800 

we're<00:03:55.340> lucky<00:03:55.670> it'll<00:03:55.790> separate<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.600> play

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
we're lucky it'll separate and play

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.140 
we're lucky it'll separate and play
quite<00:03:57.080> off<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.380> top

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.970 

and<00:04:00.510> otherwise<00:04:00.840> there's<00:04:01.140> an<00:04:01.230> ancient<00:04:01.440> trick

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
and otherwise there's an ancient trick

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.970 
and otherwise there's an ancient trick
that<00:04:02.430> I'm<00:04:02.519> going<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.760> show<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.000> I'm<00:04:03.330> how<00:04:03.540> to

that I'm going to show you I'm how to

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:11.430 
that I'm going to show you I'm how to

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.490 

oops<00:04:12.440> again

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
oops again

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.949 
oops again
now<00:04:15.100> we'll<00:04:15.310> just<00:04:15.420> scrape<00:04:16.420> off<00:04:16.630> what's<00:04:16.900> left

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
now we'll just scrape off what's left

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.360 
now we'll just scrape off what's left
and<00:04:17.350> get<00:04:18.010> a<00:04:18.040> good<00:04:18.220> clean<00:04:18.459> asset<00:04:20.040> now<00:04:21.040> we're

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
and get a good clean asset now we're

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.220 
and get a good clean asset now we're
going<00:04:21.580> to<00:04:21.700> do<00:04:21.910> an<00:04:22.060> X<00:04:22.210> or<00:04:22.360> F<00:04:22.480> test<00:04:22.780> on<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.380> gold

assay<00:04:32.290> we're<00:04:32.590> showing<00:04:32.800> this<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.370> be<00:04:33.520> at

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.680 

approximately<00:04:37.030> 55%

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.610 

so<00:04:44.320> 55%<00:04:45.220> gold<00:04:48.870> so<00:04:49.870> now<00:04:50.020> we<00:04:50.080> can<00:04:50.260> do<00:04:50.350> our<00:04:50.380> math

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
so 55% gold so now we can do our math

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.850 
so 55% gold so now we can do our math
and<00:04:50.650> figure<00:04:51.100> out<00:04:51.160> exactly<00:04:52.020> what<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.050> pay<00:04:53.740> our
