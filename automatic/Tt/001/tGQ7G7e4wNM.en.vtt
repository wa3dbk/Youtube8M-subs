here that I did not manage to clear up

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.290 
here that I did not manage to clear up
that<00:02:22.140> one<00:02:22.350> just<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.860> was<00:02:23.070> focusing<00:02:24.060> on

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
that one just because I was focusing on

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.750 
that one just because I was focusing on
the<00:02:24.540> champagne<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.980> said<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.220> barely

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
the champagne and like I said I barely

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.140 
the champagne and like I said I barely
finished<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.420> three<00:02:27.630> days<00:02:27.750> ago<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.590> yeah<00:02:29.550> but

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
finished it three days ago so yeah but

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.640 
finished it three days ago so yeah but
I'm<00:02:30.450> definitely<00:02:30.660> going<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.050> be<00:02:31.140> using<00:02:31.320> this

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
I'm definitely going to be using this

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.310 
I'm definitely going to be using this
color<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.310> conjunction<00:02:32.790> with<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.300> one<00:02:33.600> just

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
color in conjunction with this one just

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.620 
color in conjunction with this one just
to<00:02:34.500> make<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:35.010> little<00:02:35.250> more<00:02:35.370> like<00:02:36.000> wearable

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
to make it a little more like wearable

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.660 
to make it a little more like wearable
and<00:02:36.930> neutral<00:02:37.500> instead<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:37.980> like<00:02:38.220> really

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and neutral instead of like really

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.020 
and neutral instead of like really
frosty<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.300> way<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.570> so<00:02:40.470> hopefully<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.370> know

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
frosty the way it is so hopefully I know

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.630 
frosty the way it is so hopefully I know
maybe<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.390> can<00:02:42.660> finish<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.080> or<00:02:43.860> mostly<00:02:44.310> finish

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
maybe I can finish it or mostly finish

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.900 
maybe I can finish it or mostly finish
it<00:02:44.820> but<00:02:45.150> um<00:02:45.420> hopefully<00:02:46.170> finish<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.950> that's

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
it but um hopefully finish it that's

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.820 
it but um hopefully finish it that's
kind<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.360> what<00:02:48.570> I'm<00:02:48.720> shooting<00:02:48.930> for<00:02:49.110> but<00:02:49.560> again

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
kind of what I'm shooting for but again

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.680 
kind of what I'm shooting for but again
if<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.160> fall<00:02:50.370> short<00:02:50.400> from<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.120> I'm<00:02:51.300> not<00:02:51.480> going<00:02:51.630> to

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
if I fall short from it I'm not going to

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.130 
if I fall short from it I'm not going to
be<00:02:51.750> mad<00:02:51.930> at<00:02:52.110> myself<00:02:52.290> um<00:02:53.720> haven't<00:02:54.720> worked<00:02:54.960> on

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
be mad at myself um haven't worked on

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.500 
be mad at myself um haven't worked on
this<00:02:55.500> one<00:02:55.740> it<00:02:56.100> wasn't<00:02:56.520> really<00:02:56.640> like<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.910> focus

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
this one it wasn't really like a focus

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.200 
this one it wasn't really like a focus
or<00:02:57.810> anything<00:02:58.290> um<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:59.580> don't<00:02:59.700> know<00:02:59.880> if<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.060> can

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
but I can tell that it's nowhere near

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.150 
but I can tell that it's nowhere near
hitting<00:03:06.210> pan<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.900> obviously<00:03:07.680> underestimated

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
hitting pan I obviously underestimated

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.750 
hitting pan I obviously underestimated
how<00:03:09.000> much<00:03:09.030> product<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.900> use<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.040> then

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
how much product I use of this and then

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.670 
how much product I use of this and then
how<00:03:11.940> much<00:03:12.090> product<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.600> actually<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.230> there<00:03:13.440> to

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
how much product is actually in there to

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.820 
how much product is actually in there to
think<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.160> was<00:03:14.250> going<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.520> hit<00:03:14.700> pan<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.330> I

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
think that I was going to hit pan so I

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.290 
think that I was going to hit pan so I
don't<00:03:16.830> know<00:03:17.010> if<00:03:17.040> I'll<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.340> hitting<00:03:17.610> pan<00:03:18.000> by<00:03:18.239> the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
don't know if I'll be hitting pan by the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.970 
don't know if I'll be hitting pan by the
next<00:03:18.630> update<00:03:18.810> maybe<00:03:19.230> it's<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.680> little<00:03:19.890> bit

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
next update maybe it's just a little bit

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.500 
next update maybe it's just a little bit
of<00:03:20.070> pan<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:20.520> it's<00:03:20.640> not<00:03:20.850> gonna<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.180> much

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
of pan but it's not gonna be that much

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.250 
of pan but it's not gonna be that much
if<00:03:21.959> i<00:03:22.530> do<00:03:22.680> even<00:03:23.400> hit<00:03:23.610> pan<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.180> for<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> bottom

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
if i do even hit pan and for the bottom

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.650 
if i do even hit pan and for the bottom
shade<00:03:25.530> there's<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.370> tiny<00:03:26.730> dip<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.510> that's

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
shade there's a tiny dip and that's

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.690 
shade there's a tiny dip and that's
where<00:03:27.870> I've<00:03:28.140> been<00:03:28.320> like<00:03:28.560> using<00:03:28.830> dipping<00:03:29.640> my

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700
