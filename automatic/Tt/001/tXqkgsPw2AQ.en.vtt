00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
going to a little bit about more what it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.260 
going to a little bit about more what it
is<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.739> kind<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.950> like<00:00:50.100> somebody<00:00:50.879> mentioned

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
is it's kind of like somebody mentioned

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.970 
is it's kind of like somebody mentioned
playing<00:00:51.510> dodgeball<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.260> that's<00:00:52.590> kind<00:00:52.890> of

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
playing dodgeball and that's kind of

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.100 
playing dodgeball and that's kind of
actually<00:00:53.129> perfect<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
actually perfect because it's like you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.420 
actually perfect because it's like you
know<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> balls<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:55.890> lined<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
know the balls are all lined up in the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.310 
know the balls are all lined up in the
middle<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.879> each<00:00:57.270> team<00:00:57.539> runs<00:00:57.750> at<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.170> gets

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
middle and each team runs at it and gets

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
middle and each team runs at it and gets
it<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.980> don't<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.340> instead<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it and then I don't know instead of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.880 
it and then I don't know instead of
running<00:01:00.510> back<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:00.899> base<00:01:01.050> with<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> ball

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
running back to your base with the ball

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.640 
running back to your base with the ball
you<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.219> guess<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.579> run<00:01:02.730> forward<00:01:03.210> towards

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
you I guess you run forward towards

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.840 
you I guess you run forward towards
towards<00:01:04.650> their<00:01:04.890> target<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.489> towards<00:01:05.729> your

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
towards their target like towards your

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.789 
towards their target like towards your
target<00:01:06.030> towards<00:01:06.540> their<00:01:06.689> base<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.110> anyway<00:01:07.680> your

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
target towards their base so anyway your

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.020 
target towards their base so anyway your
pick<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> flag<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.640> you're<00:01:08.760> trying<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
pick up the flag and you're trying to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.960 
pick up the flag and you're trying to
cap<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.390> their<00:01:09.540> base<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.200> mean<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.549> respawn

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
cap in their base so I mean the respawn

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.160 
cap in their base so I mean the respawn
time<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.390> maps<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:12.960> crazy

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
time and this maps a little crazy

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.320 
time and this maps a little crazy
because<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.189> get<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:14.790> kills<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
because if you if you get some kills and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.810 
because if you if you get some kills and
you<00:01:15.720> cap<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> fly<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.189> flag<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you cap the fly you can get the flag to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
you cap the fly you can get the flag to
their<00:01:18.060> spawn<00:01:18.420> before<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.020> even<00:01:19.049> like

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
their spawn before they can even like

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.710 
their spawn before they can even like
