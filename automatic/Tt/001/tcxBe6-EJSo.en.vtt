of course on the other hand that slow
pace<00:03:26.100> definitely<00:03:26.700> won't<00:03:26.850> be<00:03:27.030> for<00:03:27.269> everyone

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
pace definitely won't be for everyone

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.840

and<00:03:27.900> there<00:03:28.140> are<00:03:28.200> times<00:03:28.410> when<00:03:28.650> Pro<00:03:29.040> hunts<00:03:29.370> just

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
and there are times when Pro hunts just

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.360 
and there are times when Pro hunts just
feels<00:03:30.060> boring<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.110> be<00:03:31.230> honest<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:32.160> game's

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
feels boring and to be honest the game's

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.790 
feels boring and to be honest the game's
realism<00:03:33.060> only<00:03:33.300> goes<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:33.510> far<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.590> fact

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
realism only goes so far to the fact

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.870 
realism only goes so far to the fact
that<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.010> game<00:03:35.130> tells<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:35.670> where<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
that the game tells you where the

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.479 
that the game tells you where the
animals<00:03:36.420> might<00:03:36.660> be<00:03:36.989> sometimes<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:38.250> turns

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
animals might be sometimes that turns

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.759 
animals might be sometimes that turns
the<00:03:38.700> whole<00:03:38.820> thing<00:03:39.030> into<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.269> guessing<00:03:39.690> game<00:03:39.769> but

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
the whole thing into a guessing game but

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.979 
the whole thing into a guessing game but
uh<00:03:40.800> one<00:03:41.430> thing<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.790> genuinely<00:03:42.060> do<00:03:42.570> like<00:03:42.810> about

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
uh one thing I genuinely do like about

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.199 
uh one thing I genuinely do like about
the<00:03:43.230> game<00:03:43.260> are<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:43.980> graphics<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:44.850> obviously

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
the game are the graphics now obviously

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.000 
the game are the graphics now obviously
it's<00:03:45.420> not<00:03:45.570> some<00:03:45.840> technically<00:03:46.470> impressive

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
it's not some technically impressive

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.670 
it's not some technically impressive
game<00:03:47.280> but<00:03:47.610> artistically<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.959> works<00:03:49.200> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
game but artistically it works the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.620 
game but artistically it works the
natural<00:03:50.130> settings<00:03:50.550> are<00:03:50.730> both<00:03:50.850> gorgeous<00:03:51.209> and

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
natural settings are both gorgeous and

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.870 
natural settings are both gorgeous and
faithful<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.680> their<00:03:52.830> real-life<00:03:53.250> locations

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
faithful to their real-life locations

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.120 
faithful to their real-life locations
and<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.269> especially<00:03:54.510> like<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.140> lighting<00:03:55.380> see

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
and I especially like the lighting see

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.979 
and I especially like the lighting see
the<00:03:56.250> same<00:03:56.430> areas<00:03:56.820> of<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.000> forest<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.660> can<00:03:57.870> look

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
the same areas of the forest it can look

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.660 
the same areas of the forest it can look
totally<00:03:58.050> different<00:03:58.560> depending<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.489> time

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
totally different depending on the time

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.880 
totally different depending on the time
of<00:03:59.700> day<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.390> Pro<00:04:00.600> hunts<00:04:00.930> nails<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.500> which<00:04:01.739> is

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
of day and Pro hunts nails that which is

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.310 
of day and Pro hunts nails that which is
awesome<00:04:02.430> that<00:04:02.880> adds<00:04:03.030> an<00:04:03.300> aesthetic<00:04:03.750> realism

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
awesome that adds an aesthetic realism

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.259 
awesome that adds an aesthetic realism
to<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.860> already<00:04:05.340> realistic<00:04:06.060> gameplay

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
to that already realistic gameplay

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.470 
to that already realistic gameplay
although<00:04:06.920> again<00:04:07.920> technically<00:04:08.640> could<00:04:09.360> have

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
although again technically could have

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.140 
although again technically could have
used<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.810> lot<00:04:09.989> more<00:04:10.200> polish<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.830> mean<00:04:10.980> I've<00:04:11.150> never

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
used a lot more polish I mean I've never

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.259 
used a lot more polish I mean I've never
seen<00:04:12.300> shadows<00:04:12.989> do<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:14.250> course<00:04:14.489> this<00:04:14.940> is

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
seen shadows do that of course this is

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.539 
seen shadows do that of course this is
the<00:04:15.480> Wii<00:04:15.630> U<00:04:15.900> version<00:04:16.140> but<00:04:16.620> in<00:04:17.130> this<00:04:17.280> case<00:04:17.489> that

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
the Wii U version but in this case that

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.009 
the Wii U version but in this case that
doesn't<00:04:18.000> really<00:04:18.269> mean<00:04:18.540> much

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
doesn't really mean much

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.960 
doesn't really mean much
this<00:04:19.140> version<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.650> pretty<00:04:19.979> much<00:04:20.130> identical<00:04:20.370> to

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
this version is pretty much identical to

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.820 
this version is pretty much identical to
every<00:04:21.330> other<00:04:21.359> version<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.320> only<00:04:22.530> uses<00:04:22.800> the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
every other version it only uses the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.900 
every other version it only uses the
gamepad<00:04:23.100> for<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.640> most

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
gamepad for the most

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.300 
gamepad for the most
minimal<00:04:24.420> stuff<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:25.110> can<00:04:25.290> tap<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.650> map<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:26.130> set

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
minimal stuff you can tap the map to set

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.790 
minimal stuff you can tap the map to set
away<00:04:26.400> points<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:28.020> can<00:04:28.140> do<00:04:28.290> off-screen

play<00:04:28.860> that's<00:04:29.280> about<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:30.330> don't<00:04:30.690> expect<00:04:31.050> any

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
play that's about it so don't expect any

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.860 
play that's about it so don't expect any
gamepad<00:04:31.770> design<00:04:32.160> or<00:04:32.460> anything<00:04:32.910> very<00:04:33.330> we<00:04:33.600> view

gamepad design or anything very we view

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.620 
gamepad design or anything very we view
it's<00:04:34.440> basically<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:34.980> straight<00:04:35.310> port<00:04:35.610> which<00:04:35.940> you

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
it's basically a straight port which you

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.080 
it's basically a straight port which you

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
know I mean to be fair there's a place

for that too hunting games don't get a

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
whole lot of respect in some circles and

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.580 
whole lot of respect in some circles and
I<00:05:03.060> mean<00:05:03.210> I'm<00:05:03.360> probably<00:05:03.570> as<00:05:03.840> guilty<00:05:04.200> of<00:05:04.230> that<00:05:04.410> as

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
I mean I'm probably as guilty of that as

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.710 
I mean I'm probably as guilty of that as
anyone<00:05:05.010> but<00:05:05.520> when<00:05:05.790> you<00:05:05.880> play<00:05:06.090> one<00:05:06.300> like<00:05:06.510> this

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720

it's hard not to at least appreciate the
