science behind it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.740 
science behind it
most<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.609> us<00:00:29.789> definitely<00:00:30.029> faced<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.689> problem

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
most of us definitely faced this problem

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.659 
most of us definitely faced this problem
in<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> kitchen<00:00:31.410> when<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.219> cook<00:00:32.430> green

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
in the kitchen when we cook green

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.250 
in the kitchen when we cook green
vegetables<00:00:33.239> you'll<00:00:33.360> always<00:00:33.540> end<00:00:33.840> up<00:00:34.050> having

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
vegetables you'll always end up having

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.110 
vegetables you'll always end up having
them<00:00:34.590> black<00:00:34.860> after<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.460> certain<00:00:35.670> point<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.059> time

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
them black after a certain point of time

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.389 
them black after a certain point of time
that<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> pigment<00:00:37.980> which<00:00:38.309> is

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
that is because is a pigment which is

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.860 
that is because is a pigment which is
known<00:00:38.579> as<00:00:38.760> chlorophyll<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.570> green

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
known as chlorophyll in the green

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.569 
known as chlorophyll in the green
vegetables<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.590> after<00:00:41.040> cooking<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.399> for

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
vegetables and after cooking it for

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.030 
vegetables and after cooking it for
about<00:00:41.700> 5<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.059> 7<00:00:42.360> minutes<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.930> fades<00:00:43.469> off<00:00:43.800> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
about 5 to 7 minutes it fades off and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.889 
about 5 to 7 minutes it fades off and
forms<00:00:44.579> into<00:00:44.879> another<00:00:45.120> pigment<00:00:45.600> which<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
forms into another pigment which is

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.020 
forms into another pigment which is
known<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.500> fight<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.520> how<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.789> you

known as for your fight in so how do you

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.119 
known as for your fight in so how do you
handle<00:00:48.420> chlorophyll<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.170> very<00:00:49.559> simple<00:00:49.950> if

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
handle chlorophyll it's very simple if

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.400 
handle chlorophyll it's very simple if
you<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.520> cream<00:00:50.879> vegetables<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.840> like

in boiling water

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.569 
in boiling water
like<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.719> mentioned<00:01:01.129> chlorophyll<00:01:02.129> will<00:01:02.430> be

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
like I mentioned chlorophyll will be

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.179 
like I mentioned chlorophyll will be
intact<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.570> cook<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.320> green<00:01:04.530> vegetable

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
intact if you cook the green vegetable

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.890 
intact if you cook the green vegetable
for<00:01:05.400> about<00:01:05.580> 5<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.210> 7<00:01:06.360> minutes

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
for about 5 to 7 minutes

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
for about 5 to 7 minutes
anything<00:01:07.320> about<00:01:07.650> 7<00:01:08.070> minutes<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.970> make<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
anything about 7 minutes will make the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.030 
anything about 7 minutes will make the
chlorophyll<00:01:09.869> fade<00:01:10.200> off<00:01:10.409> which<00:01:10.619> means<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> will

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
chlorophyll fade off which means it will

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.980 
chlorophyll fade off which means it will
go<00:01:11.220> black<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:12.390> your<00:01:12.570> palak

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
go black and that is how your palak

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
go black and that is how your palak
paneer<00:01:13.200> or<00:01:13.530> any<00:01:13.860> other<00:01:14.100> green<00:01:14.369> vegetable<00:01:14.880> goes

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
paneer or any other green vegetable goes

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.670 
paneer or any other green vegetable goes
black<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> end<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.200> cooking<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.650> for

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
black because you end up cooking it for

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.399 
black because you end up cooking it for
a<00:01:16.830> very<00:01:17.009> long<00:01:17.310> time<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.420> case<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:19.259> have

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
a very long time in this case we have

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
a very long time in this case we have
put<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> green<00:01:20.070> vegetables<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.880> boiling

put in the green vegetables in boiling

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.640 
put in the green vegetables in boiling
water<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:23.450> now<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.509> need<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.470> out

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
water and now we need to get this out

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.120 
water and now we need to get this out
palak<00:01:26.400> also<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> very<00:01:27.630> delicate<00:01:28.380> vegetable

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
palak also is a very delicate vegetable

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.310 
palak also is a very delicate vegetable
doesn't<00:01:29.490> take<00:01:29.610> too<00:01:29.729> long<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.150> cook<00:01:30.329> maximum

this case will not cook it for more than

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
this case will not cook it for more than
