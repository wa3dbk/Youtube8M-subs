00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
and just I think that shows how much of

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.570 
and just I think that shows how much of
a<00:03:29.660> powerful<00:03:29.960> woman<00:03:30.350> she<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.250> fact<00:03:31.490> that

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
a powerful woman she is in the fact that

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.400

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
people don't so I thought that was
