00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.890
 welcome to this new video in this 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.179
 new video I bring you a mod for 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.099
 minecraft this time version 1.2 7.2 and 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:28.869
 Well, the mod is called is the 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:32.500
 tomahawk mods obviously it is a mote 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.260
 a tomahawk that you and your sweet and you 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.879
 bucks makes it a job that 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.289
 the character of selling 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.420
 material stone iron diamond or gold and 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.140
 good for 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.089
 yes yes for this to stick to an item 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.609
 it is only with the left click 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.500
 effective new but this nickname adds a 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:58.000
 function with the ax that with the click 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.440
 right with the right click excuse me this 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.509
 sales and it becomes a tomahawk 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.810
 and obviously then you can harm your a 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.399
 your enemies this hurt them 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.549
 obviously the damage depends on the material 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:17.350
 that is done this for example are 63 5 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:19.960
 4 3 and well then there will depend on your 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.819
 your material if you throw it after 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.979
 obviously you can pick it up again 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:27.819
 as I am creative, I can 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.020
 launch infinite but then you this one 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.020
 being in survivor 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.630
 I have one and you can pick it up 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:43.119
 the cuts and as you see is not damaged or 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.860
 well let's try this one with this 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.860
 recipe is not so peaceful 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.410
 I dont know 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.410
 or not 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.590
 wait try let's try to give us 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.590
 many and we put ourselves in survival 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.160
 and well, there you can give your 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.340
 Obviously that's the way it happens and good 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.530
 As you can see, the partridge has already been broken and 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.600
 obviously, as I said 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.240
 depends on the material 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.040
 that you have to your h that good because the 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.070
 so you can throw it here for example 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.290
 the boat stays stuck on the floor in 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.610
 the grass but in solid blocks nothing 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:38.380
 bounces as you see it bounces but by 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.560
 example here in the wool and there capea 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.590
 ok and good then nothing else what you add 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.190
 the mod is basically this 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:52.240
 obviously the diamond 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.910
 you'll hurt you will give more damage will 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.110
 be more harm and then you will kill more 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:03.220
 quick to the enemies as they see is not 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.040
 it hurts so much but here it is 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.550
 if you can find a little bit but 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.880
 It has been useful and I hope they will 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.880
 serve 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.240
 and nothing I hope you liked it is a 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.270
 simple way quite useful the truth and 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.370
 good that they comment subscribe they give 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.370
 like and well see you
