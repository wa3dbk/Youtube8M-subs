 [Music] 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.630
 wanted to miss the presentation of the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.250
 disc of the bisbal since we are in the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.260
 red carpet waiting for many 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.190
 guests and see if we have ten thousand 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.190
 ways to catch them 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.060
 ways 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:28.939
 just throw against him not always the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.939
 true because yes no 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:37.090
 before life I have to tell 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.400
 [Music] 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.400
 there is no reason to say no 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.580
 it's good that you take your time 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.820
 five years practically since from the 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.850
 day that came out from the year that the 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.020
 last and good I hope you have been 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.970
 always as always height of a level 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.530
 of a Latin album here because to me I 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:04.339
 love with a party is a bulería and 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:07.479
 I go crazy to dance like that the facet of 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.479
 sing we will 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.869
 says this album and the medium-length film 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:16.719
 good david well knowing already the 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.600
 work also from the director who have 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.829
 had for this medium-length the piece 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.450
 artist and partner that I had next 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.640
 well we hope good I've seen 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.200
 seen little things has been a bit and I think 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.360
 that is very subtle very thin I think that the 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.969
 medium-length film accompanies us tell us that 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.469
 we are going to learn this footage as you go 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.959
 to see a love story between a 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:41.770
 unknown and a great artist as is 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:43.869
 david and well all the history that 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.170
 they are living through the 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.170
 songs 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.390
 is the most conceptual sound then 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.710
 Well, yes, it is true that I already had 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.330
 I want to return to this footage on 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.800
 millimeter is a fictional story is not 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.170
 a very nice love comedy that we have 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.790
 made with kike maíllo today you are going to see is 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.960
 a different way of showing the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.060
 video clips 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.800
 there are not four in total and it has been 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.080
 very original worked with quique because 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.490
 Well, we've put that point of 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.490
 acting and it has been a great experience 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.240
 not always 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.000
 because to say no 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.270
 yes 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.280
 [Music] 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:40.410
