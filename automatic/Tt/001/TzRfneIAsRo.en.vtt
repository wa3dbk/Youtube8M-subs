00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
400 gigabyte model there as well we

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.500 
400 gigabyte model there as well we
didn't<00:02:53.010> see<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.250> need<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.430> their<00:02:53.850> out<00:02:54.390> of

didn't see the need of their out of

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.170 
didn't see the need of their out of
picking<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:55.280> picking<00:02:56.280> up<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> hundred

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
picking up picking up the a hundred

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.080 
picking up picking up the a hundred
getting<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.540> comes<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.020> 400<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.770> 800<00:02:59.090> 900

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
getting it comes in to 400 and 800 900

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.360 
getting it comes in to 400 and 800 900
you<00:03:00.510> could<00:03:00.690> double<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.050> price<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.620> course<00:03:01.890> for

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
you could double the price of course for

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.930 
you could double the price of course for
the<00:03:03.020> card<00:03:04.020> I<00:03:04.230> don't<00:03:05.010> think<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.280> size<00:03:05.490> really

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
the card I don't think the size really

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.900 
the card I don't think the size really
changes<00:03:06.450> but<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.320> can<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.130> can<00:03:08.370> double<00:03:08.820> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
changes but you can you can double the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.830 
changes but you can you can double the
price<00:03:11.150> for<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:14.790> yeah<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.510> there<00:03:15.720> you

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
price for that but but yeah so there you

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.010 
price for that but but yeah so there you
go<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.790> these<00:03:17.790> are<00:03:17.850> compatible<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.810> thing

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
go and these are compatible the thing

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.770 
go and these are compatible the thing
that<00:03:19.580> that<00:03:20.580> really<00:03:20.760> drew<00:03:21.090> us<00:03:21.120> towards<00:03:21.600> these

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
that that really drew us towards these

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.000 
that that really drew us towards these

system so we are having trouble to
drivers<00:04:02.510> at<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.630> moment<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.230> haven't<00:04:04.590> really

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
drivers at the moment I haven't really

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.430 
drivers at the moment I haven't really
spent<00:04:05.100> too<00:04:05.310> much<00:04:05.400> time<00:04:05.459> on<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.300> if<00:04:07.290> you

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
spent too much time on that and if you

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.410
