00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
Sean I love the 4/9 edged knife makers

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.520 
Sean I love the 4/9 edged knife makers
love<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:36.340> talk<00:00:36.550> about<00:00:36.760> edge<00:00:37.149> geometry<00:00:37.840> which

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
love to talk about edge geometry which

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.040 
love to talk about edge geometry which
refers<00:00:38.950> to<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.370> angle<00:00:39.910> of<00:00:40.090> the<00:00:40.420> edge<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.899> the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
refers to the angle of the edge of the

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.020 
refers to the angle of the edge of the
knife<00:00:41.200> itself<00:00:41.710> now<00:00:42.010> let's<00:00:42.370> just<00:00:42.640> say<00:00:42.789> for<00:00:43.000> a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
knife itself now let's just say for a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.029 
knife itself now let's just say for a
moment<00:00:43.180> that<00:00:43.390> these<00:00:43.600> are<00:00:43.780> real<00:00:44.050> knives<00:00:44.350> the

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
moment that these are real knives the

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.970 
moment that these are real knives the
edge<00:00:45.190> on<00:00:45.520> this<00:00:45.910> German<00:00:46.449> made<00:00:46.660> knife<00:00:46.930> is<00:00:47.199> 22

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
edge on this German made knife is 22

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.459 
edge on this German made knife is 22
degrees<00:00:48.010> on<00:00:48.640> each<00:00:49.030> side<00:00:49.360> which<00:00:49.809> means<00:00:50.020> that<00:00:50.350> it

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
degrees on each side which means that it

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.430 
degrees on each side which means that it
is<00:00:50.530> very<00:00:50.770> strong<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:52.300> edge<00:00:52.449> on<00:00:52.719> my<00:00:52.899> shun<00:00:53.230> is

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
is very strong the edge on my shun is

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.520 
is very strong the edge on my shun is
only<00:00:53.739> 16<00:00:54.489> degrees<00:00:55.090> on<00:00:55.329> both<00:00:55.359> sides<00:00:55.899> now<00:00:56.199> this

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
only 16 degrees on both sides now this

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.340 
only 16 degrees on both sides now this
is<00:00:56.739> very<00:00:57.280> very<00:00:57.760> sharp<00:00:58.329> but<00:00:58.629> typically<00:00:59.020> a<00:00:59.140> knife

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
is very very sharp but typically a knife

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.049 
is very very sharp but typically a knife
with<00:00:59.500> this<00:00:59.590> kind<00:00:59.829> of<00:00:59.920> edge<00:01:00.070> just<00:01:00.489> can't<00:01:00.820> keep

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
with this kind of edge just can't keep

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.759 
with this kind of edge just can't keep
it<00:01:01.269> because<00:01:01.570> it<00:01:01.780> isn't<00:01:01.960> strong<00:01:02.469> enough

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
it because it isn't strong enough

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.090 
it because it isn't strong enough
how<00:01:03.280> does<00:01:03.399> my<00:01:03.550> shun<00:01:03.850> do<00:01:04.000> it<00:01:04.320> superior<00:01:05.320> steel

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
how does my shun do it superior steel

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.430 
how does my shun do it superior steel
which<00:01:06.670> begins<00:01:07.150> with<00:01:07.480> desert

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.650 

believe<00:01:14.440> it<00:01:14.560> or<00:01:14.620> not<00:01:14.680> steel<00:01:15.460> is<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:15.970> lot<00:01:16.360> like

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
believe it or not steel is a lot like

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.810

shorten<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.210> life<00:04:25.630> of<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.590> knife<00:04:26.740> so<00:04:26.950> always

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
shorten the life of the knife so always

wash<00:04:27.580> by<00:04:27.820> hand<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.660> here's<00:04:28.840> how<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.020> do<00:04:29.140> it

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
wash by hand and here's how I do it

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.560 
wash by hand and here's how I do it
first<00:04:30.220> get<00:04:30.400> yourself<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.850> good<00:04:31.000> sinker<00:04:31.270> size

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
first get yourself a good sinker size

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.510 
first get yourself a good sinker size
then<00:04:31.900> hold<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.380> knife<00:04:32.500> flat<00:04:32.890> against<00:04:33.460> the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
then hold the knife flat against the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.700 
then hold the knife flat against the

this<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:49.539> not<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.260> sharpening<00:04:50.890> steel<00:04:51.160> this<00:04:51.550> is<00:04:51.610> a

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
provided us a guide to the proper angle

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.680 
provided us a guide to the proper angle
right<00:05:32.390> here<00:05:32.740> just<00:05:33.740> line<00:05:33.950> up<00:05:33.980> the<00:05:34.100> blade<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:37.690> my

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
right here just line up the blade and my

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.720 
right here just line up the blade and my
ritual<00:05:39.050> is<00:05:39.200> five<00:05:39.410> times<00:05:39.740> on<00:05:39.920> one<00:05:40.100> side<00:05:40.370> four<00:05:40.700> on

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
ritual is five times on one side four on

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.510 
ritual is five times on one side four on
the<00:05:40.910> other<00:05:41.090> then<00:05:41.600> three<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.050> then<00:05:42.140> two<00:05:42.770> how

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
the other then three and then two how

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.180 
the other then three and then two how
often<00:05:43.820> well<00:05:44.360> it<00:05:44.570> depends<00:05:44.930> on<00:05:45.080> use<00:05:45.650> but<00:05:45.980> I

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
often well it depends on use but I

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.340 
often well it depends on use but I
generally<00:05:47.180> find<00:05:47.330> that<00:05:47.480> it's<00:05:47.630> better<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.900> steel

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
generally find that it's better to steel

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.350 
generally find that it's better to steel
before<00:05:48.860> you<00:05:49.280> feel<00:05:49.550> that<00:05:49.790> the<00:05:49.880> knife<00:05:50.060> really

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
before you feel that the knife really

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.580 
before you feel that the knife really
needs<00:05:50.840> it<00:05:51.080> for<00:05:51.320> me

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
needs it for me

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.310 
needs it for me
once<00:05:52.130> a<00:05:52.250> week<00:05:52.400> under<00:05:52.640> normal<00:05:53.330> use<00:05:53.870> is<00:05:54.080> fine

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
once a week under normal use is fine

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.430 
once a week under normal use is fine
good<00:05:54.800> now<00:05:55.250> eventually<00:05:56.180> your<00:05:56.900> knife<00:05:57.110> will

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
good now eventually your knife will

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.590 
good now eventually your knife will
actually<00:05:58.070> require<00:05:58.340> sharpening<00:05:59.300> that's

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
actually require sharpening that's

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.850 
actually require sharpening that's
another<00:05:59.810> thing<00:06:00.050> altogether
