and<00:01:10.780> it's<00:01:11.780> kind<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:11.990> cool<00:01:12.200> but<00:01:12.860> other<00:01:13.729> than

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
and it's kind of cool but other than

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.510 
and it's kind of cool but other than
that<00:01:14.090> just<00:01:14.659> that<00:01:14.979> create<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.009> custom<00:01:16.340> character

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
and you can if you go to the code it's

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.139 
and you can if you go to the code it's
pretty<00:01:19.100> much<00:01:19.220> like<00:01:19.280> going<00:01:19.729> through<00:01:19.759> every

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
pretty much like going through every

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.139 
pretty much like going through every
single<00:01:21.399> you<00:01:22.399> know<00:01:22.460> it's<00:01:22.670> like<00:01:22.850> going<00:01:23.090> through

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
single you know it's like going through

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.060 
single you know it's like going through
every<00:01:23.390> single<00:01:23.630> option<00:01:23.810> but<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.770> makes<00:01:24.950> a

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
every single option but it makes a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.039 
every single option but it makes a
little<00:01:25.250> busy<00:01:25.429> a<00:01:25.729> little<00:01:26.090> bit<00:01:26.330> easier<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.720> see<00:01:27.020> a

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
little busy a little bit easier to see a

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.410 
little busy a little bit easier to see a
character<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:27.979> for<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.549> name<00:01:28.729> obviously

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
character and for the name obviously

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.859 
character and for the name obviously
it's<00:01:29.720> naming<00:01:30.439> the<00:01:30.679> character<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:31.580> oh<00:01:31.869> you're

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
it's naming the character so oh you're

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.969 
it's naming the character so oh you're
gonna<00:01:32.960> want<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:35.350> name<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.380> if<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.679> want<00:01:36.890> you

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979

tells me that I can change the case

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.930 
tells me that I can change the case
which<00:01:43.610> I<00:01:43.880> do<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:45.610> yeah<00:01:47.860> what<00:01:48.860> wants<00:01:49.759> to<00:01:49.789> do
