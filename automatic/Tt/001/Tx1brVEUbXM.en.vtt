00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.650
 ah 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.340
 hello and welcome to a new video of 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.469
 geek kirchner 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.170
 today I want to show you how to turn on and 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.250
 turn off the screen of our terminal 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.200
 without using the button Where 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.970
 all this is for all those who 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.000
 they are always suffering with the button 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.780
 power that is not broken by its possible 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.199
 weakness or for those who have 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.610
 wishes to have the double tap that comes 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:42.579
 in the in the new models of lg 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.249
 for do 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.320
 turning off and on the screen without 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.960
 use the power button we will use 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.510
 22 applications 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.510
 the first is what cream is 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.969
 which can be found in the market 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.590
 and we look for what he writes and there 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.810
 countless applications that make 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.290
 exactly the same 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.479
 I have one that is perhaps the most 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.640
 simple that there is this and it occupies very little 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.369
 34 houses but apart from the simple ones 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.130
 what you have to do is activate a simple 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.280
 widget on the desktop and press it and 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.510
 go out 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.909
 let's see how it is configured we enter 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.650
 just install it we will appear this 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:40.070
 screen to 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.870
 when activating the application then 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.140
 we have to activate what cream is for 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.750
 what 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.430
 the widget is able to give you the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.380
 permissions are able to turn off the screen 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.640
 then we go to 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.640
 to the desk 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.570
 sorry 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.010
 we mark widget and install 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.640
 the widget 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.190
 of the application 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.160
 I do not get the permission to give 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.700
 device manager 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.330
 as for example we would appear this 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.270
 screen where we have to give 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.230
 and permissions for the application to be 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.230
 able to turn off the screen 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.690
 and it's as simple as pressing on the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.940
 padlock on the widget and turn off the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.870
 screen the second application that 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.870
 I wanted to show you 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.810
 gravity screen off 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.810
 we put here gravity screen has two 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.459
 versions one free and one pro for 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.660
 use it you could start with the 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.760
 free but the truth is that it 's pretty 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.290
 complete and for the price that is me 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.290
 It looks like it's a little euro 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.190
 the free one seems to me that only 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.980
 has a limitation of 15 minutes 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.020
 let's see how it works because it is capable of 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.730
 turn the screen on and off 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.640
 is able to turn on and off the 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.820
 screen using all part of the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.370
 sensors that we have or the proximity 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:29.019
 or the accelerometer 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.019
 let's see how they work 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.530
 gravity for the graffiti I have it 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:48.239
 I configured configured to be 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.239
 I paid with the proximity sensor 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.290
 you can see how you can as 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.620
 Can be used with the sensor 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.420
 pocket that also goes out that is 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.340
 when he detected that you put it in a 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.130
 pocket by the by the kind of 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.050
 inclination that we are giving him the 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.680
 it automatically turns off also the 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.940
 upside down when using it mouth 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.430
 down 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.850
 the terminal would shut down we can activate 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.250
 the 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.739
 the lying on his back also 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.140
 and at the top we can also 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.300
 use in any direction the 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.490
 pocket sensor turn off the screen 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.470
 by proximity turn on the screen by 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.720
 proximity joel turn off screen by 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.960
 proximity I have it disconnected because 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.810
 he used the previously what screen 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.820
 he mentioned but he did use the 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.580
 turn on the screen by proximity is 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.710
 say only by passing your hand through the 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.200
 proximity sensor which is not 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.340
 working constantly but you see 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.770
 that is configured to work for 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.180
 say something 5 seconds and another five 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.430
 seconds the sensor is off 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.169
 you can turn on the screen by the 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:07.820
 movement is also turned off by 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.820
 movement shaking the phone goes off 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.260
 keep the screen by movement is 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.529
 to say, it has many very many 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.659
 configurations 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:21.529
 keep running while there is a 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:24.249
 phone call notification for 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.249
 that is always 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.110
 is always running and has the 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.870
 function to run at startup to 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.840
 that just turn on the phone already 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.200
 start to work has a mode a 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.950
 pause mode as you can see if you touch the 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.660
 screen the service is paused then 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.440
 it would stop working until I did not 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.440
 let's go back on 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.100
 the truth that I am very happy and now 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:06:00.470
 I'm going to show you the consumptions I've 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.470
 had in the last 10 hours 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.770
 as you can see 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.890
 now the statistics updates the 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.790
 terminal has been on for 10 hours 50 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:19.160
 minutes has been awake 18% as 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.550
 you can see the maximum consumption I have 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.529
 had 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:27.620
 with gmail here is the 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:32.080
 the use of the cpu 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.080
 and order by use vale 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:39.360
 the application so you can see 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:43.229
 only active in double quotes 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:45.569
 seconds and really spending already what 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:48.270
 I can assure you, what is we, let's go? 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.099
 little in execution if we put it by 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.120
 execution you can also see that it is not 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:53.120
 in none of the posts 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:01.860
 in use, you can see it 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:04.620
 and now I'm going to show you that neither 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.409
 prevents the phone from getting deep 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.389
 sleep as you can check here happens 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:12.270
 exactly the same takes 10 hours 50 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:14.430
 minutes in the terminal working and 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.199
 I really got into deep sleep 9 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.150
 hours that 9 hours has been 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:21.120
 running the application is to say that 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.249
 neither the consumption as I say is not 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.239
 nothing special 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:31.330
 Well I hope you have enjoyed forgiveness 

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:34.840
 sorry once the application is installed and 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.629
 and execute it you will also appear 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.520
 the screen of 

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:42.819
 device manager so that 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.650
 let's give it to him so that we give him the permissions 

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:46.569
 relevant so you can turn on and 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.540
 turn off the screen as in the application 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:50.790
 what he writes 

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.280
 Well now it is everything and I hope that 

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:57.110
 I have helped you come many thanks 

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.110
 and see you in the next video
