00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.589 
solution for you and it's called gift go
I<00:00:22.230> battle<00:00:23.039> month<00:00:23.189> ago<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.759> with<00:00:23.939> o2<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.509> I

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
I battle month ago I was with o2 and I

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.300 
I battle month ago I was with o2 and I
used<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.289> run<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.589> credit<00:00:25.769> all

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
used to run out of credit all

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.359 
used to run out of credit all
the<00:00:26.640> time<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.060> know<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.420> get<00:00:28.410> 300<00:00:28.800> texture<00:00:29.189> but

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the time you know I get 300 texture but

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.730 
the time you know I get 300 texture but
I'd<00:00:29.490> spend<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.599> lot<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.810> time<00:00:30.929> calling<00:00:31.410> people

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
I'd spend a lot of time calling people

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.370 
I'd spend a lot of time calling people
so<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.400> run<00:00:32.550> out<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:33.990> I<00:00:34.080> came<00:00:34.230> across

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
so I just run out and then I came across

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.740 
so I just run out and then I came across
giffgaff<00:00:34.830> now<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.760> pretty<00:00:35.940> much<00:00:36.030> set<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.570> by

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
giffgaff now it's pretty much set up by

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.180 
giffgaff now it's pretty much set up by
02<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.970> not<00:00:38.970> won<00:00:39.270> by<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.810> I<00:00:39.990> think<00:00:40.380> as<00:00:41.010> it

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
02 and not won by them I think as it

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.920 
02 and not won by them I think as it
says<00:00:41.400> they're<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> mobile<00:00:42.090> network<00:00:42.240> run<00:00:42.720> by

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
says they're the mobile network run by

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.220 
says they're the mobile network run by
you<00:00:43.130> and<00:00:44.130> basically<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.390> cut<00:00:45.840> out<00:00:45.930> all<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
you and basically they cut out all the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.540 
you and basically they cut out all the
call<00:00:46.440> center<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.100> everything<00:00:47.400> like

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
call center and everything like

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.640 
call center and everything like
that<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.790> if<00:00:48.240> you<00:00:48.330> have<00:00:48.540> a<00:00:48.570> problem<00:00:48.840> which

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
that so if you have a problem which

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.500 
that so if you have a problem which
probably<00:00:50.010> won't<00:00:50.190> because<00:00:50.580> its<00:00:50.730> contract<00:00:51.240> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
probably won't because its contract you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.570 
probably won't because its contract you
know<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.930> there's<00:00:52.200> nobody<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.650> call<00:00:52.950> its<00:00:53.370> it

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
know that there's nobody to call its it

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.970 
know that there's nobody to call its it
you<00:00:53.970> know<00:00:54.150> which<00:00:55.020> could<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> downside<00:00:55.590> in

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you know which could be a downside in

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.890 
you know which could be a downside in
some<00:00:56.160> cases<00:00:56.400> but<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.850> nine<00:00:57.180> out<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.390> ten<00:00:57.690> cases

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
some cases but in nine out of ten cases

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.390 
some cases but in nine out of ten cases
you're<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.380> going<00:00:58.560> to<00:00:58.620> need<00:00:58.740> the<00:00:58.890> call<00:00:59.070> center

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
you're not going to need the call center

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.010 
you're not going to need the call center
anyway<00:00:59.640> because<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.450> just<00:01:00.720> go<00:01:00.930> on

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
anyway because you know you just go on

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.650 
anyway because you know you just go on
the<00:01:01.050> internet<00:01:01.790> but<00:01:02.790> by<00:01:03.000> cutting<00:01:03.330> that<00:01:03.450> out

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the internet but by cutting that out

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660 
the internet but by cutting that out
they've<00:01:03.870> managed<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.290> bring<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.739> cost<00:01:05.009> down<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
they've managed to bring the cost down a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.630 
they've managed to bring the cost down a
lot<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> lot<00:01:06.869> more<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.290> your<00:01:07.380> money

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
lot so you get a lot more for your money

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.010 
lot so you get a lot more for your money
so<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.060> when<00:01:09.509> you<00:01:09.630> top<00:01:09.840> up

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
so what you do is when you top up

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.110 
so what you do is when you top up
whatever<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.560> might<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.890> usually<00:01:11.310> top<00:01:11.730> up<00:01:11.910> so

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
whatever it might you usually top up so

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.820 
whatever it might you usually top up so
say<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.390> put<00:01:12.570> 10<00:01:12.840> pediment<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.620> phone
