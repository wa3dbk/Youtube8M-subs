00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
have these flat razors that are

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.030 
have these flat razors that are
specifically<00:00:29.760> designed<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.470> trim<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.769> shape

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
specifically designed to trim and shape

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.670 
specifically designed to trim and shape
eyebrows<00:00:32.520> but<00:00:32.880> surprisingly<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.960> don't<00:00:34.320> prefer

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
eyebrows but surprisingly I don't prefer

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.729 
eyebrows but surprisingly I don't prefer
to<00:00:34.890> use<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.430> i<00:00:35.460> actually<00:00:35.760> prefer<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.480> use

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
to use that i actually prefer to use

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.940 
to use that i actually prefer to use
just<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.860> regular<00:00:38.190> razor<00:00:39.469> also<00:00:40.469> i<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.680> not<00:00:40.920> like

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
just a regular razor also i do not like

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.860 
just a regular razor also i do not like
to<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.340> my<00:00:41.460> eyebrows<00:00:41.790> plucked<00:00:42.090> wheeze<00:00:42.510> or

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
to have my eyebrows plucked wheeze or

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.200 
to have my eyebrows plucked wheeze or
waxed<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.399> method<00:00:44.610> works<00:00:44.850> very<00:00:45.120> well

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
waxed so this method works very well

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.090 
waxed so this method works very well
even<00:00:45.570> though<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> hair<00:00:46.200> grows<00:00:46.350> back<00:00:46.440> fairly

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
even though the hair grows back fairly

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.310 
even though the hair grows back fairly
quickly<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.969> shake<00:00:48.809> them<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.050> every

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
quickly you have to shake them up every

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.660 
quickly you have to shake them up every
couple<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.620> days<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.309> doesn't<00:00:50.640> take

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
couple of days it really doesn't take

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639 
couple of days it really doesn't take
that<00:00:50.910> long<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.020> I'm<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.289> taking<00:00:52.559> my
