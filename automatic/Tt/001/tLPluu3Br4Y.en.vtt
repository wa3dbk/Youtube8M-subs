those with mint types of flavors seem to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.719

have a very light amount of their mint
in<00:01:48.849> it<00:01:48.940> probably<00:01:49.300> because<00:01:49.479> it's<00:01:49.660> so<00:01:49.810> strong

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.719 
and would appeal to everybody but just
enough<00:01:52.569> to<00:01:52.599> add<00:01:52.720> that<00:01:53.020> light<00:01:53.289> little<00:01:53.560> zest<00:01:54.429> of

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
enough to add that light little zest of

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.139 
enough to add that light little zest of
mint<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.289> smell<00:01:56.590> on<00:01:56.649> this<00:01:56.950> is<00:01:57.610> for<00:01:57.940> sure<00:01:58.119> a

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.110

taste<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.960> grapefruit<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.770> spot-on<00:02:38.730> it's

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
taste of that grapefruit is spot-on it's

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.120 
taste of that grapefruit is spot-on it's
there<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:40.020> when<00:02:40.260> you're<00:02:40.410> smoking<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:41.100> a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
there but when you're smoking it a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.010 
there but when you're smoking it a
little<00:02:41.550> bit<00:02:41.670> more<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.300> citrus<00:02:42.510> comes<00:02:42.840> out

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
little bit more of that citrus comes out

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.570 
little bit more of that citrus comes out
it<00:02:43.140> almost<00:02:43.410> seems<00:02:43.830> like<00:02:43.920> they<00:02:44.160> cut<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.520> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
it almost seems like they cut it a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.790 
it almost seems like they cut it a
little<00:02:44.610> bit<00:02:44.880> with<00:02:45.270> their<00:02:45.600> orange<00:02:46.140> flavor<00:02:46.440> just

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
little bit with their orange flavor just

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.190 
little bit with their orange flavor just
to<00:02:46.920> add<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.070> little<00:02:47.370> bit<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.700> zest<00:02:47.940> because

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
to add that little bit of a zest because

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.920 
to add that little bit of a zest because
grapefruit<00:02:49.200> as<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.800> fruit<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:50.970> general<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.570> much

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
grapefruit as a fruit in general is much

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.890 
grapefruit as a fruit in general is much
more<00:02:52.200> light<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.490> it's<00:02:53.730> not<00:02:53.880> as<00:02:54.150> prominent<00:02:54.510> as

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
more light so it's not as prominent as

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.820 
more light so it's not as prominent as
your<00:02:55.680> other<00:02:55.950> fruity<00:02:56.580> tobacco<00:02:57.060> flavors<00:03:00.830> taste

your other fruity tobacco flavors taste

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.770 
your other fruity tobacco flavors taste
on<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.160> is<00:03:02.280> definitely<00:03:02.520> very<00:03:02.730> good<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.480> only

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
on this is definitely very good the only

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.600 
on this is definitely very good the only
thing<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.260> does<00:03:04.410> add<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> little<00:03:04.980> bit<00:03:05.430> of

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
thing is it does add a little bit of

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.670 
thing is it does add a little bit of
that<00:03:05.820> throat<00:03:06.270> throat<00:03:06.810> harshness<00:03:07.170> from<00:03:07.530> that

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
that throat throat harshness from that

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.820 
that throat throat harshness from that
citrus<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.570> mean<00:03:09.570> it's<00:03:09.720> not<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.290> not<00:03:10.440> bad<00:03:10.650> by

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
citrus I mean it's not it's not bad by

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.530 
citrus I mean it's not it's not bad by
any<00:03:11.010> means<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.550> some<00:03:11.730> citrus<00:03:12.060> flavors<00:03:12.090> just

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
any means and some citrus flavors just

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.640 
any means and some citrus flavors just
affect<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:12.990> little<00:03:13.200> bit<00:03:13.290> more<00:03:13.440> which<00:03:13.620> is

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
affect you a little bit more which is

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.530 
affect you a little bit more which is
why<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:13.980> was<00:03:14.400> pretty<00:03:14.670> confident<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.180> there<00:03:15.390> is

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
why I was pretty confident that there is

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.000 
why I was pretty confident that there is
like<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.990> hint<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.290> there<00:03:16.590> orange

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
like that hint that there orange

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.680 
like that hint that there orange
cutting<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.760> with<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.090> because<00:03:18.210> it<00:03:18.450> does<00:03:18.600> the

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
cutting in with it because it does the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.020 
cutting in with it because it does the
same<00:03:18.900> thing<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.170> me<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.430> really<00:03:20.760> do<00:03:20.880> like

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
same thing to me but I really do like

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.300 
same thing to me but I really do like
their<00:03:21.210> orange<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.530> fact<00:03:22.710> that<00:03:22.740> it's<00:03:22.980> if

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
their orange and the fact that it's if

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
their orange and the fact that it's if
it's<00:03:23.460> in<00:03:23.580> this<00:03:23.760> then<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.240> definitely

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
it's in this then it definitely

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.940 
it's in this then it definitely
amplifies<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.170> flavor<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.500> little<00:03:25.680> bit<00:03:25.770> more

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
amplifies the flavor a little bit more

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.320 
amplifies the flavor a little bit more
giving<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.280> little<00:03:26.370> bit<00:03:26.490> more<00:03:26.550> characteristic

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
giving a little bit more characteristic

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.880 
giving a little bit more characteristic
than<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:27.900> they<00:03:28.020> just<00:03:28.230> did<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.530> straight

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
than if they just did the straight

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.810 
than if they just did the straight
grapefruit<00:03:29.280> flavor<00:03:34.190> yeah<00:03:35.190> very<00:03:35.430> nice<00:03:35.580> thought

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
grapefruit flavor yeah very nice thought

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.510 
grapefruit flavor yeah very nice thought
out<00:03:35.940> put<00:03:36.560> towards<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:38.010> little<00:03:38.160> bit<00:03:38.340> later

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
out put towards a little bit later

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.950 
out put towards a little bit later
towards<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:38.940> bowl<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.240> flavor<00:03:39.480> does<00:03:39.720> tend<00:03:39.930> to

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
towards the bowl the flavor does tend to

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.870 
towards the bowl the flavor does tend to
mellow<00:03:40.260> out<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.470> little<00:03:40.710> bit<00:03:40.890> which<00:03:41.070> in<00:03:41.220> this

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
mellow out a little bit which in this

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.240 
mellow out a little bit which in this
case<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.360> good<00:03:42.600> thing<00:03:42.840> because<00:03:43.350> that<00:03:43.590> that

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
case is a good thing because that that

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.810 
case is a good thing because that that
throat<00:03:44.550> cake<00:03:44.790> goes<00:03:45.420> away<00:03:46.340> but<00:03:47.340> yeah<00:03:47.430> just<00:03:47.670> be
