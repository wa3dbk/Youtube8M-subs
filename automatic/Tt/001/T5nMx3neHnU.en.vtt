time trying to find washes for it when
you<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.770> easily<00:01:50.100> put<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> flute<00:01:50.490> master<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.850> it

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you can easily put a flute master in it

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.109 
you can easily put a flute master in it
or<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.479> did<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.720> actually<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.640> 2002

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
or as I did I actually of back in 2002

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.920 
or as I did I actually of back in 2002
about<00:01:54.329> ten<00:01:54.509> years<00:01:54.600> ago<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> picked<00:01:55.140> up<00:01:55.290> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
85 to 89 I'm guessing and which fills

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.339 
85 to 89 I'm guessing and which fills
fast<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.770> works<00:02:07.890> perfectly<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.780> guys

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
fast and it works perfectly you guys

from the 70s is I hack we have one from
the<00:02:37.850> 60s<00:02:38.240> is<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:40.070> was<00:02:40.220> fatter<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:41.210> older<00:02:41.420> ones

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
the 60s is it was fatter the older ones

the 60s is it was fatter the older ones
were<00:02:41.750> fatter<00:02:42.020> you<00:02:42.320> know<00:02:43.190> they<00:02:43.280> went<00:02:43.400> out<00:02:43.490> a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
were fatter you know they went out a

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.950 
were fatter you know they went out a
little<00:02:43.640> more<00:02:43.820> and<00:02:43.940> not<00:02:44.300> only<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.480> but<00:02:44.840> you

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
little more and not only that but you

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.180 
little more and not only that but you
see<00:02:45.110> where<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.470> plastic<00:02:45.860> they<00:02:46.010> had<00:02:46.160> a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
see where this is plastic they had a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.560 
see where this is plastic they had a
metal<00:02:46.520> arm<00:02:46.700> instead

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
metal arm instead

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.080 
metal arm instead
