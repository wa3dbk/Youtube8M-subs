00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:26.190
 It's a good day, everyone I'm showing. 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.490
 here for you an incursion is 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.490
 marquetry 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.309
 not my area of â€‹â€‹expertise but this 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:45.239
 here is a special request 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:52.080
 so I decided to do it so do I 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:54.540
 I cut several brightest arrafs 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.720
 small and dark or cheddar 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.720
 in 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:14.020
 so I cut several rabin 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:14.020
 the dark mezzo they were in them here 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.850
 up here and here in the middle 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:32.940
 and they were all glued to one another and used 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.280
 staples to make this union 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:42.659
 they have been practically 24 hours 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:46.890
 it was 24 hours from the clips I took 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.710
 now the central idea here is a board 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.080
 barbecue on special request to a 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.509
 family 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.000
 so I've never taken it in that area 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.479
 Let's see what 's coming out of you. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.149
 can see you fast squares that are 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:10.530
 the white and put rectangular 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:16.620
 also what are the pebble here 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:22.130
 the next step is to plan the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:31.400
 four corners here today after that 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:36.050
 I'll pass on my roller chair 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:41.620
 to leave it here 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.620
 the appliance on both sides 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.470
 after you have passed the roll 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.650
 quartered round these fields 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:59.090
 four corners here will be rounded 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:02.180
 and I will spend a finish on Tupy and 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:09.230
 about an inch and a half inside 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:14.600
 I will make a type one every time 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:18.490
 reentrancy with the weakness of tupy's 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.710
 who stay idle cutting the meat 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.060
 choose something and it will flow 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:30.220
 for this channel I'm going to do here 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.220
 it's good 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.350
 For today, that's what I'm going to present. 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.790
 for you guys 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:43.300
 It's but I'll be back to continue 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.200
 forehead ready for you to see how 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.450
 It has been assumed that what the person 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.320
 will you receive it? 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.680
 I like work, a hug to everyone. Good. 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.680
 day
