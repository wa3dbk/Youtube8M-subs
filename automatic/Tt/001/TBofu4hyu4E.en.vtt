00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.050
 I wanted to spend the rest of my life here 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.010
 an object has impacted on the 17 received 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.630
 I 'm coming 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.519
 60 years ago they attacked the earth 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.399
 we won the war but 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.579
 they destroyed half of the planet all 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.019
 they have been evacuated there is nothing human left 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.370
 we take care of the maintenance of the 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:43.680
 drones we are the cleaning team 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.309
 two weeks more chat and we can go back 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.590
 with others it does not seem fair to win the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.590
 true and now we have to leave 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.580
 do not take risks down there and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.580
 too many dangers 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.370
 I've been watching him like that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.910
 who you are 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.910
 i 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.380
 the people he works for lied to 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.090
 they told you to carry out the orders and 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.340
 that you would soon return with the others 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.340
 it's time for you to know the truth 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.250
 as you know my name 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.530
 there are people down there 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.530
 there are things you need to know 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.220
 I'm saying beg, we're no longer a 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.990
 effective team 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.660
 but not the survivors until the 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.660
 ordinary game 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.159
 and in helping us put an end to this 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.720
 they do not have to politics
