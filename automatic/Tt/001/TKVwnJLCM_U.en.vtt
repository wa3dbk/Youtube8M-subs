with this stuff go to 1.25 gigs of DDR

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.240 
with this stuff go to 1.25 gigs of DDR
which<00:00:41.810> is<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.079> maximum<00:00:42.350> for<00:00:42.680> this<00:00:42.770> particular

Launcher when you go into micro website
then<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:53.329> can<00:00:53.390> show<00:00:53.690> that<00:00:53.720> in<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:53.960> background

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
then you can show that in the background

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.740 
then you can show that in the background

Intel max so that one's not going to
work<00:01:12.440> on<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.950> PowerPC<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:14.420> have<00:01:14.510> to<00:01:14.630> download

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
work on a PowerPC you have to download

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.440 
work on a PowerPC you have to download
just<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.920> regular<00:01:16.400> jar<00:01:16.640> file<00:01:16.880> which<00:01:17.150> is<00:01:17.270> the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
just a regular jar file which is the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.870 
just a regular jar file which is the
last<00:01:18.080> download<00:01:18.500> which<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:19.369> mostly<00:01:19.610> used<00:01:19.790> for

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
last download which is mostly used for

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.280 
last download which is mostly used for
Linux<00:01:20.330> purposes<00:01:22.570> but<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:23.720> should<00:01:23.900> work<00:01:23.930> also

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
Linux purposes but it should work also

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.500 
Linux purposes but it should work also
under<00:01:24.770> Windows<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.340> Mac<00:01:25.460> OS<00:01:25.490> 10<00:01:25.729> as<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.299> can

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
under Windows and Mac OS 10 as you can

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.649 
under Windows and Mac OS 10 as you can
see<00:01:26.690> now<00:01:30.100> because<00:01:31.100> in<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.460> end<00:01:31.610> all<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:31.880> all

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
see now because in the end all of all

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.710 
see now because in the end all of all
versions<00:01:32.900> use<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:34.280> jar<00:01:34.549> file<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:35.030> execute<00:01:35.479> but

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
versions use the jar file to execute but

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.120 
versions use the jar file to execute but
you<00:01:36.350> know<00:01:36.470> just<00:01:36.770> have<00:01:37.010> another<00:01:37.430> front<00:01:37.790> end<00:01:38.979> ok

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
you know just have another front end ok

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.149 
you know just have another front end ok
Oh<00:01:40.159> Jen<00:01:41.380> looks<00:01:42.380> kind<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:42.740> weird<00:01:44.710> I'm<00:01:45.710> running

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
Oh Jen looks kind of weird I'm running

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.190 
Oh Jen looks kind of weird I'm running
the<00:01:46.280> latest<00:01:46.400> Java<00:01:46.820> version<00:01:47.240> for<00:01:47.420> OS<00:01:47.689> 10<00:01:47.869> target

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
the latest Java version for OS 10 target

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.649 
the latest Java version for OS 10 target
though

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.050 

I<00:01:52.280> think<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:53.369> settings<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> bit

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
I think these settings are a bit

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.760 
I think these settings are a bit
optimistic<00:01:54.210> I'll<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.020> put<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.350> bright<00:01:55.590> as

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
optimistic I'll just put it on bright as

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.710 
optimistic I'll just put it on bright as
always<00:01:58.520> yeah<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.549> think<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.880> being<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.390> little

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
always yeah I think it's being a little

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.340 
always yeah I think it's being a little
bit<00:02:00.840> optimistic<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:02.930> I'll<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:03.990> add<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
bit optimistic here I'll just add a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.260 
bit optimistic here I'll just add a
server<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:04.890> loading<00:02:05.700> chunks<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
server because loading chunks of the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.479 
server because loading chunks of the
world<00:02:06.450> would<00:02:06.659> dip<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> framerate<00:02:07.860> down<00:02:08.220> so

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
world would dip the framerate down so

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.809 
world would dip the framerate down so
much<00:02:08.899> that<00:02:09.899> wouldn't<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.920> good<00:02:11.670> way

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
much that wouldn't really be a good way

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.100 
much that wouldn't really be a good way
to<00:02:11.850> say<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.330> kind<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.840> thing<00:02:12.900> around

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
to say like kind of this thing around

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.210 
to say like kind of this thing around
