00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:10.670
 site all-all dot ru 676 task find 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.870
 according to the formula of the time t 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:22.310
 on the previous page in number 674 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.310
 written this formula with equal in on t 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.740
 if in a row there are two letters in and t 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.410
 there is a sign that between them a sign 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.649
 multiply this is the very formula for 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.760
 which we will consider according to this formula 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.270
 we need to find time t 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:49.289
 this distance and this is the speed under the letter 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:52.969
 And instead of write 64 kilometers per 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:57.980
 place with write 64 kilometers then equal 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:05.460
 instead of speed we will write 8 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:08.640
 kilometers per second multiplied by t 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.650
 be careful task written 8 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.600
 kilometers per second 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.820
 well in my tutorial at least 8 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.119
 kilometers per second but with such 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.330
 speed no car can't ride no 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.729
 no one see she means missiles 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.829
 rocket that takes off into space with such 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:33.119
 speed and so look 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:34.470
 multiplier multiplier of the product as 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.340
 find one of the factors 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:43.610
 you need to divide the work into another 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.610
 factor 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.509
 to continue with us here should 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.790
 be the same here kilometers and here 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.649
 Kilometer in no case should not be 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.899
 different necessarily the same here 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.560
 kilometer here kilometers then we can 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.560
 continue on 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:10.860
 64 divided by 8 will be 8 and here that 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:13.260
 It was from the second that 8 seconds 8 seconds 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.790
 time is 8 seconds because here 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.920
 stood seconds therefore stand here 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.019
 seconds and there should have been 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:28.459
 same otherwise it would not be possible to solve 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:28.459
 so the answer is 8 seconds further under the letter b 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.470
 your formula is the same with v 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.950
 multiply by t 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:42.019
 We are still looking for a place with 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.780
 we substitute one hundred thirty two kilometers 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:51.000
 then the sign is equal to the place instead 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:55.940
 speed write 12 kilometers per hour here 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.769
 already kilometer hour went and multiplied by t 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.170
 that is, we have set up a place for it 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:07.980
 expression and instead this is a factor 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.829
 multiplier product how to find one of 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.660
 multipliers the product divided by 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:19.620
 another factor 100 32 kilometers 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.109
 divided by 12 kilometers per hour here 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.739
 kilometers and here kilometers all right 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:35.280
 we can continue to solve 132 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:40.380
 divide by 12 132 divide by 12 we take 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:44.579
 one by one for 12 I apologize for 12 1 and 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.280
 multiply by 12 will be 12 13 minus 12 this 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:59.840
 1 deuce take down again take one 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:04:03.990
 one by 12 to 12 it turns out 11 t is equal to 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.090
 1111 what hours 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.430
 here were the same here a kilometer and 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.270
 skills can therefore divide 132 by 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.670
 12 results in a clock because 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.209
 the speed was in hours last time 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.110
 the speed was in seconds therefore 8 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.350
 seconds in response 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:28.470
 but this time the speed was already in hours 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:30.360
 so I answer in hours on this all 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.600
 My name is Andrew Andreevich My garden 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.770
 all point dot ru 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.710
 please write in the comments on 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.300
 How much is clear if you decide 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.330
 like my video lessons please 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.260
 advise friends and classmate on 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.260
 that's all for now
