 by things you can have about judging 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.809
 man being in the excuse that is 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.420

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.799
 sneaking that unfortunately did not go as planned 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.110
 I am very curious at home if I am 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.750

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.210

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.380
 opinion 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.710
 switch or the volume is to 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.060
 it sounds more eyeliner we change 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.440
 kills to get low-income street 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.420
 I 've been able to watch the comics at 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.690
 each gram 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.690
 bowls 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:37.660
 Comeback Comeback dreamed I'm dead 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.100
 which meet I thought we looked 10 with 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.720
 there was a cloth would sit him I think 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.310
 you look but certainly could not see 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.190

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.420
 sat there sat a nice that are the beautiful 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.420

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.430
 I came filter you are also slow could this 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.590
 falls under the category of heavy weapon he 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.910
 rubbed his online machine 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.240
 so you can already imagine a little bit 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.360
 how fast you can save with them is not fast 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.360

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.579
 really think it 's just the one that you 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.160
 more chance with pistols can with 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.610
 this thing that I think is serious about there too 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.200
 just to make a joke 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.040
 he was never dead 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.180

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.740
 you have no impact you can go through walls 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.880

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.990
 jokes
