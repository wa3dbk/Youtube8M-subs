a rainstorm and also look extremely

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.500 
a rainstorm and also look extremely

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
realistic when viewing from above you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.970 
realistic when viewing from above you
can<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.840> large<00:01:01.140> difference<00:01:01.469> from<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
can see a large difference from the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
can see a large difference from the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
stands where it is not lit so now we're

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.760 
stands where it is not lit so now we're
going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.689> look<00:01:06.840> at<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> other<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.619> the

you can see the reflections are a lot

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.910 
you can see the reflections are a lot
