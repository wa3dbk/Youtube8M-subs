00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
of our training is based on you know

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.130 
of our training is based on you know
speed<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.370> explosive<00:02:20.910> talk<00:02:21.870> about<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
speed and explosive talk about the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.589 
speed and explosive talk about the
difference<00:02:22.470> between<00:02:22.830> starting<00:02:23.430> from<00:02:24.060> from

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
difference between starting from from

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.300 
difference between starting from from
zero<00:02:24.900> behind<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.470> quarterback<00:02:25.769> where<00:02:26.190> you're

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
zero behind the quarterback where you're

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.920 
zero behind the quarterback where you're
just<00:02:26.519> in<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.940> two-point<00:02:27.330> stance<00:02:27.360> waiting<00:02:27.870> to

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
just in a two-point stance waiting to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.360 
just in a two-point stance waiting to
get<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.140> ball<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:28.620> you're<00:02:28.739> really<00:02:28.890> going<00:02:29.129> from

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
get the ball so you're really going from

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.930 
get the ball so you're really going from
zero<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:29.910> 60<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.510> other<00:02:30.660> words<00:02:31.130> versus<00:02:32.130> getting

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
zero to 60 in other words versus getting

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.370 
zero to 60 in other words versus getting
through<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.390> line<00:02:33.569> with<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> ball<00:02:34.080> where<00:02:34.349> you

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
through the line with the ball where you

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.770 
through the line with the ball where you
have<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.739> slow<00:02:35.130> down<00:02:35.370> maybe<00:02:35.640> make<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> move<00:02:36.330> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
have to slow down maybe make a move and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.990 
have to slow down maybe make a move and
then<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.560> see<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> seam<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.489> talk<00:02:38.730> about<00:02:38.760> how

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
then you see a seam so talk about how

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.089 
then you see a seam so talk about how
it's<00:02:39.269> different<00:02:39.569> going<00:02:39.900> from<00:02:40.170> from<00:02:40.560> standing

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
it's different going from from standing

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.430 
it's different going from from standing
still<00:02:41.430> versus<00:02:42.360> when<00:02:42.569> you're<00:02:42.690> kind<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.989> slowing

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
still versus when you're kind of slowing

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.839 
still versus when you're kind of slowing
up<00:02:43.590> making<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.069> move<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.370> then<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.670> got<00:02:44.819> a

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
up making a move and then you got a

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.089 
up making a move and then you got a
burst<00:02:45.120> downfield<00:02:45.709> well<00:02:46.709> four<00:02:46.860> running<00:02:47.010> backs

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
burst downfield well four running backs

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.880 
burst downfield well four running backs
I<00:02:47.340> feel<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.700> kind<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:47.910> different

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
I feel is kind of different

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.250 
I feel is kind of different
we<00:02:49.890> use<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.340> term<00:02:50.519> slow<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.720> whole<00:02:51.900> speed

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
we use the term slow to the whole speed

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.080 
we use the term slow to the whole speed
through<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.590> whole<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:53.730> know<00:02:53.849> when<00:02:54.000> we're

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
through the whole so you know when we're

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.309 
through the whole so you know when we're
in<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.239> backfield<00:02:54.420> standing<00:02:55.019> behind<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
in the backfield standing behind the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.390 
in the backfield standing behind the
quarterback<00:02:55.530> we're<00:02:55.829> kind<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.040> taking<00:02:56.310> our

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
quarterback we're kind of taking our

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.190 
quarterback we're kind of taking our
time<00:02:56.579> being<00:02:56.849> patient<00:02:57.120> until<00:02:57.690> we<00:02:57.750> see<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.900> hole

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
time being patient until we see a hole

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.080 
time being patient until we see a hole
and<00:02:58.680> that's<00:02:58.950> that's<00:02:59.370> when<00:02:59.489> we<00:02:59.610> accelerate

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
and that's that's when we accelerate

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.970 
and that's that's when we accelerate
through<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.510> really<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:01.470> know<00:03:01.530> try<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.769> hit

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
through and really you know try to hit

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.309 
through and really you know try to hit
it<00:03:02.099> full<00:03:02.220> speed<00:03:02.579> as<00:03:03.480> far<00:03:03.690> as<00:03:03.780> second<00:03:04.110> level

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
it full speed as far as second level

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.449 
it full speed as far as second level

we get through the initial line of

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.990 
we get through the initial line of
scrimmage<00:03:10.530> we're<00:03:11.040> all<00:03:11.099> also<00:03:11.610> trying<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.849> make
