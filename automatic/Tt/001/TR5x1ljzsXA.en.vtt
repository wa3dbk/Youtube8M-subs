00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.490
 hip-hop fans got the chance 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.349
 learn the intricacies of dance on 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.789
 master classes stars of this dance 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.220
 Jaina direction is not 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.529
 or k each started in their own way but 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.029
 united their love of hip-hop and victory 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.179
 on the legendary television show 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.060
 so you think you can dance i started 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.140
 dance for 15 years and i started off as bboy then 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.269
 there is a project of Donets 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.970
 it is and still my favorite style but 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:38.100
 when i started i was thinking narrowly and mine 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.200
 only interested in hip-hop and break dance 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.660
 and I never thought about such a style as 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.160
 jazz for example over time understands that 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.030
 need to think wider then the result 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.620
 it turns out much more interesting and I started 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.379
 dance at the age of three 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.789
 later I was also very attracted to the dance project 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.250
 because this is incredible 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.469
 emotional dance this moment I already 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.930
 lived in cyprus and began to dance folk 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.059
 Greek dances then I started too 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.820
 greatly expand the range and with time 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.890
 mastered almost all dance styles we 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.280
