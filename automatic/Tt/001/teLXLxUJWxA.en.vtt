 help and clean 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.689
 recognize her 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.489
 in December at sea on the Turks 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.889
 very convenient to use for 

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:24.310
 of this 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.439
 categorically knife because 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.439
 change like 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.120
 males service completely 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.880
 Yes, and implemented what slices 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.710
 large enough 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.080
 and as you can see 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.420
 not in one layer 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.600
 dryer health allows you to dry 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.950
 just like that 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.460
 in total here here on four 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.940
 half-house 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.410
 where are you not 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.410
 in general, the whole world of Tokyo 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.490
 I listened to how the rink works 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.200
 after the first stage of drying long slices 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.970
 have become such 1 kimi 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.970
 but while they are not ready yet 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.760
 money we got 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.760
 it still remains 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.530
 now you can put on what they sweat 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.550
 add either every issue with 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.810
 tea 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.680
 good demand 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.020
 what is good to dry clothes at home 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.030
 conditions the fact is that it is a shortage 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.690
 there is not a single gram of sugar and this is me 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.420
 very useful for people who 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.610
 take care of their health 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.800
 great source of fiber 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 mineral substances 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.580
 most once on four types 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.580
 about five kilograms 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.839
 generally reverend completely forget 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:16.449
 but you can hear 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:18.369
