00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
yeah you can get an idea of it by

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.620 
yeah you can get an idea of it by
looking<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.909> way<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> reflects

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
looking but just the way it reflects

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.539 
looking but just the way it reflects
light<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.770> really<00:01:29.400> really

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
light like that is just really really

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.899 
light like that is just really really
cool<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.659> sword<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> little<00:01:31.439> bland<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.700> not

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
cool the sword is a little bland but not

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.670 
cool the sword is a little bland but not
really<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.540> bad<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.229> anything<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
really really bad or anything like that

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.020 
really really bad or anything like that
it's<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.520> really<00:01:35.850> shiny<00:01:36.150> reminds<00:01:37.020> me<00:01:37.170> of

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
it's just not really shiny reminds me of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.819 
it's just not really shiny reminds me of
Colossus<00:01:39.030> series<00:01:39.270> v<00:01:39.450> Colossus<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> lot<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
Colossus series v Colossus a lot and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.800 
Colossus series v Colossus a lot and
this<00:01:40.950> figure<00:01:41.159> itself<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> articulation

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
this figure itself like the articulation

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.120 
this figure itself like the articulation
really<00:01:43.140> feels<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.740> lot<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.950> titanium<00:01:46.950> man

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
really feels a lot like the titanium man

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.310 
really feels a lot like the titanium man
so<00:01:48.090> they're<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:48.990> they're<00:01:49.170> pretty

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
so they're you know they're pretty

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.929 
so they're you know they're pretty
similar<00:01:49.619> figures<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.189> definitely<00:01:50.610> totally

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
similar figures but definitely totally

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.999 
similar figures but definitely totally
different<00:01:51.450> sculpt<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.079> think<00:01:52.770> they're

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
different sculpt I think they're

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.050 
different sculpt I think they're
actually<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.670> same<00:01:53.880> exact<00:01:54.570> size<00:01:54.840> too<00:01:56.000> just<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
actually the same exact size too just a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.149 
actually the same exact size too just a
very<00:01:57.240> very<00:01:57.299> cool<00:01:57.630> looking<00:01:57.899> figure<00:01:58.110> I'm<00:01:58.740> hoping

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
very very cool looking figure I'm hoping

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.980 
very very cool looking figure I'm hoping
to<00:01:59.310> maybe<00:01:59.759> I'll<00:02:00.000> find<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.600> comic-con

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
to maybe I'll find one at comic-con

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.990 
to maybe I'll find one at comic-con
don't<00:02:01.649> know<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.280> there's<00:02:02.520> nothing<00:02:02.820> at<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
don't know and there's nothing at the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.320 
don't know and there's nothing at the
bottom<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.450> boots<00:02:03.930> that's<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.649> lame

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
bottom of the boots that's a little lame

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
did go with the 3 3/4 inch model but

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.060 
did go with the 3 3/4 inch model but
this<00:03:56.450> is<00:03:56.600> still<00:03:56.840> very<00:03:56.870> cool<00:03:57.230> regardless<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.980> I

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
this is still very cool regardless and I

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.670 
this is still very cool regardless and I
do<00:03:58.130> want<00:03:58.520> one<00:03:58.610> very<00:03:58.970> much<00:03:59.150> so<00:04:00.140> his<00:04:00.320> head<00:04:00.470> moves

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
do want one very much so his head moves

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.550 
do want one very much so his head moves
up<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.070> down<00:04:01.280> side<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:01.970> side<00:04:02.090> just<00:04:02.269> fine<00:04:02.780> moves

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
up and down side to side just fine moves

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.710 
up and down side to side just fine moves
up<00:04:03.860> fair<00:04:04.580> amount<00:04:04.820> so<00:04:05.090> that's<00:04:05.239> pretty<00:04:05.450> cool<00:04:05.600> you

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
up fair amount so that's pretty cool you

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.090 
up fair amount so that's pretty cool you
get<00:04:05.840> him<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.080> flying<00:04:06.350> pose<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.769> his<00:04:06.860> back

moves<00:04:08.060> up<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:08.480> down<00:04:08.570> so<00:04:08.840> this<00:04:08.930> is<00:04:08.989> really<00:04:09.170> good

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
is the one over to the right and series

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.280 
is the one over to the right and series
one<00:05:28.300> Iron<00:05:28.570> Man<00:05:28.690> right<00:05:28.720> there<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.080> he<00:05:29.170> goes

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
one Iron Man right there and he goes

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.750 
one Iron Man right there and he goes
into<00:05:29.530> scale<00:05:29.800> pretty<00:05:30.040> well<00:05:30.250> right<00:05:30.400> here<00:05:30.550> but

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
into scale pretty well right here but

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.400 
into scale pretty well right here but
he's<00:05:30.880> shorter<00:05:31.360> than<00:05:31.390> both<00:05:31.780> of<00:05:31.960> them<00:05:32.110> which<00:05:32.260> is

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
he's shorter than both of them which is

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.110 
he's shorter than both of them which is
a<00:05:32.440> little<00:05:32.740> weak<00:05:32.950> I<00:05:33.130> think<00:05:33.400> would<00:05:34.000> have<00:05:34.060> been

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
a little weak I think would have been

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.230 
a little weak I think would have been
nice<00:05:34.300> feels<00:05:34.570> taller<00:05:34.990> but<00:05:35.530> you<00:05:36.190> know<00:05:36.340> if<00:05:37.090> I'd

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
nice feels taller but you know if I'd

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.210 
nice feels taller but you know if I'd
remember<00:05:37.630> to<00:05:37.750> bring<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.260> inner<00:05:38.470> bust<00:05:38.890> out<00:05:39.040> the

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
remember to bring the inner bust out the

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.330 
remember to bring the inner bust out the
series<00:05:39.820> there<00:05:40.180> the<00:05:40.330> mark<00:05:40.870> six<00:05:41.230> one<00:05:41.620> you<00:05:42.070> can

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
series there the mark six one you can

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.730 
series there the mark six one you can
see<00:05:42.700> but<00:05:43.210> I'm<00:05:43.750> sure<00:05:43.990> century<00:05:44.350> productions

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
see but I'm sure century productions

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.560 
see but I'm sure century productions
doesn't<00:05:44.980> have<00:05:45.100> one<00:05:45.280> I'm<00:05:45.550> gonna<00:05:45.910> make<00:05:46.090> okay
