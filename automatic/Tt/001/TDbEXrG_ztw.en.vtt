 dcs beauty series is all heavy 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.960
 stood out but I think that you ducks played 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.570
 Overall not bad and deserve a way out 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.699

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.790
 Lucy for you what your voice or the most 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.790
 difficult to call such a key to be 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.589
 such 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:56.049
 fell alto 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:59.860

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:02.220
 konduk covered dna valves and 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.140
 quite periods 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.049
 you know it's hard to pick out some 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.110
 difficult game seems to me all the matches were 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.289
 difficult but key i would call the third 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.950
 match when in Nizhny Novgorod we wove 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:20.950
 20 to 1 managed to level the score and after 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.829
 of this we need to throw 2 washers 20 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.979
 seconds I would call this episode rather 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.810
 the key of the series is considered to be the command 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.640
 which plays North American style 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.329

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.990

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.009
 are there many dates for this 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.149

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.149
 first sign number 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.080
 prescribed brew forgive you take 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.649

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:05.759
 our egg funds and although 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:09.769
 defile but she spoke dorn and I 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.290
 Imagine the cooking stuck out 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.090
 honestly i'm special and holidays are difficult 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.769

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.700

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.860
 now 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.980

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:42.930

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.810
 the zero game gives loyalty to 7 personal 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.819

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.590
