and it is 24 different cases you can
choose<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> digital<00:01:40.170> or<00:01:40.409> there<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.100> 25

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
choose with the digital or there is 25

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.039 
choose with the digital or there is 25
different<00:01:42.060> ones<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.570> choose<00:01:42.720> with

now as I mentioned before there's an

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.990 
now as I mentioned before there's an
analog<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:41.590> digital<00:02:41.770> saying<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.790> can

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
analog and digital saying that you can

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.460 
analog and digital saying that you can
use<00:02:43.210> with<00:02:43.450> up<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.630> bit<00:02:43.960> when<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.170> would<00:02:44.290> like

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
use with up to bit when you would like

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.960 
use with up to bit when you would like
or<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:44.950> change<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.580> has<00:02:45.760> a

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
or you can change it so it has a

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.210 
or you can change it so it has a
different<00:02:46.150> color<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:47.230> finally<00:02:47.680> you've<00:02:48.040> got

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
different color and finally you've got

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.650 
different color and finally you've got
the<00:02:48.310> six<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.910> is<00:02:48.970> where<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.330> can<00:02:49.510> change

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
the six this is where you can change

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.120 
the six this is where you can change
different<00:02:50.110> things<00:02:50.140> like<00:02:50.560> if<00:02:50.770> you've<00:02:50.920> made<00:02:51.070> a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
different things like if you've made a

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.830 
different things like if you've made a
mistake<00:02:51.280> or<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.700> time<00:02:51.970> or<00:02:52.270> on<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.570> date<00:02:52.810> you

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
mistake or the time or on the date you

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.440 
mistake or the time or on the date you
can<00:02:53.170> go<00:02:53.320> back<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.680> change<00:02:53.980> it<00:02:54.220> in<00:02:54.400> VR<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.030> if<00:02:55.360> I

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
can go back and change it in VR and if I

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.090 
can go back and change it in VR and if I
don't<00:02:55.510> worry<00:02:55.750> for<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.440> day<00:02:56.590> as<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.890> less

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
don't worry for is this day as the less

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.190 
don't worry for is this day as the less
is<00:02:57.220> for<00:02:57.430> things<00:02:57.640> if<00:02:57.880> you<00:02:58.030> see<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> mistake<00:02:59.020> on

is for things if you see a mistake on

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.020 
is for things if you see a mistake on
the<00:02:59.350> time<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.800> can<00:02:59.950> go<00:03:00.100> back<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.520> change<00:03:00.820> it

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
the time you can go back and change it

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.460 
the time you can go back and change it
in<00:03:01.180> there<00:03:01.420> but<00:03:01.690> some<00:03:01.900> quick<00:03:02.080> look<00:03:02.260> at<00:03:02.380> the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
in there but some quick look at the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.140 
in there but some quick look at the
state<00:03:02.650> ends<00:03:02.830> with<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.490> just<00:03:03.670> simply<00:03:03.820> take

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
state ends with it you just simply take
