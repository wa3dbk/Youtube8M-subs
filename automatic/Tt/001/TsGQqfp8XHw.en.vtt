of a test as I can do I have all this

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.760 
of a test as I can do I have all this
craziness<00:00:14.880> hooked<00:00:15.839> up<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:17.100> tascam<00:00:17.880> dr-60d

into the 60d actually of this lav mic is
going<00:00:22.800> into<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:24.000> tascam<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.019> being

going into the tascam and it's being

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.790 
going into the tascam and it's being

own channel and all of the audio going
into<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> tascam<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.610> coming<00:00:39.030> out<00:00:39.270> into

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
into the tascam is all coming out into

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.310 
into the tascam is all coming out into
one<00:00:40.440> track<00:00:40.829> into<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.700> DSLR<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.899> it'll<00:00:43.079> all<00:00:43.290> be

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
one track into the DSLR so it'll all be

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.670 
one track into the DSLR so it'll all be
mixed<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.690> which<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.840> probably<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.260> how<00:00:46.649> I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
mixed in which is probably not how I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.430 
mixed in which is probably not how I
would<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:48.270> mixing<00:00:48.600> two<00:00:48.870> microphones

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
would do it I'm mixing two microphones

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
would do it I'm mixing two microphones
like<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.539> test<00:00:51.809> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
like that but this is just a test to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.500 
like that but this is just a test to
pipe<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.829> everything<00:00:53.579> from<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> tascam<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
pipe out everything from the tascam to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720 
pipe out everything from the tascam to
the<00:00:54.600> DSLR<00:00:55.079> as<00:00:55.260> well<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.800> record<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.309> separate

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the DSLR as well as record on separate

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.040 
the DSLR as well as record on separate
tracks<00:00:57.059> into<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.199> tascam<00:00:58.969> dr-60d<00:00:59.969> my<00:01:00.750> first

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
tracks into the tascam dr-60d my first

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.439 
tracks into the tascam dr-60d my first
shot<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.190> doing<00:01:02.850> everything<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.210> threw

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
shot of doing everything I threw

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.810 
shot of doing everything I threw
everything<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> rig<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> could

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
everything on the rig so that I could

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.240 
everything on the rig so that I could
see<00:01:06.510> how<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> works<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.590> fact<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
see how this works out and in fact the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.770 
see how this works out and in fact the
only<00:01:08.369> time<00:01:08.580> I'd<00:01:08.729> probably<00:01:08.760> use<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.299> like<00:01:09.420> this

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
only time I'd probably use it like this

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
only time I'd probably use it like this
in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.200> configuration<00:01:10.950> you're<00:01:11.130> seeing<00:01:11.520> is

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
in the configuration you're seeing is

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.450 
in the configuration you're seeing is
probably<00:01:12.659> four<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.830> obviously<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.250> very

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
probably four you know obviously a very

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.870 
probably four you know obviously a very
lockdown<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> tripod<00:01:16.220> studio<00:01:17.220> type<00:01:17.549> shoot

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
lockdown on a tripod studio type shoot

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
lockdown on a tripod studio type shoot
something<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:18.990> what<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.229> doing<00:01:19.409> right<00:01:19.530> now

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
something like what I'm doing right now

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.030 
something like what I'm doing right now
it<00:01:19.979> work<00:01:20.189> very<00:01:20.490> well<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.750> much<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it work very well not so much out in the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.499 
it work very well not so much out in the
field<00:01:23.280> where<00:01:23.580> things<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:24.000> changing<00:01:24.360> rapidly

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
field where things are changing rapidly

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.260 
field where things are changing rapidly
but<00:01:25.100> we'll<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.310> how<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> audio<00:01:26.790> comes<00:01:27.060> out

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
but we'll see how the audio comes out

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.030 
but we'll see how the audio comes out
and<00:01:27.479> I'll<00:01:27.840> play<00:01:28.080> around<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.890> different

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and I'll play around with the different

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.260 
and I'll play around with the different
microphones

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
microphones

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.499 
microphones
you'll<00:01:30.750> hear<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> rode<00:01:31.470> shotgun<00:01:32.369> video<00:01:33.299> mic

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
you'll hear the rode shotgun video mic

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.990 
you'll hear the rode shotgun video mic
Pro<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.170> you'll<00:01:34.439> hear<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> lab<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.790> so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
Pro and you'll hear just the lab and so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.670 
Pro and you'll hear just the lab and so
they<00:01:36.390> probably<00:01:36.630> both<00:01:36.869> sound<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.500> good

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
they probably both sound really good

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
they probably both sound really good
right<00:01:37.860> now<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:38.189> I'm<00:01:38.460> close<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> road

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
right now because I'm close to the road

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.899 
right now because I'm close to the road
okay<00:01:39.750> I'm<00:01:39.840> only<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.110> couple<00:01:40.409> feet<00:01:40.799> maybe<00:01:41.610> even

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
okay I'm only a couple feet maybe even

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.569 
okay I'm only a couple feet maybe even
just<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.150> foot<00:01:42.450> away<00:01:43.290> foot<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> half<00:01:44.490> away

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
just a foot away foot and a half away

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.440 
just a foot away foot and a half away
from<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.030> camera<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.159> lav<00:01:47.159> mic<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
from the camera so the lav mic and the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.660 
from the camera so the lav mic and the
rode<00:01:48.689> shotgun<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.890> probably<00:01:50.369> gonna<00:01:50.520> sound

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
rode shotgun is probably gonna sound

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.399 
rode shotgun is probably gonna sound
pretty<00:01:50.820> much<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.390> good<00:01:51.570> because<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.020> key<00:01:52.200> with

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
pretty much as good because the key with

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.440 
pretty much as good because the key with
microphones<00:01:53.009> no<00:01:53.640> matter<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:54.030> microphone

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
microphones no matter what microphone

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
microphones no matter what microphone
you're<00:01:54.570> using<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.340> close<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you're using is to get close get the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.670 
you're using is to get close get the
microphone<00:01:57.240> close<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> speaker's<00:01:58.469> mouth

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
microphone close to the speaker's mouth

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.740 
microphone close to the speaker's mouth
and<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.189> case<00:01:59.430> both<00:02:00.060> microphones<00:02:00.420> are

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and in this case both microphones are

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.410 
and in this case both microphones are

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
closed in other tests I'll back up and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.760 
closed in other tests I'll back up and
I'll<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.630> different<00:02:03.960> things<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.320> these<00:02:04.530> mics

we'll<00:02:09.539> see<00:02:09.720> how<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.959> audio<00:02:10.349> goes<00:02:10.560> into<00:02:10.830> tascam

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
we'll see how the audio goes into tascam

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.120 
we'll see how the audio goes into tascam
and<00:02:11.580> how<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.330> all<00:02:12.510> goes<00:02:12.720> into
