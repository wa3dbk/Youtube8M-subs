of<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> schools<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.110> realize<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.770> one

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.439 
of the schools we realize that that one
or<00:00:56.070> two<00:00:56.129> problems<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.640> need<00:00:56.850> overcoming<00:00:57.329> one

of<00:00:57.570> them<00:00:57.719> was<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.469> schools<00:00:59.370> tend<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> have

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
of them was that schools tend to have

of them was that schools tend to have

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
VGA monitors which was sold because we

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.690 
VGA monitors which was sold because we
