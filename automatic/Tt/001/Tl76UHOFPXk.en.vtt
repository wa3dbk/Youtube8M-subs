the<00:01:28.710> train<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.340> by<00:01:29.520> running<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.909> circles<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the train just by running in circles and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.969 
the train just by running in circles and
I'm<00:01:30.479> sure<00:01:30.630> there's<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> lot<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:30.960> other<00:01:31.380> guys<00:01:31.829> in
