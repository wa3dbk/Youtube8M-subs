super Brawley from last year and by
public<00:00:13.710> demand<00:00:13.980> also<00:00:14.460> we<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.850> was<00:00:14.940> inevitable

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
public demand also we it was inevitable

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.359 
public demand also we it was inevitable
that<00:00:15.600> we<00:00:15.719> had<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.020> design<00:00:16.200> a<00:00:16.650> superb<00:00:17.189> rally

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
that we had to design a superb rally

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.670 
that we had to design a superb rally
with<00:00:17.610> a<00:00:17.640> front<00:00:17.939> so<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:19.260> have<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> super

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
with a front so we have the super

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.950 
with a front so we have the super
broadly<00:00:20.130> system<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:21.360> terms<00:00:21.599> of<00:00:21.750> size<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
broadly system in terms of size and

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080 
broadly system in terms of size and
framework<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:23.010> exactly<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.610> same<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
framework it's exactly the same as the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.140 
framework it's exactly the same as the
super<00:00:24.419> Brawley<00:00:24.630> sixty<00:00:25.619> inch<00:00:25.739> frame<00:00:26.150> benefits

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
four ribs on the floor at the rear which

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.420 
four ribs on the floor at the rear which
gives<00:00:33.720> you<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.840> extra<00:00:34.020> support<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.860> also

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
main difference with the system is it's

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.840 
main difference with the system is it's
got<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> front<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.080> by<00:00:52.830> 110<00:00:53.430> millimeter

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
got a front so by 110 millimeter

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.820 
got a front so by 110 millimeter
heavy-duty<00:00:54.360> zip<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.200> either<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.650> no

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
heavy-duty zip you can either have no

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.800 
heavy-duty zip you can either have no
front<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.250> all<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.600> solid

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
front at all you can have your solid

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.110 
front at all you can have your solid
front<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.550> alternatively<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> warmer

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
front or alternatively in the warmer

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
front or alternatively in the warmer
months<00:01:00.150> it<00:01:00.600> does<00:01:00.930> come<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.200> an<00:01:01.440> independent

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
months it does come with an independent

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.670 
months it does come with an independent
full<00:01:02.490> mozzie<00:01:03.090> screen<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.290> you've<00:01:04.409> got<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
full mozzie screen so if you've got the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.609 
full mozzie screen so if you've got the
solid<00:01:04.890> panel<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:06.390> example<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.439> also

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
solid panel on for example you can also

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.240 
solid panel on for example you can also
see<00:01:08.100> by<00:01:08.640> simply<00:01:08.970> rolling<00:01:09.420> back<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.860> solid

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
see by simply rolling back the solid

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.330 
see by simply rolling back the solid
panels<00:01:11.899> it<00:01:12.899> benefits<00:01:13.439> from<00:01:13.560> also<00:01:14.039> mozzie

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
panels it benefits from also mozzie

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700 
panels it benefits from also mozzie
screens<00:01:14.789> so<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.509> use<00:01:15.719> the<00:01:16.140> full<00:01:16.380> front

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
screens so you can use the full front

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.399 
screens so you can use the full front
roll<00:01:17.280> all<00:01:17.429> the<00:01:17.460> windows<00:01:17.909> up<00:01:18.179> alternately<00:01:19.109> no

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
roll all the windows up alternately no

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.499 
roll all the windows up alternately no
front<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> full<00:01:20.399> mozzie<00:01:20.609> screen<00:01:20.969> it<00:01:21.450> really

front or a full mozzie screen it really

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.660 
front or a full mozzie screen it really
has<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:22.200> every<00:01:22.890> single<00:01:23.189> option<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.549> could

has got every single option you could

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.010 
has got every single option you could
wish<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:25.999> again<00:01:26.999> like<00:01:27.329> the<00:01:27.450> super<00:01:27.810> Brawley

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
wish for again like the super Brawley

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.989 
wish for again like the super Brawley
the<00:01:28.409> system<00:01:28.859> also<00:01:29.069> benefits<00:01:29.729> from<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
the system also benefits from the

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.859 
the system also benefits from the
optional<00:01:30.450> support<00:01:30.659> rib<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:32.280> main<00:01:32.749> problem<00:01:33.749> we

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
optional support rib the main problem we

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.289 
optional support rib the main problem we
had<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:35.460> had<00:01:35.609> to<00:01:35.759> obviously<00:01:36.060> go

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
had with this is we had to obviously go

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.809 
had with this is we had to obviously go
the<00:01:37.109> Polish<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:37.649> externally<00:01:38.399> to

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
the Polish to go externally to

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.359 
the Polish to go externally to
internally<00:01:39.539> so<00:01:40.289> we<00:01:40.380> managed<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.130> by

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
internally so we managed to do this by

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.819 
internally so we managed to do this by
positioning<00:01:41.999> two<00:01:42.299> little<00:01:42.990> eyelets<00:01:43.499> either

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
positioning two little eyelets either

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.249 
positioning two little eyelets either
side<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> door<00:01:44.749> which<00:01:45.749> are<00:01:45.899> out<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
side of the door which are out of the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.899 
side of the door which are out of the
way<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.469> you<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.859> no<00:01:47.039> water<00:01:47.280> ingress<00:01:47.759> or

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
way so you get no water ingress or

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.969 
way so you get no water ingress or
anything<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.289> of<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.409> benefits<00:01:49.530> from

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
anything but one of the benefits from

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.739 
anything but one of the benefits from
that<00:01:50.039> system<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.850> gives<00:01:51.029> you<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> porch<00:01:51.450> but

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
that system it gives you a porch but

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:54.099 
that system it gives you a porch but
gives<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.990> got<00:01:52.109> a<00:01:52.139> little<00:01:52.439> bit<00:01:52.560> more<00:01:52.619> cover

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
gives you got a little bit more cover

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.899 
gives you got a little bit more cover
again<00:01:55.109> like<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> other<00:01:56.249> fox<00:01:56.490> bib<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.789> in

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
again like all the other fox bib is in

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.419

the range it benefits from the two-way

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.499 
the range it benefits from the two-way
door<00:01:59.670> system<00:02:01.279> ok<00:02:02.279> heavy<00:02:02.579> duty<00:02:02.880> zips<00:02:03.149> are<00:02:03.299> used
