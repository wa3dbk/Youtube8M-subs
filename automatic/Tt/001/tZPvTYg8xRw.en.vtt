00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.860
 continues on the island of ré pan fried with a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.900
 salsa to hide the beetroot 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.820
 candied lemon candied flower 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.410
 so here we are on a wing of stripe peeled 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.750
 about 800 grams 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.570
 not to mention about 200 g of eldoret 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.210
 per person so here we go there seems a 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.310
 little and beard and the sulk stops 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.310
 because there is more flesh on it 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.739
 then there as it is a large wing 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.960
 ray we're going out a portion and there we 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.030
 can well see both levels jeff a 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.280
 first a second and center art 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.879
 so is to eat it's with the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.980
 fork 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.690
 we lift the pulpit eat on one side 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.160
 turn on we eat on the other side it's a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 pretty pleasant fish to eat where we 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 rarely falls on edges this will have 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.660
 that art is central so we miss it 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.879
 salt olive oil pepper of 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.070
 two sides 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.170
 clarify it and we're going to cook it to 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.180
 soft fire 2 to 3 minutes on each side 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.460
 it all depends on the thickness of the island of 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.009
 re we have it's hard to fix a 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.840
 precise time because the products 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.880
 change must still have 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.270
 holding on the ridge is important 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.310
 because a dry fish because fluorite 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.380
 then get rid of it to finish it 5 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.780
 minutes in the oven we work a lot to 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.390
 admit the product in value respect 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.450
 the seasons very important I think for 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.369
 to have a kitchen that kick and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.520
 that they are in tune with the times and 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.959
 respect the flavors ie not 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.810
 not too much mixing of flavors in one 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:47.689
 dish stop on four scents 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.439
 different if the palace is lost so 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.170
 we are on something of a kitchen 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.789
 originality but also simplicity 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.829
 in october november we have 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.780
 beautiful vegetables in the gardens whose 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.880
 beetroot and it is a very good vegetable 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.590
 there on this recipe we really put it 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.079
 worth because it's the filling 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.939
 main I cook them 45 minutes 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.769
 start cold waters big they 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.009
 are the earliest it returns as in 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.470
 Butter 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.200
 after we peel the beet once 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.880
 cold make go cube where we will put 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.489
 olive oil from sherry vinegar 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:26.030
 and scented and colored sava this 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:27.920
 works the watch and lime so 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.190
 there the lemon we have beforehand 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.810
 washed contests we will make it white 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.120
 and twice in a row to remove a 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.130
 little bitterness to then add the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.340
 sugar water and leather syrup girl 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.730
 for refusing liquoreux here is at 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.730
 lemon confit 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:54.440
 so we will go to dressage of the island 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.870
 of mischievous that we have at the bottom 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:09.769
 from the plate over the beets 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:12.019
 red cape flowers it's capr 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.820
 before the capr of the go out the flower 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.540
 who will then fall who will give the 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.130
 little cape 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.979
 so understand here we are on some 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.470
 something a lot softer it's a 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.639
 autumn recipe but at the same time 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.380
 all in freshness 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:30.040
 Here it is the green lemons we end 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.040
 some chives 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.490
 odile four names help should by 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.620
 above and to finish and julienne from 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.410
 raw red beets that will be available 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.810
 above and that will bring some crunch to 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.790
 dish if you can do the julienne in 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.640
 advance and plunge her into the icy water 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.440
 you're going to have more outfit then 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.870
 we put a little fleur de sel over 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.390
 for the wines one rather leaves on a 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.460
 white from the front of the domains 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.980
 Saint-Nicolas reliable vendéen 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.260
 organic farming is a wine on board 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.270
 of sea with a fresh eyes side and 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:13.660
 which will go very well with your wing 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:13.660
 from scratch to clean or
