00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 the mushrooms from this collection have no hats 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.270
 no man is enlightened 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.370
 would distinguish them from the usual mold 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.590
 According to the biologist and Tatyana ermines 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.960
 seemingly these specimens odious but 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.059
 possess healing properties for example 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.100
 Mongolian endemic 3 crowbar he bitter 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.050
 can be a panacea for various 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.060
 lung diseases to study it 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.560
 wood mushroom tatyana in more detail 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.400
 puts the strain into different biological 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.789
 Wednesday, my task is to pick up 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.759
 optimal environment temperature conditions 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.280
 we also pick and find the most 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.890
 active stamp for us 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.480
 just a collection of more than 30 mushrooms idea 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 its creation belongs to the head 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.129
 group of bio technologists of silver tatyane 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.230
 Penza on interest in this work she has 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.850
 arose after she carefully 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.129
 met with the atlas of Tibetan 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.440
 medicine as it turned out it is based on 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.750
 tree fungi monks cooked many 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.120
 the drug of the modern pharmaceuticals 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.129
 biologically active substances obtained 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.409
 of these organisms almost no 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.860
 apply it's time lost 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.080
 knowledge 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.070
 restore and develop for us 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.360
 biological activity itself is important there 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.570
 hepatoprotective antioxidant 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.450
 liver protection antiviral and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.310
 antibacterial and other activities 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.440
 which we can test in 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.840
 labs and then these 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.850
 The resulting substances are responsible for 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.509
 these activities we are passing medical 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.149
 which 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.429
 and check on mice there on others 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.530
 laboratory animals and this is also alive 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.840
 silver collection only in flasks not 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.340
 mushrooms and endangered plants one of 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.380
 Sergei collection compilers 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.630
 kazanovsky states a similar bank 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.009
 plant biologists are extremely necessary 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.290
 Siberian flora every year 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.540
 getting poorer many flowers and 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.430
 alder grass and also the tunkinskaya valley 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.950
 which used to cover these lands 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.890
 living carpet now you can only see 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.259
 behind the dried form who was on cape hoboy 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.090
 we admit those that there so already 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.280
 trampled this stone with the step 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.350
 the soil there is poor there and the sight 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.770
 many of these most endemic 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.869
 kinds 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.759
 who are simply now trampled 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.729
 is that we still here 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.799
 10 years ago they collected there described 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.470
 populations of these populations are simply not 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.329
 exists among endangered inhabitants 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.950
 alder is this astragalus for 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.170
 restoration of its natural population 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.750
 scientists cloned maternal plant 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.790
 and put the sprouts in the flasks 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.200
 if in a few months they prove 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.209
 its vitality 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.250
 already this spring they will land in a secluded 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.320
 corner of alder away from tourists 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.780
 part of the plant is planted and part so 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.670
 and remain to live in flasks for their 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.209
 cultivating scientists special 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.280
 rooms 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.709
 support a special light and 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.200
 temperature conditions such conditions 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.210
 inviolable living flora can 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.310
 kept over 10 years
