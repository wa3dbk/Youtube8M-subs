00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.240
 I am interested in their confrontation that I 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.359
 I can not look at it calmly and me 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.329

 commentator professional take here 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.399
 It is the commentary to forget about the passive 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:09.150
 because it is the country's points they are not 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.950

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.340
 Unfortunately unfortunately not Andrei T-shirt 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.590
 the centaurs are good and from the centaur ice is ice and 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 by the way how do you even here is a centaur not 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.409
 know very ruin he did not play either 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.180
 he did not watch one game before he was killed 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.729
 all win but he is everywhere now 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.460
 there are two types of anysayes husband and there are almost 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.890
 yes, yes and yes in each game 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.140
 there are still the other guys picked up 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.960
 not only there insane and and the rest 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.939
 teams that top collectively Andrei 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.590
 centaur chepenko 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.060
 report centaurs chepenko normally pulling 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.610
 there are two or three cards was not even 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.950
 in a row and all three 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.590
 andrey centaurs chipenko but so there 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.920
 normally drove it also gives shorter 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.060
 cutters to all until when two years due 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.950
 this is really cool 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.510
 fights get wards run because 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.280
 any crap which is up which is folded 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.080
 reach and lose some 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.850
 agiliki nick before them very quickly trusts 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.040
 almost the whole team is rubbed 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.640
 into powder that is what you think on 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.010
 add 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.440
 Well, not that I just look damn 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.180
 a lot of moments when the team wanted 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.770
 the enemy has killed him because well 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.010
 two screw caliper normal they 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:42.590
 needs that centaur 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:44.630
 he will make and for him it is not necessary 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.750
 as a professional group it seems to me 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.239
 strong yet no ulta on level more 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:57.140
 in general, you can do nothing on the base 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:03:00.050
 just on leoric stole the urgency of the team 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.730
 virtus.pro nose or this rating remember 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.920
 two or three days ago with 113 no yes here 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.080
 like this is not because there is either 1 or 2 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.600
 I understand not well, yes, the Chinese are so not 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.500
 can of course it was normal Russian 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.870
 such a dagger blink your star top 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.120
 boots fat from the movie without a diver do not need 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.970
 we obviously just x saw ratings not 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.870
 there is a dude in public who have 6 there with 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.750
 on 2000r 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.540
 he will gather happy drums return to 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.970
 radiance and not written by april just 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.310
 goes up to the norm wins by the way not 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.959
 watched the game with your say main 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.540
 competitor or student not know 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.850
 Padawan where the jellyfish was with three 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.130
 rapiers that is she didn't have a sneaker she 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.930
 just know you sold the folders already in 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.709
 late bought a third rapier and so melts 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.340
 slowly sure damn give it to me 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:57.260
 by the way it seems there were insane food it seems 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:03.860
 it was it played insane against i don't 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:06.620
 I remember our dts almost n. dts year lived 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.320
 there was a fire there that is this jellyfish 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.329
 I called in with my size cis and collected 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.420
 them even when I did not know how to go 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.520
 so that is here to someone else 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.139
 another is credited with these achievements too 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.810
 all hun as said 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:26.290
 Elisha Elisha Chepenko us all coinage 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.330
 Well yes a lot of them actually, I do only 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.419
 I know one thing or I'm lucky that I only 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.450
 one goal and a villain major him so but 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.090
 right there venomancer what are we for whom 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.580
 bet I bet 100 100 dollars on 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.230
 Kew cyber gaming that is, you do not 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.389
 you believe virtus.pro just now 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.889
 virtus.pro lost on techlabs 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:51.669
 or just there is something text over 20 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:56.250
 Mantis was there 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:59.889
 he had enough of them burst pipe and 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.919
 there was a victory for what seems to be here already 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.780
 he was taken from the heroes and now the miracle 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.610
 playing Kent now my favorite move 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.820
 it is necessary to put the standard like you 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:14.580
 prize money then the lion moves to 202 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:17.470
 and now husband and css and the wind howls 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.479
