three quarter inch so I think I'll get
the<00:02:28.140> jewelry<00:02:28.859> from<00:02:29.430> 716<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.540> three<00:02:30.989> quarter

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
the jewelry from 716 to three quarter

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.640

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.800 
yeah I imagine it would take me maybe
about<00:02:38.340> two<00:02:38.609> three<00:02:38.850> months<00:02:39.060> maybe<00:02:39.540> four<00:02:39.780> months

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
about two three months maybe four months

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.690 
about two three months maybe four months
to<00:02:40.049> get<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.320> three-quarter<00:02:40.799> inch<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.370> I

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
to get to three-quarter inch if I

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.259 
to get to three-quarter inch if I
consistently<00:02:43.040> try<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.100> push<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.730> sizes

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
consistently try to push to the sizes

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.650

each<00:02:45.930> size<00:02:46.260> every<00:02:47.010> month<00:02:47.220> or<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:48.359> I<00:02:48.390> might

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
each size every month or so so I might

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.750 
each size every month or so so I might
take<00:02:48.840> me<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:49.650> might<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.250> might<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.549> able<00:02:50.609> to

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760
