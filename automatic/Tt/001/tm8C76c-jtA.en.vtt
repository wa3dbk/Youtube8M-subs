so<00:00:10.940> in<00:00:11.090> this<00:00:11.210> test<00:00:11.420> we're<00:00:11.630> going<00:00:11.720> to<00:00:11.780> compare

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
so in this test we're going to compare

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.750 
so in this test we're going to compare
the<00:00:12.800> speed<00:00:13.430> at<00:00:13.940> which<00:00:14.000> the<00:00:14.630> two<00:00:15.230> lenses<00:00:16.010> 18-135

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
the speed at which the two lenses 18-135

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.580 
the speed at which the two lenses 18-135
STM<00:00:17.690> and<00:00:18.080> the<00:00:18.200> 18<00:00:18.529> to<00:00:18.650> 135<00:00:19.099> non<00:00:19.790> STM<00:00:20.390> grab<00:00:20.990> focus

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
STM and the 18 to 135 non STM grab focus

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.330 
STM and the 18 to 135 non STM grab focus
I'm<00:00:22.040> going<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:23.110> flip<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.260> lens<00:00:24.830> switch<00:00:25.070> to

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
I'm going to flip the lens switch to

manual focus I'm going to defo 'kiss
this<00:00:28.490> as<00:00:29.240> much<00:00:29.449> as<00:00:29.480> possible<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.350> then<00:00:30.970> servo

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
this as much as possible and then servo

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.090 
this as much as possible and then servo
AF<00:00:32.270> is<00:00:32.449> on<00:00:32.599> so<00:00:32.900> as<00:00:33.020> soon<00:00:33.170> as<00:00:33.320> I<00:00:33.410> flip<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.830> switch

AF is on so as soon as I flip the switch
to<00:00:34.610> autofocus<00:00:35.059> it's<00:00:35.420> going<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.629> go<00:00:35.870> ahead<00:00:35.960> and

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
to autofocus it's going to go ahead and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.020 
to autofocus it's going to go ahead and
try<00:00:36.290> to<00:00:36.350> get<00:00:36.530> auto<00:00:36.680> focus<00:00:37.100> I'm<00:00:37.640> not<00:00:37.820> going<00:00:37.970> to

try to get auto focus I'm not going to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.210 
try to get auto focus I'm not going to
talk<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:38.239> we<00:00:38.449> can<00:00:38.690> listen<00:00:38.840> for<00:00:39.260> any<00:00:39.590> kinds<00:00:40.160> of

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.729 

there<00:00:49.820> goes<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:50.269> got<00:00:50.690> focus<00:00:51.019> I'm<00:00:51.440> going<00:00:51.589> to<00:00:51.680> do

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
there goes it got focus I'm going to do

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.490 
there goes it got focus I'm going to do
that<00:00:51.890> one<00:00:52.010> more<00:00:52.129> time<00:00:53.080> switch<00:00:54.080> to<00:00:54.290> manual

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
that one more time switch to manual

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.049 
that one more time switch to manual
focus<00:00:54.680> on<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.190> lens<00:00:55.339> because<00:00:55.580> this<00:00:55.670> lens<00:00:55.879> is

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
focus on the lens because this lens is

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.000 
focus on the lens because this lens is
not<00:00:56.089> full<00:00:56.750> time<00:00:56.960> manual<00:00:57.199> focus<00:00:57.710> a<00:00:57.769> lot<00:00:57.890> of

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
not full time manual focus a lot of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.140 
not full time manual focus a lot of
information<00:00:58.460> floating<00:00:58.640> around<00:00:58.820> out<00:00:59.120> there

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
information floating around out there

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.030 
information floating around out there
that<00:00:59.420> says<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.720> is<00:00:59.750> turns<00:01:00.409> out<00:01:00.559> that<00:01:00.739> it<00:01:00.890> is<00:01:01.010> not

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
that says it is turns out that it is not

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.189 
that says it is turns out that it is not
I<00:01:01.339> even<00:01:01.729> mistakenly<00:01:02.479> thought<00:01:02.720> it<00:01:02.900> was<00:01:03.049> at

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
I even mistakenly thought it was at

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.710 
I even mistakenly thought it was at
first<00:01:03.229> it's<00:01:03.890> in<00:01:03.949> manual<00:01:04.369> focus<00:01:04.760> D<00:01:05.239> focused

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
first it's in manual focus D focused

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.780 
first it's in manual focus D focused
switch<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.590> autofocus<00:01:11.590> okay<00:01:12.590> now<00:01:13.220> I'm<00:01:13.640> going

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
switch the autofocus okay now I'm going

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.300 
switch the autofocus okay now I'm going
to<00:01:13.880> stop<00:01:14.600> this<00:01:14.780> video<00:01:14.930> switch<00:01:15.409> lenses<00:01:15.859> to<00:01:16.189> the

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
to stop this video switch lenses to the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.529 
to stop this video switch lenses to the
non<00:01:16.549> STM<00:01:17.090> lens<00:01:17.329> and<00:01:17.600> make<00:01:18.079> some<00:01:18.229> comparisons

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
non STM lens and make some comparisons

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:25.389 
non STM lens and make some comparisons
okay<00:01:20.539> I<00:01:20.750> now<00:01:21.259> have<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.890> 18<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:22.969> 135<00:01:23.600> non<00:01:24.530> STM

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
okay I now have the 18 to 135 non STM

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.730 
okay I now have the 18 to 135 non STM
the<00:01:25.640> older<00:01:25.969> version<00:01:26.299> lens<00:01:26.479> on<00:01:26.780> I'm<00:01:27.229> going<00:01:27.590> to

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
the older version lens on I'm going to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.469 
the older version lens on I'm going to
flip<00:01:28.039> the<00:01:28.250> switch<00:01:28.460> from<00:01:28.640> manual<00:01:29.060> focus<00:01:29.390> to

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
flip the switch from manual focus to

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.539 
flip the switch from manual focus to
autofocus<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.109> we're<00:01:30.229> going<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.439> watch<00:01:31.250> and

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
autofocus and we're going to watch and

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.130 
autofocus and we're going to watch and
see<00:01:31.609> how<00:01:31.759> long<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:31.969> takes<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:32.390> focus<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:32.990> we're

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
see how long it takes to focus and we're

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:41.010 
see how long it takes to focus and we're
going<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.289> listen<00:01:33.469> for<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.770> focusing<00:01:34.250> noise

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.560 

alright<00:01:42.020> let's<00:01:42.350> do<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:42.649> one<00:01:42.799> more<00:01:42.920> time<00:01:42.979> and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
alright let's do that one more time and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:57.410 
alright let's do that one more time and
you'll<00:01:44.570> focus<00:01:44.920> D<00:01:45.920> focus<00:01:46.780> auto<00:01:47.780> focus

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.090 

okay<00:01:58.050> pretty<00:01:58.440> significant<00:01:58.979> difference

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
okay pretty significant difference

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.040 
okay pretty significant difference
between<00:01:59.400> those<00:01:59.729> two<00:01:59.790> let's<00:02:00.690> throw<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
between those two let's throw the

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.230 
between those two let's throw the
pancake<00:02:01.590> 40<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> quick<00:02:02.820> test<00:02:03.030> with

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
pancake 40 on and do a quick test with

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.600 
pancake 40 on and do a quick test with
that<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.510> well<00:02:03.659> since<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.200> right<00:02:04.380> here

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
that as well since I have it right here

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.840 
that as well since I have it right here
and<00:02:05.659> D<00:02:06.659> focused<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.440> manual<00:02:08.160> focus<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.700> I'm

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
and D focused and manual focus and I'm

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.020 
and D focused and manual focus and I'm
going<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.000> switch<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.209> autofocus<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.640> go

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
going to switch to autofocus and go

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.290 
going to switch to autofocus and go
I<00:02:15.060> detect<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.230> tiny<00:02:16.590> bit<00:02:16.860> more<00:02:17.130> noise<00:02:17.820> from

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
I detect just a tiny bit more noise from

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.290 
I detect just a tiny bit more noise from
the<00:02:18.480> 40<00:02:18.930> than<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.290> do<00:02:19.350> from<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.740> 18<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.250> 135<00:02:20.760> STM

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the 40 than I do from the 18 to 135 STM

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.390 
the 40 than I do from the 18 to 135 STM
the<00:02:21.480> 18<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.900> 135<00:02:22.410> STM<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:22.920> very<00:02:23.489> very<00:02:24.060> quiet
