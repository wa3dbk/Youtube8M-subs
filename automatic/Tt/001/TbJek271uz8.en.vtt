hey<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.469> it<00:00:01.620> going<00:00:01.970> so<00:00:02.970> these<00:00:03.210> are<00:00:03.449> your<00:00:03.570> clamps

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:04.940 
hey is it going so these are your clamps

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.290 
hey is it going so these are your clamps
3d<00:00:05.940> printed<00:00:06.330> these<00:00:06.450> knobs<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.490> then<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.880> heat

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
3d printed these knobs and then I heat

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.660 
3d printed these knobs and then I heat
it<00:00:09.330> up<00:00:09.769> not<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.160> end<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.370> soldering

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
it up not on the end of the soldering

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.180 
it up not on the end of the soldering
iron<00:00:12.170> and<00:00:13.170> it<00:00:13.410> uh<00:00:15.170> and<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.379> then<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:17.039> get

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
iron and it uh and that then just get

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.490 
iron and it uh and that then just get
depressed<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.699> there<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.810> shouldn't<00:00:19.230> come<00:00:19.350> out

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
depressed in there it shouldn't come out

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.019 
depressed in there it shouldn't come out
I<00:00:19.560> mean<00:00:19.830> I've<00:00:19.949> talked<00:00:20.430> down<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.580> pretty<00:00:20.789> hard<00:00:20.970> I

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
I mean I've talked down a pretty hard I

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.759 
I mean I've talked down a pretty hard I
couldn't<00:00:21.270> get<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.449> move

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
couldn't get it to move

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.310 
couldn't get it to move
yep<00:00:23.340> pretty<00:00:24.060> accurate<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.740> knobs<00:00:27.320> so

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
yep pretty accurate on the knobs so

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
yep pretty accurate on the knobs so
these<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.539> t-nuts<00:00:31.219> threaded<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
these are the t-nuts threaded with a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.010 
these are the t-nuts threaded with a
quarter<00:00:33.440> 22<00:00:34.440> match<00:00:34.590> threaded<00:00:35.190> rod<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.610> not

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
quarter 22 match threaded rod I'm not

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.500 
quarter 22 match threaded rod I'm not
here<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> clamps<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.430> side<00:00:38.700> there's<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
here the clamps on one side there's a

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
here the clamps on one side there's a
little<00:00:39.809> notch<00:00:42.110> just<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.290> grab<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.710> end<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
little notch just to grab the end of the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.069 
little notch just to grab the end of the
piece<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.399> wood<00:00:44.520> there's<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> pretty<00:00:45.239> wide<00:00:45.660> slot

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
piece of wood there's a pretty wide slot

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.889 
piece of wood there's a pretty wide slot
to<00:00:46.620> keep<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:47.270> give<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> freedom

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
to keep your give you all the freedom

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.299 
to keep your give you all the freedom
you<00:00:48.930> need<00:00:50.539> so<00:00:51.539> yeah<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.320> t-nuts<00:00:52.649> slide<00:00:52.980> into

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you need so yeah the t-nuts slide into

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
you need so yeah the t-nuts slide into
your<00:00:53.340> your<00:00:54.030> router<00:00:54.329> table<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.410> take<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
your your router table then you take the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.290 
your your router table then you take the
stepper<00:00:55.949> block<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.850> put<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> other

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
stepper block you put it on the other

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.590 
stepper block you put it on the other
side<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.940> you<00:00:59.940> know<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.359> pretty

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
side and you know you can get pretty

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.860 
side and you know you can get pretty
close<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:02.190> where<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.789> need<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.090> based<00:01:03.750> on

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
close to where you need to be based on

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.080 
close to where you need to be based on
the<00:01:03.960> step<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.260> block<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.460> can't<00:01:05.729> get

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the step of block and if you can't get

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.850 
the step of block and if you can't get
the<00:01:06.330> measurement<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> need<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.740> only

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the measurement you need you can only

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.030 
the measurement you need you can only
just<00:01:08.010> flip<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.310> around<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.659> 0.125<00:01:10.350> inches

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
just flip it around this is 0.125 inches

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.140 
just flip it around this is 0.125 inches
and<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.299> 0.1<00:01:12.930> steps<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.700> mean

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and these are 0.1 steps so that I mean

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.340 
and these are 0.1 steps so that I mean
you<00:01:15.360> should<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.720> able<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> find<00:01:16.110> between

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you should be able to find between

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.510 
you should be able to find between
either<00:01:17.250> flipping<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.759> over<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:19.159> if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.340> clip

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
either flipping it over or if you clip

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.670 
either flipping it over or if you clip
the<00:01:20.610> plug<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.030> way<00:01:21.240> it'll<00:01:21.810> step<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.350> different

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the plug this way it'll step a different

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
the plug this way it'll step a different
increment<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.909> should<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.270> able<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
increment so I you should be able to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.719 
increment so I you should be able to
find<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.990> matches<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.520> stock<00:01:28.610> if<00:01:29.610> you

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
find one that matches your stock if you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.010 
find one that matches your stock if you
can't<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.450> stick<00:01:30.570> something<00:01:30.780> under

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
can't you can just stick something under

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.810 
can't you can just stick something under
the<00:01:31.110> stepper<00:01:31.380> block<00:01:31.590> or<00:01:31.970> or<00:01:32.970> whatever<00:01:33.799> these

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
the stepper block or or whatever these

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.249 
the stepper block or or whatever these
are<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.030> extra<00:01:36.740> tea<00:01:37.740> nuts<00:01:37.979> with<00:01:38.490> knobs<00:01:39.259> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
are the extra tea nuts with knobs and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.289 
are the extra tea nuts with knobs and
then<00:01:40.439> these<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> ones<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.070> figure<00:01:41.310> if<00:01:41.850> you

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
then these are the ones I figure if you

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.950 
then these are the ones I figure if you
wanted<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:43.430> make<00:01:44.430> your<00:01:44.460> own<00:01:44.729> clamps<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.780> can

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
wanted to make your own clamps you can

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.649 
wanted to make your own clamps you can
just<00:01:46.399> pull<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> knob<00:01:47.640> off<00:01:47.850> stick<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> piece

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
just pull the knob off stick the piece

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.630 
just pull the knob off stick the piece
of<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.020> there<00:01:49.229> leave<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.130> stepper<00:01:50.369> block

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
of one on there leave your stepper block

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.200 
of one on there leave your stepper block
on<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> back<00:01:51.030> side<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.250> from<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
on the back side and then from there I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.030 
on the back side and then from there I
milled<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.840> channel<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> stepper<00:01:55.770> block

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
milled a channel in the stepper block

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.289 
milled a channel in the stepper block
just<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.430> case<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.729> needed<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.119> real

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
just in case you needed to get real

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.530 
just in case you needed to get real
close<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:59.610> couldn't<00:02:00.060> see<00:02:00.390> that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
close like this I couldn't see that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.200 
close like this I couldn't see that
happening<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.649> case<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:02.880> so

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
happening but just in case and then so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.210 
happening but just in case and then so
how<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.750> work<00:02:04.040> go<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.070> like<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
how they work go on like this that the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.100 
how they work go on like this that the
middle<00:02:08.489> Tina<00:02:09.030> goes<00:02:09.360> inside<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> your

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
middle Tina goes inside of your

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.100 
middle Tina goes inside of your
channel<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.320> your<00:02:12.500> router<00:02:12.980> table<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.930> goes

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
channel on your router table that goes
