good<00:00:58.199> idea<00:00:59.059> goals<00:01:00.059> 3<00:01:00.449> make<00:01:01.440> sure<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.770> first

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
good idea goals 3 make sure that first

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.759 
good idea goals 3 make sure that first
one<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.780> below<00:01:03.780> parallel<00:01:04.080> everything<00:01:04.589> else

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
one was below parallel everything else

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.560 
one was below parallel everything else
after<00:01:05.100> i<00:01:05.129> told<00:01:05.250> myself<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.939> long<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.299> i<00:01:06.390> hit

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
after i told myself as long as i hit

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.690 
after i told myself as long as i hit
parallel<00:01:06.990> i'm<00:01:07.140> fine<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
parallel i'm fine with it so there's a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.250 
parallel i'm fine with it so there's a
three<00:01:08.970> minimum<00:01:09.360> anything<00:01:09.720> else<00:01:09.869> after<00:01:10.049> this

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
three minimum anything else after this

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.859 
three minimum anything else after this
point<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.619> extra<00:01:11.340> credit<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:17.330> not<00:01:18.330> too<00:01:18.540> bad<00:01:18.750> at

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
point is extra credit so not too bad at

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
point is extra credit so not too bad at
all

just do what kind of a said there's no
real<00:03:05.800> reason<00:03:05.950> for<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:06.370> other<00:03:06.610> than<00:03:06.900> we<00:03:07.900> were

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
real reason for this other than we were

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.449 
real reason for this other than we were
kind<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.290> wondering<00:03:08.410> if<00:03:08.709> we<00:03:08.830> could<00:03:08.980> do<00:03:09.070> it<00:03:09.100> and

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
kind of wondering if we could do it and

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.170 
kind of wondering if we could do it and
so<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:10.260> did<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.890> was<00:03:11.980> fun<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.910> was<00:03:13.000> all

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
so I did and it was fun and it was all

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.500 
so I did and it was fun and it was all
so<00:03:13.300> stupid<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.870> don't<00:03:14.140> try<00:03:14.320> this<00:03:14.380> at<00:03:14.530> home

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
so stupid so don't try this at home

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.180 
so stupid so don't try this at home
because<00:03:16.510> there's<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:17.050> better<00:03:17.680> chance<00:03:17.800> of

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
because there's a better chance of

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.410 
because there's a better chance of
getting<00:03:18.250> her<00:03:18.550> than<00:03:18.760> getting<00:03:18.940> much<00:03:19.060> work<00:03:19.269> out

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
getting her than getting much work out

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.470 
getting her than getting much work out
of<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:21.420> haven't<00:03:22.420> done<00:03:22.570> much<00:03:22.750> jumping<00:03:23.560> since

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
of it so haven't done much jumping since

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.759 
of it so haven't done much jumping since
months<00:03:25.480> before<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.110> injury<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:26.739> I

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
months before the injury and so I

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.170 
months before the injury and so I
decided<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.340> be<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.489> good<00:03:27.670> chance<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:28.030> get<00:03:28.120> back

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
decided to be a good chance to get back

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.350 
decided to be a good chance to get back
into<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.660> and

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
into it and

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.720 
into it and
this<00:03:30.660> is<00:03:30.870> forty<00:03:31.680> eight<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.010> half<00:03:32.040> inch<00:03:32.460> box

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
this is forty eight and a half inch box

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.590 
this is forty eight and a half inch box
if<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.120> remember<00:03:33.480> correctly<00:03:34.100> so<00:03:35.390> that's<00:03:36.390> almost

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
if I remember correctly so that's almost

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.790 
if I remember correctly so that's almost
50<00:03:36.960> inches<00:03:37.520> not<00:03:38.520> not<00:03:38.880> too<00:03:39.090> horrible<00:03:39.270> I'm<00:03:39.800> 510

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
50 inches not not too horrible I'm 510

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
50 inches not not too horrible I'm 510
so<00:03:41.190> if<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.630> gives<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.780> any<00:03:42.870> kind<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.820> gauge

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
so if that gives you any kind of gauge

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.480 
so if that gives you any kind of gauge
on<00:03:45.090> how<00:03:45.120> tall<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.480> box<00:03:45.810> actually<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.650> how

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
on how tall that box actually is and how

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.660 
on how tall that box actually is and how
much<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.790> takes<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:48.000> jump<00:03:48.240> on<00:03:48.330> top<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.540> it<00:03:49.670> these

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
much it takes to jump on top of it these

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.150 
much it takes to jump on top of it these
are<00:03:50.790> some<00:03:50.940> kneeling<00:03:51.150> box<00:03:51.540> jumps<00:03:51.960> I<00:03:52.170> like<00:03:52.890> this

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
are some kneeling box jumps I like this

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.830 
are some kneeling box jumps I like this
