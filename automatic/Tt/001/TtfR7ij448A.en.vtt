my head cut off here this is a nice
pillow<00:00:36.220> really

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.390 

really<00:00:39.859> loud<00:00:40.120> you'll<00:00:41.120> get

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
really loud you'll get

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.920

well<00:02:09.100> technically<00:02:10.100> it's<00:02:10.280> not<00:02:10.340> driving<00:02:10.880> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
well technically it's not driving the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.860 
well technically it's not driving the
green<00:02:11.240> as<00:02:11.600> high<00:02:11.900> as<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.200> could<00:02:12.380> be

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.390 

freeze<00:02:15.870> right<00:02:16.079> we've<00:02:16.709> all<00:02:16.859> seen<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.189> one

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
freeze right we've all seen this one

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.869 
freeze right we've all seen this one
before<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.909> is<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.709> amazing<00:02:19.709> blue<00:02:20.310> let's

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
before this is this amazing blue let's

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.830 
before this is this amazing blue let's
have<00:02:21.090> 5<00:02:21.329> and<00:02:21.749> the<00:02:21.959> course<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.379> is<00:02:22.530> to

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
have 5 and the course this is to

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.839 
have 5 and the course this is to
lithium-ion<00:02:24.840> cells<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.560> as<00:02:25.950> well<00:02:26.219> and<00:02:26.579> it's

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
lithium-ion cells and as well and it's

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.580 
lithium-ion cells and as well and it's
being<00:02:27.030> over<00:02:27.299> driven<00:02:27.659> similar<00:02:28.079> to<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.349> other

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
only help its 350 milliamp but what

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.090 
only help its 350 milliamp but what
