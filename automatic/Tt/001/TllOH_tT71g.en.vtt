00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.349
 another murder conception 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:13.110
 This time around it just adds 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.410
 only so yes because it I think that knows 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.029
 each a redstone blocks to these 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.920
 send a redstone signal as soon as you 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.529
 the transmitter and receiver on the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 running the same frequency would then 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.279
 I could do quite useful things 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.300
 I am here once the blocks 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.420
 senders and fans i can provide 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:41.489
 now something just go out and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.719
 show I say together now 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:55.140
 make hidden entrance i think 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:56.730
 everybody knows that here are 23 now 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.949
 If you want to do it, you have to climb it 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.480
 content to go ahead but there is 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.109
 once here the wireless receivers 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.670
 beautiful 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:17.040
 of course he needs that if anything 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:18.479
 Here you have one 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.670
 finger down you can put so many on one 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.189
 Frequor laurel forest say here now 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.689
 are my frequency can be the x plus 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.360
 10 or do it all now on stage 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.720
 One you can also run up for it 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.720
 would like to demonstrate that 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:56.040
 Now, I'll say you're packing here 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:01.860
 These themselves go through a stone 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:07.590
 by the one of you also have to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:11.760
 on 11 but also on it now 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:16.730
 could easily find the parts on or 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.730
 also and then you can sometimes 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:33.540
 tackle yourself and with switch on 1 1 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:35.790
 put and still another switch runs 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.470
 the whole yes that 's mine 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.270
 he favorite place to find for him 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.860
 You are welcome to sign because you 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.980
 a video I really really 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.110
 commented that is actually quite 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.610
 nice because then i also see something like that 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.620
 also what you do not like it or where 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.890
 He needs help one whom I have 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.090
 already helped over skype is more 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.350
 and also like to write more 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.190
 videos as a youtuber i did 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.410
 do not know who that was 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.910
 Thanks for that, so I think it's really good 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.630
 There are feedback and could also say 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.370
 I am also bad for that 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.810
 helpful if the direct decision 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:17.190
 I will need to do it completely 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:19.049
 firmly and shows here this last this 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.690
 a bit in my opinion 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.769
 pretty much means you can do it 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.420
 build really cool things and a lot 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.760
 easier mainly because we have to install 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.140
 of the year behind one another 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.670
 I do not need to be dissimilar 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.610
 his ex-team circuit is still the one 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.970
 the front lacks that overarching 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.920
 yes and then it was the thank you for it 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.600
 there and students have fun with what he 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.269
 just makes on youtube no idea 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.269
 until the next video 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.540
 I'm back at the installation 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.290
 style like every time after one 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.600
 book presentation 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.000
 I forgot to say yes 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.650
 but still knows how you all the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.240
 installed you see now here now 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.010
 let's go to the description slink us 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.500
 and a description as you come here 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.150
 again at micro forums out but is 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.160
 now here because ultimately it also for 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.170
 1.6 that took me a long time 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.250
 thought there is no more going out 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.380
 including there are with these online 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.940
 install but I do not recommend you something 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.900
 because sometimes I am with some 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.010
 pretty hard to get out of it 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.380
 case they are not wanted anymore 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.150
 I do not know how he is going against the 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.700
 just 1.614 14.6 click on it 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.870
 you do not passed and you have 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.290
 actually because the redstone 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.080
 hybrid4 know how it works but almost 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.800
 not on generations isabelle 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.600
 mergault 69 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.050
 keep old pressed then probably 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:43.740
 library comes out of this application 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.210
 support minecraft like that and if you 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.220
 Forge downloaded from me too 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.940
 have you ever explained you go to the 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.650
 pug order 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.580
 I already have some of those that I have 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.860
 will also introduce how to 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.120
 for example the world bikes or the best 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.620
 or come in single player 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.600
 I already have it in here now 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.520
 whole draws because here just can 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.660
 I also made you very short 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.280
 of course does not need replacing because 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.180
 You do not have her yet and that's it 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.000
 even then it really should 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.420
 run smoothly 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.860
 John otherwise thanks for watching 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.860
 see you next time
