and it just kind of crunched me like a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.760 
and it just kind of crunched me like a
like<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.580> taco<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.420> know<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:11.020> fractured<00:02:11.530> a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
like a taco you know and I fractured a

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.830 
like a taco you know and I fractured a
vertebrae<00:02:12.190> right<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.550> center<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.030> my

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
sternum on the stomach side so is that

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.449 
sternum on the stomach side so is that
then<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.940> design<00:02:18.940> problem<00:02:19.720> or<00:02:20.319> not<00:02:20.950> happy<00:02:21.280> today

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
then a design problem or not happy today

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.300 
then a design problem or not happy today
yeah<00:02:22.150> he<00:02:22.480> felt<00:02:22.750> mounting<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.800> know<00:02:23.920> I've

well<00:03:11.049> we've<00:03:11.290> had<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.470> plan<00:03:11.799> from<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.130> beginning

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
two to four sites about it and and he

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.170 
two to four sites about it and and he
wasn't<00:05:11.350> real<00:05:11.590> keen<00:05:11.800> about<00:05:12.100> it<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.490> sponsors

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
wasn't real keen about it and sponsors

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.420 
wasn't real keen about it and sponsors
weren't<00:05:13.390> keen<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:13.990> his<00:05:14.650> sponsors<00:05:15.160> didn't

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
weren't keen and his sponsors didn't

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.010 
weren't keen and his sponsors didn't
like<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.760> monster<00:05:15.970> angle<00:05:16.510> so<00:05:16.690> it<00:05:16.720> kind<00:05:16.960> of

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
like the monster angle so it kind of

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.810 
like the monster angle so it kind of
just<00:05:17.260> didn't<00:05:17.830> really<00:05:17.950> come<00:05:18.220> together<00:05:18.370> but<00:05:18.730> it

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
just didn't really come together but it

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.230 
just didn't really come together but it
it<00:05:19.240> sounded<00:05:19.540> like<00:05:19.660> a<00:05:19.720> cool<00:05:19.930> idea<00:05:20.140> so<00:05:21.060> no<00:05:22.060> more

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
it sounded like a cool idea so no more

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.470
