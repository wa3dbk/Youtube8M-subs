00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.849
 Hello everyone and welcome back after the first 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 stop in Milan for our journey 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.750
 exploratory in NFC technology we 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.180
 door to turin 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.010
 today we know that a nfc smartphone can 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.080
 be used to perform micro 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.599
 payments without money transfer 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.130
 physical in all authorized stores or for 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.380
 buy a tram or ticket 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.210
 meter or to download audio guides 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.210
 directly on our smartphone 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.830
 this and so much more accurate in 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.360
 this particular connectivity is short 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.100
 radius the mobile becomes in practice 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.510
 a house with a badge 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.970
 but today we are going to discover others 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.010
 news we're going to find out how ours 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.989
 NFC mobile can become a key 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.250
 which opens many doors for example 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.250
 squaring Strout 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.430
 me in turin at the research center 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.530
 Fiat Telecom Italia is carrying on 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.970
 a trial that aimed at 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.960
 change our relationship with the world 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.240
 of the four wheels 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.860
 which is great news for those like 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.130
 me ca n't even find the keys to 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.189
 bag 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.930
 yes the first useful thing that it 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.430
 smartphone to the author allows us to 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.420
 to do is to open the door 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.369
 of our car 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.250
 just bring the smartphone closer to the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.140
 reader on the windshield and we come 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.240
 immediately recognized throughout 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.200
 security and we are therefore authorized to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.319
 then enter once on board we rest 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.720
 the smartphone on the internal reader is the 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.549
 instrument panel lights up to try 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.990
 which is recognized and therefore we can 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.679
 start the car but 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.270
 fantastic 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.799
 so you press my car without it 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.959
 need to give me the keys certainly 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.459
 because the keys are digital then 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:48.679
 this simple application that will stay 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.360
 form nfc phone can use it 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.189
 smartphone in other person to access 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.299
 my car or share mine 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.299
 smart with people 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.979
 the first door is good 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.979
 right 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.520
 it's a nice convenience especially for 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.770
 who has to manage does so many go 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.720
 I imagine undoubtedly a service that 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.250
 can help many companies but think for 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.110
 example a car sharing where there are 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.790
 many users who have to share it 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.110
 same vehicle and therefore management 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.430
 physical keys can be a 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.870
 problem 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.940
 therefore in the future it will also be able to 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.610
 door of my house with a nfc smartphone 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.080
 yes with this technology the smartphone 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.480
 can actually be used for 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.010
 open many types of access ports such as 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.750
 example at home court is appropriate a 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.360
 condominium access to a private individual who 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.460
 sports club office or business 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.050
 another room of a hotel recognizing 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.300
 with the safety ability every single one 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.290
 user dependent but if they steal me I lose 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.970
 the smartphone 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.560
 no problem unlike this 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.660
 would cause with traditional keys 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.730
 indeed in this new scenario but 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.200
 simple phone call or via the internet 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.300
 I could block yours in real time 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.990
 access credentials age 6 and later 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.990
 are known 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.470
 in short, the nfc technology means 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.270
 a lot of life 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.270
 the future is all in our hands
