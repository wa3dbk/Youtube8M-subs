cleared<00:00:14.869> professionals<00:00:15.500> let's<00:00:16.129> take<00:00:16.340> a

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
cleared professionals let's take a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.580 
cleared professionals let's take a
deeper<00:00:16.760> look<00:00:16.789> into<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:17.330> problem<00:00:17.720> at<00:00:17.869> its<00:00:18.259> most

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
deeper look into the problem at its most

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.830 
deeper look into the problem at its most
basic<00:00:18.919> it<00:00:19.279> is<00:00:19.490> a<00:00:19.520> supply<00:00:20.029> and<00:00:20.060> demand<00:00:20.450> issue

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
basic it is a supply and demand issue

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.620 
basic it is a supply and demand issue
first<00:00:21.680> let's<00:00:22.220> address<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.759> high<00:00:22.939> demand<00:00:23.390> for

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
first let's address the high demand for

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.250 
first let's address the high demand for
cleared<00:00:23.930> resources<00:00:24.789> there<00:00:25.789> are<00:00:26.000> 150<00:00:26.900> billion

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
cleared resources there are 150 billion

and clearances are required for most

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:34.090 
and clearances are required for most
demand<00:00:32.629> is<00:00:32.839> at<00:00:32.960> an<00:00:33.080> all-time<00:00:33.260> high<00:00:33.559> and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
demand is at an all-time high and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.340 
demand is at an all-time high and
getting<00:00:34.519> higher<00:00:35.230> compounding<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.320> problem

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
getting higher compounding the problem

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.560 
getting higher compounding the problem
is<00:00:36.830> the<00:00:36.980> fact<00:00:37.220> that<00:00:37.370> we<00:00:37.670> aren't<00:00:37.879> adding<00:00:38.269> enough

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
is the fact that we aren't adding enough

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.540 
is the fact that we aren't adding enough
cleared<00:00:38.930> resources<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.769> the<00:00:39.860> current<00:00:40.220> supply

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
cleared resources to the current supply

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.930

of available candidates in 2012 the net

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.729 
of available candidates in 2012 the net
increase<00:00:44.300> of<00:00:44.420> cleared<00:00:44.899> professionals<00:00:45.590> is

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
increase of cleared professionals is

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.000 
increase of cleared professionals is
only<00:00:46.160> 1%<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.329> only<00:00:48.020> a<00:00:48.050> small<00:00:48.379> percentage<00:00:48.890> of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
only 1% and only a small percentage of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.500 
only 1% and only a small percentage of
this<00:00:49.160> small<00:00:49.460> percentage<00:00:49.969> have<00:00:50.149> above<00:00:50.480> a

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
this small percentage have above a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.450 
this small percentage have above a
top-secret<00:00:51.079> clearance<00:00:51.710> let<00:00:52.160> alone<00:00:52.190> the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
top-secret clearance let alone the

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.520 
top-secret clearance let alone the
intelligence<00:00:53.180> community<00:00:53.719> level<00:00:54.050> clearances

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
intelligence community level clearances

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.279 
intelligence community level clearances
so<00:00:55.340> what<00:00:55.550> do<00:00:55.760> these<00:00:55.940> numbers<00:00:56.210> mean<00:00:56.449> it's

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
so what do these numbers mean it's

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.990 
so what do these numbers mean it's
pretty<00:00:57.620> simple<00:00:58.039> actually

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
pretty simple actually

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.440 
pretty simple actually
demand<00:01:00.990> has<00:01:01.260> far<00:01:01.620> outstripped<00:01:01.950> supply<00:01:02.450> there

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
demand has far outstripped supply there

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.030 
demand has far outstripped supply there
will<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.840> persistent<00:01:04.290> shortage<00:01:04.590> of

resources and that shortage will become

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.520 
resources and that shortage will become
exponentially<00:01:08.160> greater<00:01:08.400> each<00:01:08.760> coming<00:01:09.150> year
