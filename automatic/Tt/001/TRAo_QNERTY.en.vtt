some<00:02:22.770> cobblestone<00:02:23.770> slabs<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:24.940> think<00:02:25.120> this

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
some cobblestone slabs and I think this

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.570 
some cobblestone slabs and I think this
look<00:02:25.450> kind<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:25.660> cool<00:02:26.040> alright<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.250> actually

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
look kind of cool alright so actually

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.760 
look kind of cool alright so actually
before<00:02:27.880> we<00:02:28.120> do<00:02:28.330> this<00:02:28.480> I'm<00:02:28.810> going<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.230> take<00:02:29.650> the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
before we do this I'm going to take the

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.540 
before we do this I'm going to take the
LOB<00:02:29.950> out<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.670> we're<00:02:31.390> gonna<00:02:31.480> make<00:02:31.630> this<00:02:31.810> look

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
LOB out and we're gonna make this look

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.040 
LOB out and we're gonna make this look
much<00:02:33.550> nicer<00:02:33.730> than<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.300> already<00:02:34.450> does

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
much nicer than it already does

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:58.520 
much nicer than it already does
so<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.930> trash<00:02:56.170> cans<00:02:56.380> are<00:02:56.470> really<00:02:56.740> useful<00:02:56.950> in

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
so the trash cans are really useful in

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.070 
so the trash cans are really useful in
there<00:02:59.530> they're<00:02:59.890> very<00:02:59.920> useful<00:03:00.310> even<00:03:00.670> in

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
there they're very useful even in

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.920 
there they're very useful even in
multiplayer<00:03:02.080> worlds<00:03:02.890> because<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.900> lot<00:03:04.900> of

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
multiplayer worlds because a lot of

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.380 
multiplayer worlds because a lot of
times<00:03:05.170> people<00:03:05.580> need<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.700> dispose<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.090> their

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
times people need to dispose of their

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.970

and<00:05:04.169> but<00:05:05.169> if<00:05:05.439> it's<00:05:05.680> surrounded<00:05:05.830> by<00:05:06.189> other

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
and but if it's surrounded by other

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.890 
and but if it's surrounded by other
pieces<00:05:06.610> of<00:05:06.759> saying<00:05:06.969> it<00:05:07.089> won't<00:05:07.240> grow<00:05:07.389> so<00:05:07.839> I'm

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
pieces of saying it won't grow so I'm

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.850 
pieces of saying it won't grow so I'm
right-clicking<00:05:08.080> right<00:05:08.469> now<00:05:08.559> it's<00:05:08.740> not

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
right-clicking right now it's not

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.079 
right-clicking right now it's not
working<00:05:08.919> so<00:05:09.309> we<00:05:09.430> got<00:05:09.550> to<00:05:09.610> do<00:05:09.669> is<00:05:09.759> going<00:05:09.879> to<00:05:09.939> jump

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:10.089 
working so we got to do is going to jump

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.649 
working so we got to do is going to jump
on<00:05:10.210> in<00:05:10.419> here<00:05:10.449> you've<00:05:11.439> got<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:12.509> you've<00:05:13.509> got<00:05:13.539> a

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
on in here you've got a you've got a

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:19.019 
on in here you've got a you've got a
carve<00:05:13.990> out<00:05:14.169> a<00:05:16.169> area<00:05:17.580> kind<00:05:18.580> of<00:05:18.639> like<00:05:18.729> a<00:05:18.789> plus

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:19.029 
carve out a area kind of like a plus

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:20.579 
carve out a area kind of like a plus
sign<00:05:19.059> so<00:05:19.599> this<00:05:19.689> is<00:05:19.809> like<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.960> plus<00:05:20.169> sign<00:05:20.199> like

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:20.589 
sign so this is like a plus sign like

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:23.309 
sign so this is like a plus sign like
this<00:05:20.770> now<00:05:21.520> what<00:05:21.639> we're<00:05:21.789> gonna<00:05:21.849> do<00:05:22.120> is<00:05:22.449> the

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
this now what we're gonna do is the

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:26.129 
this now what we're gonna do is the
cactus<00:05:23.710> is<00:05:23.889> gonna<00:05:24.039> go<00:05:24.159> right<00:05:24.460> there<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:25.930> we're

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
cactus is gonna go right there so we're

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:27.450 
cactus is gonna go right there so we're
also<00:05:26.259> gonna<00:05:26.379> need<00:05:26.589> another<00:05:26.740> material<00:05:27.249> now<00:05:27.400> to

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
also gonna need another material now to

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.510 
also gonna need another material now to
top<00:05:27.999> off<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.629> sides<00:05:28.870> here<00:05:29.199> so<00:05:29.379> it<00:05:29.529> looks<00:05:29.559> okay

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
top off the sides here so it looks okay

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.920 
top off the sides here so it looks okay
I<00:05:30.550> know<00:05:30.849> Collison<00:05:31.360> probably<00:05:31.659> doesn't<00:05:31.870> look

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
I know Collison probably doesn't look

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.110 
I know Collison probably doesn't look
the<00:05:32.080> greatest<00:05:32.639> especially<00:05:33.639> mashed<00:05:33.789> up<00:05:33.909> on<00:05:34.059> the

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
the greatest especially mashed up on the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.489 
the greatest especially mashed up on the
smooth<00:05:34.330> stone<00:05:34.539> but<00:05:34.719> I<00:05:34.779> can<00:05:34.930> edit<00:05:35.050> this<00:05:35.229> again

00:05:35.489 --> 00:05:35.499 
smooth stone but I can edit this again

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:37.200 
smooth stone but I can edit this again
later<00:05:35.620> now<00:05:36.009> we're<00:05:36.610> gonna<00:05:36.699> do<00:05:36.909> is<00:05:37.029> you're<00:05:37.149> gonna

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
later now we're gonna do is you're gonna

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.909 
later now we're gonna do is you're gonna
stick<00:05:37.479> the<00:05:37.599> cactus<00:05:37.990> in<00:05:38.169> there<00:05:38.469> and<00:05:38.649> it<00:05:38.770> will

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
stick the cactus in there and it will

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.980 
stick the cactus in there and it will
grow<00:05:39.159> or<00:05:39.520> will<00:05:39.849> live<00:05:40.029> like<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.419> because<00:05:40.809> it's

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
grow or will live like that because it's

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.829

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:43.839 
not both the flat faces of the cactus

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:47.010 
not both the flat faces of the cactus

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
aren't touched by a wall now we're gonna

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.239 
aren't touched by a wall now we're gonna
pay<00:05:47.169> just<00:05:47.229> basically<00:05:47.529> do<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.770> same<00:05:47.800> design

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:48.249 
pay just basically do the same design

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:53.909 
pay just basically do the same design
that<00:05:48.279> we<00:05:48.610> did<00:05:48.819> on<00:05:49.059> the<00:05:50.699> on<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.870> lava<00:05:53.199> garbage

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
that we did on the on the lava garbage

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.469 
that we did on the on the lava garbage
can<00:05:54.159> except<00:05:54.759> we're<00:05:54.879> just<00:05:55.029> gonna<00:05:55.120> do<00:05:55.300> it<00:05:55.389> for

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
can except we're just gonna do it for

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.309 
can except we're just gonna do it for
the<00:05:55.569> cactus

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.049 

we<00:05:59.319> can't<00:05:59.529> just<00:05:59.680> one<00:05:59.860> now<00:06:00.099> if<00:06:00.729> you<00:06:00.789> don't<00:06:00.969> know

00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:01.059 
we can't just one now if you don't know

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:06.749 
we can't just one now if you don't know
character<00:06:01.569> when<00:06:01.870> you<00:06:05.069> for<00:06:06.069> cacti<00:06:06.370> when<00:06:06.610> you

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
character when you for cacti when you

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.029 
character when you for cacti when you
something<00:06:07.569> is<00:06:07.659> land<00:06:07.870> lands<00:06:08.259> on<00:06:08.379> them<00:06:08.589> it

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
something is land lands on them it

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.699 
something is land lands on them it
disappears<00:06:09.639> so<00:06:09.879> it's<00:06:10.089> basically<00:06:10.479> a<00:06:10.839> garbage

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:11.709 
disappears so it's basically a garbage

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:16.649 
disappears so it's basically a garbage
can<00:06:11.830> without<00:06:12.129> the<00:06:12.249> sizzle<00:06:12.580> of<00:06:12.819> a<00:06:15.569> without<00:06:16.569> the

00:06:16.649 --> 00:06:16.659 
can without the sizzle of a without the

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.510 
can without the sizzle of a without the
sizzle<00:06:16.959> of<00:06:17.110> lava<00:06:17.770> essentially<00:06:19.139> so<00:06:20.399> let's<00:06:21.399> do

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
sizzle of lava essentially so let's do

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.769 
sizzle of lava essentially so let's do
this<00:06:21.580> one<00:06:21.699> before<00:06:21.999> it<00:06:22.149> gets<00:06:22.300> dark<00:06:22.479> so<00:06:22.599> we're

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:22.779 
this one before it gets dark so we're

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:25.559 
this one before it gets dark so we're
gonna<00:06:22.870> place<00:06:23.050> one<00:06:23.080> here<00:06:24.089> we're<00:06:25.089> gonna<00:06:25.209> do<00:06:25.360> two

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
gonna place one here we're gonna do two

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.989 
gonna place one here we're gonna do two
on<00:06:25.689> the<00:06:25.779> sides<00:06:25.990> and<00:06:26.889> that's<00:06:27.580> blocking<00:06:27.879> the

00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:27.999 
on the sides and that's blocking the

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:30.689 
on the sides and that's blocking the
door<00:06:28.240> so<00:06:28.599> it's<00:06:28.749> kind<00:06:28.990> of<00:06:29.050> a<00:06:29.319> bad<00:06:30.279> place<00:06:30.550> from

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
door so it's kind of a bad place from

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.010 
door so it's kind of a bad place from
here<00:06:30.909> it's<00:06:31.029> just<00:06:31.060> place<00:06:31.300> it<00:06:31.449> farther<00:06:31.629> over<00:06:31.870> but

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
here it's just place it farther over but

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.389 
here it's just place it farther over but
you<00:06:32.080> guys<00:06:32.199> get<00:06:32.379> the<00:06:32.469> idea<00:06:32.499> of<00:06:32.979> how<00:06:33.129> to<00:06:33.189> build

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:33.399 
you guys get the idea of how to build

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:38.399 
you guys get the idea of how to build
this<00:06:35.849> and<00:06:36.849> you<00:06:37.719> know<00:06:37.809> we<00:06:37.899> could<00:06:38.020> obviously<00:06:38.199> put

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
this and you know we could obviously put

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:42.839 
this and you know we could obviously put
another<00:06:38.649> sign<00:06:38.830> up<00:06:38.979> top<00:06:39.189> there<00:06:39.430> but<00:06:41.789> now<00:06:42.789> you

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
another sign up top there but now you

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:47.969 
another sign up top there but now you
can<00:06:43.120> properly<00:06:43.569> dispose<00:06:43.930> of<00:06:44.819> items<00:06:45.819> and<00:06:46.979> same

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
can properly dispose of items and same

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.579 
can properly dispose of items and same
way<00:06:48.129> with<00:06:48.309> this<00:06:48.459> one<00:06:48.639> so<00:06:49.330> there<00:06:49.629> you<00:06:49.689> go<00:06:49.809> guys
