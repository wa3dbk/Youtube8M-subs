sometimes<00:06:11.349> gliding<00:06:11.830> can<00:06:11.949> help<00:06:12.099> you<00:06:12.219> sometimes

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
sometimes gliding can help you sometimes

it'll screw up he's got no one to use it
right<00:06:15.629> this<00:06:16.629> is<00:06:16.749> definitely<00:06:17.169> a<00:06:17.229> gliding<00:06:17.529> time

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:17.889 
right this is definitely a gliding time

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:21.269 
right this is definitely a gliding time
though<00:06:18.689> it'll<00:06:19.689> give<00:06:19.810> you<00:06:19.900> just<00:06:20.199> barely<00:06:20.710> enough

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
Kristen sling get on to that next one as

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.800 
Kristen sling get on to that next one as
you<00:06:26.349> can<00:06:26.439> see<00:06:26.620> without<00:06:26.770> on<00:06:27.219> I'm<00:06:27.819> oyster<00:06:28.539> point

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
you can see without on I'm oyster point

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.499 
you can see without on I'm oyster point
but<00:06:29.050> actually<00:06:29.409> I<00:06:29.650> was<00:06:30.400> pressed<00:06:30.939> forward<00:06:31.240> and

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
but actually I was pressed forward and

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:41.459 
but actually I was pressed forward and
see<00:06:31.659> if<00:06:31.719> you<00:06:31.779> would<00:06:31.900> make<00:06:32.050> it<00:06:32.169> anyways<00:06:32.560> I<00:06:40.469> think

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
that's everything so we're gonna go the

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.800
