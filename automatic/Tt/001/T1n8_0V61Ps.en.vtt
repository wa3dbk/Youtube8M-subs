00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and especially on a practical note so

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.850 
and especially on a practical note so
they<00:00:51.270> don't<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.600> wrinkly<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.739> you

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
they don't get wrinkly because if you

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.220 
they don't get wrinkly because if you
bundle<00:00:53.160> them<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.879> box<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
bundle them up in a box which is what I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.740 
bundle them up in a box which is what I
used<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.670> get<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:56.940> wrinkly<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.600> then

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
used to do they get all wrinkly and then

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750 
used to do they get all wrinkly and then
you<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> steam<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.559> iron<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:59.129> every

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.849 
you have to steam or iron them every
time<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.149> wear<00:01:00.329> them<00:01:00.359> which<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.989> really

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
time you wear them which is really

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.680

an<00:02:44.010> underscore<00:02:44.550> on<00:02:45.120> Twitter<00:02:45.570> because<00:02:45.989> there's

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
an underscore on Twitter because there's

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.960
