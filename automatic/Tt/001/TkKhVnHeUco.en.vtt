owner is that her final release was a

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.000 
owner is that her final release was a
little<00:03:14.109> different<00:03:14.500> here<00:03:14.590> especially<00:03:14.709> her

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
little different here especially her

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.390 
little different here especially her
face<00:03:15.329> compared<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.840> prototype<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:18.160> which

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
face compared to the prototype and which

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.129 
face compared to the prototype and which
I<00:03:18.549> agree<00:03:18.819> her<00:03:19.600> face<00:03:19.780> looks<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.049> little

different<00:03:20.350> from<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.980> prototype<00:03:21.220> personally

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
different from the prototype personally

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.580 
different from the prototype personally
