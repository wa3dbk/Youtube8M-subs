00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.820
 So we are at the mills Castle 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.720
 backgammon to bressuire so that's the 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.980
 water tower that supplies water 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.980
 drinking the whole city of bressuire 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.930
 this water tower was built in 1978 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.880
 and the goal here is to rehabilitate 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.570
 completely this book so it goes 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 by several phases 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.770
 there is first all the replacement 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.149
 pipelines 1 which feeds its 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.559
 water towers inside is 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.480
 also the repair of all 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.160
 tank tightness 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.660
 so in fact for sealing the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.050
 principle it's going to be like for a 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.960
 swimming pool 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.430
 we will put a liner that will actually 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.820
 ensure the complete watertightness of 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.129
 the carved 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.390
 the seal was made by the concrete 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.100
 in the mass that means that in fact 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.929
 it's just the concrete that was 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.850
 than the water tower and is waterproof but 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.890
 concrete working in time 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.199
 since 1978 it has formed 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.390
 microcracks and therefore with micro 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.940
 flight and so the idea is to renew 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.649
 this work by laying this liner and until 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.510
 that was a lot more systems of 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.130
 resin so paints to do 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.260
 sealing and for some years 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.750
 appeared this system is it has the advantage 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.690
 to be able to be used in all 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.280
 conditions including when one is in 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.450
 zone in wet zone 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.550
 unlike paintings it is necessary 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.470
 to be relatively dry here even in zone 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.240
 wet we can do it and we're in 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.700
 wetland because the water tower to 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.900
 two tanks one that is being repaired 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.180
 but the other who remain in service 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.130
 can continue to feed the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.930
 population and so we always have 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.700
 moisture in water tower and despite 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.260
 this humidity we have the possibility of 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.180
 ask this liner so a technology 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.800
 relatively recent and who should we 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.090
 ensure tranquility behind 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.190
 for a good fifteen years 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.800
 that we really have a material that 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.720
 is very thick you can imagine that 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.620
 is about 100 mm thick 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.420
 a bit like a big plastic 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.370
 imagine a trunk plastic by 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.110
 very thick example and so in fact we're going 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.570
 really see a sustainability that will not 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.770
 hang on who will not run away and so in 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.080
 time we can think we're going 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.060
 really do not need to come back 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.230
 on this book for 15 to 20 years we 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.850
 is what is called on the dome of the 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.320
 water tower is so here we go 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.600
 also re-seal 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.400
 so it's a kind of tar that goes 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600
 be placed on the water tower for 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.100
 to make sure that one is 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.690
 completely waterproof and avoid having 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.440
 seepage of rainwater to 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.440
 inside the water tower
