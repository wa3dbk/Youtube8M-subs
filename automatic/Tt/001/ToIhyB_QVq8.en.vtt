00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
slowly ripped them apart but here we see

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.660 
slowly ripped them apart but here we see
in<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.019> pilot<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.620> Barbara<00:02:21.980> had<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.220> previous

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
eventually bring Jim apart of Jim and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.619 
eventually bring Jim apart of Jim and
Barbara<00:02:35.940> apart

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
Barbara apart

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.410 
Barbara apart
I<00:02:36.660> think<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.230> they<00:02:37.950> make<00:02:38.640> ones<00:02:38.879> have<00:02:39.209> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
I think and they make ones have the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.230 
I think and they make ones have the
secrets<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.080> they're<00:02:40.170> fighting<00:02:40.440> each<00:02:40.709> other

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
secrets and they're fighting each other

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.300 
secrets and they're fighting each other
to<00:02:42.630> hide<00:02:43.020> secrets<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.710> relationships

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
to hide secrets and relationships

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.970 
to hide secrets and relationships
eventually<00:02:45.090> those<00:02:45.420> secrets<00:02:45.840> work<00:02:46.080> better<00:02:46.710> way

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
eventually those secrets work better way

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.970 
eventually those secrets work better way
down

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
down

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.550 
down
I<00:02:48.010> think<00:02:48.790> they<00:02:48.970> are<00:02:49.090> both<00:02:49.330> going<00:02:50.319> through<00:02:50.379> a

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
I think they are both going through a

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.530 
I think they are both going through a
lot<00:02:50.830> our<00:02:51.489> presence<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.239> they're<00:02:52.390> like

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
lot our presence and they're like

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.540 
lot our presence and they're like
whoppers<00:02:52.930> but<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.140> lot<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.379> history<00:02:53.739> was<00:02:54.190> part

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
whoppers but a lot of history was part

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.270 
whoppers but a lot of history was part
of<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.760> history<00:02:54.879> and<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:56.620> we<00:02:56.830> go<00:02:56.950> through<00:02:57.190> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
of that history and as we go through the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.089 
of that history and as we go through the
series<00:02:57.550> we<00:02:58.000> sort<00:02:58.269> of<00:02:58.330> see<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:59.200> those<00:02:59.470> hidden

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
series we sort of see that those hidden

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.000 
series we sort of see that those hidden
deaths<00:03:00.900> clash<00:03:01.900> with<00:03:02.140> each<00:03:02.230> other<00:03:02.470> with<00:03:02.860> their

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
deaths clash with each other with their

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.410 
deaths clash with each other with their
relationship<00:03:03.550> for<00:03:03.700> their<00:03:03.819> nanny<00:03:04.000> kind<00:03:04.330> of

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
relationship for their nanny kind of

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.120 
relationship for their nanny kind of

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.610 
elsewhere
and<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.569> one<00:03:09.720> thing<00:03:09.900> I've<00:03:10.049> always<00:03:10.290> wondered

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
and the one thing I've always wondered

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.589 
and the one thing I've always wondered
is<00:03:10.920> though<00:03:11.129> there<00:03:11.340> are<00:03:11.430> clearly<00:03:11.790> fractures<00:03:12.450> in

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
is though there are clearly fractures in

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.110 
is though there are clearly fractures in
their<00:03:12.689> relationship<00:03:13.230> now<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:14.310> wonder<00:03:14.790> why

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
their relationship now so I wonder why

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.149 
their relationship now so I wonder why
