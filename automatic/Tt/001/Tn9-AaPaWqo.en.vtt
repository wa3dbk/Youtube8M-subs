you guys can shoot on the ground and if
your<00:01:30.150> bullets<00:01:30.509> show<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.840> that's<00:01:31.439> where<00:01:31.680> you

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
your bullets show up that's where you

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.469 
your bullets show up that's where you
can<00:01:31.979> walk<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.549> doesn't<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.030> can't<00:01:33.299> walk

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
can walk if it doesn't you can't walk

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.200 
can walk if it doesn't you can't walk
off<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.310> there<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.670> might<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.909> some

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
off there so there there might be some

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
off there so there there might be some
other<00:01:36.270> spot<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.500> but

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
other spot you can get to with this but

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.490 
other spot you can get to with this but
this<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.240> first<00:01:39.270> out<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.930> map<00:01:40.079> there<00:01:40.320> is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this is the first out of map there is

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
this is the first out of map there is
another<00:01:40.829> one<00:01:41.070> as<00:01:41.250> well<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.640> came<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.240> I'm

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
another one as well that came out so I'm

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.999 
another one as well that came out so I'm
gonna<00:01:42.479> try<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.840> get<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.979> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
gonna try and get that up there but I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.429 
gonna try and get that up there but I
don't<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> ps4<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
don't have a ps4 so it's going to be a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.950 
don't have a ps4 so it's going to be a
little<00:01:46.740> bit<00:01:46.950> tricky<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.630> for<00:01:48.630> me<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> get

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
little bit tricky for for me to get

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.219 
little bit tricky for for me to get
videos<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.710> i'll<00:01:50.310> probably<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.899> ask<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
videos but i'll probably just ask a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.440 
videos but i'll probably just ask a
couple<00:01:52.409> people<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:53.250> i'm<00:01:53.610> trying<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.360> get
