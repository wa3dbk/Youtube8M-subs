00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.820
 the three fractions in this sequence 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.429
 they are identical in everything from the 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.559
 tires and suspension to the size of 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.170
 vehicle and the weight the only difference 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.840
 is the driving train and the 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.790
 power distribution traction 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.910
 on all four wheels distributes the 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.610
 power to all wheels traction 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.820
 front only distributes the power to 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.100
 the front wheels and the driving of 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.780
 traction on the rear wheels only 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.839
 distributes power to the wheels 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.089
 therefore the traction and the 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.370
 control are directly related 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.980
 with the amount of grip that your wheels 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.199
 and tires maintain with the surface 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.089
 of the road each tire has the 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.069
 Maximum capacity and grip level 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.829
 depends on the coefficient of friction 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.899
 between the tires and the surface of the 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.449
 way when too much is distributed 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.179
 power to the tire itself loses the 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.489
 grab and start spinning or skating and 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.680
 traction and control are reduced this 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.810
 means that when the power is only 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.939
 distributes to two wheels instead 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.460
 when you accelerate to take a curve 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.770
 will only have half the force of 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.770
 acceleration and the traction system in 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.630
 all wheels the net result is 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.000
 that the traction system of all 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.619
 wheels provides a greater attraction and 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.330
 a better ability to take the 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.090
 corners if the conditions of 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.159
 driving suddenly change or that 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.350
 the corner that is being taken is more 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.570
 pronounced of what was anticipated in 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.039
 wet or slippery conditions the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.350
 have the driving force 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.659
 distributed on all four wheels improves 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.759
 the traction under acceleration improving 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.000
 not only the performance of the car but 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.659
 also the control when you take a 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.100
 curve there are three possible conditions 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.340
 these conditions are called address 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.709
 neutral low by its direction and on 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.689
 address the neutral address keeps 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.700
 the grip on all four wheels for 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.819
 have good control when taking the turn 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.159
 Low or subaddress may occur when 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.920
 the driving force and the strength of 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.509
 take the turn combine to access 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.870
 the maximum grip available in the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.760
 tires when driving the automobile 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.280
 about direction is when the vehicle 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.130
 rotates more than the address income that 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.200
 you need this can happen when 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.900
 the forces of direction and to take a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.720
 corner on the rear wheels exceeds the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.420
 maximum grip on wet roads in 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.630
 gravel was at a high incline the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.730
 symmetric attraction the four wheels 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.739
 really the combination of 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.049
 wet and slippery gravel in a 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.180
 pending causes a vehicle with 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.330
 four-wheel drive lose your 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.670
 grip 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.130
 this is a function of the strength of 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.040
 driving and the reduced weight of 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.350
 wheels that exceed the grip causing 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.900
 a loss of traction with all the 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.730
 power on the rear wheels where the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.739
 weight is now focused 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.200
 the driving train of the wheel 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.569
 back pushes up but then 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.150
 the power needs to continue the 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.940
 rise exceeding the available grip 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.799
 and the impulse defends itself when distributing 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.920
 power through the four wheels 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.019
 the symmetric driving of subaru in 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.260
 all wheels allows a force 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.150
 greater driving and is delivered without 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.120
 exceed the maximum grip of the 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.310
 tires plus driving force to 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.760
 through the four wheels means a 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.400
 Greater control and trust symmetrical 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.000
 all wheel drive of subaru is safety 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.000
