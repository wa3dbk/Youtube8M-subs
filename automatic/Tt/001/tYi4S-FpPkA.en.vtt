00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.590 
from the back behind the Space Needle
there<00:01:38.250> are<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> few<00:01:38.579> areas<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.060> having<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:39.360> way

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
there are a few areas of having one way

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.550 
see right here's another one of those
high<00:01:45.329> points<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.720> was<00:01:45.840> talking<00:01:46.140> about<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
high points I was talking about that the

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560 
high points I was talking about that the
humans<00:01:46.829> can<00:01:46.920> hold<00:01:47.130> out<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.939> each<00:01:48.119> position

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
humans can hold out on but each position

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.389 
humans can hold out on but each position
will<00:01:48.899> require<00:01:49.229> more<00:01:49.619> than<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:49.890> person<00:01:49.950> this

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
will require more than one person this

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.740
