those of you that have been watching you
know<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.130> installed<00:00:32.520> two<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.880> these<00:00:33.000> well

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
know that we installed two of these well

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.080 
know that we installed two of these well
in<00:00:34.170> our<00:00:34.290> last<00:00:34.440> build<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.550> installed<00:00:35.940> two

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
in our last build and we installed two

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150 
in our last build and we installed two
of<00:00:36.329> these<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.870> 2011<00:00:37.410> Dodge<00:00:37.890> Challenger

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
of these in a 2011 Dodge Challenger

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.540 
of these in a 2011 Dodge Challenger
which<00:00:38.670> she<00:00:39.120> does<00:00:39.320> 137<00:00:40.320> decibels<00:00:40.829> she<00:00:41.340> does

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
which she does 137 decibels she does

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.049 
which she does 137 decibels she does
compete<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> car<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:44.789> thing<00:00:45.030> is

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
compete with the car but the thing is

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.940 
compete with the car but the thing is
it's<00:00:45.390> only<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.840> 12<00:00:46.050> volt<00:00:46.260> system<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.890> does

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it's only up a 12 volt system what does

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.619 
it's only up a 12 volt system what does
that<00:00:47.010> mean<00:00:47.370> well<00:00:47.610> she's<00:00:47.850> only<00:00:47.940> running<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.480> off

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
that mean well she's only running it off

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.290 
that mean well she's only running it off
a<00:00:48.660> stock<00:00:49.079> battery<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.250> we're<00:00:50.940> doing<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.270> same

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
a stock battery so we're doing the same

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.270 
a stock battery so we're doing the same
thing<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:51.899> let's<00:00:52.829> start<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
thing here let's start with the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.650 
thing here let's start with the
amplifier<00:00:53.989> this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> new<00:00:55.379> VFL<00:00:55.920> 2680<00:00:56.910> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
amplifier this is the new VFL 2680 it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.860 
amplifier this is the new VFL 2680 it
does<00:00:57.899> come<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> face<00:00:58.590> knob<00:00:59.870> really

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
does come with the face knob really

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.270 
does come with the face knob really
quick<00:01:01.109> let<00:01:01.530> me<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:01.800> show<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
quick let me just show you that the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700 
quick let me just show you that the
inputs<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.850> these<00:01:03.000> are<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.629> gauge<00:01:03.930> not<00:01:04.379> 8

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
inputs on these are for gauge not 8

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.510 
inputs on these are for gauge not 8
gauge<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.280> 4<00:01:05.519> gauge<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.710> amplifier<00:01:08.189> runs

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
gauge but 4 gauge so this amplifier runs

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.890 
gauge but 4 gauge so this amplifier runs
at<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> thousand<00:01:09.240> three<00:01:09.390> hundred<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.720> eighty

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
at a thousand three hundred and eighty

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.609 
at a thousand three hundred and eighty
rms<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.860> home<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.170> gonna<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.439> running

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
rms at one home it is gonna be running

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.140 
rms at one home it is gonna be running
on<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.799> 12-volt<00:01:14.220> setup<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.790> we're<00:01:14.939> probably

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
on a 12-volt setup so we're probably

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.810 
on a 12-volt setup so we're probably
gonna<00:01:15.540> see<00:01:15.750> close<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> about<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> thousand<00:01:16.830> only

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
gonna see close to about a thousand only

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.120 
gonna see close to about a thousand only
because<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.479> fact<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.960> we<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.979> this

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
because of the fact we we know what this

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
because of the fact we we know what this
will<00:01:20.310> put<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> 12<00:01:21.180> volt<00:01:21.360> system<00:01:21.540> with<00:01:21.869> an

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
will put out on a 12 volt system with an

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.710 
will put out on a 12 volt system with an
older<00:01:22.320> vehicle<00:01:22.610> again<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> our<00:01:24.150> testing

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
older vehicle again this is our testing

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.660 
older vehicle again this is our testing
this<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.380> American<00:01:25.890> based<00:01:26.070> testing<00:01:26.490> this

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
this is not American based testing this

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.429 
this is not American based testing this
is<00:01:26.820> ours<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.360> you're<00:01:27.900> probably<00:01:28.020> looking<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
is ours so you're probably looking a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.550 
is ours so you're probably looking a
maybe<00:01:28.829> about<00:01:29.070> 1100<00:01:29.759> RMS<00:01:30.240> divide<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.320> by<00:01:31.500> 2

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
maybe about 1100 RMS divide that by 2

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.109 
maybe about 1100 RMS divide that by 2
and<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.250> these<00:01:32.340> Wolfers<00:01:32.729> will<00:01:32.939> be

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
and that's what these Wolfers will be

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.660 
and that's what these Wolfers will be
seeing<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:33.659> 1<00:01:33.930> ohm<00:01:35.689> let's<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> sq<00:01:37.670> 500

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
seeing at 1 ohm let's get to the sq 500

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.920 
seeing at 1 ohm let's get to the sq 500
which<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.939> two-channel<00:01:39.659> not<00:01:39.900> a

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
which is a two-channel not a

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.410 
which is a two-channel not a
four-channel<00:01:40.680> again<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> two<00:01:41.939> channel

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
four-channel again it is a two channel

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.990 
four-channel again it is a two channel
not<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.140> four<00:01:43.409> channel<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.399> inputs<00:01:44.850> are

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
not a four channel and the inputs are

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.260 
not a four channel and the inputs are
also<00:01:45.240> four<00:01:46.140> gauge<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:47.549> only<00:01:47.729> thing<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.090> these

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
also four gauge the only thing is these

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.170 
also four gauge the only thing is these
take<00:01:48.720> ring<00:01:49.649> terminals<00:01:50.130> versus<00:01:51.000> just

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
take ring terminals versus just

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.359 
take ring terminals versus just
hardwired<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.320> we'll<00:01:52.560> we'll<00:01:53.009> show<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.220> more

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
hardwired and we'll we'll show you more

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.420 
hardwired and we'll we'll show you more
of<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.759> when<00:01:53.970> we<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.180> into<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.570> building

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
of this when we get into the building

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.600 
of this when we get into the building
let's<00:01:56.430> go<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.000> speakers<00:01:57.450> we'll<00:01:58.170> be

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
let's go to the speakers we'll be

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.270 
let's go to the speakers we'll be
installing<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.030> s<00:02:00.210> Q<00:02:00.509> Series<00:02:00.780> which<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
installing the s Q Series which is the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.810 
installing the s Q Series which is the
carbon<00:02:03.000> fiber<00:02:03.360> series<00:02:04.549> again<00:02:05.549> you're<00:02:05.700> looking

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
carbon fiber series again you're looking

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.389 
carbon fiber series again you're looking
at<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> six<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.570> half<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:07.140> then<00:02:08.069> you're<00:02:08.220> also

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
at a six and a half and then you're also

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.369 
at a six and a half and then you're also
looking<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> five<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.509> quarter<00:02:09.720> down

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
looking at a five and a quarter down

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.309 
looking at a five and a quarter down
below<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:12.450> reason<00:02:12.720> I'm<00:02:12.840> showing<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.230> guys

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
below the reason I'm showing you guys

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.760 
below the reason I'm showing you guys
the

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
the
setup<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.310> because<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.850> fact<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.210> haven't

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
setup is because of the fact we haven't

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.870 
setup is because of the fact we haven't
taken<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.810> car<00:02:16.020> apart<00:02:16.320> yet<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:17.550> wanted<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
taken the car apart yet but we wanted to

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.340 
taken the car apart yet but we wanted to
give<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.240> options<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.810> were<00:02:19.050> given<00:02:19.320> for

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
give you the options that were given for

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.910 
give you the options that were given for
the<00:02:19.530> customer<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.720> specs<00:02:22.080> call<00:02:22.350> for<00:02:22.590> six<00:02:22.800> and

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
fuse holder 100 amps will be installing

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.300 
fuse holder 100 amps will be installing
of<00:03:14.310> course<00:03:14.520> another<00:03:15.000> set<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.420> rca's<00:03:16.310> normally

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
of course another set of rca's normally

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.930 
of course another set of rca's normally
we<00:03:17.460> would<00:03:17.610> have<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:19.160> total<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.220> three<00:03:20.459> RCA's

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
we would have to a total of three RCA's

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.460 
we would have to a total of three RCA's
but<00:03:21.240> in<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:21.420> case<00:03:21.630> we're<00:03:21.900> only<00:03:21.930> installing

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
but in this case we're only installing

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.110 
but in this case we're only installing
two<00:03:22.650> because<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.220> fact<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.640> customer<00:03:23.820> is

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
two because of the fact the customer is

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.420 
two because of the fact the customer is
only<00:03:24.240> going<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.480> be<00:03:24.600> running<00:03:24.920> four<00:03:25.920> sets<00:03:26.220> of

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
only going to be running four sets of

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.510 
only going to be running four sets of
preempt<00:03:27.240> of<00:03:27.360> pre<00:03:27.690> RCA<00:03:28.230> outputs<00:03:28.770> of<00:03:29.100> his<00:03:29.340> head

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
preempt of pre RCA outputs of his head

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.940 
preempt of pre RCA outputs of his head
unit<00:03:30.020> which<00:03:31.020> is<00:03:31.140> perfect<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.680> that's<00:03:31.830> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
unit which is perfect and that's the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.040 
unit which is perfect and that's the
reason<00:03:32.280> why<00:03:32.400> we're<00:03:33.060> only<00:03:33.090> using<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.990> two

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
reason why we're only using a two

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.260 
reason why we're only using a two
channel<00:03:34.380> amplifier<00:03:36.260> as<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.440> can<00:03:37.560> see<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:37.890> has

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
channel amplifier as you can see it has

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
channel amplifier as you can see it has
one<00:03:39.270> set<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.570> RCA<00:03:39.900> inputs<00:03:43.640> let's<00:03:44.640> get<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.970> the
