00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
make sure that it can be assembled we

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.220 
make sure that it can be assembled we
determine<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.360> height<00:00:42.600> at<00:00:43.050> which<00:00:43.080> the

assembly line you do virtual built and
in<00:00:47.970> a<00:00:48.000> virtual<00:00:48.420> builds<00:00:48.750> we'll<00:00:48.900> come<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
in a virtual builds we'll come to a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.710 
in a virtual builds we'll come to a
component<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.980> we'll<00:00:50.070> say<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> wonder<00:00:50.699> if<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
component and we'll say I wonder if that

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.260 
component and we'll say I wonder if that
can<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.170> assembled<00:00:53.040> as<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.969> put

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
can be assembled as it's going to put

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.850 
can be assembled as it's going to put
stress<00:00:54.630> on<00:00:54.840> an<00:00:54.989> operator<00:00:55.500> when<00:00:55.680> they're

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
stress on an operator when they're

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.889 
stress on an operator when they're
assembling<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:57.510> bring<00:00:57.750> that

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
assembling that we can then bring that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
assembling that we can then bring that
component<00:00:58.530> into<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> motion<00:00:59.760> capture<00:01:00.210> lab

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
component into the motion capture lab

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.020 
component into the motion capture lab
and<00:01:00.629> into<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> survey<00:01:01.230> elements<00:01:01.620> lab<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:02.579> then

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and into the survey elements lab we then

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.810 
and into the survey elements lab we then
assess<00:01:03.589> tasks<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.800> involve<00:01:05.100> complex

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
assess tasks that involve complex

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.540 
assess tasks that involve complex
motions<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.750> also<00:01:06.899> do<00:01:07.229> high<00:01:07.500> profile<00:01:08.100> studies

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
motions we also do high profile studies

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.389 
motions we also do high profile studies
here<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.910> if<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:10.800> were<00:01:10.920> asked<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.250> look

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
here so if we are we were asked to look

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:12.980 
here so if we are we were asked to look
at<00:01:11.550> a<00:01:11.610> strategy<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.060> where<00:01:12.300> the<00:01:12.539> antenna

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
at a strategy of where the antenna

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.010 
at a strategy of where the antenna
should<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:14.399> placed<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.300> then<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.539> can<00:01:15.660> bring<00:01:15.869> in

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
should be placed so then we can bring in

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.800 
should be placed so then we can bring in
multiple<00:01:16.680> vehicles<00:01:17.570> virtually<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
multiple vehicles virtually and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.650 
multiple vehicles virtually and
determine<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> best<00:01:20.039> location<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.880> strategy

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
determine the best location the strategy

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.590 
determine the best location the strategy
of<00:01:21.899> where<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:24.270> antenna

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
of where we would have the antenna

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.649 
of where we would have the antenna
located<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.619> all<00:01:25.890> four<00:01:26.400> vehicles<00:01:26.659> passive

cloud<00:01:37.140> movement<00:01:38.119> we<00:01:39.119> also<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> head

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
cloud movement we also have a head

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.649

should<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.170> actually<00:01:43.530> want<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.830> into<00:01:44.040> some

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
should we actually want to get into some

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.609 
should we actually want to get into some
fine<00:01:44.549> movement<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> tricky

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
fine movement so that is the tricky

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.679 
fine movement so that is the tricky
stuff<00:01:46.680> comes<00:01:47.220> where<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> technology<00:01:48.450> then

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
stuff comes where the technology then

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.710 
stuff comes where the technology then
says<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.799> need<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> take<00:01:50.310> these<00:01:50.640> cloud<00:01:51.000> markers

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
says we need to take these cloud markers

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.850 
says we need to take these cloud markers
and<00:01:51.960> match<00:01:52.680> them<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:54.000> an<00:01:54.360> animation<00:01:54.900> so<00:01:55.710> it's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and match them to an animation so it's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.030 
and match them to an animation so it's
blend<00:01:56.159> moves<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> human<00:01:57.930> model<00:01:58.320> ms4

study that is on the fourth yesterday

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.170 
study that is on the fourth yesterday
and<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.500> want<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.799> know<00:02:01.950> whether<00:02:02.189> or<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.460> Glen

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and I want to know whether or not Glen

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.660 
and I want to know whether or not Glen
could<00:02:03.450> reach<00:02:03.689> an<00:02:04.229> electrical<00:02:04.770> connector<00:02:05.340> a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
could reach an electrical connector a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.569 
could reach an electrical connector a
hose<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.720> attach<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.070> he<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.399> actually

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
hose and attach so he would actually

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:14.770 
hose and attach so he would actually
move<00:02:09.030> forward<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.489> reach<00:02:11.489> out<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.150> them

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.130 

this<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:15.200> view<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.069> touch<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.180> then<00:02:17.569> we<00:02:17.990> would

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
this is view and touch and then we would

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.410 
this is view and touch and then we would
be<00:02:18.290> then<00:02:18.500> capturing<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.520> posture<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.300> then

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
be then capturing this posture and then

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.480 
be then capturing this posture and then
I<00:02:20.540> calculate<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.260> stress<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.800> his<00:02:22.010> shoulder

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
I calculate the stress on his shoulder

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.160 
I calculate the stress on his shoulder
and<00:02:22.640> things<00:02:22.850> like<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.600> to<00:02:23.750> say<00:02:23.900> what's

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
and things like that you to say what's

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.110 
and things like that you to say what's
not<00:02:24.319> very<00:02:24.530> stressful<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.069> you're<00:02:25.250> right<00:02:25.400> but

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
not very stressful and you're right but

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.000 
not very stressful and you're right but
there<00:02:26.420> will<00:02:26.569> be<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.810> host<00:02:27.110> there<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:27.740> put<00:02:27.920> your

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
there will be a host there so put your

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.800 
there will be a host there so put your
hand<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.340> whole<00:02:28.580> though<00:02:28.819> in<00:02:29.150> this<00:02:29.390> hose

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
hand on the whole though in this hose

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.710 
hand on the whole though in this hose
here<00:02:30.590> but<00:02:31.100> that's<00:02:31.190> not<00:02:31.430> too<00:02:31.819> bad<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.180> posture

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
here but that's not too bad of a posture

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.320 
here but that's not too bad of a posture
and<00:02:32.959> I<00:02:33.080> would<00:02:33.290> say<00:02:33.440> absolutely<00:02:33.730> I'm<00:02:34.730> working

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
and I would say absolutely I'm working

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.960 
and I would say absolutely I'm working
two<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.350> three<00:02:36.620> years<00:02:36.890> ahead<00:02:37.069> of<00:02:37.340> this<00:02:37.670> being

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
two to three years ahead of this being

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.570 
two to three years ahead of this being
in<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.510> assembly<00:02:39.140> line<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.920> what<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:40.130> can<00:02:40.280> do

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
in the assembly line so what I can do

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.330 
in the assembly line so what I can do
now<00:02:40.819> is<00:02:40.880> say<00:02:41.270> back<00:02:41.660> calculate<00:02:42.020> if<00:02:42.800> this<00:02:43.100> hose

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
now is say back calculate if this hose

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.580 
now is say back calculate if this hose
is<00:02:43.370> here<00:02:44.000> but<00:02:44.569> is<00:02:44.660> gonna<00:02:44.810> push<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.200> on<00:02:45.350> like

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
is here but is gonna push it on like

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.900 
is here but is gonna push it on like
that<00:02:46.300> what<00:02:47.300> is<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.870> maximum<00:02:48.530> force<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.730> we

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
that what is the maximum force that we

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.240 
that what is the maximum force that we
can<00:02:50.090> apply<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.350> we<00:02:51.500> can<00:02:51.680> use<00:02:51.860> the

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
can apply to that so we can use the

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.610 
can apply to that so we can use the
biomechanics<00:02:53.150> within<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.570> model<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.140> say<00:02:54.350> in

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
biomechanics within the model and say in

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.330 
biomechanics within the model and say in
that<00:02:54.890> posture<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:56.390> should<00:02:56.720> be<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:58.070> can't

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
that posture it should be it can't

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.180 
that posture it should be it can't
exceed<00:02:58.850> 17<00:02:59.480> pounds<00:02:59.870> of<00:02:59.989> insertion<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.769> then

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
exceed 17 pounds of insertion and then

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.670 
exceed 17 pounds of insertion and then
that<00:03:01.430> becomes<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.470> specification<00:03:03.470> as<00:03:03.650> a

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
that becomes the specification as a

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.009 
that becomes the specification as a
target<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:04.970> we<00:03:05.180> then<00:03:05.420> bring<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.750> the

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
target that that we then bring to the

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.809 
target that that we then bring to the
engineering<00:03:06.470> team<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.069> say<00:03:07.250> okay

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
engineering team and say okay

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.360 
engineering team and say okay
great<00:03:08.390> location<00:03:08.569> no<00:03:09.470> problem<00:03:09.950> we<00:03:10.040> can<00:03:10.190> reach

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
great location no problem we can reach

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.880 
great location no problem we can reach
it<00:03:10.670> but<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.330> can't<00:03:11.569> exceed<00:03:11.989> 17<00:03:12.739> pounds<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:18.709> if

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
it but you can't exceed 17 pounds so if

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.039 
it but you can't exceed 17 pounds so if
you<00:03:18.980> want<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.280> reach<00:03:19.459> out<00:03:19.790> with<00:03:20.450> your<00:03:20.510> okay

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
you want to reach out with your okay

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.330 
you want to reach out with your okay
with<00:03:21.200> your<00:03:21.350> left<00:03:21.530> hand<00:03:21.680> let's<00:03:21.890> do<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.100> cat

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
with your left hand let's do the cat

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.670 
with your left hand let's do the cat
rolls<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:23.209> there's<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.480> cap<00:03:23.780> way<00:03:24.260> out<00:03:24.470> in<00:03:24.620> front

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
rolls so there's a cap way out in front

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.620 
rolls so there's a cap way out in front
is<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.250> go<00:03:25.340> lean<00:03:25.640> in<00:03:25.880> like<00:03:26.060> your<00:03:26.209> assembly

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
is you go lean in like your assembly

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.710 
is you go lean in like your assembly
worker<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.620> you're<00:03:27.769> going<00:03:27.950> for<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.720> right

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
worker and you're going for that right

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.250 
worker and you're going for that right
hand<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.739> my<00:03:31.630> electrical<00:03:32.630> connector<00:03:33.110> way

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
hand and my electrical connector way

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.339 
hand and my electrical connector way
over<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.680> right

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
over the right

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.530 
over the right
there's<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.920> boat<00:03:35.340> right<00:03:35.370> there<00:03:35.670> yes<00:03:36.030> there's<00:03:36.420> a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
there's a boat right there yes there's a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.869 
there's a boat right there yes there's a
little<00:03:36.840> green<00:03:38.629> yeah<00:03:39.889> good<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.129> then<00:03:41.579> maybe

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
little green yeah good and then maybe

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.399 
little green yeah good and then maybe
right<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.269> middle<00:03:42.540> there's<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.049> folks

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
right in the middle there's that folks

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.059 
right in the middle there's that folks
that<00:03:43.650> perform<00:03:44.249> really<00:03:44.579> hope<00:03:45.349> so<00:03:46.349> what<00:03:46.499> I<00:03:46.530> do<00:03:46.680> is

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
that perform really hope so what I do is

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.920 
that perform really hope so what I do is
I<00:03:47.189> actually<00:03:47.370> put<00:03:47.819> a<00:03:47.849> little<00:03:47.909> rock<00:03:48.420> there<00:03:48.749> so

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
I actually put a little rock there so

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.750 
I actually put a little rock there so
you<00:03:48.989> have<00:03:49.109> an<00:03:49.200> idea<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.799> you've<00:03:50.099> reached<00:03:50.430> it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
you have an idea that you've reached it

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.750 
you have an idea that you've reached it
virtually<00:03:51.329> but<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.109> actual<00:03:52.439> virtual<00:03:52.769> dataset

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
virtually but the actual virtual dataset

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.780 
virtually but the actual virtual dataset
is<00:03:54.000> our<00:03:54.180> engineering<00:03:54.750> data<00:03:55.049> set<00:03:55.349> is<00:03:55.500> saying

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
is our engineering data set is saying

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.250 
is our engineering data set is saying
that<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.909> engineers<00:03:57.450> are<00:03:57.599> releasing<00:03:58.109> on<00:03:58.230> a

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
that the engineers are releasing on a

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.849 
that the engineers are releasing on a
day<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.560> day<00:03:58.650> basis<00:03:59.370> and<00:04:00.359> we<00:04:01.290> would<00:04:01.439> get<00:04:01.590> then

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
day to day basis and we would get then

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.759 
day to day basis and we would get then
the<00:04:01.889> actual<00:04:02.840> location<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.260> this<00:04:04.409> is<00:04:04.560> then

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
the actual location and this is then

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.129 
the actual location and this is then
where<00:04:05.010> we<00:04:05.129> would<00:04:05.280> use<00:04:05.489> for<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:06.419> revisions

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
where we would use for and revisions

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.629 
where we would use for and revisions
make<00:04:07.349> sure<00:04:07.530> there's<00:04:07.650> enough<00:04:07.680> hand<00:04:08.069> clearance
