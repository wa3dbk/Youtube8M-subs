example well eighth notes there's eight
in<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.510> bar<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.710> don't<00:00:37.860> count<00:00:38.040> them

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
in a bar right but you don't count them

one two three four five six seven eight

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.799 
one two three four five six seven eight
basically<00:00:41.640> each<00:00:41.670> quarter<00:00:42.239> note<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.600> four

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
basically each quarter note the four

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.030 
basically each quarter note the four
quarter<00:00:43.140> notes<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:43.530> two<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.800> three<00:00:44.010> four

quarter notes one two and three four

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.500 
quarter notes one two and three four
they<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.360> second<00:00:46.230> note<00:00:46.890> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
they get a second note if you will or a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.810 
they get a second note if you will or a
second<00:00:48.930> eighth<00:00:49.110> note<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.489> count<00:00:50.670> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
second eighth note so and you count it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.240 
second eighth note so and you count it
like<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.340> two<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.699> three<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.840> four

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
like this one and two and three and four

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.420 
like this one and two and three and four
and<00:00:56.570> ok<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.930> quarter<00:00:58.170> note<00:00:58.320> beat<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and ok so the quarter note beat the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.789 
and ok so the quarter note beat the
count<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.789> bar<00:01:00.030> would<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.359> 1<00:01:01.079> 2<00:01:01.890> 3<00:01:02.280> 4<00:01:03.320> 8th<00:01:04.320> notes

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
count one bar would be 1 2 3 4 8th notes

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.700 
count one bar would be 1 2 3 4 8th notes
would<00:01:05.070> be<00:01:05.250> counted<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.810> two<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
would be counted as one and two and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.700 
would be counted as one and two and
three<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.400> four<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.170> still<00:01:10.439> have

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
three and four and so you still have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.830 
three and four and so you still have
your<00:01:10.950> four<00:01:11.159> quarter<00:01:11.580> notes<00:01:11.659> one<00:01:12.659> two<00:01:12.810> three

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
your four quarter notes one two three

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.219 
your four quarter notes one two three
and<00:01:13.110> four<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.979> each<00:01:14.640> quarter<00:01:15.360> note<00:01:15.509> it

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
and four but each quarter note it

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.280 
and four but each quarter note it
consists<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.610> eighth<00:01:17.820> notes<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.780> two

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
consists of two eighth notes one and two

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.039 
consists of two eighth notes one and two
and<00:01:19.320> three<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.310> four<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.240> now<00:01:21.900> it's

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
and three and four and now it's

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.350 
and three and four and now it's
important<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.500> note<00:01:22.909> we're<00:01:23.909> talking<00:01:24.060> about<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
important to note we're talking about a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.219 
important to note we're talking about a
puzzle<00:01:24.780> earlier<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:26.880> an<00:01:27.180> eighth<00:01:27.630> note<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
puzzle earlier that an eighth note the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.399 
puzzle earlier that an eighth note the
and<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.159> will<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.610> say<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.200> end

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and if you will like say one and the end

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.109 
and if you will like say one and the end
of<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.460> exactly<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.750> between<00:01:34.170> b1<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.400> b2

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
of one is exactly in between b1 and b2

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.660 
of one is exactly in between b1 and b2
so<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.650> well<00:01:38.130> let<00:01:38.369> me<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.549> this

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
so if you have one well let me do this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.620 
so if you have one well let me do this
way<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.600> two<00:01:40.229> right<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.509> would<00:01:42.509> be

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
way one and two right and would be

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.210 
way one and two right and would be
exactly<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> center<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.070> would<00:01:44.189> have

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
exactly in the center so you would have

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
exactly in the center so you would have
one<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.290> two<00:01:46.290> right<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.020> two<00:01:49.020> it's

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
one and two right one and two it's

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.700 
one and two right one and two it's
exactly<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.430> middle<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:51.200> symmetrical<00:01:52.200> so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
exactly in the middle or symmetrical so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.100 
exactly in the middle or symmetrical so
let's<00:01:52.890> practice<00:01:53.310> counting<00:01:53.570> bars<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.899> eighth

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
let's practice counting bars of eighth

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.899 
let's practice counting bars of eighth
notes<00:01:55.140> or<00:01:55.560> measures<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.009> eighth<00:01:56.159> notes<00:01:56.189> go

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
notes or measures of eighth notes go

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.830 
notes or measures of eighth notes go
like<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.329> one<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.560> two<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.670> three<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.570> four

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
like this one and two and three and four

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.050 
like this one and two and three and four
and<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.780> two<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.810> three<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.979> four<00:02:05.280> and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
and one and two and three and four and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.290 
and one and two and three and four and
one<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.160> two<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.190> three<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.300> four<00:02:09.599> and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
one and two and three and four and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.120 
one and two and three and four and
keep<00:02:11.480> practicing<00:02:11.750> counting<00:02:12.500> those<00:02:12.710> eighth

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
keep practicing counting those eighth

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.970 
keep practicing counting those eighth
