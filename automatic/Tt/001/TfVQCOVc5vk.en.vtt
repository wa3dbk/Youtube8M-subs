so I flip it on lights are good let's go

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.120 
so I flip it on lights are good let's go
back<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.640> check<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.509> out

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
back here check it out

nice we've got the tail light and the
plate<00:01:25.170> light<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.009> see<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.399> plate

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
plate light so you can see the plate

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.340 
plate light so you can see the plate
light<00:01:26.820> comes<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.270> under<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.170> that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
light comes in under there and that

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.289 
light comes in under there and that
shines<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> plate<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:29.490> we've<00:01:29.880> got<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> two

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
shines the plate and we've got the two

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.399 
shines the plate and we've got the two
LED<00:01:30.960> tails<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> let's<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.119> ahead<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.659> check<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
LED tails so let's go ahead and check to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.800 
LED tails so let's go ahead and check to
see<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.829> we<00:01:35.399> got<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.939> left<00:01:36.930> Karen<00:01:38.750> it's<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
see what we got here left Karen it's a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
see what we got here left Karen it's a
left<00:01:40.079> turn<00:01:40.320> signal<00:01:40.770> blinks<00:01:41.369> right<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.670> there

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
left turn signal blinks right in there

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.709 
left turn signal blinks right in there
real<00:01:42.299> nice<00:01:45.289> right<00:01:46.289> turn<00:01:46.619> signal<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:48.240> all<00:01:48.420> built

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
real nice right turn signal is all built

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.020 
real nice right turn signal is all built
in<00:01:48.930> blinks<00:01:49.380> real<00:01:49.560> nice<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:51.259> then<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.850> can

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
in blinks real nice and then you can

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.020 
in blinks real nice and then you can
probably<00:01:54.299> tell<00:01:54.689> pretty<00:01:55.020> easily<00:01:55.759> brake<00:01:56.759> light

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
probably tell pretty easily brake light

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.969 
probably tell pretty easily brake light
works<00:01:58.340> nice<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.609> good<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:03.259> f4i<00:02:04.259> tail

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
works nice and good so the f4i tail

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.960 
works nice and good so the f4i tail
light<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.649> 1992<00:02:08.030> CBR<00:02:09.030> f2<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.230> got<00:02:10.350> an<00:02:10.440> f4<00:02:10.890> I

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
light on a 1992 CBR f2 so we got an f4 I

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.700 
light on a 1992 CBR f2 so we got an f4 I
2002<00:02:11.970> tail<00:02:12.210> light

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
2002 tail light
