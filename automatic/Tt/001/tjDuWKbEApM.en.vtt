F sharp diminished again it should sound
something<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.410> this

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250

the<00:00:49.489> second<00:00:49.969> line<00:00:50.120> of<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.300> court<00:00:50.629> I<00:00:51.339> put<00:00:52.339> into

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
the second line of the court I put into

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:54.310 
the second line of the court I put into
here<00:00:52.760> something<00:00:53.239> which<00:00:53.390> jazz<00:00:53.750> musicians

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
here something which jazz musicians

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.649 
here something which jazz musicians
refer<00:00:54.679> to<00:00:54.829> as<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:55.010> minor<00:00:55.219> line<00:00:55.519> cliche<00:00:56.149> starts

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
refer to as a minor line cliche starts

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.319 
refer to as a minor line cliche starts
off<00:00:56.839> in<00:00:57.019> a<00:00:57.229> minor<00:00:57.859> go<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.280> a<00:00:58.519> minor<00:00:58.850> major<00:00:59.149> seven

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
off in a minor go to a minor major seven

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.219 
off in a minor go to a minor major seven
a<00:00:59.870> minus<00:01:00.769> seven<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.190> minus<00:01:01.579> six<00:01:01.929> so<00:01:02.929> the<00:01:03.079> line

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
a minus seven a minus six so the line

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:16.419 
a minus seven a minus six so the line
should<00:01:03.469> sound<00:01:03.710> like<00:01:03.799> this<00:01:14.679> the<00:01:15.679> third<00:01:15.950> line<00:01:16.159> is

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
should sound like this the third line is

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:17.919 
should sound like this the third line is
the<00:01:16.549> same<00:01:16.759> as<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.030> first<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:17.509> we<00:01:17.630> don't<00:01:17.659> have

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
the same as the first so we don't have

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.469 
the same as the first so we don't have
to<00:01:18.080> repeat<00:01:18.409> that<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.789> fourth<00:01:20.030> line<00:01:20.210> goes

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
to repeat that and the fourth line goes

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.450 
to repeat that and the fourth line goes
into<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:20.899> relative<00:01:21.289> major<00:01:21.560> which<00:01:21.890> is<00:01:21.920> G<00:01:22.280> major

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
into the relative major which is G major

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.690 
into the relative major which is G major
I'm<00:01:23.179> using<00:01:23.509> G<00:01:24.409> major<00:01:24.619> seven<00:01:25.130> here<00:01:25.340> going<00:01:25.610> to

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
I'm using G major seven here going to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.120 
I'm using G major seven here going to
give<00:01:25.940> us<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.149> bit<00:01:26.330> more<00:01:26.539> to<00:01:26.630> play<00:01:26.840> over<00:01:27.200> C<00:01:27.920> major

give us a bit more to play over C major

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.639 
give us a bit more to play over C major
7<00:01:28.700> as<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.909> substitute<00:01:29.899> really<00:01:30.170> for<00:01:30.350> an<00:01:30.409> E<00:01:30.500> minor

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
chord and then right at the end there's

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.949 
chord and then right at the end there's
this<00:01:36.229> little<00:01:36.649> snatch<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.429> another<00:01:37.850> minor<00:01:38.659> line

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
this little snatch of another minor line

the<00:01:47.220> whole<00:01:47.400> line<00:01:47.610> should<00:01:47.850> sound<00:01:48.120> like<00:01:48.240> this

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440

three lines of our chords into audacity

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.380 
three lines of our chords into audacity
and<00:02:09.170> we<00:02:10.170> can<00:02:10.350> highlight<00:02:10.770> each<00:02:11.520> line<00:02:11.880> in<00:02:12.090> turn
