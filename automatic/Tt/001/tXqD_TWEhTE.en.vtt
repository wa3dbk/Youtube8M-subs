hello<00:00:12.269> miiverse<00:00:12.750> creepers<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.620> MEAP

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
hello miiverse creepers this is MEAP

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.519 
hello miiverse creepers this is MEAP
juice<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.969> new<00:00:15.120> snapshot<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.929> found

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
juice and in the new snapshot I found

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.099 
juice and in the new snapshot I found
out<00:00:16.710> something<00:00:17.010> really<00:00:17.190> cool

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
out something really cool

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.380 
out something really cool
they're<00:00:19.529> basically<00:00:21.320> it's<00:00:22.320> really<00:00:22.590> awesome<00:00:22.859> um

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
they're basically it's really awesome um

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.650 
they're basically it's really awesome um
there<00:00:24.390> are<00:00:24.420> new<00:00:25.230> portals<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.180> go<00:00:27.180> ahead<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
there are new portals so go ahead and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.439 
there are new portals so go ahead and
build<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> redstone<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.449> then

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
build the redstone like this and then

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
build the redstone like this and then
you<00:00:30.599> place<00:00:30.810> fire<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> little<00:00:31.560> laggy<00:00:31.740> so

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you place fire it's a little laggy so

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.330 
you place fire it's a little laggy so
yeah<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.540> anyway<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.079> gives<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> lava

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
yeah but anyway this gives you a lava

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.569 
yeah but anyway this gives you a lava
portal<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.079> step<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
portal and when you step in it it's a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.430 
portal and when you step in it it's a
little<00:00:38.820> buggy<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.480> can<00:00:39.600> see<00:00:39.840> like<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
little buggy so you can see like it

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.590 
little buggy so you can see like it
looks<00:00:40.710> kind<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.040> weird<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:41.670> you're<00:00:42.059> inside

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
looks kind of weird like you're inside

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.160 
looks kind of weird like you're inside
of<00:00:42.629> it

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
of it

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.340 
of it
yeah<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.800> looks<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.219> weird<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.789> um<00:00:45.350> takes

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
yeah it looks kind of weird and um takes

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.770 
yeah it looks kind of weird and um takes
a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.770> bit<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.360> go<00:00:48.570> your

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
a little bit and there we go your

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.639 
a little bit and there we go your
teleported<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:49.920> Oh<00:00:50.219> No

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
teleported and then Oh No

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.790 
teleported and then Oh No
so<00:00:52.649> here's<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> Redstone<00:00:53.399> behind<00:00:53.670> it

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
so here's all the Redstone behind it

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.599 
so here's all the Redstone behind it
yeah<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.489> lot<00:00:57.920> yeah<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.340> pretty

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
yeah it's it's a lot yeah it's pretty

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.810 
yeah it's it's a lot yeah it's pretty
complicated<00:01:00.260> basically<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:01.820> this

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
complicated basically right here this

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.969 
complicated basically right here this
line<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.239> command<00:01:03.719> blocks<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.229> tests<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.949> all

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
line of command blocks it tests for all

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.399 
line of command blocks it tests for all
the<00:01:05.129> redstone<00:01:05.460> blocks<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:07.200> I

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
the redstone blocks so you can see if I

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.200 
the redstone blocks so you can see if I
destroy<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.430> comparator<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.030> gonna

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
destroy this this comparator is gonna

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.560 
destroy this this comparator is gonna
turn<00:01:09.540> off<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.650> place<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> goes<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.909> so

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
turn off and if I place a it goes on so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.870 
turn off and if I place a it goes on so
these<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.140> test<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.860> ten<00:01:14.430> total

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
these all just test for the ten total

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.990 
these all just test for the ten total
blocks<00:01:15.119> needed<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> portal<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:17.490> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
blocks needed for the portal and then it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.570 
blocks needed for the portal and then it
goes<00:01:18.420> into<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.720> NAND<00:01:18.990> gate<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> when<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.340> are

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
goes into a NAND gate and when they are

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.179 
goes into a NAND gate and when they are
all<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.979> gonna<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.670> ahead<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.210> oh

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
all like that it's gonna go ahead and oh

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.770 
all like that it's gonna go ahead and oh
also<00:01:26.189> there's<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.909> flint<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.240> steel<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
also there's the flint and steel so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.289 
also there's the flint and steel so
here's<00:01:27.990> an<00:01:28.110> or<00:01:28.350> gate<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:28.770> these<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.520> tests

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
here's an or gate with these so it tests

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.789 
here's an or gate with these so it tests
for<00:01:30.409> fire<00:01:31.409> here<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.720> fire<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> other<00:01:34.470> spot

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
for fire here or fire in the other spot

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.520 
for fire here or fire in the other spot
so<00:01:35.790> uh<00:01:36.590> yeah<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:38.970> true<00:01:39.200> then<00:01:40.200> oh

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so uh yeah so if it's all true then oh

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.520 
so uh yeah so if it's all true then oh
there's<00:01:41.070> some<00:01:41.400> redstone<00:01:41.610> blocks<00:01:42.030> um<00:01:42.320> if<00:01:43.320> it's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
there's some redstone blocks um if it's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.960 
there's some redstone blocks um if it's
all<00:01:43.619> true<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:45.450> triggers<00:01:46.579> this<00:01:47.579> command

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
all true then it triggers this command

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.219 
all true then it triggers this command
block<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.500> setting<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.810> redstone

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
block so it's setting this to redstone

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
block so it's setting this to redstone
right<00:01:52.530> under<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.009> sets<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.850> redstone

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
right under here sets it to it redstone

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.080 
right under here sets it to it redstone
block<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> destroy<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> basically<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
block and destroy so basically it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.840 
block and destroy so basically it
replaces<00:01:57.450> no<00:01:58.020> yeah<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.979> replaces<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
replaces no yeah it replaces that and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.889 
replaces no yeah it replaces that and
then<00:02:00.060> two<00:02:00.630> ticks<00:02:00.869> later<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.380> sets<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.100> oh<00:02:02.899> no

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
then two ticks later it sets it to oh no

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.740 
then two ticks later it sets it to oh no
no<00:02:04.170> no<00:02:04.380> no<00:02:04.439> okay<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.219> got<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.759> wrong<00:02:05.909> sorry<00:02:06.299> so

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
no no no okay I got this wrong sorry so

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.529 
no no no okay I got this wrong sorry so
it<00:02:06.990> sets<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.710> right<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:09.300> two

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
it sets this right here that two

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.630 
it sets this right here that two
redstone<00:02:09.869> block<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.319> then<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.190> back<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.580> err

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
redstone block and then it back to err

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.930 
redstone block and then it back to err
so<00:02:12.820> basically<00:02:13.390> stopping<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:14.110> clock<00:02:14.440> and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
so basically stopping this clock and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.980 
so basically stopping this clock and
yeah<00:02:16.170> then<00:02:17.170> what<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.560> does<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:20.440> also<00:02:20.710> oh<00:02:21.640> no<00:02:22.000> so

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
yeah then what it does it also oh no so

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.990 
yeah then what it does it also oh no so
yeah<00:02:23.470> when<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> does<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.610> basically

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
yeah when it does that it basically

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.970 
yeah when it does that it basically
turns<00:02:25.300> this<00:02:25.570> off<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.110> that's<00:02:26.350> when<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.740> break

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
turns this off so that's when you break

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.000 
turns this off so that's when you break
the<00:02:27.130> portal<00:02:27.490> it<00:02:27.700> will<00:02:27.730> turn<00:02:28.300> all<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:28.600> off<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
the portal it will turn all this off and

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.190 
the portal it will turn all this off and
when<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.220> build<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.550> portal

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
when you build the portal

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.400 
when you build the portal
it<00:02:32.200> turns<00:02:32.680> these<00:02:32.920> on<00:02:33.780> yeah<00:02:34.780> I'll<00:02:34.960> get<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.200> that

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
it turns these on yeah I'll get to that

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.770 
it turns these on yeah I'll get to that
in<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.890> minute<00:02:36.100> so<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.880> turns<00:02:37.090> these<00:02:37.210> torches<00:02:37.660> on

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
in a minute so it turns these torches on

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.820 
in a minute so it turns these torches on
so<00:02:38.110> basically<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:39.100> starts<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:39.760> clock<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.870> oh

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
so basically it starts this clock and oh

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.530 
so basically it starts this clock and oh
yeah<00:02:43.290> starts<00:02:44.290> clock<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.959> also<00:02:48.090> places<00:02:49.090> two

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
yeah starts clock and it also places two

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.330 
yeah starts clock and it also places two
torches<00:02:50.110> here<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.770> you<00:02:50.860> can't<00:02:51.130> actually

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
torches here so you can't actually

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.000 
torches here so you can't actually
really<00:02:51.760> see<00:02:52.120> them<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:53.440> can<00:02:53.709> see<00:02:53.830> if<00:02:53.920> I

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
really see them but you can see if I

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.420 
really see them but you can see if I
destroy<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:54.520> I'll<00:02:55.120> get<00:02:55.330> torch<00:02:57.180> yeah<00:02:58.180> so

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
destroy this I'll get torch yeah so

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.190 
destroy this I'll get torch yeah so
that's<00:03:00.430> just<00:03:00.850> for<00:03:01.000> lighting<00:03:01.540> so<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:01.870> gives<00:03:02.020> off

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
that's just for lighting so it gives off

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.199 
that's just for lighting so it gives off
light<00:03:03.030> um<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:06.010> yeah<00:03:06.220> this<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.580> super<00:03:07.000> fast

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
light um so yeah this is a super fast

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.240 
light um so yeah this is a super fast
clock<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.900> it's<00:03:08.709> kind<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:10.200> not<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.350> best<00:03:11.560> cuz

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
clock and it's kind of not the best cuz

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.370 
clock and it's kind of not the best cuz
you<00:03:13.180> can<00:03:13.330> obviously<00:03:13.630> see<00:03:13.989> there's<00:03:14.200> some

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
you can obviously see there's some

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.890 
you can obviously see there's some
downsides<00:03:14.860> like<00:03:15.130> this<00:03:15.520> is<00:03:15.700> jittery<00:03:16.180> very

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
downsides like this is jittery very

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.740 
downsides like this is jittery very
jittery<00:03:17.170> um<00:03:17.560> I<00:03:17.980> think<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:18.910> actually<00:03:19.269> better

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
jittery um I think it's actually better

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.180 
jittery um I think it's actually better
when<00:03:20.049> there<00:03:20.200> are<00:03:20.260> blocks<00:03:20.500> there<00:03:20.799> so<00:03:21.010> if<00:03:21.100> I

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
when there are blocks there so if I

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.860 
when there are blocks there so if I
destroy<00:03:21.549> this<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.660> do<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:27.690> yeah<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.750> can

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
destroy this and do this yeah you can

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.660 
destroy this and do this yeah you can
see<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.110> jittery<00:03:29.500> is<00:03:29.590> much<00:03:29.980> less<00:03:30.250> noticeable

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
see that jittery is much less noticeable

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.000 
see that jittery is much less noticeable
you<00:03:31.150> can<00:03:31.269> see<00:03:31.540> it's<00:03:31.690> still<00:03:32.410> slightly<00:03:32.650> there

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
you can see it's still slightly there

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.080 
you can see it's still slightly there
but<00:03:33.310> not<00:03:33.489> nearly<00:03:33.730> as<00:03:33.940> much<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:35.700> yeah<00:03:36.700> here's

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
but not nearly as much so yeah here's

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.440 
but not nearly as much so yeah here's
one<00:03:37.180> of<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.570> major<00:03:38.080> problems<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:38.950> it

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
one of the major problems of it

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.500 
one of the major problems of it
it's<00:03:40.450> jittery<00:03:41.080> oh<00:03:41.310> yeah<00:03:42.310> its<00:03:42.730> jittery<00:03:43.120> if<00:03:43.330> you

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
it's jittery oh yeah its jittery if you

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.100 
it's jittery oh yeah its jittery if you
uh<00:03:44.040> still<00:03:45.040> affect<00:03:45.549> something<00:03:45.820> its<00:03:46.480> jittery<00:03:46.870> if

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
uh still affect something its jittery if

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.080 
uh still affect something its jittery if
you<00:03:47.230> don't<00:03:47.410> have<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.650> blocks<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.160> also<00:03:48.610> it

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
you don't have the blocks and also it

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.810 
you don't have the blocks and also it
sticks<00:03:49.959> out<00:03:50.140> on<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:50.470> side<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:51.130> that's<00:03:51.489> really

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
sticks out on this side so that's really

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.390 
sticks out on this side so that's really
huge<00:03:52.090> downside<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.750> me<00:03:52.870> but<00:03:53.739> it<00:03:53.920> still<00:03:54.190> looks

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
huge downside to me but it still looks

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.870 
huge downside to me but it still looks
cool<00:03:54.700> from<00:03:54.730> like<00:03:55.030> one<00:03:55.209> side<00:03:55.450> um<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.850> just

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
cool from like one side um and I just

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.630 
cool from like one side um and I just
got<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.330> knowledge<00:03:58.600> of<00:03:58.630> effect<00:03:59.019> so<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.459> can

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
got the knowledge of effect so you can

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.009 
got the knowledge of effect so you can
see<00:04:00.760> on<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.940> scoreboard<00:04:01.360> I<00:04:01.480> forgot<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.870> turn

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
see on the scoreboard I forgot to turn

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.750 
see on the scoreboard I forgot to turn
it<00:04:02.170> on<00:04:02.230> off<00:04:02.470> for<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:02.920> video<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.459> can<00:04:03.640> see

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
it on off for the video so you can see

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.030 
it on off for the video so you can see
on<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.910> right<00:04:04.150> if<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.930> go<00:04:05.080> in<00:04:05.200> here<00:04:05.230> my<00:04:05.680> portal

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
on the right if I go in here my portal

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.539 
on the right if I go in here my portal
will<00:04:06.130> start<00:04:06.430> ticking<00:04:06.790> up<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:08.250> let's<00:04:09.250> go<00:04:09.430> ahead

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
will start ticking up and let's go ahead

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.660 
will start ticking up and let's go ahead
and<00:04:09.880> show<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.120> quick<00:04:10.510> demonstration<00:04:11.610> so<00:04:12.610> it

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
and show a quick demonstration so it

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.979 
and show a quick demonstration so it
goes<00:04:12.850> up<00:04:13.299> to<00:04:13.570> 50<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:15.519> it<00:04:15.579> should<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.450> then<00:04:16.780> you

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
goes up to 50 so it should and then you

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.289 
goes up to 50 so it should and then you
see<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.290> does<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.680> tell<00:04:17.829> raka<00:04:18.070> man<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:19.000> sucked

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
see it does it tell raka man that sucked

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.789 
see it does it tell raka man that sucked
too<00:04:19.450> lazy<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.870> make<00:04:20.019> it<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.200> mention<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:20.650> got

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
too lazy to make it to mention you got

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.069 
too lazy to make it to mention you got
the<00:04:20.890> point<00:04:21.130> right

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
the point right

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.420 
the point right
and<00:04:22.169> then<00:04:22.289> it's<00:04:22.740> supposed<00:04:22.979> to<00:04:23.009> tell<00:04:23.159> apart<00:04:23.340> you

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.480 
and then it's supposed to tell apart you
hereby<00:04:23.610> dildo<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.240> 150<00:04:25.080> blocks<00:04:25.319> up<00:04:25.500> instead<00:04:25.830> 50

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.629 

so<00:04:29.490> yeah<00:04:30.330> their<00:04:31.199> main<00:04:31.379> the<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:32.039> locks<00:04:32.490> the

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
so yeah their main the it locks the

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.450 
so yeah their main the it locks the
Flint<00:04:33.210> fire<00:04:33.509> and<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.139> really<00:04:34.590> complicated

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
Flint fire and it's really complicated

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.670 
Flint fire and it's really complicated
that's<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.240> basic<00:04:36.539> gist<00:04:36.719> you<00:04:37.319> can<00:04:37.439> do<00:04:37.530> with

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
that's the basic gist you can do with

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.350 
that's the basic gist you can do with
this<00:04:37.800> with<00:04:37.979> actually<00:04:38.400> any<00:04:38.550> block<00:04:38.879> you<00:04:39.120> can<00:04:39.240> do

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
this with actually any block you can do
