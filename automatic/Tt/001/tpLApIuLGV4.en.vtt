00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
watch my back as I point it toward my

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:02.119 
watch my back as I point it toward my
opponent<00:00:59.449> okay<00:01:00.449> that's<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.049> key<00:01:01.260> all<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
know where that ball went I know it went

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.809 
know where that ball went I know it went
in<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:39.959> I<00:01:40.049> felt<00:01:40.289> it<00:01:40.409> okay<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.640> will

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
in because I felt it okay and you will

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.550 
in because I felt it okay and you will
too

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.980 

why<00:01:45.980> are<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:46.130> gonna<00:01:46.220> ask<00:01:46.510> what<00:01:47.510> grip<00:01:47.720> should<00:01:47.870> I

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
why are you gonna ask what grip should I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.020 
why are you gonna ask what grip should I
use<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.290> is<00:01:48.440> very<00:01:48.620> common<00:01:49.040> because<00:01:49.760> if<00:01:49.970> you

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
use this is very common because if you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.360 
use this is very common because if you
use<00:01:50.150> a<00:01:50.180> continental<00:01:50.780> grip<00:01:51.020> or<00:01:51.800> an<00:01:52.010> Eastern

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
use a continental grip or an Eastern

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.430 
use a continental grip or an Eastern
backhand<00:01:52.820> grip<00:01:52.930> let's<00:01:53.930> just<00:01:54.110> say<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.260> were

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
backhand grip let's just say you were

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.100 
backhand grip let's just say you were
using<00:01:54.940> an<00:01:55.940> Easter<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.300> continental<00:01:56.840> grip<00:01:56.870> on

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
using an Easter a continental grip on

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.750 
using an Easter a continental grip on
the<00:01:57.170> backhand<00:01:57.440> watch<00:01:57.650> what<00:01:57.830> happens<00:01:58.100> watch

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
the backhand watch what happens watch

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.350 
the backhand watch what happens watch
what<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.060> ball<00:01:59.210> goes<00:02:00.670> goes<00:02:01.670> way<00:02:01.850> up<00:02:02.030> there<00:02:02.180> why

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
what the ball goes goes way up there why

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.700 
what the ball goes goes way up there why
because<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.900> don't<00:02:03.080> have<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.290> muscles<00:02:03.619> in

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
because you don't have the muscles in

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.190 
because you don't have the muscles in
your<00:02:03.740> forearm<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.540> control<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.660> topspin<00:02:06.050> on<00:02:06.170> a

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
your forearm to control the topspin on a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.469 
your forearm to control the topspin on a
continental<00:02:06.619> grip<00:02:06.880> for<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.940> backhand<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:08.360> we

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
continental grip for the backhand so we

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.490 
continental grip for the backhand so we
have<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.750> move<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:08.990> a<00:02:09.050> little<00:02:09.200> bit<00:02:09.320> to<00:02:09.410> the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
have to move it a little bit to the

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.060 
have to move it a little bit to the
eastern<00:02:09.800> side<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.280> here's<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.000> little<00:02:11.209> trick

squeezing<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.820> racket<00:02:32.120> hard<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.780> want<00:02:32.959> to

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
squeezing the racket hard you want to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.770 
squeezing the racket hard you want to
have<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.260> finger<00:02:33.440> spread<00:02:34.060> okay<00:02:35.060> because<00:02:35.510> see

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
have the finger spread okay because see

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.050 
have the finger spread okay because see
this<00:02:35.900> this<00:02:36.290> finger<00:02:36.739> spreading<00:02:37.100> creates<00:02:37.910> an

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
this this finger spreading creates an

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.479 
this this finger spreading creates an
apex<00:02:38.690> or<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:39.020> pivot<00:02:39.320> point<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.220> hand<00:02:40.370> and

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
apex or a pivot point of the hand and

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.699 
apex or a pivot point of the hand and
wrist<00:02:40.520> it's<00:02:40.910> shorter<00:02:41.360> than<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.230> back<00:02:42.440> here

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
wrist it's shorter than it is back here

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.620 
wrist it's shorter than it is back here
this<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:42.980> longer<00:02:43.340> distance<00:02:43.700> here<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:44.510> is

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
this is longer distance here so this is

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.390 
this is longer distance here so this is
harder<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.900> control<00:02:45.080> when<00:02:45.860> we<00:02:46.010> spread<00:02:46.280> our

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
harder to control when we spread our

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.850 
harder to control when we spread our
fingers<00:02:46.730> out<00:02:46.910> okay<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:48.140> nice<00:02:48.380> turn<00:02:48.530> back<00:02:48.680> in

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
fingers out okay on a nice turn back in

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.580 
fingers out okay on a nice turn back in
we<00:02:49.280> have<00:02:49.430> more<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.820> unit<00:02:50.209> here<00:02:50.450> this<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.410> more

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
we have more of a unit here this is more

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.960 
we have more of a unit here this is more
