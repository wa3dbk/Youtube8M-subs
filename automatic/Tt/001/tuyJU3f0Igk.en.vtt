00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.250 
know if you could even see my stomach
from<00:02:58.790> there<00:02:59.790> we<00:02:59.940> get<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.329> need<00:03:00.629> to<00:03:00.810> change<00:03:01.079> that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
from there we get I need to change that

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.300 
from there we get I need to change that
camera<00:03:01.680> do<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.040> second<00:03:03.920> yeah<00:03:04.920> um<00:03:07.250> my<00:03:08.250> stomach

has<00:03:08.849> been<00:03:09.060> going<00:03:09.540> better<00:03:09.750> than<00:03:09.930> my<00:03:10.200> arms<00:03:10.590> I

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
has been going better than my arms I

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.539 
has been going better than my arms I
guess<00:03:11.690> it's<00:03:13.370> it's<00:03:14.370> kind<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:15.390> hard<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.560> don't

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
guess it's it's kind of hard I don't

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.009 
guess it's it's kind of hard I don't
know<00:03:17.819> really<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.419> can<00:03:18.599> see<00:03:18.780> any

know really if you can see any

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.800 
know really if you can see any
difference<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.680> think<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.370> said<00:03:20.579> tiny<00:03:21.120> bit<00:03:21.510> after

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
difference I think I said tiny bit after

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.349 
difference I think I said tiny bit after
this<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.169> mean<00:03:22.440> I'm<00:03:22.590> getting<00:03:23.450> muscles<00:03:24.590> here<00:03:25.590> I

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
this I mean I'm getting muscles here I

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:32.780 
this I mean I'm getting muscles here I
can<00:03:27.359> feel<00:03:27.389> them<00:03:28.160> um<00:03:30.319> this<00:03:31.319> skin<00:03:31.950> stuff<00:03:32.340> i<00:03:32.519> guess

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
can feel them um this skin stuff i guess

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.319 
can feel them um this skin stuff i guess
i<00:03:32.970> will<00:03:33.030> never<00:03:33.389> get<00:03:34.139> rid<00:03:34.379> of<00:03:34.579> yeah<00:03:35.579> i<00:03:35.879> think

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
i will never get rid of yeah i think

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.839 
i will never get rid of yeah i think
it's<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.840> bit<00:03:37.139> tighter<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:39.859> think<00:03:40.859> I<00:03:41.129> mean<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.639> need

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
it's a bit tighter I think I mean I need

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.879 
it's a bit tighter I think I mean I need
that<00:03:42.030> scheme<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.510> be<00:03:42.629> able<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.049> like<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.500> can

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
that scheme to be able to like I can

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.800 
that scheme to be able to like I can
flip<00:03:44.190> backwards<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:45.060> if<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.389> wouldn't<00:03:45.750> have

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
flip backwards and if I wouldn't have

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.129 
flip backwards and if I wouldn't have
that<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.319> probably<00:03:46.949> won't<00:03:47.370> work<00:03:47.569> then<00:03:48.569> I<00:03:48.690> stunt

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
that it probably won't work then I stunt

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.699 
that it probably won't work then I stunt
like<00:03:49.609> shit<00:03:50.609> so<00:03:50.870> that's<00:03:51.870> maybe<00:03:52.049> why<00:03:52.349> you<00:03:52.379> can

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
like shit so that's maybe why you can

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.970 
like shit so that's maybe why you can
