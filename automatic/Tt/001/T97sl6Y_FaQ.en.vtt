00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello everyone today I 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.780
 would like to talk to you about a topic not 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.390
 usual 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.680
 it's something you're talking about 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.179
 quite often you ask them often 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.340
 questions on it I play pokemon 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.559
 is so many of you that this 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.230
 in comments in message 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.630
 private or or during the live you me 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.910
 ask if I assume in quotation marks 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.260
 obviously the fact that playing pokemon 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.090
 indeed it's a question in the 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.350
 tac of the 28 breaks surely with 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.939
 pokemon of a video that I took out not 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.470
 very long time in this wide video 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.449
 from a point of view a game not take 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.510
 everything I say at the foot of the letter 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.969
 and it is not a monologue 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.829
 recite to someone who is not going 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.850
 understand someone tolerant by 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.800
 compared to the fact that you play pokemon 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.540
 that's very important to know and I 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.570
 am not here to explain 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.289
 why pokemon is not just a game 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.149
 for kids 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.620
 I do not even need to explain myself 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.230
 I will not do it in this video a 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.680
 part even much of it let's say from 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.449
 my audience is the slice of 12 16 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.420
 years so well I know well there is also 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.039
 of the oldest 18 30 years like me 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.920
 where there are even younger ones so at 12 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.810
 16 years old and the college period and that's 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 the period at which players 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.810
 receive the most mockery we go 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.189
 call it that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.270
 and that's why we have a lot 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.900
 of them asking questions 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.840
 short 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.979
 let's go straight to the goal pokemon is a game 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.659
 for children 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.939
 sorry you do not like it but pokemon 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.439
 is a game designed to please children 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.330
 there is only to look at the commercials of 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.470
 the time there was even a pervert in 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.680
 waterproof so it's good for 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.390
 children 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.939
 but afterwards his children they have 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.590
 grown up and he's a good half 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.509
 I think of just over half of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.979
 today's players I'm doing 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.409
 Part I was four when red 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.909
 blue came out in France and 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.470
 today I always in game freak 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.020
 or nintendo it depends how are the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.549
 things they had to adapt to the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.040
 first generation of players who has 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.670
 grown up have become teenagers or 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.320
 even 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.990
 the adults and they also had 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.360
 adapt to the new generation of 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.299
 young players it actually took he 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.090
 needed to fill these two types of players 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.560
 type of player with a single game and 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.330
 it is partly here that the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.520
 problem because a game for kids 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.619
 played by teenagers and adults 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.140
 necessarily there is something to ask 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.360
 questions someone who who did not play 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.350
 who has played very little or someone who has 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.239
 played the first versions that's 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.440
 the typical example and that she is still 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.860
 less for someone who has never played 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.959
 down these people there can not know and 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.730
 it can not know that the game was 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.530
 suitable for a much older audience 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.780
 so the reputation fortis new channel 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.060
 is normal it makes sense the game to the 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.950
 base it was a game only for the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.780
 children but then he adapted himself 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.900
 of course I do not forget image 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.239
 child of pokÃ©mon conveyed by the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.180
 cartoon by the card game 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.830
 and that's what society has 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.049
 retained the pokemon phenomenon 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.060
 for example when I talk about it with 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.709
 parents of my friends friends who play 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.640
 not to pokemon down they did not know 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.260
 that they had a video game 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720
 they did not even know but it's not 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.130
 this generation who is going to have one who is going 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.570
 see this intolerance because that's 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.980
 the word so be careful I do not have any 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.959
 blame the cartoon at the game of 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.910
 cards when I say that it conveys the 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.140
 childish side is when to video games 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.130
 there is a double reading with the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.090
 card game collection 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.900
 there are people who collect the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.310
 stamps and there are others that 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.180
 collect coins bah 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.890
 there are people who collect 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.299
 pokemon cards it's like that and again 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.440
 I did not even mention the competition 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.519
 because if I only talked about 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.380
 competition I could explain to you 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.850
 for hours why pokemon 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.200
 is not a game for kids 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.880
 why it's a game that requires 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.260
 a lot of maturity and this argument 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.609
 it's really a door sinking 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.780
 open 1 so I'm not even going in 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.970
 talk when I told you everything to 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.549
 the time but it sucks is something 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.230
 embarrassing enough it makes the talk cons 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.640
 someone intolerant or someone from 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.109
 price in the group phenomenon because 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.519
 that's the main problem 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.470
 the group phenomenon a player a 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.000
 young player is not going to tell himself by 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.290
 himself so that he stays a game for 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.700
 the jared kids playing it's the 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.109
 group phenomenon that makes that 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.220
 some players stop playing by 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.319
 against someone of intolerance you 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.069
 would have liked to demonstrate by a more b 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.269
 that they are wrong 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.190
 I do not speak of them who is right who has 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.010
 wrong and that he is wrong he will not have 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.659
 not even aware of 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.860
 to deny the evidence against someone 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.189
 who believes that pokemon is a game for 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.900
 children 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.939
 simply because he did not play 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.709
 game or very little but that is 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.260
 curious enough who is 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.000
 smart enough to be interested in 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.709
 your passion is there you can 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.150
 make it clear to the person that 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.319
 pokemon is not just a game for 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.610
 children and personally it gives 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.440
 a lot to pin down people someone who 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.569
 is not even able to take an interest in 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.010
 the passion of someone who prefers 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.190
 laugh at something that does not know 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.299
 not so that in the end the ridicule is 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.650
 the unconsciousness of the person and well 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.150
 me these people do not interest me 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.100
 so be careful I do not tell you to sort 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.479
 your friends well but it's true that it's 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.600
 still a good indicator to know 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.070
 what people think and in people 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.630
 are the girls ah the girls 1 bah yes 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.039
 how to tell a girl that we play 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.510
 pokemon without her running away 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.310
 healthy without a bad word game that's 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.680
 not complicated if you even 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.639
 do not accept saying to the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.740
 other than you play pokemon 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.750
 how do you want a queue to accept 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.410
 if in addition she has a priori and that 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.300
 it's something that annoys me 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.130
 especially in the players of 18 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.830
 20 years because at the limit go back to 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.300
 college not to assume its north it's 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.560
 normal I can understand because there is 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.199
 the group phenomenon we do not want 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.580
 to be rejected here but to 18 20 years where 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.300
 we grew up we are still a little 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.370
 more mature 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.630
 I can not stand the jo 18 20 years 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.280
 who does not assume the fact that they play at 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.539
 pokemon people who are ashamed at this age 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.039
 there you guys are not going to do you 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.169
 stoning because you play pokemon 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.260
 and in addition if you do not tell your 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.789
 girlfriend you start your relationship on 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.410
 lies so it does not start very 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.060
 well finally here I think I said everything 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.440
 what I wanted on the subject and I the 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.090
 remember this video she is not there 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.900
 to explain why pokemon is not 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.550
 not a game for kids 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.020
 if you want to ask me questions 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.610
 whether on this subject there at the tank at 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.330
 our subject I invite you to pass 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.370
 during the live 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.120
 I'll see you soon for next 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.120
 video with everyone
