that or any other disk connection-wise
you<00:01:14.220> only<00:01:14.310> get<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.520> USB<00:01:14.909> port<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.390> also<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you only get one USB port you also get a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
you only get one USB port you also get a
headphone<00:01:16.259> jack<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> little<00:01:17.100> dongle

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
headphone jack and get a little dongle

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.230 
headphone jack and get a little dongle
connector<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.270> hooking<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.840> DVI<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.710> vga

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
connector for hooking up a DVI or vga

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
connector for hooking up a DVI or vga
cable<00:01:21.240> there's<00:01:22.020> no<00:01:22.110> firewire<00:01:22.650> there's<00:01:22.950> no<00:01:23.040> SD

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
cable there's no firewire there's no SD

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.830 
cable there's no firewire there's no SD
card<00:01:23.700> slot<00:01:23.909> there's<00:01:24.060> no<00:01:24.119> Express<00:01:24.509> card<00:01:24.780> slot

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
card slot there's no Express card slot

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.090 
card slot there's no Express card slot
so<00:01:25.049> that's<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.500> make<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> kind<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.040> hard

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
so that's going to make it kind of hard

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.429 
so that's going to make it kind of hard
to<00:01:26.310> hook<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.850> mobile<00:01:27.240> broadband<00:01:27.990> antenna<00:01:28.320> in

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
to hook up a mobile broadband antenna in

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.249 
to hook up a mobile broadband antenna in
let's<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> those<00:01:29.070> USB<00:01:29.490> versions

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
let's get one of those USB versions

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.539 
let's get one of those USB versions
there<00:01:31.259> are<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> couple<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.799> nifty<00:01:31.979> new<00:01:32.189> features

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
there are a couple of nifty new features
