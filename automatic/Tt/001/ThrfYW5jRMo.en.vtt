slides<00:05:00.380> off<00:05:00.650> has<00:05:01.520> a<00:05:01.550> little<00:05:01.880> port<00:05:02.450> in<00:05:02.600> there

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
slides off has a little port in there

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.530 
slides off has a little port in there

and then that gives you the ability to

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.980 
and then that gives you the ability to
hook<00:05:06.080> this<00:05:06.500> cable<00:05:07.070> up<00:05:07.220> to<00:05:07.370> it<00:05:07.520> by<00:05:07.750> sliding<00:05:08.750> it

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
hook this cable up to it by sliding it

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.100 
hook this cable up to it by sliding it
in<00:05:09.110> here<00:05:09.670> so<00:05:10.670> you<00:05:10.760> can<00:05:10.910> have<00:05:11.060> the<00:05:11.240> three<00:05:11.840> prong
