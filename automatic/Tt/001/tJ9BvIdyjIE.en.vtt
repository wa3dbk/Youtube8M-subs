watch these other videos on this part

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.450 
watch these other videos on this part
here<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:49.980> go<00:00:50.070> over<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
here but I'm just going to go over the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.540 
here but I'm just going to go over the
update<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.960> typically<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.980> does<00:00:53.160> need<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.430> be

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
update so typically that does need to be

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
update so typically that does need to be
a<00:00:53.670> probably<00:00:54.239> miss<00:00:54.390> 3d<00:00:54.899> will<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.379> turn<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
a probably miss 3d will just turn the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.150 
a probably miss 3d will just turn the
max<00:00:55.829> angles<00:00:56.250> right<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.680> I'm<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.739> going

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
max angles right here and I'm just going

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.520 
max angles right here and I'm just going
to<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.250> over<00:00:59.430> the<00:01:00.149> sliders<00:01:00.870> which<00:01:01.140> i<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
to go over the sliders which i think is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.290 
to go over the sliders which i think is
a<00:01:01.590> lot<00:01:01.710> better<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.550> I'm<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
a lot better so I'm just going to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.649 
a lot better so I'm just going to
control<00:01:03.899> high<00:01:04.170> part<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.850> we're

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
control high part of this here and we're

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.510 
control high part of this here and we're
going<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> Chris<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
going to do the Chris and we're going to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.039 
going to do the Chris and we're going to
bring<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.850> way<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> right<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
bring it all the way to the right and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.969 
bring it all the way to the right and
it's<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> make<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> Chris<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:12.860> we'll<00:01:13.860> do

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
it's going to make it Chris and we'll do

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.290 
it's going to make it Chris and we'll do
this<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.310> here

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.720 

and<00:01:17.870> we'll<00:01:18.170> do<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:18.410> to<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.620> negative<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.400> Z

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
and we'll do it to the negative so Z

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.420 
and we'll do it to the negative so Z
subs<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:20.440> then<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:21.590> can<00:01:21.740> see<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.130> chris

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
subs it then you can see it's chris

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.140 
subs it then you can see it's chris
there<00:01:23.200> now<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:24.770> one<00:01:25.010> here<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.280> very<00:01:25.550> similar

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
there now this one here is very similar

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.000 
there now this one here is very similar
but<00:01:26.330> this<00:01:26.660> kind<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.990> bevels<00:01:27.410> this<00:01:27.590> is<00:01:27.740> called

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
but this kind of bevels this is called

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.500 
but this kind of bevels this is called
none<00:01:28.730> Chris<00:01:29.980> so<00:01:30.980> we'll<00:01:31.520> just<00:01:31.550> bring<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:31.970> here

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.810 

right<00:01:35.510> here<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.130> we're<00:01:37.310> going<00:01:37.400> to<00:01:37.460> crank<00:01:37.670> this

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
right here and we're going to crank this

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.980 
right here and we're going to crank this
up<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.330> going<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.510> give<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.720> a<00:01:38.750> little<00:01:38.840> bit

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
up this is going to give it a little bit

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:47.340 
up this is going to give it a little bit
of<00:01:39.080> bevel<00:01:39.350> here<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:41.390> we'll<00:01:42.050> do<00:01:42.200> one<00:01:43.270> her<00:01:44.270> here

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.750 

and<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.620> the<00:01:48.710> negative<00:01:49.090> Z<00:01:50.090> sub<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:51.400> then<00:01:52.400> you

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
and to the negative Z sub it then you

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.840 
and to the negative Z sub it then you
can<00:01:52.910> see<00:01:53.150> how<00:01:53.330> this<00:01:53.510> works<00:01:54.640> alright<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.820> first

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
can see how this works alright the first

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.570 
can see how this works alright the first
slider<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:57.110> brings<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.500> out<00:01:57.620> Chris<00:01:57.950> which<00:01:58.340> was

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
slider it brings it out Chris which was

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.970 
slider it brings it out Chris which was
the<00:01:58.700> top<00:01:59.270> one<00:01:59.480> then<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.840> second<00:02:00.230> one<00:02:00.260> then

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
the top one then the second one then

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.340 
the top one then the second one then
this<00:02:01.430> next<00:02:01.820> slider<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.720> makes<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.080> kind<00:02:03.290> of

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
this next slider it makes it kind of
