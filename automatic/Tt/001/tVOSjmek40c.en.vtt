and then at the bottom we were having

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.529 
and then at the bottom we were having
some<00:01:35.439> nice<00:01:35.590> hardened<00:01:36.039> clay<00:01:36.159> just<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.210> sort<00:01:37.420> of

act like a bit of a path that had been

straight upper to the build
I'm<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.490> continue<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.030> design<00:01:42.360> around

just a few more details on roof and the

just a few more details on roof and the
wall<00:02:26.190> there<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.610> then<00:02:26.760> we're<00:02:26.849> gonna<00:02:26.970> go<00:02:27.209> to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
wall there and then we're gonna go to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.750 
wall there and then we're gonna go to
our<00:02:27.720> helicopter<00:02:28.560> view<00:02:28.739> as<00:02:29.099> I<00:02:29.220> like<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.489> call<00:02:29.519> it

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.280 
our helicopter view as I like to call it
which<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.330> basically<00:02:30.599> where<00:02:30.810> we<00:02:30.959> go<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.110> do

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
which is basically where we go to do

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.720 
which is basically where we go to do
building<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.680> roof<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.130> can<00:02:32.310> see<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.579> is

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
building a roof and I can see this is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.789 
building a roof and I can see this is
one<00:02:32.970> block<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.540> lower<00:02:33.690> down<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.680> actual

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
iron bars we'd be having five of these I

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.670 
iron bars we'd be having five of these I
think<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.090> was<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.870> entire<00:03:01.139> building<00:03:01.319> and

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
think it was in the entire building and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.800 
think it was in the entire building and
this<00:03:01.859> was<00:03:02.040> quite<00:03:02.190> enough<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.790> light<00:03:02.940> up<00:03:03.150> quite

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
this was quite enough to light up quite

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.360 
this was quite enough to light up quite
nicely<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.530> did<00:03:04.680> a<00:03:04.709> very<00:03:04.769> good<00:03:05.040> job<00:03:05.100> at

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
nicely and it did a very good job at

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.390 
nicely and it did a very good job at
