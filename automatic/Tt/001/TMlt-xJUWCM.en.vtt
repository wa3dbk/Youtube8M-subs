00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.490
 English 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.370
 advantage or an obstacle in I am 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.130
 obstacle because you have to know how to do 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.309

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.750
 possible

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:20.780

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.780
 a ride I do not know 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.530
 based on a girl 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.410

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.660

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.050
 to me 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.090
 to me 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.630
 this device by mail 

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:27.469
 with all of them 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.659

00:05:55.769 --> 00:06:01.539

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.039
 fernando arms forward fernando pains 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.159
 do not go to bother if we criticize you 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:08.500
 to not see you go and then not to leave 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:12.250
 you leave us with pains 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.420
 you leave them with pains the truth that 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.880
 when one has already mastered the 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.740
 character comes out very naturally already 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.660
 sometimes until one relaxes you do not 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.340
 an excellent invitation but I think 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.680
 you should not forget about the energy that 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.490
 puts the singer in each presentation 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.380
 ok many thanks fernando 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.270
 maricarmen marín we listen to your opinion 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.250
 It has been a correct presentation 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.890
 what Fernando says to you 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.870
 you will also feel it energy and vocally 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.390
 the shades have been good the breaks 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.980
 characteristic of pains and you have to 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.050
 be careful in tuning so 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.780
 everything else very well many thanks 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.200
 mari carmen lord ricardo now 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.610
 we hear your opinion is obvious no 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.230
 only that you sing very well but that 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.600
 It is a very good imitation of pains 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.010
 o'riordan I'm not going to discuss it I'm going to 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.320
 tell you things that I feel are 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:02.680
 happening that I think you have to observe 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.969
 and detect I think you're still with 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.649
 fear here 

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:08.169
 I feel that you have entered a little bit with 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:11.889
 fear of the scenario and that has not had 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:15.579
 this presentation until the end when 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:17.709
 came the shuffle of shoulders the little thing the 

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:19.539
 Spark of joy that has pains 

00:07:17.709 --> 00:07:21.459
 throughout the whole reference video 

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:23.019
 when he sings this song I think he has 

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:24.309
 I am missing suddenly I felt that 

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:26.199
 you are a little contrast a little 

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:28.299
 concentrated on singing the benefit has 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:29.829
 I've been fine, I just feel like I 'm missing a 

00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:32.589
 little more than chip with a little more than 

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:34.449
 joy I think you should also soften 

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:36.519
 a little bit the setting of your voice is 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:39.519
 a bit hard suddenly you have to warm up 

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:42.129
 and the time climbing that 

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:43.509
 granite to raise the falsetto also 

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:45.279
 it's a bit hard and I think you can 

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:47.259
 soften more to look like the more 

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:48.729
 pain or riordan you wanted to do something if 

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:51.719
 I made the mistake of doing a test of 

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:51.719
 sound bad with mine 

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:55.839
 I have but I have to tell you one thing 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:57.339
 more I expected more problems from 

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:58.619
 pronunciation and I did not hear so many 

00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:00.879
 that out there we are also better 

00:07:58.619 --> 00:08:03.339
 many gentlemen of the jury thanks 

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:04.390
