sticks up on some our older projects be
surprising<00:00:08.550> how<00:00:08.700> hard<00:00:09.059> these<00:00:09.240> are<00:00:09.510> actually

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
surprising how hard these are actually

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.830 
surprising how hard these are actually
defined<00:00:10.260> when<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.500> don't<00:00:10.679> have<00:00:10.830> him<00:00:10.980> around

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
defined when you don't have him around

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.029 
defined when you don't have him around
anyway<00:00:13.130> go<00:00:14.130> ahead<00:00:14.420> grab<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.929> think<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.800> had

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
anyway go ahead grab one I think I had

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.939 
anyway go ahead grab one I think I had
to<00:00:17.160> peel<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.670> real<00:00:17.910> part<00:00:18.560> yeah<00:00:19.560> one<00:00:19.770> like

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
to peel this real part yeah one like

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.400 
to peel this real part yeah one like
this<00:00:20.100> would<00:00:20.310> work<00:00:21.500> grab<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.769> make<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> mark

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
this would work grab it and make a mark

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.490 
this would work grab it and make a mark
about<00:00:25.410> halfway<00:00:25.740> down<00:00:27.019> make<00:00:28.019> sure<00:00:28.050> it's<00:00:28.410> a

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
about halfway down make sure it's a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.490 
about halfway down make sure it's a
straight<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:28.980> too<00:00:29.840> has<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.080> as<00:00:31.140> straight

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
straight one too has to be as straight

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.090 
straight one too has to be as straight
as<00:00:31.650> possible<00:00:31.850> should<00:00:32.850> not<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.030> might<00:00:33.270> even<00:00:33.300> use

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
as possible should not I might even use

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.410 
as possible should not I might even use
this<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.340> here<00:00:35.550> that's<00:00:35.700> probably<00:00:36.090> straighter

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
this one here that's probably straighter

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.930 
this one here that's probably straighter
make<00:00:39.800> a<00:00:40.800> mark<00:00:41.129> about<00:00:41.399> halfway<00:00:41.670> down<00:00:43.940> about

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
make a mark about halfway down about

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.389 
make a mark about halfway down about
there<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.559> cut<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> end<00:00:47.070> off<00:00:47.190> it

safety glasses on and get the glue out

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.020 
safety glasses on and get the glue out
and<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:16.680> will<00:03:16.890> be

and you will be

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.020 
and you will be
small<00:03:18.900> amount<00:03:19.020> of<00:03:19.350> glue<00:03:19.670> next<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.910> makes

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
small amount of glue next to it makes

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.170 
small amount of glue next to it makes
you<00:03:21.390> don't<00:03:21.600> actually<00:03:21.750> glue<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:23.060> bunch<00:03:24.060> of

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
you don't actually glue it a bunch of

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.770 
you don't actually glue it a bunch of
drops<00:03:24.450> next<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:27.950> then<00:03:28.950> with<00:03:29.520> your<00:03:30.150> ISO<00:03:30.450> pool

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
drops next to it then with your ISO pool

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.660 
drops next to it then with your ISO pool
stick<00:03:31.819> so<00:03:32.819> you've<00:03:33.060> got<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.360> straightest<00:03:34.319> end

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
stick so you've got the straightest end

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.690 
stick so you've got the straightest end
stick<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.819> next<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:37.130> like<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.459> then

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
stick it next to it like that and then

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.130 
stick it next to it like that and then
you<00:03:38.790> can<00:03:39.000> take<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.569> away<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:41.040> hold<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.489> down

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
you can take it away and hold that down

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.550 
you can take it away and hold that down
until<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.260> dries<00:03:43.500> completely<00:03:45.200> even<00:03:46.200> put<00:03:46.350> some

more on the side so you don't want these

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:56.710 
more on the side so you don't want these

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
bunch of drops down next to it about the

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.670 
bunch of drops down next to it about the
lengthy<00:04:47.990> I<00:04:48.020> suppose<00:04:48.380> stick

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680

have<00:05:21.450> to<00:05:21.570> repeat<00:05:21.840> that<00:05:21.960> exact<00:05:22.320> same<00:05:22.500> process

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
have to repeat that exact same process

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.290 
have to repeat that exact same process
on<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.190> end<00:05:23.310> all<00:05:23.430> go<00:05:23.610> through<00:05:23.790> that<00:05:23.910> in<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.090> sec

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
on the end all go through that in a sec

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.540 
on the end all go through that in a sec
but<00:05:24.330> while<00:05:24.660> this<00:05:24.840> is<00:05:24.990> drying<00:05:25.380> I'm<00:05:26.190> going<00:05:26.370> to

I've been wearing the glasses off and
gluing<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:48.930> left<00:05:49.110> clicked<00:05:49.410> up<00:05:49.530> like<00:05:49.710> right<00:05:50.010> on

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
gluing and left clicked up like right on

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.360 
gluing and left clicked up like right on
the<00:05:50.250> glasses<00:05:50.820> where<00:05:51.480> my<00:05:51.630> eyes<00:05:52.130> it's<00:05:53.130> been<00:05:53.340> a

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
the glasses where my eyes it's been a

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.220 
the glasses where my eyes it's been a
bit<00:05:53.580> like<00:05:53.940> it's<00:05:54.180> just<00:05:54.390> super<00:05:54.750> glue<00:05:54.930> except

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
bit like it's just super glue except

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.620 
bit like it's just super glue except
what<00:05:55.380> can<00:05:55.560> happen<00:05:55.740> is<00:05:56.040> it<00:05:56.280> dries<00:05:56.880> up<00:05:57.090> inside<00:05:57.420> it

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
what can happen is it dries up inside it

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.200 
what can happen is it dries up inside it
when<00:05:57.720> you<00:05:57.870> squeeze<00:05:58.260> it<00:05:58.440> like<00:05:58.470> splats<00:05:59.070> out<00:05:59.310> like

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
when you squeeze it like splats out like

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.540 
when you squeeze it like splats out like
because<00:06:01.170> it<00:06:01.230> builds<00:06:01.410> up<00:06:01.560> pressure<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:02.040> flicks

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
because it builds up pressure and flicks

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.730 
because it builds up pressure and flicks
out<00:06:02.790> and<00:06:03.000> can<00:06:03.150> flick<00:06:03.450> off<00:06:03.600> things<00:06:03.900> like<00:06:04.620> you

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
out and can flick off things like you

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.960 
out and can flick off things like you
wouldn't<00:06:05.010> think<00:06:05.130> it<00:06:05.310> would<00:06:05.460> but<00:06:05.700> it's<00:06:05.910> just
