00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello very good the style lads and 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.710
 increasing and welcome to a new 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.420
 episode of plants against zombies 2 a 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.519
 this part we are going to continue exactly 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.370
 where we left the level that does not 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.540
 get that I did not get through yesterday 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.400
 I've been 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.940
 so to speak, trying to play 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.040
 laverty what tactics could you use but 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.869
 it turns out that the parrot that I thought that 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.000
 I could not go on these levels to see 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.490
 it has logic what what has happened to me 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.689
 but I can not find the logic that you 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.820
 go through a challenge in which you have to 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.680
 protect on your own these 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.660
 plants the parrot can be brought to one of 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.070
 your plants that you have to protect me 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.020
 I thought it was just that the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.670
 they could eat but not that they can 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.710
 carry if it's a very basic fault very 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.070
 silly 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.320
 but that I have not taken into account is the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.180
 Captain's problem is worth what then 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.920
 is what we are going to do we are going to put 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.720
 the two floors the two rows of 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.239
 sunflowers let's put the macro potato 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.489
 let's put the cannon we're going to put 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.250
 this tiparraco here we are going to put 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.360
 this tiparraco here and we're going to put 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:07.780
 this tiparraco here if I have not put 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.000
 the dragon but really these levels 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.649
 They are getting on my nerves 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.649
 they really put to the test 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.320
 all 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.119
 everything we go absolutely all the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.190
 nerves that you can have you know that 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.049
 forgive if it has sounded a little more 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.050
 strong the micro but you should simply 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:34.810
 I've moved the helmet for a little while 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.229
 and that's why basically 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.740
 nothing more and nothing less than that I put 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.579
 directly the potato there so that the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.110
 cool down go starting before 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.619
 time I know that since if you put it 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.320
 before then that that you that you avoid yourself 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.010
 Well, what do you mean better? 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.180
 I put the corn spear or spear butter 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.690
 or call it what you want because 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.840
 normally the third zombie that comes to you 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.170
 It is usually a flying one that usually 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 come through the top 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.530
 normally normally then I 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.830
 I have to fit a little bit a little 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.830
 to that 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.740
 we are going to put you there so that you go 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.650
 when you see yourself as you see it comes by the 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.720
 top part 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.940
 I need this urgently 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.980
 the problem 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.270
 You have done well thanks 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.270
 thank you from the heart of truth 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.500
 let's see how I can do it 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.300
 you have to be proactive and about 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.580
 everything very fast you can not be taking 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.410
 too much to put your plants to see 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.970
 neither do you go to lolo 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.980
 metals but 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.660
 try not to waste too much time 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.670
 because and above all, look at many 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.950
 zombies that's something that I just 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.110
 is what they do not quite fail I will 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.420
 my ball and I usually do not notice 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.140
 too much in that many times if it's a 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.850
 mistake I've ever made with a 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.130
 quite often many times but 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.130
 Well, what are we going to do like this? 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.720
 then I will cover this part of today 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.720
 do not 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.630
 strips I did not want that anymore 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.340
 let's put that 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.340
 then the change then change it 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.870
 i 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.800
 OK 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.800
 I will save a little bit 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.690
 I'll save you because 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.360
 because you need to look like it does not but 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.020
 now it has become crazy to have seen that 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:08.480
 I say butter have become the 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.459
 rollers has gone crazy as a kid 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.510
 I'm going to put you to use the 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.510
 nutrients more than anything 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.519
 I have to fill that row if yes or 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:23.519
 Yeah come on 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.220
 I wanted to cover everything I can 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.220
 once 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.770

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.730
 wait to penetrate 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.740
 and less bad 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.879

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:23.599
