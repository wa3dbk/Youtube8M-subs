00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
if you want to kill glezos the boots of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920 
if you want to kill glezos the boots of
the<00:01:35.189> roots<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.670> lot<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.240> lot<00:01:36.360> less<00:01:36.750> in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the roots are a lot more a lot less in

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.510 
the roots are a lot more a lot less in
value<00:01:37.229> than<00:01:37.350> they<00:01:37.439> used<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.369> it's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
value than they used to be but it's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.490 
value than they used to be but it's
still<00:01:38.670> pretty<00:01:38.880> awesome<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:40.020> boots<00:01:40.229> can

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
still pretty awesome the boots can

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
still pretty awesome the boots can
obviously<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.070> get<00:01:41.189> double<00:01:41.490> steadfast<00:01:41.909> is

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
obviously if you get double steadfast is

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
obviously if you get double steadfast is
gonna<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> decent<00:01:42.630> amount<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.049> value<00:01:43.790> other

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
gonna be a decent amount of value other

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.859 
gonna be a decent amount of value other
than<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.119> don't<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.659> there's<00:01:45.840> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
than that I don't think there's that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
than that I don't think there's that
much<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> good<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.430> do

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
much that would be that good to do

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.310 
much that would be that good to do
