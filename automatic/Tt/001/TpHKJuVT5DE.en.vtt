about<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.190> same<00:01:29.340> time<00:01:29.580> I<00:01:29.640> was<00:01:29.910> also

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
about it but at the same time I was also

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.060 
about it but at the same time I was also
very<00:01:30.150> curious<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> where<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.650> would<00:01:31.770> start

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
very curious as to where we would start

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.510 
very curious as to where we would start
and<00:01:32.400> where<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.060> wanted<00:01:33.300> us<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> finish<00:01:33.660> out<00:01:33.870> I

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
and where they wanted us to finish out I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.890 
and where they wanted us to finish out I
mean<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> biggest<00:01:35.820> challenge<00:01:36.300> was<00:01:36.480> we<00:01:36.720> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
mean the biggest challenge was we you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
mean the biggest challenge was we you
know<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.140> needed<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.500> convince<00:01:37.770> Roman<00:01:38.220> sans<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
know we needed to convince Roman sans to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.150 
know we needed to convince Roman sans to
build<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.300> bike<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.840> us<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.230> thought<00:01:40.980> of

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
build this bike for us I thought of

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.130 
build this bike for us I thought of
bringing<00:01:41.520> over<00:01:41.820> some<00:01:41.940> sketches<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.630> him<00:01:42.810> but

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
bringing over some sketches to him but

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.540 
bringing over some sketches to him but
they're<00:01:43.290> not<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.830> know<00:01:43.860> we're<00:01:44.220> gonna<00:01:44.370> bring

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
they're not you know we're gonna bring

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.700 
they're not you know we're gonna bring
him<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.820> prototype<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.510> this<00:01:45.600> bike<00:01:45.930> one<00:01:46.560> week

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
him a prototype of this bike one week

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.410 
him a prototype of this bike one week
later<00:01:46.800> we<00:01:47.160> were<00:01:47.280> there<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.640> California<00:01:48.210> with<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
later we were there in California with a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.690 
later we were there in California with a
bike<00:01:48.660> and<00:01:48.900> you<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.050> started<00:01:49.590> doing<00:01:49.710> burnouts

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
bike and you just started doing burnouts

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.910 
bike and you just started doing burnouts
in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.120> yards<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.660> then<00:01:51.990> he<00:01:52.080> came<00:01:52.260> back<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
in the yards and then he came back and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920 
in the yards and then he came back and
his<00:01:53.310> eyes<00:01:53.490> were<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:53.940> beaming<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.780> was

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
his eyes were just beaming and that was

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.320 
his eyes were just beaming and that was
it<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.410> was<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.590> such<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.010> spectacular<00:01:56.340> crazy

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
it it was just such a spectacular crazy

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.870 
it it was just such a spectacular crazy
moment<00:01:57.900> in<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.140> project<00:02:00.860> with<00:02:01.860> what<00:02:02.100> BMW<00:02:02.370> has

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
moment in this project with what BMW has

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
moment in this project with what BMW has
going<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.330> it's<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.660> whole<00:02:03.870> new<00:02:04.020> level<00:02:04.200> of

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
going on it's like a whole new level of

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.950 
going on it's like a whole new level of
design<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.310> we're<00:02:06.150> looking<00:02:06.360> at<00:02:06.450> incredibly

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
design and we're looking at incredibly

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.750 
design and we're looking at incredibly
reliable<00:02:07.200> bikes<00:02:07.650> paired<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.369> beautiful

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
reliable bikes paired with beautiful

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:21.620 
reliable bikes paired with beautiful
functioning<00:02:09.240> form

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.060 

what<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.660> really<00:02:22.960> love<00:02:23.200> about<00:02:23.230> motorcycle

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
what I really love about motorcycle

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.730 
what I really love about motorcycle
design<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.300> get<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.630> design<00:02:25.930> every

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
design is that you get to design every

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.710 
design is that you get to design every
bit<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> piece<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.610> bike<00:02:27.820> but<00:02:28.360> that's<00:02:28.540> also

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
bit a piece of the bike but that's also

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.420 
bit a piece of the bike but that's also
the<00:02:28.990> challenging<00:02:29.560> bit<00:02:29.740> because<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.220> got<00:02:30.340> to

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the challenging bit because you got to

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.910 
the challenging bit because you got to
understand<00:02:30.970> every<00:02:31.870> piece<00:02:32.320> a<00:02:32.350> bit<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.830> the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
understand every piece a bit of the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.360 
understand every piece a bit of the
motorcycle<00:02:34.800> when<00:02:35.800> you're<00:02:35.890> working<00:02:36.190> on<00:02:36.280> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
motorcycle when you're working on the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.310 
motorcycle when you're working on the
motor<00:02:36.550> you're<00:02:37.420> gonna<00:02:37.540> know<00:02:37.780> what<00:02:37.930> goes<00:02:38.140> on

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
motor you're gonna know what goes on

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.930 
motor you're gonna know what goes on
inside<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.010> otherwise<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.490> can't<00:02:39.730> really

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
inside of it otherwise you can't really

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.380 
inside of it otherwise you can't really
design<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.570> in<00:02:40.720> an<00:02:40.840> honest<00:02:41.170> way<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:42.390> that's

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
design it in an honest way and that's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.780 
design it in an honest way and that's
the<00:02:43.660> quality<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.110> see<00:02:44.490> within<00:02:45.490> my<00:02:45.730> team

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.520 

what<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.820> think<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:52.270> interesting<00:02:52.840> with<00:02:53.410> this

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
what I think is interesting with this

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.890 
what I think is interesting with this
motorcycle<00:02:53.920> somehow<00:02:54.820> it<00:02:54.940> also<00:02:55.120> reflects<00:02:55.840> the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
motorcycle somehow it also reflects the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.950 
motorcycle somehow it also reflects the
spirit<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.860> design<00:02:57.160> studio<00:02:57.900> because<00:02:58.900> a

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
spirit in the design studio because a

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.570 
spirit in the design studio because a
lot<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.320> people<00:02:59.620> out<00:02:59.770> there<00:02:59.800> to<00:03:00.160> think<00:03:00.400> that

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
lot of people out there to think that

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.700 
lot of people out there to think that
we're<00:03:00.790> like<00:03:01.000> like<00:03:01.810> these<00:03:02.020> super<00:03:02.440> clean-cut

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
we're like like these super clean-cut

creates motorcycles in a magical kind of
way<00:03:11.560> yeah<00:03:11.890> on<00:03:12.040> one<00:03:12.250> hand<00:03:12.460> it<00:03:12.580> might<00:03:12.700> be<00:03:12.850> true

Sasha killer Park when people think
about<00:03:57.230> BMW<00:03:57.950> they<00:03:58.520> usually<00:03:58.700> think<00:03:59.060> about

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
about BMW they usually think about

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.110 
about BMW they usually think about
precision<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.440> function<00:04:00.980> which<00:04:01.850> is<00:04:02.000> also

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
precision and function which is also

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.610 
precision and function which is also
correct<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:02.750> mean<00:04:02.780> we're<00:04:03.020> always<00:04:03.170> at<00:04:03.500> the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
correct I mean we're always at the

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.680 
correct I mean we're always at the
cutting<00:04:04.040> edge<00:04:04.160> pushing<00:04:04.640> innovation<00:04:05.360> that's

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
cutting edge pushing innovation that's

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.050 
cutting edge pushing innovation that's
our<00:04:05.900> thing<00:04:06.200> but<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.490> bike<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.850> bit

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
our thing but this bike is a bit

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.200 
our thing but this bike is a bit
different<00:04:08.240> this<00:04:08.810> bike<00:04:09.080> is<00:04:09.260> about<00:04:09.790> heart<00:04:10.790> and

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
different this bike is about heart and

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.280 
different this bike is about heart and
soul<00:04:11.570> and<00:04:11.960> Garage<00:04:12.920> Spirit<00:04:13.520> this<00:04:14.120> bike<00:04:14.390> is<00:04:14.660> all

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
soul and Garage Spirit this bike is all

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.390 
soul and Garage Spirit this bike is all
about<00:04:15.980> emotion<00:04:17.680> what<00:04:18.680> I<00:04:18.710> really<00:04:19.220> like<00:04:19.370> about

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
about emotion what I really like about

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.290 
about emotion what I really like about
this<00:04:19.820> bike<00:04:20.030> is<00:04:20.270> that<00:04:20.300> mix<00:04:21.080> between<00:04:21.500> old

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
this bike is that mix between old

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.740 
this bike is that mix between old
classic<00:04:23.300> style<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.810> new<00:04:24.790> technology<00:04:25.790> like

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
classic style and new technology like

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.720 
classic style and new technology like
the<00:04:26.870> bodywork<00:04:27.290> is<00:04:27.500> very<00:04:27.800> simple<00:04:28.220> very<00:04:28.340> clean

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
the bodywork is very simple very clean

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.180 
the bodywork is very simple very clean
it<00:04:29.150> really<00:04:29.630> captures<00:04:30.140> that<00:04:30.350> pureness<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:31.040> our

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
it really captures that pureness of our

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.530 
it really captures that pureness of our
own<00:04:31.250> ideas<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.850> then<00:04:32.060> we<00:04:32.150> have<00:04:32.300> all<00:04:32.420> the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
own ideas and then we have all the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.360 
own ideas and then we have all the
technology<00:04:32.870> where<00:04:33.470> everything<00:04:34.040> is<00:04:34.160> just

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
technology where everything is just

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.970 
technology where everything is just
littered<00:04:34.940> with<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.810> best<00:04:36.110> parts<00:04:36.470> you<00:04:36.590> can<00:04:36.800> get

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
littered with the best parts you can get

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.150 
littered with the best parts you can get
that<00:04:37.190> really<00:04:37.520> speaks<00:04:37.850> high-performance<00:04:39.160> when

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
that really speaks high-performance when

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.070 
that really speaks high-performance when
BMW<00:04:40.430> came<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.150> us<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:41.480> said<00:04:41.540> they<00:04:41.720> wanted<00:04:41.990> to

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
BMW came to us and said they wanted to

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.710 
BMW came to us and said they wanted to
do<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.380> r9<00:04:42.560> yes<00:04:42.980> homage<00:04:43.910> bike<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.540> was<00:04:44.690> a

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
do the r9 yes homage bike it was a

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.450 
do the r9 yes homage bike it was a
really<00:04:44.990> big<00:04:45.140> project<00:04:45.380> just<00:04:45.830> in<00:04:45.950> general<00:04:46.310> but

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
really big project just in general but

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.790 
really big project just in general but
we<00:04:47.090> really<00:04:47.390> attacked<00:04:47.720> it<00:04:47.900> from<00:04:47.930> both<00:04:48.230> ends<00:04:48.500> so

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
we really attacked it from both ends so

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.890 
we really attacked it from both ends so
it<00:04:49.070> was<00:04:49.220> not<00:04:49.430> only<00:04:49.580> aesthetically<00:04:50.180> correct

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
it was not only aesthetically correct

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.170 
it was not only aesthetically correct
but<00:04:51.620> then<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:51.920> fully<00:04:52.160> functional<00:04:52.670> aspect<00:04:53.060> of

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
but then the fully functional aspect of

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.320 
but then the fully functional aspect of
it<00:04:53.300> as<00:04:53.390> well<00:04:53.570> all<00:04:54.200> of<00:04:54.260> us<00:04:54.500> had<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.710> same<00:04:55.010> vision

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
it as well all of us had the same vision

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.540 
it as well all of us had the same vision
which<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.360> pretty<00:04:56.660> I<00:04:56.930> think<00:04:57.410> unique<00:04:57.860> when<00:04:58.430> you

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
which is pretty I think unique when you

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.130 
which is pretty I think unique when you
when<00:04:58.760> you<00:04:58.850> pull<00:04:59.030> people<00:04:59.330> from<00:04:59.570> such<00:04:59.930> different

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
when you pull people from such different

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.620 
when you pull people from such different
parts<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.800> world<00:05:00.950> together<00:05:01.510> but<00:05:02.510> I<00:05:02.540> think

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
parts of the world together but I think

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:10.830 
parts of the world together but I think
that<00:05:02.930> really<00:05:03.200> shows<00:05:03.260> an<00:05:03.620> end<00:05:03.770> result

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.920 

I<00:05:13.380> think<00:05:14.380> for<00:05:14.530> me<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.680> motorcycle<00:05:15.160> is<00:05:15.930> easily

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
I think for me a motorcycle is easily

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.189 
I think for me a motorcycle is easily
the<00:05:17.050> purest<00:05:17.910> execution<00:05:18.910> of<00:05:19.030> an<00:05:19.120> idea<00:05:19.479> it's<00:05:20.020> all

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
the purest execution of an idea it's all

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.780 
the purest execution of an idea it's all
exposed<00:05:20.620> you<00:05:20.889> know<00:05:20.979> the<00:05:21.190> engine<00:05:21.460> is<00:05:21.520> all<00:05:21.610> out

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
exposed you know the engine is all out

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.600 
exposed you know the engine is all out
there<00:05:22.030> every<00:05:22.680> mechanical<00:05:23.680> piece<00:05:23.949> is<00:05:24.250> is

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
there every mechanical piece is is

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.600 
there every mechanical piece is is
exposed<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.479> world<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:26.580> you<00:05:27.580> really

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
exposed to the world and you really

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.129 
exposed to the world and you really
can't<00:05:28.000> hide<00:05:28.240> bad<00:05:28.479> design<00:05:28.870> with<00:05:29.050> the

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
can't hide bad design with the

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.920 
can't hide bad design with the
motorcycle<00:05:29.740> it's<00:05:29.949> all<00:05:30.070> right<00:05:30.250> there<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.930> really

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
motorcycle it's all right there I really

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.300 
motorcycle it's all right there I really
get<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.080> lot<00:05:32.229> of<00:05:32.320> satisfaction<00:05:32.470> out<00:05:33.070> of<00:05:33.100> making

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
get a lot of satisfaction out of making

00:05:33.310 --> 00:06:35.140 
get a lot of satisfaction out of making
that<00:05:33.490> work

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:54.679 

and

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:54.689 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:07:12.050 

you
