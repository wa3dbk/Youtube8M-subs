00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.110
 hello to everyone here ashton and this 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.510
 video we will talk about the weekly update of 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.270
 this week Thursday as usual 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.800
 lapt has come out so let's see 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.119
 what brings us back 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.480
 bungee of what it actually speaks to us 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.790
 all the update is vaguely concentrated 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.570
 precisely on what will come with the 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:38.260
 peace of late February said baretto 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.540
 Gospel above says that the update takes place 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.920
 he hopes to arrive by the end of February 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.140
 could slip a little depending on 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.680
 how much they bring us to complete precisely 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.120
 the various finishes, however, he is confident 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.790
 finally this point too I am 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.550
 confident that it arrives just a week 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.900
 next with the various changes mentioned 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.510
 we have already spoken in the past 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.770
 weeks and precisely we hope because there 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.250
 are some things that really me 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.369
 interest and first of all the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.630
 upgrade to pulse guns instead 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.400
 from impulses he talked about it week 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.890
 last are really useless now like 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.320
 now there is never a real reason for 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.630
 choose them I personally choose to 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.640
 use the red death at the expense of give i 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.409
 stronger because I simply like it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.930
 a lot with 10 percent more than 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.570
 damage will certainly be stronger 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.520
 therefore more palatable in any way 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.500
 these things from last week in the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.909
 this week's plate the most 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.680
 important is the match making for the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.450
 for weekly pearls this means that 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.340
 the weekly heroes than the level ones 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.970
 3 no 28 28 30 miseno to 30 now sorry 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.990
 for for the various coins etcetera 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.299
 from now on they can no longer be 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.460
 made by yourself there will be matchmaking 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.380
 so it will be kind of a rock e 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.690
 we'll talk about this later because 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.900
 I would like to hear your opinion 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.700
 in any case, just like rock 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.570
 select the playlist and go to 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.830
 do the weekly magazines and this 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.200
 in my opinion it will bring problems but 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.120
 anyway we'll talk about it after that 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.040
 which honestly everyone asks and 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.920
 will also arrive for nightfall and for 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.420
 raids the answer is no for nightfall 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.010
 simply because if there is white 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.610
 of the team returns to john orbit 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.390
 holmes making so we say for them 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.709
 it wouldn't make too much sense and honestly 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.560
 also for me we say that I am in 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:37.519
 general line favorable match making 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.580
 on these playlists only if it also remains 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.860
 the option of being able to do it yourself because 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.030
 to be for strength but if in team with 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.070
 people who don't know or seed 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.280
 would also pass because then how 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:54.560
 we know in the various in the various rock 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.959
 there's a lot of people in the avant-garde 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.090
 that goes into the game does nothing and yes 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.230
 pecks the reward but honestly doesn't 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.680
 we can therefore precisely talk about it later but 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.190
 for the raid instead no to give instead 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.360
 anything 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.790
 and also for the raid they said that not 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.100
 the match making will come because 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.260
 they want it to remain a challenge for i 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.840
 players 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.939
 that they must communicate not knowing 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.370
 play together if so here so on 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.319
 in match making for iphone that 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.819
 will prevent the only for the weekly heroes 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.900
 that therefore those that milan coins it 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.730
 I repeat now some other tweaks in reality 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.640
 little thing 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:39.379
 apparently ksouri will bring it after the birth 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.530
 always the exotic gs as you often know e 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.909
 gladly exor arrives on the tower that 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.810
 he knows practically nothing about 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.890
 interesting and let's say you encrypt it 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.510
 give you one more chance of 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.640
 get something for that week 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.109
 with the fact that often not willingly 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.000
 I see above all in the last few weeks 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.099
 on rare it has become totally useless 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.360
 so much so that I had accumulated more than 200 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.550
 coins that was ridiculous and 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.540
 after the peace that will support the 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.910
 in g now I hope because in the in the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.070
 database s ii there are also the in g 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.110
 exotic for the weapons that stop 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.290
 sell only in exotic g for pearls 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.549
 class and how I see it south or not 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.440
 should exist or sell 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.860
 alone and in large exotic in this way 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.260
 there would be no problem with the ho 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.700
 found now remains mentioned icebreaker 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.640
 and everyone buys icebreakers and so on 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.300
 there is a minimum of variety 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.190
 obviously then this is my idea 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.960
 I am clearly curious to know what 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.590
 do you think but you know how I feel about it 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.860
 xuren spoke now is another one 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.990
 other change is on the playlists either 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.990
 in the crucible that glee is that neither the 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.030
 strike and it happens very often 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.740
 unfortunately the maps are repeated also 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.350
 three or four times in a row he has 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.640
 ridiculous and also because for example 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.840
 making installments of the avant-garde is not 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.090
 want to do four times in a row 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.770
 omni cool because it lasts a long time 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.410
 obviously it's not even with a strike 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.700
 so fun and beautiful and this is it 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.550
 apparently it will never happen again 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:11.560
 This in my opinion we need to step 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.500
 more and let us choose which strife 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.060
 make a sort of choice as the next 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.290
 maps during the mythical match 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.440
 during the wait etc. 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.120
 so I surely would have known more 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.740
 interesting in my opinion less 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.540
 frustrating also because really now 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.050
 as it is wrong now but this is a step 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.990
 forward 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:32.830
 in addition there will be new new sizes e 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.719
 more maps for red and iron nardÃ² 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.669
 and good luck not 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:40.259
 now the iron scenario is fine for 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.090
 now he broke my balls 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:47.009
 I reached level 5 and I don't have any 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:49.529
 really more than desire to play and more 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.749
 or less low in reality this was almost 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:52.979
 all the weekly updates were there at the end 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:55.949
 some videos of the community 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.689
 there was a video of that little boy he is 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.699
 was found by a person who has 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.599
 deleted all the characters then you are 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:06.689
 put to cry the thing is enough 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:09.840
 sad is or is not useful to say how 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:11.939
 as news it is simply a last 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.659
 what came out I don't know how 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:18.180
 sincerely the images of the complexes 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.310
 the next was a banner and they will be 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.210
 hammer of gilles de rinaldis imar now 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.699
 the wrath of sili mar 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:28.589
 has a great perfect ability so if you 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:30.689
 you have the opportunity next month to 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:33.169
 have a banner renewed, take it 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:35.639
 because it can be can be fun 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.259
 as a weapon, the wrath of yes but can be 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.000
 also strong with this traffic act 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.699
 let's say it's worth it like having a 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.050
 epilogue of atheist, however, to 331 without 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.680
 motorcycle alanine but that's all another 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.870
 speech 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.310
 so for today's video it's all if 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.509
 I liked the institutes released 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.759
 online that seems to sign up 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:53.219
 see you in the next video that 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.990
 probably will be on the recap of the rom 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:55.480
 bank because I personally have finished 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.240
 not 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.640
 I no longer intend to play on pp 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.380
 for pre I arrived at level 5 taken 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.860
 all that interested me and then 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.730
 closed simply because the lag 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.110
 especially this week it was 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.760
 indecent 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.900
 so see you in the next video 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.900
 good hunt guardians hello
