00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the lens Distortion

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060 
the lens Distortion
there<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.480> some<00:00:27.689> vignetting<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.920> also

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
there is some vignetting but also

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.620 
there is some vignetting but also
because<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> photograph<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.179> building

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
because I photograph this building

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.139 
because I photograph this building
close-up<00:00:31.380> I'm<00:00:31.980> kind<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.250> at<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> low<00:00:32.579> angle<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
close-up I'm kind of at a low angle and

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.450 
close-up I'm kind of at a low angle and
I'm<00:00:33.239> using<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.600> wide<00:00:33.780> lens<00:00:34.050> I've<00:00:35.010> ended<00:00:35.190> up<00:00:35.309> with

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
I'm using a wide lens I've ended up with

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.010 
I'm using a wide lens I've ended up with
some<00:00:35.610> perspective<00:00:36.149> distortion<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.870> this

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
some perspective distortion on this

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.680 
some perspective distortion on this
building<00:00:37.410> or<00:00:37.800> quite<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> bit<00:00:38.280> actually<00:00:38.570> and<00:00:39.570> if

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
building or quite a bit actually and if

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.270 
building or quite a bit actually and if
you<00:00:39.809> remember<00:00:40.079> back<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.680> crop<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> rotate

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you remember back in the crop and rotate

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
you remember back in the crop and rotate
video<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.030> mentioned<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.750> I'd<00:00:42.870> come<00:00:43.079> back<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
video I mentioned that I'd come back and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.840 
video I mentioned that I'd come back and
look<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.649> keystoning<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.760> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
look at keystoning because this is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.400 
look at keystoning because this is
something<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.329> use<00:00:45.660> often<00:00:46.020> in

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
something that I use often in

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.860 
something that I use often in
combination<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:47.010> lens<00:00:47.399> correction<00:00:48.059> so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
combination with lens correction so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.200 
combination with lens correction so
let's<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.289> how<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:50.090> I'm<00:00:51.090> going

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
let's just see how I do that I'm going

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.580 
let's just see how I do that I'm going
to<00:00:51.300> start<00:00:51.480> off<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.050> defaults<00:00:52.530> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
to start off with just the defaults and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.430 
to start off with just the defaults and
lens<00:00:52.829> correction<00:00:53.149> turn<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.320> right

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
lens correction turn it on and right

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
lens correction turn it on and right
away<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.250> made<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.550> subtle

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
away you can see it's made that subtle

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.400 
away you can see it's made that subtle
change<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> nice<00:00:57.570> one<00:00:57.809> fix<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.260> lens

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
change but a nice one fix the lens

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.220 
change but a nice one fix the lens
distortion<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.609> vignette<00:00:59.910> Ian<00:01:00.230> I'm

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
distortion and the vignette Ian I'm

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.720 
distortion and the vignette Ian I'm
gonna<00:01:01.410> come<00:01:01.620> back<00:01:01.710> over<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> basic<00:01:02.579> group

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
gonna come back over to the basic group

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.990 
gonna come back over to the basic group
here<00:01:03.229> come<00:01:04.229> down<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.500> crop<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.860> rotate<00:01:05.000> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
here come down to crop and rotate and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.969 
here come down to crop and rotate and
under<00:01:06.240> Keystone<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:07.200> gonna<00:01:07.470> choose<00:01:07.710> vertical

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
under Keystone I'm gonna choose vertical

I line it up with a part of the image

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.030 
I line it up with a part of the image
that<00:01:21.000> should<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.540> straight<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.080> isn't<00:01:22.470> needs

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
that should be straight but isn't needs

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.859 
that should be straight but isn't needs
a<00:01:23.159> reference<00:01:23.520> point<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.509> I'm<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> use

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
a reference point so I'm going to use

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.530 
a reference point so I'm going to use
these<00:01:25.020> columns<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.920> side<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.640> then

these columns here on this side and then

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.640 
these columns here on this side and then
I'll<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> same<00:01:28.080> thing<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> other

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
I'll do the same thing with the other

I'll do the same thing with the other
side<00:01:28.950> click<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.090> drag<00:01:32.329> bring<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> over<00:01:33.780> it

might<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:34.710> perfect<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.400> pretty

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
might not be perfect but it's pretty

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.819 
might not be perfect but it's pretty

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
close when you have things lined up and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.499 
close when you have things lined up and
you<00:01:37.890> think<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.220> ready<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.490> go<00:01:38.700> now<00:01:39.210> there's

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.850 
you think you're ready to go now there's
a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:39.659> okay<00:01:39.869> button<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> middle<00:01:40.710> it's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
a little okay button in the middle it's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.460 
a little okay button in the middle it's
sometimes<00:01:41.250> difficult<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.759> see<00:01:42.140> but<00:01:43.140> click<00:01:43.350> on

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
sometimes difficult to see but click on

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.990 
sometimes difficult to see but click on
that<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.340> should<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> really

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that and you should see a really

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.639 
that and you should see a really
dramatic<00:01:45.119> shift<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.470> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
dramatic shift here and it really is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.170 
dramatic shift here and it really is
that's<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> big<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> notice<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that's a big one so you notice that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.760 
that's a big one so you notice that
everything's<00:01:48.630> straightened<00:01:48.990> out<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.409> this

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
everything's straightened out now this

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.139 
everything's straightened out now this
is<00:01:49.950> what<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> building<00:01:50.340> actually<00:01:50.729> looks<00:01:50.939> like

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
is what the building actually looks like

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.850 
is what the building actually looks like
the<00:01:51.390> lines<00:01:51.600> are<00:01:51.810> straight<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the lines are straight and so on and

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.789 
the lines are straight and so on and
it's<00:01:53.369> actually<00:01:53.670> sucked<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.090> those<00:01:54.270> pixels<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
it's actually sucked in those pixels to

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.920 
it's actually sucked in those pixels to
correct<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.189> perspective<00:01:56.700> distortion<00:01:56.930> so

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
correct that perspective distortion so

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.020 
correct that perspective distortion so
we<00:01:58.020> do<00:01:58.140> lose<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.500> fair<00:01:58.860> bit<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> image<00:01:59.219> but

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
we do lose a fair bit of the image but

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.670 
we do lose a fair bit of the image but
on<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> bonus<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> end<00:02:00.930> up<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> proper

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
on the bonus you end up with a proper

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.580 
on the bonus you end up with a proper
perspective<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> building<00:02:03.469> so<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.530> we

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
perspective on the building so if we

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.870 
perspective on the building so if we
actually<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:04.950> went<00:02:05.130> back<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.610> kind<00:02:05.729> of

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
actually just went back and just kind of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.310 
actually just went back and just kind of
saw<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.149> difference<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.930> when<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> first

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
saw that difference this is when I first

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.619 
saw that difference this is when I first
opened<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.910> this<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.060> after<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.420> lens

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
opened it up this is after the lens

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.420 
opened it up this is after the lens
correction<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:10.500> fix<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.860> distortion

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
correction and we fix that distortion

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.640 
correction and we fix that distortion
and<00:02:11.670> vignetting<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.360> then<00:02:12.930> afterwards<00:02:13.379> with

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and vignetting and then afterwards with

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.790 
and vignetting and then afterwards with
the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.890 
the
keystoning<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.550> crop<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.880> rotate<00:02:14.970> very

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
keystoning and crop and rotate very

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.960 
keystoning and crop and rotate very
dramatic<00:02:16.380> change<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.920> I've<00:02:17.160> really<00:02:17.430> fixed

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
dramatic change and I've really fixed

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.520 
dramatic change and I've really fixed
the<00:02:18.060> perspective<00:02:18.540> distortion<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:19.200> that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the perspective distortion on that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.860 
the perspective distortion on that
building
