00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.770
 and that trap of entry to use for 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.470
 gain time was your goal or the 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.029
 objective was cc in any way 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.330
 I have to ensure the safety of 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.330
 new 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.230
 turn 'the and look here slowly 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.930
 you in a moment like that maybe you do not listen 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.829
 zero 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.079
 I told you to turn slowly 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.289
 was my merciless assassin to Japanese 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.500
 innocent to a woman like her I'm going to 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.570
 say a convenient power the stew you 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.199
 you hide in the shade and all the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.089
 responsibility falls on others 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.339
 arrogant and despicable so is your 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.039
 True identity 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.470
 cullen you also want to know the 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:08.690
 zero identity 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.190
 but what nonsense says you also have 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.190
 right to witness the truth 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
 Y 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.299
 I can not believe it 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.970
 that's right i'm 0 led the order of the 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.970
 black knights against the sacrum 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.200
 British empire and eventually I will be 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.200
 who dominates the whole world 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.420
 using Japanese people 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.109
 if you look at it from a perspective 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.109
 objective Japan is going to be released too 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.250
 I should have arrested him before 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.330
 you discovered I did not want to believe it always 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.130
 I denied for that reason because I believed in you 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.230
 but you only lie to me 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.620
 even to no nose and not deserved 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.300
 kidnapped that your resources could 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.210
 agree a momentary truce 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.600
 I hope you can help us shelter one year 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.620
 there's nothing we can not do together 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.320
 you are naive you should have cooperated 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.950
 with the fi if you had joined forces 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.930
 with him and the world is in the past all 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.840
 the past is over 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.770
 Maybe it was not you who killed his father 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.750
 Repent as much as you want more 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.900
 late you will not do it he had to betray 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.670
 to the world even at the end of the world you 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.500
 betrayed his wishes should not be fulfilled 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.520
 stupid the world is not based just by 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.350
 ideals 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.650
 let's shoot me if that's your wish 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.510
 I feel the liquid over saturated 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.750
 will explode if my heart stops 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.060
 it will be our final shusaku of equal 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.890
 way I propose a deal to you who was 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.989
 Who told you about the chalk that has made you 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.390
 that person no one is now those things 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.239
 it has nothing to do with you 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.730
 existence is a simple mistake you're not 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.790
 part of this world and I 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.790
 I will save you I will not do it alone with light 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.560
 but 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.700
 mosaics and one of the losses in the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.900
 mistakes 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.900
 we have committed 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.220
 I could 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.220
 I wish it were just a dream 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.870
 but 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.870
 In return 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.410
 i 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.039
 the topics 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.610
 Everytime that
