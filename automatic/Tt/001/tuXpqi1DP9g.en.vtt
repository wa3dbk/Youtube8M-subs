capture now mo has been in the business
of<00:00:13.889> doing<00:00:14.190> motion<00:00:14.639> capture<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.660> I'm<00:00:15.750> sure

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
of doing motion capture and I'm sure

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.810 
of doing motion capture and I'm sure
you've<00:00:16.080> seen<00:00:16.260> 3d<00:00:16.740> video<00:00:17.010> games<00:00:17.310> which<00:00:17.640> have

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
you've seen 3d video games which have

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.400 
you've seen 3d video games which have
characters<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.510> move<00:00:18.690> very<00:00:18.869> realistically

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
characters that move very realistically

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.189

video<00:00:26.669> games<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:27.060> all<00:00:27.210> made<00:00:27.539> using<00:00:28.079> what's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
video games are all made using what's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.069 
video games are all made using what's
called<00:00:28.949> marker<00:00:29.609> based<00:00:29.789> motion<00:00:30.150> capture<00:00:30.539> and

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
called marker based motion capture and

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.659 
called marker based motion capture and
these<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:31.259> some<00:00:31.499> markers<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.279> use<00:00:32.490> we

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
these are some markers that we use we

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.790 
these are some markers that we use we
put<00:00:32.880> them<00:00:33.030> actually<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.570> outfits<00:00:34.530> at<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
put them actually on the outfits at the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.220 
put them actually on the outfits at the
actors<00:00:35.160> wear<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> then<00:00:35.670> use<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> camera<00:00:36.990> like

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
actors wear and then use a camera like

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.640 
actors wear and then use a camera like
this<00:00:37.520> which<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.940> ring<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.600> LEDs<00:00:40.110> around<00:00:40.470> it

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
this which has a ring of LEDs around it

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.500 
this which has a ring of LEDs around it
it<00:00:40.830> shines<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.250> light<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.850> markers<00:00:42.330> and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it shines a light at the markers and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
it shines a light at the markers and
makes<00:00:43.260> them<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.620> very<00:00:43.890> bright<00:00:44.100> when<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
makes them very very bright when the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000 
makes them very very bright when the
camera<00:00:44.700> sees<00:00:44.910> them<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.440> then<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.620> picks<00:00:46.860> up

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
camera sees them and then it picks up

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.670 
camera sees them and then it picks up
those<00:00:47.400> dots<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.970> space<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.380> connect

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
those dots in space and then we connect

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.290 
those dots in space and then we connect
them<00:00:49.800> together<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.220> make<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.490> skeleton<00:00:51.090> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
them together to make a skeleton and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.180 
them together to make a skeleton and
from<00:00:51.900> that<00:00:52.080> we're<00:00:52.320> able<00:00:52.470> to<00:00:52.590> animate<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
from that we're able to animate a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160 
from that we're able to animate a
three-dimensional<00:00:54.000> character<00:00:54.450> now<00:00:54.990> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
three-dimensional character now that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.840 
three-dimensional character now that
works<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.680> good<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.310> skeletal

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
works really really good for skeletal

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.150 
works really really good for skeletal
motion<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.570> got<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.780> arm<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.710> body

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
motion if you got an arm or a body

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.820 
motion if you got an arm or a body
motion<00:00:59.700> and<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:01.290> doesn't<00:01:01.560> work<00:01:01.620> so

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
motion and so on what doesn't work so

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.990 
motion and so on what doesn't work so
well<00:01:01.860> for<00:01:02.040> is<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.610> you're<00:01:02.730> trying<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
well for is when you're trying to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.630 
well for is when you're trying to
capture<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.450> deformable<00:01:04.140> surface<00:01:04.739> something

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
capture a deformable surface something

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
capture a deformable surface something
like<00:01:05.759> your<00:01:05.939> face<00:01:06.210> where<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> skin<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.110> smooth

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
like your face where the skin is smooth

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.300 
like your face where the skin is smooth
or<00:01:08.039> your<00:01:08.159> neck<00:01:08.399> for<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:10.950> end<00:01:11.159> up

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
or your neck for that you really end up

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.399 
or your neck for that you really end up
doing<00:01:11.609> a<00:01:11.700> lot<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.179> using<00:01:12.509> hand<00:01:12.840> animation

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
doing a lot of it using hand animation

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
doing a lot of it using hand animation
and<00:01:13.649> trying<00:01:14.219> to<00:01:14.340> make<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.579> look<00:01:14.670> real<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:14.939> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and trying to make it look real and it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.719 
and trying to make it look real and it
never<00:01:15.420> quite<00:01:15.689> looks<00:01:16.049> real<00:01:16.289> contro<00:01:17.249> reality

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
never quite looks real contro reality

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.969 
never quite looks real contro reality

show<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> how<00:01:39.359> it<00:01:39.539> works<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:40.249> contour<00:01:41.249> capture

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
show you how it works a contour capture

variety<00:01:47.939> type<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.630> makeup<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.679> picked<00:01:49.889> up

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
variety type of makeup this we picked up

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.279 
variety type of makeup this we picked up
at<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> Halloween<00:01:50.579> store<00:01:50.609> it's<00:01:51.479> phosphorescent

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
at a Halloween store it's phosphorescent

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:53.449 
at a Halloween store it's phosphorescent
make<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.619> kind<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.950> glows<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.369> dark

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
make it the kind of glows in the dark

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.690 
make it the kind of glows in the dark
and<00:01:53.909> what<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.929> do<00:01:55.109> is<00:01:55.139> typically<00:01:55.649> mix<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.159> with

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
and what we do is typically mix it with

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.760 
and what we do is typically mix it with
a<00:01:56.729> little<00:01:56.819> bit<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.149> base<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.780> we've<00:01:58.200> done<00:01:58.409> here

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
a little bit of base as we've done here

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
a little bit of base as we've done here
that<00:01:59.219> matches<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> color<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.539> performer

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that matches the color of the performer

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.709 
that matches the color of the performer
and<00:02:01.229> then<00:02:02.069> we<00:02:02.219> sponge<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.029> onto<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> skin

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
and then we sponge it onto the skin

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.260 
and then we sponge it onto the skin
usually<00:02:03.990> using<00:02:04.499> exfoliating<00:02:05.219> sponge<00:02:05.549> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
usually using exfoliating sponge to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.330 
usually using exfoliating sponge to
create<00:02:06.569> a<00:02:06.779> random<00:02:07.439> pattern<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> skin

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
create a random pattern on the skin

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.419 
create a random pattern on the skin
wherever<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.270> we<00:02:09.450> want<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.959> capture

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
wherever it is we want to do the capture

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.209 
wherever it is we want to do the capture
in<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:11.269> case<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.659> cloth<00:02:12.379> what<00:02:12.769> we<00:02:12.859> typically

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:13.219 
in the case of cloth what we typically

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.819 
in the case of cloth what we typically
do<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.489> take<00:02:14.060> phosphorescent<00:02:14.719> powder<00:02:14.959> mix<00:02:15.709> it

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
do is take phosphorescent powder mix it

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.309 
do is take phosphorescent powder mix it
with<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> dye<00:02:16.219> and<00:02:16.579> then<00:02:17.060> spread<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.450> randomly

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
with a dye and then spread it randomly

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.309 
with a dye and then spread it randomly
along<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.920> cloth<00:02:19.159> and<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:20.359> is<00:02:20.870> all<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.290> need

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
along the cloth and that is all you need

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.039 
along the cloth and that is all you need
to<00:02:21.530> do<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.739> prepare<00:02:22.659> after<00:02:23.659> we<00:02:23.750> apply<00:02:23.989> the

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
to do to prepare after we apply the

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.380 
to do to prepare after we apply the
makeup<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.769> performer<00:02:25.340> we<00:02:25.909> place<00:02:26.180> her

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
makeup to the performer we place her

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.599 
makeup to the performer we place her
within<00:02:26.659> the<00:02:26.840> view<00:02:27.079> of<00:02:27.290> many<00:02:27.560> cameras<00:02:28.129> in<00:02:28.310> this

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.729 
within the view of many cameras in this
case<00:02:28.879> we<00:02:29.090> have<00:02:29.180> 44<00:02:29.750> all<00:02:30.019> looking<00:02:30.560> from

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
case we have 44 all looking from

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.979 
case we have 44 all looking from
different<00:02:31.040> angles<00:02:31.400> behind<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.359> cameras<00:02:32.810> are

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
something very different we have color

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.149 
something very different we have color

under<00:03:02.269> normal<00:03:02.419> lighting<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.709> then<00:03:03.859> we<00:03:03.950> have

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
under normal lighting but then we have

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.399 
under normal lighting but then we have
grayscale<00:03:04.909> cameras<00:03:05.419> which<00:03:05.629> only<00:03:05.870> open<00:03:06.290> their

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
flashing when the lights are off what do

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.759 
flashing when the lights are off what do
they<00:03:10.370> see<00:03:10.549> well<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.629> see<00:03:11.689> the<00:03:11.900> glow<00:03:12.260> that

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
they see well they see the glow that

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.619 
they see well they see the glow that
comes<00:03:12.829> from<00:03:13.219> that<00:03:13.400> phosphorescent<00:03:14.239> make<00:03:14.419> up

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
comes from that phosphorescent make up

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.140 
comes from that phosphorescent make up
that<00:03:14.989> we<00:03:15.109> put<00:03:15.290> all<00:03:15.470> over<00:03:15.739> her<00:03:15.889> face<00:03:15.919> and<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
that we put all over her face and the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.879 
that we put all over her face and the
phosphorescent<00:03:17.750> powder<00:03:17.959> we<00:03:18.229> put<00:03:18.440> within<00:03:18.650> her

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
phosphorescent powder we put within her

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.180 
phosphorescent powder we put within her
clothing<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.840> they<00:03:20.840> use<00:03:21.229> that<00:03:21.260> random

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
clothing and they use that random

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.699 
clothing and they use that random
pattern<00:03:22.609> to<00:03:23.000> align<00:03:23.419> each<00:03:23.599> other<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:24.409> go<00:03:24.530> and

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
pattern to align each other to go and

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.009 
pattern to align each other to go and
triangulate<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.489> find<00:03:25.760> out<00:03:25.939> what<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.689> 3d

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
triangulate to find out what the 3d

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.899 
triangulate to find out what the 3d
surface<00:03:27.349> looks<00:03:27.590> like<00:03:27.769> what<00:03:28.549> is<00:03:28.669> the<00:03:28.790> end

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
surface looks like what is the end

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.599 
surface looks like what is the end
result<00:03:29.299> well<00:03:30.049> if<00:03:30.349> we<00:03:30.979> were<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.129> use<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> marker

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
result well if we were to use a marker

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.640 
result well if we were to use a marker
based<00:03:31.970> capture<00:03:32.419> system<00:03:32.750> to<00:03:32.870> try<00:03:33.079> to<00:03:33.139> capture<00:03:33.470> a
