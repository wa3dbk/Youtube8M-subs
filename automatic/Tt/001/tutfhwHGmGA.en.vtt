00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.830
 Welcome to 23 Pakistan 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.490
 tutorial today we will now 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.470
 So recipe make easy recipe 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.019
 places, for example, went out of the way 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.720
 comes enchanted if you have three demant 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.580
 blocks to solve and it's easy 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.780
 I'm going to be outnumbered for that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.149
 Again, here I go now 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.200
 penultimate place is my new method 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.010
 is public cross creates what 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.250
 I make it limited between two times 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.610
 i web this method the city break the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.969
 press ap so that weapons themselves like that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.969
 for that it needed two svp 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.750
 he is technical raises us psn is it a 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.339
 to make a new recipe 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.490
 now it must come out a white 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.390
 it should be like a forward for st 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.110
 hiring up to now as one 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:21.210
 friday shows that this too 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.970
 is equal to three teams we give that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:32.280
 material to the krad make weeks ground 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:36.320
 a bit then modify that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.320
 again and now a bit like 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:48.600
 efficient against a very uncertain one 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:52.860
 dark suit and with a tie which 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:57.119
 hurt with it still Beck for example 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.560
 Whether Beck and Strength 100 it is a 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.540
 a little bit or ten is not too 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.270
 exaggerated and now makes it easy 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.140
 that stuff strength 10 opened up there and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.340
 that the final result prescription once the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.660
 ingredient he scores ingrid him now 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.660
 But put a recipe 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:32.010
 So it's defined as material 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.640
 point botha is equal to a bow from 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.030
 material 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.260
 now we can put the addition b 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.750
 yes we have to be careful that it 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.159
 just with these signs makes that would have 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.049
 to improve it, I really care 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:56.129
 right point what we write 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:03:00.599
 Now we just hold ourselves 30 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:05.069
 inventor prof and now could here 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:08.280
 be at air point 4.4 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.959
 Now you can say we like the recipe 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.250
 should be 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:19.519
 that could be in three lines and pay 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:22.560
 it has a total of 313 3 new 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:28.139
 I'm sure we're part of it 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:34.139
 above gww that is pure uppermost lines 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:39.720
 prof then b again a gps what 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:41.669
 all around what to hope for but 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.090
 with the bow you could chant 10 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:47.569
 on it and now one last need 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.599
 Of course, this method also the 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:58.020
 server point to add the recipe 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:04:00.810
 the recipe he in swr 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:05.510
 extreme angel and now easy 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.510
 men simply opened up the method 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:12.240
 display size and that was too late to sit 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.780
 Of course you have to do that in advance 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:33.030
 before we put the ingredients and stuff 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:39.530
 should it work discussed gms 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:43.650
 and bow and around the pros and 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:48.020
 sks is bent arrow gave up much 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.020
 is carried out by the arc towards 

00:04:53.079 --> 00:05:01.399
 You know what I mean as well as 

00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:04.699
 bread lohan will advance from 

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:06.529
 Zahnhals books are supposed to take today 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.169
 thank you for being me already 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.819
 hope you understand it even if I have the 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.629
