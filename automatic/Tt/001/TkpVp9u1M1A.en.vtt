the<00:00:49.920> fact<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> matter<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:52.020> whole

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the fact of the matter is is this whole

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.950 
the fact of the matter is is this whole
idea<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.559> DHA<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.579> DHA<00:00:53.670> are<00:00:54.300> ultimately<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
idea that DHA and DHA are ultimately the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.779 
idea that DHA and DHA are ultimately the
goal<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.320> why<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.590> need<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.770> omega<00:00:56.010> threes<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
goal of why we need to omega threes and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.389 
goal of why we need to omega threes and
they<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.149> critical<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:58.230> all<00:00:58.410> three<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.219> them

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
they are critical but all three of them

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
they are critical but all three of them
have<00:00:59.910> benefits<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> body<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
have benefits in the body it's just that

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.759 
have benefits in the body it's just that
certain<00:01:01.829> benefits<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.430> only<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.969> obtained<00:01:03.769> by

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
certain benefits can only be obtained by

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
certain benefits can only be obtained by
those<00:01:05.070> those<00:01:05.400> other<00:01:05.610> products<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.210> obviously

of<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.720> now<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> issue<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.920> run<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.340> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
of them now the issue we run into is

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.490 
of them now the issue we run into is
that<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.790> course<00:01:15.030> too<00:01:15.330> much<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> good<00:01:16.290> thing

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that of course too much of a good thing

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.929 
that of course too much of a good thing
can<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> bad<00:01:17.100> thing<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.490> there's<00:01:17.610> plenty<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
can be a bad thing and there's plenty of

health effects in the body not only

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.539 
health effects in the body not only
problems<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.619> blood<00:01:34.829> clotting<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.430> can

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
problems with blood clotting but it can

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.880 
problems with blood clotting but it can
compromise<00:01:35.909> immune<00:01:36.360> function<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.500> too<00:01:37.560> much

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
compromise immune function so too much

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.260 
compromise immune function so too much
of<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.280> bad<00:01:38.460> thing<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:38.729> there's<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.060> fine

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270

day<00:03:18.459> at<00:03:19.209> 40%<00:03:19.600> you're<00:03:20.139> gonna<00:03:20.260> get<00:03:20.500> tons<00:03:21.459> of<00:03:21.700> epa

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
day at 40% you're gonna get tons of epa

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.000 
day at 40% you're gonna get tons of epa
and<00:03:22.209> DHA<00:03:22.450> probably<00:03:23.230> more<00:03:23.620> than<00:03:23.769> you<00:03:23.889> actually

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
and DHA probably more than you actually

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.180 
and DHA probably more than you actually
need<00:03:24.400> for<00:03:24.430> optimal<00:03:24.940> help<00:03:25.090> at<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.389> point

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
need for optimal help at that point

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.559 
need for optimal help at that point
fantastic<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:27.700> but<00:03:27.940> what<00:03:28.060> they<00:03:28.150> find<00:03:28.329> is<00:03:28.480> those

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
fantastic so but what they find is those

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.750 
fantastic so but what they find is those
people<00:03:28.780> who<00:03:28.959> don't<00:03:29.290> eat<00:03:30.220> fish

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
people who don't eat fish

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.699 
people who don't eat fish
they<00:03:30.970> don't<00:03:31.180> supplement<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.079> add<00:03:32.200> fish<00:03:32.440> oil

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
they don't supplement and add fish oil

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.340 
they don't supplement and add fish oil
or<00:03:32.889> these<00:03:33.130> EPA<00:03:34.120> DHA<00:03:34.329> supplements<00:03:34.989> converted

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
or these EPA DHA supplements converted

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.250 
or these EPA DHA supplements converted
at<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.530> higher<00:03:35.680> rate<00:03:36.269> another<00:03:37.269> factor<00:03:37.780> is<00:03:37.959> your

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
at a higher rate another factor is your

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.530 
at a higher rate another factor is your
ratios<00:03:38.650> of<00:03:38.829> your<00:03:39.010> omega-3<00:03:39.639> and<00:03:39.760> omega-6<00:03:40.120> the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
ratios of your omega-3 and omega-6 the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.020 
ratios of your omega-3 and omega-6 the
LA<00:03:41.079> which<00:03:41.350> is<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.620> omega-6<00:03:42.040> uses<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.819> same

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
LA which is the omega-6 uses the same

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.059 
LA which is the omega-6 uses the same
pathways<00:03:43.569> in<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.810> body<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.230> convert<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.829> into

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
pathways in the body to convert it into

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.059 
pathways in the body to convert it into
other<00:03:45.510> longer<00:03:46.510> chain<00:03:46.750> omega-6<00:03:47.380> fatty<00:03:47.590> acids

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
other longer chain omega-6 fatty acids

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.819 
other longer chain omega-6 fatty acids
so<00:03:48.910> if<00:03:49.180> you're<00:03:49.329> eating<00:03:49.750> an<00:03:49.900> excessive<00:03:50.019> amount

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
so if you're eating an excessive amount

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.830 
so if you're eating an excessive amount
of<00:03:51.010> LA<00:03:51.489> which<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.180> can<00:03:52.329> actually<00:03:52.480> get<00:03:52.690> away

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
of LA which you can actually get away

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.870 
of LA which you can actually get away
with<00:03:53.139> even<00:03:53.290> four<00:03:53.650> or<00:03:53.680> five<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.190> one<00:03:54.340> ratios<00:03:54.760> and

with even four or five to one ratios and

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.559 
with even four or five to one ratios and
still<00:03:55.090> convert<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:56.130> ala<00:03:57.130> quite<00:03:57.489> well<00:03:57.790> but<00:03:58.510> a

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
still convert the ala quite well but a

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.750 
still convert the ala quite well but a
lot<00:03:58.870> of<00:03:58.900> Western<00:03:59.380> diets<00:03:59.709> are<00:03:59.829> extremely<00:04:00.579> high

lot of Western diets are extremely high

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.650 
lot of Western diets are extremely high

in omega-6 which is not necessarily

don't really want to try to tackle that
one<00:04:12.400> today<00:04:13.349> but<00:04:14.349> if<00:04:14.530> you're<00:04:14.680> keeping<00:04:14.889> that<00:04:15.190> at

one today but if you're keeping that at

one today but if you're keeping that at

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
is the one that you're converting

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.230 
is the one that you're converting

not<00:04:22.330> keeping<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.020> excessive<00:04:23.620> then<00:04:23.770> you're

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
not keeping it excessive then you're

a large amount of nuts you're probably

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:34.510 
a large amount of nuts you're probably

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
okay and if you're getting your Omega

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.330 
okay and if you're getting your Omega
threes<00:04:34.879> from<00:04:35.360> mixed<00:04:35.690> sources<00:04:36.310> such<00:04:37.310> as

cantaloupes or walnuts your ratios are
going<00:04:40.669> to<00:04:40.729> be<00:04:40.819> really<00:04:41.150> really<00:04:41.270> good<00:04:41.419> if<00:04:41.780> you're

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
going to be really really good if you're

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.059 
going to be really really good if you're
getting<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.229> lot<00:04:42.379> of<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.560> from<00:04:42.710> adding<00:04:42.919> some

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
getting a lot of it from adding some

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.350 
getting a lot of it from adding some
ground<00:04:43.250> flaxseed<00:04:43.729> in<00:04:43.879> your<00:04:44.000> diet<00:04:44.180> you're

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
ground flaxseed in your diet you're

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.790 
ground flaxseed in your diet you're
really<00:04:44.810> good<00:04:44.960> because<00:04:45.199> it<00:04:45.289> has<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.470> higher

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
really good because it has a higher

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.860 
really good because it has a higher
omega-3<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:46.669> omega-6<00:04:47.000> it<00:04:47.330> will<00:04:47.449> balance<00:04:47.780> you

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
omega-3 and omega-6 it will balance you

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.800 
omega-3 and omega-6 it will balance you
right<00:04:48.050> out<00:04:48.259> and<00:04:49.030> even<00:04:50.030> other<00:04:50.180> good<00:04:50.389> sources<00:04:50.569> to

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
right out and even other good sources to

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.119 
right out and even other good sources to
add<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:51.110> our<00:04:51.139> lots<00:04:51.409> of<00:04:51.560> leafy<00:04:51.889> green

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 
add in our lots of leafy green

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.550 
add in our lots of leafy green
vegetables<00:04:52.699> so<00:04:53.599> if<00:04:53.900> you're<00:04:54.050> eating<00:04:54.409> all<00:04:54.530> of

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
vegetables so if you're eating all of

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.050 
vegetables so if you're eating all of
those<00:04:54.770> things<00:04:55.009> regularly<00:04:55.610> you're<00:04:55.759> adding<00:04:56.000> a

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
those things regularly you're adding a

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.399 
those things regularly you're adding a
