00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.849 

and<00:00:02.210> you<00:00:03.210> take<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.449> square<00:00:03.810> sheet<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.170> paper<00:00:04.380> and

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
and you take a square sheet of paper and

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.590 
and you take a square sheet of paper and
place<00:00:05.190> it<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.670> one<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.120> edges<00:00:06.450> is

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
place it so that one of the edges is

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.839 
place it so that one of the edges is
pointing<00:00:06.960> towards<00:00:07.350> you<00:00:07.470> then<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.670> make<00:00:08.820> a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
pointing towards you then you make a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.520 
pointing towards you then you make a
vertical<00:00:09.330> fold<00:00:09.570> from<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.960> right<00:00:10.110> corner<00:00:10.320> to

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
vertical fold from the right corner to

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.780 
vertical fold from the right corner to
the<00:00:10.650> left<00:00:10.800> found<00:00:11.190> fault

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
the left found fault

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.640 
the left found fault
now<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.719> should<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.110> crease<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.559> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
now you should have a crease in the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.379 
now you should have a crease in the
middle<00:00:13.679> fold<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.639> right<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.849> left<00:00:15.059> corners

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
middle fold the right and left corners

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.900 
middle fold the right and left corners
towards<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> crease<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.680> middle<00:00:16.949> then

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
towards the crease in the middle then

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.700 
towards the crease in the middle then
fold<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.539> again<00:00:18.630> like<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.380> did<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.619> first

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
fold it again like you did in the first

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890 
fold it again like you did in the first
step<00:00:20.100> from<00:00:20.699> right<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.939> left<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
step from right to left so that the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.990 
step from right to left so that the
pockets<00:00:22.380> created<00:00:22.740> by<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.920> previous<00:00:23.340> step<00:00:23.580> are

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
pockets created by the previous step are

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.349 
pockets created by the previous step are
inside<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.660> fold<00:00:25.279> fold<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.430> triangle<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.330> that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
inside the fold fold a triangle so that

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.300 
inside the fold fold a triangle so that
your<00:00:27.660> thumb<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> obtuse<00:00:28.800> edge<00:00:29.039> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
your thumb is on the obtuse edge and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.460 
your thumb is on the obtuse edge and
then<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:30.689> other<00:00:30.750> hand

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
then with your other hand

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.639 
then with your other hand
unfold<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.279> sharp<00:00:32.550> edge<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.149> refold<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
unfold the sharp edge and refold it to a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.510 
unfold the sharp edge and refold it to a
closer<00:00:34.920> side<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.550> folded<00:00:36.059> towards<00:00:36.360> your<00:00:36.480> thumb

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
closer side is folded towards your thumb

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.400 
closer side is folded towards your thumb
you<00:00:38.520> open<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> folder<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:39.809> created<00:00:39.870> in

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
you open the folder that was created in

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.530 
you open the folder that was created in
previous<00:00:40.559> stage<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.879> told<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.300> on

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
previous stage and then we told it on

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.030 
previous stage and then we told it on
purpose<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.620> neat

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
purpose so that's neat

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.060 
purpose so that's neat
besides<00:00:44.510> closed<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.840> towards<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> crease<00:00:46.890> in

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
besides closed and towards the crease in

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.209 
besides closed and towards the crease in
the<00:00:47.129> center<00:00:48.079> then<00:00:49.079> fold<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> left<00:00:49.649> corner<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the center then fold the left corner of

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.100 
the center then fold the left corner of
the<00:00:50.520> rhombus<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.120> was<00:00:51.270> created<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the rhombus that was created in the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.740 
the rhombus that was created in the
previous<00:00:52.260> stage<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.370> corner<00:00:53.750> you

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
previous stage in the right corner you

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.779 
previous stage in the right corner you
should<00:00:54.780> get<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> neck<00:00:55.430> you<00:00:56.430> just<00:00:56.579> same<00:00:56.760> thing

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
should get a neck you just same thing

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.029 
should get a neck you just same thing
you<00:00:57.149> did<00:00:57.270> three<00:00:57.539> stages<00:00:57.809> ago<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.800> sharp

the fold and refolding it downwards to
form<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.930> head<00:01:04.110> when<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.250> do<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> twice<00:01:05.729> smaller

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
form a head when we do it twice smaller

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.090 
form a head when we do it twice smaller
than<00:01:06.450> head<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> form<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> beak<00:01:09.710> now<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
than head it to form a beak now do the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.609 
than head it to form a beak now do the
same<00:01:11.130> thing<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> field<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.390> body<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.439> that

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
same thing on the field and body so that

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.469 
same thing on the field and body so that
what<00:01:13.799> used<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.369> tail<00:01:14.790> will<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.450> a

what used to be tail will now be a

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.539 
what used to be tail will now be a
pointy<00:01:15.930> edge<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.590> bottom<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> newly
