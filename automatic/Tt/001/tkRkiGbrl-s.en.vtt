00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:07.290
 they ask us to simplify the fraction 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:12.050
 504 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.650
 1260 match 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.660
 what it means to simplify a fraction 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.880
 means finding a fraction 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.029
 equivalent that is the fraction that 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.360
 represents the same rational number of 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:31.790
 way that this fraction is irreducible 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.790
 a fraction is irreducible when 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.220
 the numerator and the denominator do not have 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.090
 common prime factors 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.770
 our case we will be doing 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.470
 dividing up and down by the same 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.080
 good number you have to say one thing about 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.270
 the irreducible fraction and that is in the 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.000
 If it is negative, the least is 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.160
 up our case less between more 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 less because the menu will no longer accompany 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.940
 all the time up we'll see if 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.520
 500 4,260 have common factors and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.980
 we are going to divide both by the same 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.320
 number and so we're getting 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:13.530
 successively equivalent fractions if 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.610
 we see that 504 thousand 260 are both pairs or 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.610
 They are divisible by 2 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.750
 51 12 x 24 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:37.830
 105 for 2 10 04 and 2 for 240 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:43.370
 252 in 1260 and we divide by 2 3 by 2 12 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.880
 063 for 2 600 130 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.800
 we put this as we have divided 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.510
 numerator and denominator by all for a 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.430
 same number the fraction we have is 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.460
 equivalent we follow 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.230
 - up we see that both are pairs 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:05.820
 because we are going to divide by 2 252 between 2 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:10.530
 1 for 2 2 0 2 for 2 4 in order 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.190
 we lower the 5 2 points 4 5 1 2 and 6 by 2 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.190
 12 0 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:24.820
 denominator 630 we divide between 2 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:27.570
 we have three left by 260 31 by 22 10 5 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.570
 for 2 10 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:37.050
 126 match of 315 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.250
 now less between more all the time already 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.250
 we know that they accompany less 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:52.480
 up we will have 126 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.480
 and down we have 315 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.450
 well we know that the denominator is 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:02.620
 odd therefore new 16 x 2 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.850
 equal less up now let's see if 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.560
 They are divisible by 3 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.360
 to see if the number is divisible by 3 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.930
 or else the division is made by 3 and you see 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.730
 that 330 or your figures are added and you 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:20.610
 see if the result is a multiple of 3 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.610
 + 2 369 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.400
 this number 9 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.160
 yes that is divisible by 3 then this is 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:36.890
 divisible by 3 of 315 we do the same 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:41.330
 3 1 459 is also visible by 3 then 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.490
 let's do what we can divide by 3 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.090
 4 12 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:51.459
 0 62 x 360 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.459
 315 we are also divided by 3 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.090
 for about 30 10 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.650
 53 15 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.480
 42 match of 105 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.420
 42 42 6 is divisible by 3 105 10 56 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.850
 It is also impossible for 3 divided 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:25.110
 both by 3 42 between 3 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:29.750
 for 3 3 or 4 12 4 for 3 12 0 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.750
 and now doing 5 we divide it by 3 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:40.610
 for 39 15 5 13 15 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:44.210
 we would be 14 matches of 35 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.099
 let's notice that now the top one about 4 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.099
 or 5 is not visible by 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.320
 3 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.060
 I'm not visible for 5 either because it's not going 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.240
 to advance a 5 but yes that is divisible 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.300
 by 7 and 35 it is also divisible by 7 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.370
 then we divide up and down by 7 - 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:09.430
 14 value minus up 14 between 72 and 35 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.540
 between 75 and now let's notice that less 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.970
 two fifths 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.060
 irreducible operation because the maximum 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.790
 common divisor of 2 and 5 is 1 there is no 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.430
 no prime factor like an am so 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.090
 so much this would be the expression 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:29.710
 simplified of about 500 four parties 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.710
 1260 that was what they asked us
