show<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.029> some<00:00:24.420> replays<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.439> sort<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
show you some replays that sort of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.310 
show you some replays that sort of
illustrate<00:00:26.250> how<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.699> basically<00:00:27.359> attack<00:00:28.019> with

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
illustrate how to basically attack with

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.519 
illustrate how to basically attack with
the<00:00:28.560> Goho<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.900> first<00:00:30.900> thing<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.199> probably

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the Goho and first thing you probably

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.760 
the Goho and first thing you probably
want<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.009> take<00:00:32.160> into<00:00:32.460> account<00:00:32.660> is<00:00:33.660> when<00:00:34.559> you're

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
want to take into account is when you're

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.790 
want to take into account is when you're
scouting<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.610> base<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.630> want<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.320> look<00:00:37.500> for

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
scouting a base you want to look for

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.010 
scouting a base you want to look for
where<00:00:38.670> they<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.030> basically<00:00:39.210> put<00:00:39.629> those<00:00:39.750> two

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
where they can basically put those two

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.100 
where they can basically put those two
by<00:00:40.200> two<00:00:40.280> types<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:42.020> compartments<00:00:43.020> because

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
by two types of compartments because

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.020 
by two types of compartments because
that's<00:00:43.440> where<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.800> that's<00:00:44.430> where<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> giant

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
that's where your that's where the giant

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
that's where your that's where the giant
bombs<00:00:45.180> are<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.320> let's<00:00:46.620> go<00:00:46.739> ahead

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
bombs are going to be so let's go ahead

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.389 
bombs are going to be so let's go ahead
and<00:00:46.980> take<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> look<00:00:47.789> at<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.750> attack<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.100> let's

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and take a look at this attack so let's

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.119 
and take a look at this attack so let's
just<00:00:50.579> put<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> pause<00:00:51.449> right<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.129> let's

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
just put a pause right here and let's

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.939 
just put a pause right here and let's
take<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.460> look<00:00:53.670> at<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.850> base<00:00:54.120> layout<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.079> based

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
take a look at this base layout so based

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.760 
take a look at this base layout so based
on<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:57.210> amount<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.809> giant<00:00:58.410> bombs<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
on the amount of giant bombs that you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.010 
on the amount of giant bombs that you
have<00:00:58.949> available<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.609> townhall<00:00:59.969> 8<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.989> have

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
have available at townhall 8 you have

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.080 
have available at townhall 8 you have
three<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.649> them<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.430> basically<00:01:02.789> there<00:01:03.059> is

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
three of them and so basically there is

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.509 
three of them and so basically there is
only<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.780> finite<00:01:04.409> amount<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.799> portions<00:01:05.309> where

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
only a finite amount of portions where

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.270 
only a finite amount of portions where
you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.729> put<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.350> giant<00:01:07.350> bombs<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:08.159> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
you can put your giant bombs and as you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.880 
you can put your giant bombs and as you
guys<00:01:08.430> know<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.030> giant<00:01:09.420> bombs<00:01:09.600> usually<00:01:10.500> equals

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
guys know to giant bombs usually equals

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.800 
guys know to giant bombs usually equals
death<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> hog<00:01:12.150> rider<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> want<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
death for the hog rider so you want to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.510 
death for the hog rider so you want to
make<00:01:12.960> sure<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.530> careful<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:14.040> those<00:01:14.369> so

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
make sure to be careful about those so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.609 
make sure to be careful about those so
you<00:01:14.610> want<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> avoid<00:01:14.939> any<00:01:15.270> sort<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.229> places

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you want to avoid any sort of places

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.039 
you want to avoid any sort of places
where<00:01:16.799> they<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.009> put<00:01:17.189> those<00:01:17.369> two<00:01:18.090> giant<00:01:18.869> bombs

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
where they can put those two giant bombs

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.920 
where they can put those two giant bombs
all<00:01:19.680> right<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.580> as<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.000> look<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.540> type<00:01:21.780> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
all right so as you look in this type of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.740 
all right so as you look in this type of
base<00:01:22.080> layout<00:01:22.369> there<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.520> some<00:01:23.820> some<00:01:24.360> areas<00:01:24.659> we

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
base layout there are some some areas we

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.539 
base layout there are some some areas we
could<00:01:24.930> probably<00:01:25.080> put<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.369> being

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
could probably put one of them being

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.789 
could probably put one of them being
like<00:01:26.790> right<00:01:27.000> here

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
like right here

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.310 
like right here
now<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.549> addition<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:31.049> could<00:01:31.200> also

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
now in addition to that it could also

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.130 
now in addition to that it could also
probably<00:01:31.649> be<00:01:32.100> right<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.689> but<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.020> guys

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
probably be right here but as you guys

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.520 
probably be right here but as you guys
know<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:35.700> got<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.969> have<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> try<00:01:36.929> to<00:01:36.990> play

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
know you got to have to try to play

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.620 
know you got to have to try to play
around<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.100> little<00:01:38.250> bit<00:01:38.429> and<00:01:38.729> try<00:01:39.600> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
around with it a little bit and try to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.069 
around with it a little bit and try to
scout<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.229> deploy<00:01:40.979> or<00:01:41.130> trigger<00:01:41.429> those<00:01:41.579> traps

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
scout and deploy or trigger those traps

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.139 
scout and deploy or trigger those traps
so<00:01:43.079> let's<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:43.859> ahead<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.069> try<00:01:44.189> see<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.700> this

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so let's go ahead and try see what this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.370 
so let's go ahead and try see what this
attacker<00:01:45.509> did<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.039> then<00:01:47.039> we'll<00:01:47.219> show<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.399> how

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
attacker did and then we'll show you how

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
attacker did and then we'll show you how
how<00:01:49.579> how<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.789> done<00:01:50.969> so<00:01:51.240> he<00:01:51.329> drops<00:01:51.600> his<00:01:51.780> golden

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
how how it's done so he drops his golden

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.809 
how how it's done so he drops his golden
first<00:01:52.469> it's<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> zoom<00:01:53.459> in<00:01:53.579> right<00:01:53.759> here

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
first it's going to zoom in right here

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.529 
first it's going to zoom in right here
so<00:01:55.009> that's<00:01:56.009> usually<00:01:56.610> meant<00:01:56.789> to<00:01:56.939> lure<00:01:57.149> out<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
so that's usually meant to lure out the

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.350 
so that's usually meant to lure out the
clan<00:01:57.840> castle<00:01:58.110> troops<00:01:58.880> try<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> trigger<00:02:00.209> any

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
clan castle troops try to trigger any

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.029 
clan castle troops try to trigger any
type<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.659> giant<00:02:00.840> bombs<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.530> Golem<00:02:01.920> is

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
type of giant bombs because the Golem is

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.199 
type of giant bombs because the Golem is
you<00:02:02.310> know<00:02:02.429> a<00:02:03.170> thing<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.349> can<00:02:04.500> helpfully<00:02:05.209> take

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
you know a thing that can helpfully take

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.999 
you know a thing that can helpfully take
out<00:02:06.360> those<00:02:06.509> giant<00:02:06.899> bombs<00:02:07.049> fairly<00:02:07.530> easily<00:02:07.679> and

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
out those giant bombs fairly easily and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.699 
out those giant bombs fairly easily and
then<00:02:08.429> still<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.729> alive<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.479> soak<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.560> rest

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
then still be alive to soak up the rest

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.100 
then still be alive to soak up the rest
of<00:02:10.799> the<00:02:10.920> damage<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.849> use<00:02:12.060> some<00:02:12.239> wizards<00:02:12.630> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
of the damage so you use some wizards to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.089 
of the damage so you use some wizards to
take<00:02:13.349> out<00:02:13.470> some<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.769> surrounding

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
take out some of the surrounding

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.780 
take out some of the surrounding
buildings<00:02:14.549> and<00:02:14.989> then<00:02:15.989> we<00:02:16.319> have<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.430> hog

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
buildings and then we have the hog

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.699 
buildings and then we have the hog
riders<00:02:18.120> which<00:02:18.329> they<00:02:18.870> only<00:02:19.290> issue<00:02:19.440> with<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
riders which they only issue with the

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.430 
riders which they only issue with the
hog<00:02:19.860> riders<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.370> usually<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.840> have<00:02:22.079> to<00:02:22.230> deal

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
hog riders is usually you have to deal

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.759 
hog riders is usually you have to deal
with<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:23.310> time<00:02:23.880> factor<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.380> lot<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.650> them

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
with a time factor so if a lot of them

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.140 
with a time factor so if a lot of them
do<00:02:25.890> get<00:02:26.040> blown<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:26.670> you're<00:02:26.819> just<00:02:27.000> left

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
do get blown up then you're just left

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.360 
do get blown up then you're just left
with<00:02:27.239> like<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.480> few<00:02:27.660> hog<00:02:27.840> riders<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.379> it's<00:02:29.160> hard

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
with like a few hog riders and it's hard

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.369 
with like a few hog riders and it's hard
to<00:02:29.459> sometimes<00:02:29.760> clean<00:02:30.060> up<00:02:30.239> now<00:02:30.840> let's<00:02:31.079> go<00:02:31.230> ahead

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
to sometimes clean up now let's go ahead

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.780 
to sometimes clean up now let's go ahead
and<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.560> what<00:02:31.769> this<00:02:31.920> attacker<00:02:32.220> does<00:02:32.519> so<00:02:32.670> he

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
and see what this attacker does so he

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.479 
and see what this attacker does so he
activates<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.420> Kings<00:02:33.630> ability<00:02:34.250> pretty<00:02:35.250> early

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
activates the Kings ability pretty early

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.759 
activates the Kings ability pretty early
actually<00:02:35.880> here<00:02:36.720> he<00:02:36.930> takes<00:02:37.139> out<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.440> clan

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
actually here he takes out the clan

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.610 
actually here he takes out the clan
castle<00:02:37.980> troops<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:39.540> probably<00:02:40.200> one

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
castle troops but that is probably one

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.050 
castle troops but that is probably one
of<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.709> primary<00:02:40.950> factors<00:02:41.519> if<00:02:41.639> you<00:02:41.700> want<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.940> do

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
of the primary factors if you want to do

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.229 
of the primary factors if you want to do
a<00:02:42.269> effective<00:02:43.200> hog<00:02:43.319> rider<00:02:43.560> attack<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.549> he<00:02:44.880> kind

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
a effective hog rider attack so he kind

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.849 
a effective hog rider attack so he kind
of<00:02:45.269> Scouts<00:02:45.569> here<00:02:45.720> there<00:02:46.170> goes<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.380> Giant<00:02:46.799> Bomb

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
of Scouts here there goes a Giant Bomb

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.840 
of Scouts here there goes a Giant Bomb
and<00:02:48.380> there<00:02:49.380> go<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.620> hog<00:02:49.859> rider<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:50.430> once<00:02:50.700> he's

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
and there go the hog rider so once he's

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.090 
and there go the hog rider so once he's
kind<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.090> cleared<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.569> out<00:02:51.859> then<00:02:52.859> he's<00:02:52.980> kind

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
kind of cleared that out then he's kind

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.650 
kind of cleared that out then he's kind
of<00:02:53.220> confident<00:02:53.670> saying<00:02:53.760> okay<00:02:54.060> well<00:02:54.239> now<00:02:54.389> I<00:02:54.420> can

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
of confident saying okay well now I can

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.930 
of confident saying okay well now I can
deploy<00:02:55.590> my<00:02:55.739> giant<00:02:55.950> our<00:02:56.160> deployment<00:02:56.819> hog

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
deploy my giant our deployment hog

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.539 
deploy my giant our deployment hog
riders<00:02:57.410> deploy<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.590> heal<00:02:58.769> spell<00:02:58.829> around<00:02:59.430> as

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
riders deploy that heal spell around as

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.710 
riders deploy that heal spell around as
many<00:02:59.790> defenses<00:03:00.660> as<00:03:00.780> possible<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.790> then<00:03:02.790> from

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
many defenses as possible and then from

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.420 
many defenses as possible and then from
that<00:03:03.750> point<00:03:04.319> then<00:03:04.859> it's<00:03:05.040> pretty<00:03:05.190> much<00:03:05.310> just

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
that point then it's pretty much just

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.089 
that point then it's pretty much just
hog<00:03:05.819> rider<00:03:06.090> cleanup<00:03:06.510> at<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> moment<00:03:07.049> like<00:03:07.980> I

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
hog rider cleanup at the moment like I

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.550 
hog rider cleanup at the moment like I
said<00:03:08.280> there<00:03:08.430> was<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.609> spot<00:03:09.000> almost<00:03:09.959> predicting

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
said there was a spot almost predicting

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.229 
said there was a spot almost predicting
their<00:03:10.680> giant<00:03:11.010> bombs<00:03:11.160> here<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:11.910> let's<00:03:12.060> go<00:03:12.180> in

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
their giant bombs here but let's go in

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.759

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
there takes out a bunch of hogs but he

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:19.970 
there takes out a bunch of hogs but he
still<00:03:18.510> has<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> bunch<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.109> them<00:03:19.290> alive<00:03:19.680> and

those skeleton troops are now kind of

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.409 
those skeleton troops are now kind of
chasing<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.639> hog<00:03:23.760> riders<00:03:24.030> around<00:03:24.299> they're

not<00:03:24.450> going<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.840> they're<00:03:25.620> not<00:03:25.680> going<00:03:25.889> to<00:03:25.950> attack

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
not going to they're not going to attack

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.339 
not going to they're not going to attack
the<00:03:26.280> skeleton<00:03:26.669> troops<00:03:26.880> until<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.329> very<00:03:27.630> end

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
the skeleton troops until the very end

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.839 
the skeleton troops until the very end
once<00:03:28.620> all<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.889> defenses<00:03:29.310> are<00:03:29.430> taken<00:03:29.730> out

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
once all the defenses are taken out

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.490 
once all the defenses are taken out
because<00:03:29.970> then<00:03:30.359> they're<00:03:30.480> sort<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.720> seen<00:03:30.959> as<00:03:31.109> a

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
because then they're sort of seen as a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.539 
because then they're sort of seen as a
threat<00:03:31.919> but<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:33.239> hog<00:03:33.510> riders<00:03:33.810> do<00:03:34.549> prioritize

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
threat but the hog riders do prioritize

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.999 
threat but the hog riders do prioritize
the<00:03:36.000> defense's<00:03:36.480> first<00:03:36.690> now<00:03:37.440> since<00:03:37.829> that's

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:38.009 
the defense's first now since that's

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.009 
the defense's first now since that's
sort<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.280> cleaned<00:03:38.549> up<00:03:38.699> now<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.389> hog<00:03:39.720> riders

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
sort of cleaned up now the hog riders

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:40.910 
sort of cleaned up now the hog riders
can<00:03:40.169> go

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
can go

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.130 
can go
take<00:03:41.069> out<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.340> rest<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.240> other<00:03:42.510> types<00:03:42.930> of

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
take out the rest of the other types of

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.040 
take out the rest of the other types of
structures<00:03:44.239> so<00:03:45.239> that's<00:03:45.390> always<00:03:45.569> really<00:03:45.900> good

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
structures so that's always really good

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.870 
structures so that's always really good
now<00:03:46.560> it's<00:03:46.770> just<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.040> time<00:03:47.250> thing<00:03:47.489> as<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.760> can

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
now it's just a time thing as you can

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.630 
now it's just a time thing as you can
see<00:03:48.000> time<00:03:48.270> was<00:03:48.540> pretty<00:03:49.050> pretty<00:03:49.950> close<00:03:50.190> at<00:03:50.489> the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
see time was pretty pretty close at the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.010 
see time was pretty pretty close at the
end<00:03:50.790> I'm<00:03:50.970> gonna<00:03:51.090> go<00:03:51.209> ahead<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.360> speed<00:03:51.690> up<00:03:51.810> this

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
end I'm gonna go ahead and speed up this

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.250 
end I'm gonna go ahead and speed up this
raid<00:03:52.349> and<00:03:52.910> he<00:03:53.910> has<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.209> Town<00:03:54.690> Hall<00:03:54.870> left<00:03:55.110> so

raid and he has that Town Hall left so

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.620 
raid and he has that Town Hall left so
sometimes<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.860> are<00:03:56.010> met<00:03:56.280> with<00:03:56.510> sometimes<00:03:57.510> a

sometimes you are met with sometimes a

sometimes you are met with sometimes a
99%<00:03:58.470> one-star<00:03:59.160> or<00:03:59.400> like<00:03:59.730> just<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.060> one-star

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
victory in this case though you did take

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
it out for a solid three star alright so

another type of go whole raid and just

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.740 
another type of go whole raid and just
because<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.580> says<00:04:08.730> go<00:04:08.970> low<00:04:09.120> doesn't<00:04:09.510> mean<00:04:09.630> you

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
because it says go low doesn't mean you

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.320 
because it says go low doesn't mean you
have<00:04:09.930> to<00:04:10.190> omit<00:04:11.190> error<00:04:11.430> get<00:04:11.819> rid<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.000> any<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.239> the

have to omit error get rid of any of the

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
other troops you can include Wizards

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.069 
other troops you can include Wizards
let's<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:14.850> go<00:04:14.940> ahead<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.090> pause<00:04:15.330> first<00:04:15.660> so

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
let's just go ahead and pause first so

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.259 
let's just go ahead and pause first so
yes<00:04:16.229> he<00:04:16.829> has<00:04:16.919> these<00:04:17.100> extra<00:04:17.579> builders<00:04:18.060> huts

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
yes he has these extra builders huts

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.879 
yes he has these extra builders huts
right<00:04:18.450> here<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:18.840> extra<00:04:19.139> percentage<00:04:19.620> points

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
right here for extra percentage points

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.199 
right here for extra percentage points
I'd<00:04:19.979> probably<00:04:20.190> take<00:04:20.549> care<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.790> that<00:04:20.880> first

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
I'd probably take care of that first

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.620 
I'd probably take care of that first
just<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.260> get<00:04:22.729> get<00:04:23.729> those<00:04:23.880> extra<00:04:24.150> percentage

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
just to get get those extra percentage

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.420 
just to get get those extra percentage
points<00:04:24.930> obviously<00:04:25.350> and<00:04:25.560> then<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.190> want<00:04:26.340> to

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
points obviously and then you want to

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.000 
points obviously and then you want to
just<00:04:26.580> look<00:04:26.729> for<00:04:27.000> those<00:04:27.150> 2x2<00:04:27.630> sort<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.710> spaces

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
just look for those 2x2 sort of spaces

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.490 
just look for those 2x2 sort of spaces
it's<00:04:29.639> not<00:04:29.880> it's<00:04:30.330> not<00:04:30.479> this<00:04:30.750> one<00:04:30.930> between<00:04:31.110> the

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
it's not it's not this one between the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.280 
it's not it's not this one between the
archer<00:04:31.950> tower<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:33.180> Elektra<00:04:33.900> storage<00:04:34.200> is

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
archer tower and the Elektra storage is

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.500 
archer tower and the Elektra storage is
actually<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:35.669> one<00:04:35.850> between<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.300> gold

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
actually the one between the gold

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.030 
actually the one between the gold
storage<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.770> air<00:04:38.070> defense<00:04:38.460> right<00:04:38.669> here

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
storage and the air defense right here

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.770 
storage and the air defense right here
so<00:04:41.040> different<00:04:41.550> places<00:04:41.850> where<00:04:42.240> he<00:04:42.389> can<00:04:42.510> put<00:04:42.750> the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
so different places where he can put the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.320 
so different places where he can put the
giant<00:04:43.169> bombs<00:04:43.290> obviously<00:04:44.280> there<00:04:44.490> there<00:04:44.790> are<00:04:45.090> in

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
giant bombs obviously there there are in

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.659 
giant bombs obviously there there are in
the<00:04:45.510> middle<00:04:45.780> right<00:04:45.930> here<00:04:45.960> as<00:04:46.260> well<00:04:47.090> but<00:04:49.669> not

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
the middle right here as well but not

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.070 
the middle right here as well but not
really<00:04:50.880> much<00:04:51.090> places<00:04:51.450> you<00:04:51.539> can<00:04:51.660> go<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:51.930> it's<00:04:52.050> a

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
really much places you can go so it's a

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.810 
really much places you can go so it's a
little<00:04:52.229> predictable<00:04:52.770> on<00:04:52.800> where<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.610> can

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
little predictable on where you can

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.880 
little predictable on where you can
anticipate<00:04:54.630> where<00:04:55.050> those<00:04:55.169> giant<00:04:55.470> bombs<00:04:55.650> are

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
anticipate where those giant bombs are

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.040 
anticipate where those giant bombs are
as<00:04:56.039> well<00:04:56.310> as<00:04:56.400> where<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.640> can<00:04:56.789> maybe

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
as well as where you can maybe

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.080 
as well as where you can maybe
potentially<00:04:58.050> drop<00:04:58.320> those<00:04:58.800> healing<00:04:59.190> spells<00:04:59.550> so

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
potentially drop those healing spells so

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.700 
potentially drop those healing spells so
another<00:05:00.510> one<00:05:00.690> kind<00:05:00.990> of<00:05:01.050> potentially<00:05:01.530> right

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
another one kind of potentially right

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.850 
another one kind of potentially right
here<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.390> you<00:05:03.390> got<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.660> try<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:03.990> watch<00:05:04.229> out<00:05:04.500> for

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
here and you got to try to watch out for

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.420 
here and you got to try to watch out for
that

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
that

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.240 
that
alright<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.210> let's<00:05:06.620> let's<00:05:07.620> see<00:05:07.919> what<00:05:08.100> we<00:05:08.220> have

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
alright so let's let's see what we have

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.140 
alright so let's let's see what we have
here<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.800> drop<00:05:11.070> some<00:05:11.250> hog<00:05:11.430> riders<00:05:11.729> just<00:05:11.940> to

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
here so you drop some hog riders just to

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.800 
here so you drop some hog riders just to
sort<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.450> wore<00:05:12.690> out<00:05:12.930> that<00:05:13.229> clan<00:05:13.650> castle<00:05:14.810> takes

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
sort of wore out that clan castle takes

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.770 
sort of wore out that clan castle takes
out<00:05:16.050> that<00:05:16.470> Archer<00:05:17.100> tower<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.669> then<00:05:17.820> he<00:05:18.390> sort

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
out that Archer tower and then he sort

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.290 
out that Archer tower and then he sort
of<00:05:18.870> luring<00:05:19.110> out<00:05:19.200> those<00:05:19.470> wizards<00:05:19.979> now<00:05:20.669> you<00:05:21.090> can

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
of luring out those wizards now you can

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.260 
of luring out those wizards now you can
definitely<00:05:21.539> use<00:05:22.640> both<00:05:23.640> so<00:05:23.880> he<00:05:23.970> has<00:05:24.090> those

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
definitely use both so he has those

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.690 
definitely use both so he has those
Tesla's<00:05:24.720> actually<00:05:25.110> there<00:05:25.260> for<00:05:25.289> a<00:05:25.700> little

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
Tesla's actually there for a little

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.920 
Tesla's actually there for a little
protection<00:05:27.120> on<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.330> builder<00:05:27.720> Hut

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
protection on that builder Hut

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.670 
protection on that builder Hut
interesting<00:05:28.830> approach<00:05:29.070> you<00:05:29.910> do<00:05:30.090> sort<00:05:30.360> of<00:05:30.680> have

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
interesting approach you do sort of have

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.969 
interesting approach you do sort of have
those<00:05:31.890> tells<00:05:32.160> there<00:05:32.460> Tyga's<00:05:32.850> prevent<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:34.080> guess

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
those tells there Tyga's prevent I guess

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.219 
those tells there Tyga's prevent I guess
just<00:05:35.220> in<00:05:35.370> case<00:05:35.580> like<00:05:35.789> towards<00:05:36.000> the<00:05:36.090> end<00:05:36.180> if<00:05:37.050> you

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
just in case like towards the end if you

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.029 
just in case like towards the end if you
want<00:05:37.470> to<00:05:37.680> kind<00:05:38.669> of<00:05:38.789> protect<00:05:39.479> that<00:05:39.690> last<00:05:40.050> star<00:05:40.770> I

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
want to kind of protect that last star I

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.210 
want to kind of protect that last star I
do<00:05:41.400> think<00:05:41.760> that<00:05:41.820> it's<00:05:42.450> sometimes<00:05:43.220> uneffective

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
do think that it's sometimes uneffective

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.800 
do think that it's sometimes uneffective
though<00:05:44.400> because<00:05:45.120> you're<00:05:45.240> kind<00:05:45.389> of<00:05:45.419> wasting

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
though because you're kind of wasting

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.840 
though because you're kind of wasting
your<00:05:45.840> Tesla's<00:05:46.350> I<00:05:47.010> think<00:05:47.400> it's<00:05:47.490> kind<00:05:47.669> of<00:05:47.700> better

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
your Tesla's I think it's kind of better

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.820 
your Tesla's I think it's kind of better
spent<00:05:48.150> in<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.389> middle<00:05:48.660> but<00:05:49.140> you<00:05:49.380> know<00:05:49.680> there's

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
spent in the middle but you know there's

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.469 
spent in the middle but you know there's
all<00:05:49.979> these<00:05:50.370> different<00:05:50.430> types<00:05:50.820> of<00:05:50.940> situations

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
all these different types of situations

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.020 
all these different types of situations
where<00:05:51.659> it<00:05:51.870> does<00:05:52.080> it<00:05:52.470> could<00:05:52.710> have<00:05:52.800> helped

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
where it does it could have helped

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.510 
where it does it could have helped
you<00:05:53.090> out<00:05:53.380> anyhow<00:05:54.380> which<00:05:54.890> is<00:05:55.040> on<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.250> outside

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
you out anyhow which is on the outside

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.620 
you out anyhow which is on the outside
they<00:05:55.640> took<00:05:55.790> out<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.060> clan<00:05:56.240> castle<00:05:56.600> troops

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
they took out the clan castle troops

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.470 
they took out the clan castle troops
with<00:05:57.470> ease<00:05:57.770> and<00:05:58.160> now<00:05:58.580> sits<00:05:58.880> pretty<00:05:59.060> much<00:05:59.240> where

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
with ease and now sits pretty much where

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.790 
with ease and now sits pretty much where
do<00:05:59.540> you<00:05:59.600> want<00:05:59.780> to<00:05:59.870> deploy<00:06:00.080> your<00:06:00.230> hog<00:06:00.440> riders

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
do you want to deploy your hog riders

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.150 
do you want to deploy your hog riders
there's<00:06:01.400> one<00:06:02.230> took<00:06:03.230> the<00:06:03.500> hog<00:06:03.740> riders<00:06:04.010> down

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
there's one took the hog riders down

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.950 
there's one took the hog riders down
pretty<00:06:04.730> significantly<00:06:05.390> actually<00:06:05.780> almost

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
pretty significantly actually almost

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.790 
pretty significantly actually almost
taking<00:06:06.410> them<00:06:06.530> out<00:06:06.710> but<00:06:07.700> we<00:06:07.820> have<00:06:08.060> actually

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
taking them out but we have actually

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.020 
taking them out but we have actually
some<00:06:09.800> more<00:06:09.920> hog<00:06:10.070> riders<00:06:10.340> from<00:06:10.490> the<00:06:10.610> bottom

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
some more hog riders from the bottom

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.170 
some more hog riders from the bottom
she's<00:06:11.660> kind<00:06:11.840> of<00:06:11.870> putting<00:06:12.170> them<00:06:12.320> up<00:06:13.030> kind<00:06:14.030> of<00:06:14.060> on

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
she's kind of putting them up kind of on

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.570 
she's kind of putting them up kind of on
different<00:06:14.660> spots<00:06:14.750> because<00:06:15.290> the<00:06:15.650> defenses<00:06:16.340> are

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
different spots because the defenses are

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.270 
different spots because the defenses are
a<00:06:16.850> little<00:06:17.390> bit<00:06:17.540> scattered<00:06:18.020> in<00:06:18.140> this<00:06:18.290> case<00:06:18.560> so

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
a little bit scattered in this case so

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.590 
a little bit scattered in this case so
what<00:06:19.490> we<00:06:19.580> have<00:06:19.820> here<00:06:20.210> is<00:06:21.970> at<00:06:22.970> least<00:06:23.270> he<00:06:23.360> got<00:06:23.450> to

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
what we have here is at least he got to

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.420 
what we have here is at least he got to
the<00:06:23.720> middle<00:06:23.810> of<00:06:23.990> that<00:06:24.050> base<00:06:24.350> with<00:06:24.800> his<00:06:25.010> witches

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
the middle of that base with his witches

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.550 
the middle of that base with his witches
and<00:06:25.640> his<00:06:26.210> wizards<00:06:26.810> so<00:06:27.290> that's<00:06:27.440> actually

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
and his wizards so that's actually

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.170 
and his wizards so that's actually
something<00:06:27.770> you<00:06:28.040> want<00:06:28.340> to<00:06:28.400> maybe<00:06:28.670> take<00:06:28.910> into

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
something you want to maybe take into

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.540 
something you want to maybe take into
account<00:06:29.480> if<00:06:30.410> you<00:06:30.560> do<00:06:30.770> want<00:06:30.980> to<00:06:31.010> do<00:06:31.160> the<00:06:31.280> go<00:06:31.430> home

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
account if you do want to do the go home

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.190 
account if you do want to do the go home
strategy<00:06:32.030> you<00:06:32.090> can<00:06:32.240> actually<00:06:32.600> bring<00:06:32.990> some

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
strategy you can actually bring some

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.710 
strategy you can actually bring some
it's<00:06:34.100> kind<00:06:34.430> of<00:06:34.460> like<00:06:34.580> it's<00:06:35.030> got<00:06:35.180> like<00:06:35.300> a<00:06:35.360> mini

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
it's kind of like it's got like a mini

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.500 
it's kind of like it's got like a mini
go<00:06:36.020> wee-wee<00:06:36.380> with<00:06:36.650> hog<00:06:36.890> riders<00:06:37.280> so<00:06:38.210> then<00:06:38.360> as

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 
go wee-wee with hog riders so then as

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.390 
go wee-wee with hog riders so then as
you<00:06:38.630> can<00:06:38.750> see<00:06:38.810> the<00:06:39.440> witches<00:06:39.830> and<00:06:39.860> the<00:06:40.040> wizards

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
you can see the witches and the wizards

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.100 
you can see the witches and the wizards
are<00:06:40.490> sort<00:06:40.670> of<00:06:40.700> powering<00:06:41.060> their<00:06:41.270> way<00:06:41.450> towards

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
are sort of powering their way towards

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.210 
are sort of powering their way towards
the<00:06:42.170> base<00:06:42.350> the<00:06:42.500> skeletons<00:06:42.950> are<00:06:43.040> kind<00:06:43.190> of

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
the base the skeletons are kind of

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.130 
the base the skeletons are kind of
tanking<00:06:43.580> for<00:06:43.730> the<00:06:43.820> wizard<00:06:44.120> and<00:06:44.360> then<00:06:44.810> the<00:06:44.960> Hogs

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
tanking for the wizard and then the Hogs

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.230 
tanking for the wizard and then the Hogs
are<00:06:45.320> sort<00:06:45.530> of<00:06:45.560> also<00:06:45.950> taking<00:06:46.610> out<00:06:46.700> the<00:06:46.760> defenses

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
are sort of also taking out the defenses

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.570 
are sort of also taking out the defenses
and<00:06:47.270> also<00:06:47.660> cleaning<00:06:47.930> up<00:06:48.050> the<00:06:48.770> rest<00:06:49.400> of<00:06:49.520> the

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
and also cleaning up the rest of the

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.190 
and also cleaning up the rest of the
base<00:06:49.790> so<00:06:50.030> this<00:06:50.480> is<00:06:50.630> actually<00:06:51.020> a<00:06:51.050> fairly

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
base so this is actually a fairly

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.300 
base so this is actually a fairly
effective<00:06:51.530> strategy

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
effective strategy

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.270 
effective strategy
indle<00:06:53.300> is<00:06:53.420> a<00:06:53.450> little<00:06:53.720> bit<00:06:53.810> of<00:06:53.900> a<00:06:53.960> mismatch<00:06:54.200> I<00:06:55.010> do

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
indle is a little bit of a mismatch I do

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.520 
indle is a little bit of a mismatch I do
like<00:06:55.610> the<00:06:55.910> sort<00:06:56.420> of<00:06:56.450> deployment<00:06:56.900> strategy<00:06:57.290> and

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
like the sort of deployment strategy and

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.980 
like the sort of deployment strategy and
troop<00:06:57.920> composition<00:06:58.520> a<00:06:58.700> very<00:06:59.540> effective<00:06:59.810> at

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
troop composition a very effective at

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.190 
troop composition a very effective at
the<00:07:00.110> townhall<00:07:00.470> 8<00:07:00.620> level<00:07:01.480> so<00:07:02.480> it's<00:07:02.780> pretty<00:07:03.080> much

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200 
the townhall 8 level so it's pretty much

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.850 
the townhall 8 level so it's pretty much
that<00:07:03.260> and<00:07:04.390> the<00:07:05.390> three-star<00:07:05.930> victory<00:07:06.320> but<00:07:06.680> that

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
that and the three-star victory but that

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.080 
that and the three-star victory but that
about<00:07:07.040> wraps<00:07:07.250> it<00:07:07.340> up<00:07:07.430> for<00:07:07.490> this<00:07:07.670> for<00:07:07.820> you<00:07:07.910> guys
