00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
right here and we're gonna start to warm

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.560 
right here and we're gonna start to warm
it<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.100> top<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.550> stove<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.059> top<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
stove we're also going to blend in our

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.130 
stove we're also going to blend in our
corn<00:01:02.730> starch<00:01:03.090> our<00:01:03.270> corn<00:01:03.480> starch<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
corn starch our corn starch is going to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.960 
corn starch our corn starch is going to
allow<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> sauce<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.920> thicken<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.729> give

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
allow the sauce to thicken up and give

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.750 
allow the sauce to thicken up and give
it<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.150> really<00:01:06.299> good<00:01:06.390> sauce<00:01:06.810> consistency<00:01:10.760> and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
it a really good sauce consistency and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.830 
it a really good sauce consistency and
then<00:01:11.880> we're<00:01:11.970> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> start<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> heat<00:01:12.659> this

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
then we're going to start to heat this

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
then we're going to start to heat this
up

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.580 

while<00:01:18.520> this<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:18.880> heating<00:01:19.080> I'm<00:01:20.080> going<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.410> take

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
while this is heating I'm going to take

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.990 
while this is heating I'm going to take
a<00:01:20.620> little<00:01:20.890> bit<00:01:21.070> of<00:01:21.250> my<00:01:21.490> cornstarch<00:01:23.850> I'm<00:01:24.850> going

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
a little bit of my cornstarch I'm going

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.040 
a little bit of my cornstarch I'm going
to<00:01:25.060> add<00:01:25.210> it<00:01:25.420> in<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.650> sauce<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.780> gonna<00:01:28.870> be

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
to add it in to the sauce it's gonna be

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.110 
to add it in to the sauce it's gonna be
very<00:01:29.260> useful<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.770> use<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:29.920> whip<00:01:30.190> so<00:01:30.760> you<00:01:30.850> can<00:01:31.000> go

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
very useful to use a whip so you can go

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.630 
very useful to use a whip so you can go
ahead<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.510> whip<00:01:31.690> it<00:01:31.870> on<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.369> get<00:01:33.520> it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
ahead and whip it on in and get it

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.219 
ahead and whip it on in and get it
really<00:01:33.820> well<00:01:34.030> blended<00:01:34.450> because<00:01:34.690> corn<00:01:34.960> starts

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
really well blended because corn starts

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.650 
really well blended because corn starts
likes<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.680> lump<00:01:35.890> once<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.090> starts<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.420> come<00:01:37.630> up

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
likes the lump once it starts to come up

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.250 
likes the lump once it starts to come up
to<00:01:38.020> just<00:01:38.740> below<00:01:38.979> a<00:01:39.010> boil<00:01:39.340> about<00:01:40.000> 210<00:01:40.930> degrees

to just below a boil about 210 degrees

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.300 
to just below a boil about 210 degrees
you're<00:01:41.440> going<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:41.619> start<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:41.920> notice<00:01:41.950> that

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
you're going to start to notice that

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.219 
you're going to start to notice that
thicken<00:01:42.610> up<00:01:42.700> dramatically<00:01:43.210> once<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:43.990> gets<00:01:44.140> to

thicken up dramatically once it gets to

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.020 
thicken up dramatically once it gets to
