00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you'll very people review the game which

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.220 
you'll very people review the game which
a<00:00:51.000> lot<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> people<00:00:51.329> should<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:51.809> familiar<00:00:51.960> with

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
a lot of people should be familiar with

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.729 
a lot of people should be familiar with
but<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:53.010> makes<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:54.059> particular

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
but then what makes this particular

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.849 
but then what makes this particular
production<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:57.149> bit<00:00:57.270> different<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
production a little bit different so it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.660 
production a little bit different so it
is<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.390> discover<00:01:00.620> innovation<00:01:01.620> by<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> prototype

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
is we discover innovation by a prototype

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.509 
is we discover innovation by a prototype
of<00:01:02.699> cartilage<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.960> use<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.280> we<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
of cartilage and we use that we do it

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.880 
of cartilage and we use that we do it
with<00:01:05.700> us<00:01:05.850> Noddy<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.600> love<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.290> game<00:01:07.470> game

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
with us Noddy and we love the game game

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
with us Noddy and we love the game game
is<00:01:08.070> very<00:01:08.310> great<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.900> wanted<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
is very great and we we wanted to do it

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.859 
is very great and we we wanted to do it
but<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.570> refund<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.740> design<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.869> obvious

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
but we refund that the design of obvious

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.670 
but we refund that the design of obvious
validation<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:17.509> suitable<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.900> wicca

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
validation was not suitable with wicca

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.530 
validation was not suitable with wicca
market<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> way<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.030> used<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> do

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
market in the way we are used to do

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.530 
market in the way we are used to do
again<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.259> wanted<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.540> differently

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
again so we wanted to do it differently

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.040 
again so we wanted to do it differently
with<00:01:24.979> different<00:01:25.979> design<00:01:26.549> more<00:01:27.000> us

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
with different design more us

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.800 
with different design more us
more<00:01:29.320> graphic<00:01:29.800> and<00:01:30.100> so<00:01:30.850> more<00:01:31.690> magnet<00:01:32.230> mom<00:01:32.620> is

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
more graphic and so more magnet mom is

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.300 
more graphic and so more magnet mom is
this<00:01:34.810> is<00:01:34.960> kind<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.200> box<00:01:35.410> we<00:01:35.590> already<00:01:35.740> did<00:01:36.070> that

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
this is kind of box we already did that

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.570 
this is kind of box we already did that
boasts<00:01:36.640> more<00:01:36.790> for<00:01:37.240> operation<00:01:37.870> of<00:01:38.050> videos<00:01:38.890> from

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
boasts more for operation of videos from

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.410 
boasts more for operation of videos from
16<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:41.190> so<00:01:42.190> we<00:01:42.430> wanted<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.730> do<00:01:42.940> it<00:01:43.060> like<00:01:43.270> this

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
16 and so we wanted to do it like this

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.350 
16 and so we wanted to do it like this
we<00:01:44.230> have<00:01:44.350> changed<00:01:44.560> our<00:01:44.950> we<00:01:45.550> did<00:01:45.700> not<00:01:45.850> change<00:01:46.090> as

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
we have changed our we did not change as

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.680 
we have changed our we did not change as
game<00:01:47.080> mechanics<00:01:47.950> game<00:01:48.430> enters<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.940> same<00:01:49.180> but

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
game mechanics game enters the same but

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.080 
game mechanics game enters the same but
we<00:01:49.960> change<00:01:50.230> some<00:01:50.530> point<00:01:51.250> about<00:01:51.550> vocabulary

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
we change some point about vocabulary

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.280 
we change some point about vocabulary
and<00:01:52.750> we<00:01:53.260> use<00:01:53.440> more<00:01:54.330> worlds<00:01:55.330> before<00:01:55.870> with

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
and we use more worlds before with

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.200 
and we use more worlds before with
things<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:56.860> forth<00:01:57.160> are<00:01:57.310> more<00:01:57.580> efficient

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
things and so forth are more efficient

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.170 
things and so forth are more efficient
