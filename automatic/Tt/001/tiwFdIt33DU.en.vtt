00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
1600 by my back I'm going to type that

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.830 
1600 by my back I'm going to type that
in<00:00:26.039> now<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:27.090> I'm<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> go<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.570> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
in now so I'm going to go to the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.779 
in now so I'm going to go to the
stronghold<00:00:28.140> finder<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:29.099> will<00:00:29.250> be<00:00:29.400> linked<00:00:29.670> in

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
stronghold finder it will be linked in

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
stronghold finder it will be linked in
the<00:00:29.820> description<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> will<00:00:31.050> say<00:00:31.289> is

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the description and what it will say is

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
the description and what it will say is
seed<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.160> obviously<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> put<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> seed<00:00:33.120> in

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
seed so obviously you put the seed in

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:41.450 
seed so obviously you put the seed in
there<00:00:33.390> some<00:00:33.570> ice<00:00:33.690> one<00:00:35.750> 642<00:00:39.469> 4478<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:41.280> you

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
there some ice one 642 4478 and then you

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.450 
there some ice one 642 4478 and then you
press<00:00:41.579> calculate<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:43.379> sometimes<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
press calculate and then sometimes it

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.790 
press calculate and then sometimes it
does<00:00:44.640> say<00:00:44.850> invalid<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.840> sometimes<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
does say invalid and sometimes it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.869 
does say invalid and sometimes it
doesn't<00:00:46.860> find<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.210> other<00:00:48.450> times<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:49.140> will

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
doesn't find it but other times it will

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.340 
doesn't find it but other times it will
like<00:00:50.879> because<00:00:51.449> some<00:00:51.719> strong<00:00:51.960> house<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.320> just

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
like because some strong house is just

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.830 
like because some strong house is just
completely<00:00:52.620> plugged<00:00:53.610> some<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.660> don't

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
completely plugged some of them don't

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
completely plugged some of them don't
generate<00:00:55.379> properly<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.010> doesn't<00:00:56.430> give<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
generate properly so it doesn't give a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.590 
generate properly so it doesn't give a
son<00:00:57.539> coordinate<00:00:58.609> but<00:00:59.609> here's<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.000> stronghold

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
son coordinate but here's one stronghold

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.219 
son coordinate but here's one stronghold
2<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.789> that-<00:01:03.589> 756<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.949> zed<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.610> minus<00:01:06.229> 108

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
2 is that- 756 and zed is minus 108

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.390 
2 is that- 756 and zed is minus 108
there<00:01:07.650> i'm<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> go<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.430> now<00:01:10.189> 756<00:01:11.189> is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
there i'm going to go to that now 756 is

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.520 
there i'm going to go to that now 756 is
do<00:01:11.909> boo<00:01:12.090> boo<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.810> way<00:01:12.990> ah<00:01:14.930> okay<00:01:15.930> so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
do boo boo do it this way ah okay so

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.320 
do boo boo do it this way ah okay so
while<00:01:16.920> i'm<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.400> my<00:01:17.549> way<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.210> will

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
while i'm on my way there it will

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.210 
while i'm on my way there it will
probably<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.960> spike<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> lot<00:01:19.590> because

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
probably like spike a lot because

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.520 
probably like spike a lot because
generating<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.479> lacks<00:01:22.759> but<00:01:23.759> yeah<00:01:24.420> i'm<00:01:25.350> going

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
generating it lacks but yeah i'm going

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
generating it lacks but yeah i'm going
to<00:01:25.590> talk<00:01:25.680> about<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:26.100> I'm<00:01:26.189> doing<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:27.180> you're
