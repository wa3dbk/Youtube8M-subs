00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
review or an on foot video I have one

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.269 
review or an on foot video I have one
for<00:00:27.180> both<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.570> these<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:28.680> look<00:00:29.070> at<00:00:29.189> my

for both of these so just go look at my

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.470 
for both of these so just go look at my
channel<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.760> shouldn't<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.210> hard<00:00:30.359> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
channel it shouldn't be that hard to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.930 
channel it shouldn't be that hard to
find<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.590> solely<00:00:31.859> performance<00:00:32.640> review

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

as you can see I have two colorways I

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.520 
as you can see I have two colorways I
got<00:00:34.980> these<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.309> $60<00:00:36.059> each<00:00:36.270> which<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.050> actually

the adidas outlets from what I

the adidas outlets from what I
understand<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.489> haven't<00:00:48.480> played<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.809> these

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899

royalty<00:00:49.530> colorways<00:00:49.920> yet<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:50.760> I've<00:00:51.390> been

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
royalty colorways yet but I've been

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.600 
royalty colorways yet but I've been
playing<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> mr.<00:00:52.530> Chicago<00:00:53.010> colorway<00:00:53.460> for

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
about a week and a half so I thought it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.119 
about a week and a half so I thought it
was<00:00:55.020> time<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> give<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> performance

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
was time to give you a performance

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.420 
was time to give you a performance
review<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.620> five<00:00:58.829> things<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.190> gonna<00:00:59.280> be

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
review the five things are gonna be

review the five things are gonna be
focusing<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.059> our<00:01:00.300> traction<00:01:01.170> cushion

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
focusing on our traction cushion

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.179 
focusing on our traction cushion
lockdown<00:01:03.120> slash<00:01:03.449> support<00:01:04.040> durability<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
lockdown slash support durability and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.340 
lockdown slash support durability and
breathability<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.659> are<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> start

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
breathability so we are going to start

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.820 
breathability so we are going to start
at<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> bottom<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> shoe<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.610> traction

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
at the bottom of the shoe with traction

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.700 
at the bottom of the shoe with traction
so<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.270> entire<00:01:12.869> outsole<00:01:13.590> is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
so as you can see the entire outsole is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.010 
so as you can see the entire outsole is
made<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.220> herringbone<00:01:14.640> pattern<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.240> does

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
made up of a herringbone pattern it does

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.870 
made up of a herringbone pattern it does
switch<00:01:16.350> colors<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.250> see<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> is

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
switch colors as you can see but it is

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.010 
switch colors as you can see but it is
all<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.240> same<00:01:18.600> rubber<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:20.570> fairly<00:01:21.570> pliable

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
all the same rubber it's fairly pliable

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.859 
all the same rubber it's fairly pliable
I'd<00:01:22.500> say<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.159> same<00:01:23.450> thickness<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
I'd say about the same thickness as the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.969 
I'd say about the same thickness as the
kt5<00:01:25.799> outsole<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:27.930> able<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.290> move<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
kt5 outsole so you are able to move it I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.740 
kt5 outsole so you are able to move it I
don't<00:01:29.520> know<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.270> but<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> can

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
don't know if you can see that but I can

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.510 
don't know if you can see that but I can
move<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.259> herringbone<00:01:31.740> pattern<00:01:32.100> fairly

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
move the herringbone pattern fairly

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.100 
move the herringbone pattern fairly
easily<00:01:33.740> moving<00:01:34.740> forward<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.490> backward<00:01:36.110> with

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
easily moving forward and backward with

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.499 
easily moving forward and backward with
motions<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.490> traction<00:01:39.329> worked

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
motions like that this traction worked

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.510 
motions like that this traction worked
amazing<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.280> all

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
amazing because as you can see it is all

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.289 
amazing because as you can see it is all
one<00:01:41.850> directional<00:01:42.390> herringbone<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.759> that

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
one directional herringbone so in that

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.030 
one directional herringbone so in that
sense<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.689> me<00:01:45.930> report<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.530> backward<00:01:46.890> this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
sense just me report and backward this

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.270 
sense just me report and backward this
shoe<00:01:47.280> works<00:01:47.490> amazing<00:01:48.799> except<00:01:49.799> when<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.040> was

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
shoe works amazing except when I was

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310 
shoe works amazing except when I was
making<00:01:50.430> cuts<00:01:50.820> at<00:01:51.090> an<00:01:51.270> angle<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:52.049> or

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
making cuts at an angle like that or

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.499 
making cuts at an angle like that or
even<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.670> outside<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.090> my<00:01:54.149> foot<00:01:54.360> like

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
even with the outside of my foot like

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.550 
even with the outside of my foot like
that<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.049> felt<00:01:55.979> there<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.670> slippage

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
that I felt there was a bit of slippage

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.780 
that I felt there was a bit of slippage
one<00:01:58.560> thing<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.890> shoe<00:01:59.009> could<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.280> used<00:01:59.520> to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
one thing that shoe could have used to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.600 
one thing that shoe could have used to
enhance<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.960> traction<00:02:01.320> would<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.369> an

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
enhance that traction would be an

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.280 
enhance that traction would be an
outrigger<00:02:03.210> right<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.869> with<00:02:04.020> some<00:02:04.170> more

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
outrigger right here with some more

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.350 
outrigger right here with some more
traction<00:02:04.590> for<00:02:05.009> making<00:02:05.340> cuts<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.939> outside

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
traction for making cuts on the outside

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.719 
traction for making cuts on the outside
of<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:06.479> foot

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
of your foot

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.479 
of your foot
so<00:02:08.270> overall<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.500> traction<00:02:09.860> was<00:02:09.979> very<00:02:10.220> good

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
so overall the traction was very good

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.100 
so overall the traction was very good
except<00:02:11.180> for<00:02:11.360> making<00:02:11.480> cuts

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
except for making cuts

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.660 
except for making cuts
I<00:02:12.230> personally<00:02:12.709> don't<00:02:12.950> make<00:02:13.129> a<00:02:13.160> lot<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.430> cuts

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
I personally don't make a lot of cuts

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.759 
I personally don't make a lot of cuts
because<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.060> play<00:02:14.269> power<00:02:14.510> forward<00:02:14.959> so<00:02:15.530> I'll

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
because I play power forward so I'll

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.330 
because I play power forward so I'll
give<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.099> traction<00:02:16.550> eight<00:02:16.760> out<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:17.060> ten<00:02:18.340> next

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
give the traction eight out of ten next

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.490 
give the traction eight out of ten next
up<00:02:19.489> we<00:02:19.700> have<00:02:19.730> cushion<00:02:20.360> as<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.870> can<00:02:21.050> see<00:02:21.230> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
up we have cushion as you can see the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.660 
up we have cushion as you can see the
midsole<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.370> DeRose<00:02:22.910> 3.5<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.810> foam

midsole of the DeRose 3.5 is a foam

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.190 
midsole of the DeRose 3.5 is a foam
cushioning<00:02:25.670> system<00:02:25.880> right<00:02:26.540> here<00:02:26.599> it<00:02:26.989> does<00:02:27.170> not

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
cushioning system right here it does not

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.650 
cushioning system right here it does not
offer<00:02:27.739> much<00:02:28.250> cushioning<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.880> be<00:02:29.060> completely

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
offer much cushioning to be completely

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.630 
offer much cushioning to be completely
honest<00:02:30.080> with<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.349> it<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:30.650> fairly<00:02:31.010> hard<00:02:31.340> and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
honest with you it is fairly hard and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.320 
honest with you it is fairly hard and
also<00:02:32.450> if<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.780> look<00:02:32.959> inside<00:02:33.730> there<00:02:34.730> is<00:02:34.940> this

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
also if you look inside there is this

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.990 
also if you look inside there is this
hard<00:02:35.690> plastic<00:02:35.840> adidas<00:02:36.799> miCoach<00:02:36.980> insert<00:02:37.700> which

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
hard plastic adidas miCoach insert which

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.750 
hard plastic adidas miCoach insert which
really<00:02:38.450> cuts<00:02:38.780> down<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.200> cushioning<00:02:39.760> so

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
really cuts down on the cushioning so

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.380 
really cuts down on the cushioning so
basically<00:02:42.640> 90%<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.700> your<00:02:43.790> cushioning<00:02:44.209> is

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
basically 90% of your cushioning is

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.300 
basically 90% of your cushioning is
coming<00:02:44.810> from<00:02:44.989> this<00:02:45.260> thin<00:02:45.590> little<00:02:45.829> outsole

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
coming from this thin little outsole

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.190 
coming from this thin little outsole
right<00:02:46.519> here<00:02:46.880> I'd<00:02:47.030> say<00:02:47.329> it's<00:02:47.480> about<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.750> quarter

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
right here I'd say it's about a quarter

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.949 
right here I'd say it's about a quarter
of<00:02:48.230> an<00:02:48.380> inch<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.680> 31<00:02:49.310> inch<00:02:49.430> thick<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:50.390> is<00:02:50.420> not

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
of an inch to 31 inch thick it is not

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.110 
of an inch to 31 inch thick it is not
very<00:02:51.260> thick<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:52.459> be<00:02:52.549> quite<00:02:52.790> honest<00:02:53.090> with

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
very thick and to be quite honest with

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.059 
very thick and to be quite honest with
you<00:02:53.360> it<00:02:53.599> is<00:02:53.720> not<00:02:53.840> very<00:02:54.110> soft<00:02:54.440> either<00:02:54.769> it's

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
you it is not very soft either it's

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.740 
you it is not very soft either it's
quite<00:02:55.400> firm<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.910> you<00:02:56.060> need<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.299> press<00:02:56.510> down<00:02:56.690> on

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
quite firm and you need to press down on

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.710 
quite firm and you need to press down on
it<00:02:56.959> quite<00:02:57.200> hard<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.470> get<00:02:57.739> any<00:02:58.010> sort<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.459> give<00:02:59.450> to

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
it quite hard to get any sort of give to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.580 
it quite hard to get any sort of give to
it<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.910> was<00:03:02.150> fine<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.900> terms<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.380> just

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
it so it was fine in terms of just

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.860 
it so it was fine in terms of just
running<00:03:03.980> on<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.400> court<00:03:04.700> or<00:03:04.970> doing<00:03:05.299> jump<00:03:05.599> stops

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
running on the court or doing jump stops

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.660 
running on the court or doing jump stops
or<00:03:06.110> something<00:03:06.410> like<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.709> but<00:03:07.280> when<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.519> came

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
or something like that but when it came

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.059 
or something like that but when it came
to<00:03:07.849> grabbing<00:03:08.269> rebounds<00:03:08.480> or<00:03:09.079> going<00:03:09.739> up<00:03:09.829> for<00:03:10.010> a

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
to grabbing rebounds or going up for a

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.680 
to grabbing rebounds or going up for a
block<00:03:10.310> attempt<00:03:10.790> or<00:03:10.910> something<00:03:11.299> like<00:03:11.480> that

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
block attempt or something like that

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.420 
block attempt or something like that
when<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.590> hit<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.889> ground<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.280> could

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
when you hit the ground you could

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.069 
when you hit the ground you could
definitely<00:03:13.760> feel<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.269> in<00:03:14.480> your<00:03:14.600> knees<00:03:14.810> that

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
there is not a lot of cushioning so

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.930 
there is not a lot of cushioning so
