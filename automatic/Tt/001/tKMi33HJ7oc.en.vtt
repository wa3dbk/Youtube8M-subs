 hi i have for today for you and 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.650
 very nice recipe but nice one 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.570
 mask 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.599
 I'm pretty tired because I have today 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.480
 worked the day and it was so busy for me 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.279
 But today I still have to get out then I thought 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.619
 then it might be nice to have one 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.610
 make a mask for myself 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.610
 well let's start 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.020
 what do you need first half 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.130
 banana eaten all over the place 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.130
 you don't get my name you go 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.159
 by the way, very awful name 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.870
 hydrate 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:56.460
 but also on that was i worked and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.940
 mesman oily skin so then it is 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.039
 nice to use something terribly them 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:10.820
 stÃ¼bben pasted there should be something like that 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:10.820
 look like you are going to add 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:21.000
 feel linseed too 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:22.020
 you add about a tablespoon of broken 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.160
 linseed 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.790
 works which marry 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.040
 clean yes deep clean 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.030
 I have discovered this mask transversely 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.680
 son felt like a mask at the swimming pool 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.890
 mark is not that big but is still possible 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.770
 all things are at home 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.150
 just looking up and then I took one 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.150
 mask made makes you real 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.110
 were ingredient you are going 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.800
 add is cocoa powder 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.100
 which also makes you about ndng farmer french 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.100
 oil 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:30.470
 and then dip yourself and work cocoa 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:30.950
 boosting then I did need that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.620
 to smoke 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:42.620
 and then add one last ingredients 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:45.880
 and that is home boxx about one 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.880
 tablespoon honey 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.170
 when is a means indeed 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:02.380
 interacts own richard 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:05.790
 and the skin repairs 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.790
 this time you also burka 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.690
 if you mixed everything up because 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.690
 it look something like this 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.560
 I admit you will see a reset 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.680
 but it really is a very nice mask 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.980
 this mask is about enough for with 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.930
 the two of them but what you are going to do is 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.830
 naturally cleanse your skin 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.830
 I'm going to do that now 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.710
 do this cleaned in my skin and it 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.440
 it's time to apply the mask 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.270
 i always do i have to go my hands 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.740
 that they are also an easiest because it is 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.740
 quite a liquid mask 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.140
 make sure you get something from one 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.120
 paper towel at hand for mommy 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.070
 from kliederboel 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.820
 not too thick a layer or snow 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.650
 long because other than it will drip and 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.080
 well you just don't want us 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.080
 examination with mask 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.850
 well you look so dirty but really 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.850
 it's just a breeze 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.150
 Mark also using it as 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.480
 well my mask is over but I later 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:31.770

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.840

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.570
 and yet work would be saved well me me 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.590
 have rinsed the mask after it 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.280
 about 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:48.600
