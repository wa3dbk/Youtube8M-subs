 voice 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.929
 I say put the ball because we 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.399

 in this place 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.440
 because everyone is going to attack the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.369
 people who will be hunting the ball 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.190
 Rolling she's not going to put us down. 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.530
 now another racket will pass the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.409
 time when he was hitting the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:19.390
 rethinking a little over it does not lead 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.659
 an important highlight of the arm 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.890
 When are we going to start lifting the 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.540
 ball with the insistent arm and now 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.720

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.509
 I will not play and I feel the weight of the 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.759
 ball with feeling the weight of the ball 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.860
 poisonous feeling the weight of the ball is

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.810
 extended arm

 I raised my arm and the ball just 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.399

 let this ball is a first of them 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.430

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.519

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.470
 front

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:16.260
 weight of the ball hitting the ball 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.069

 those who observe contentment are very 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.390
