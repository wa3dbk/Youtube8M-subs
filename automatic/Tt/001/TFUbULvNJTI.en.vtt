hi<00:00:01.700> I'm<00:00:02.700> here<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.149> discuss<00:00:03.449> about<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:04.069> Fe<00:00:05.069> error

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
hi I'm here to discuss about a Fe error

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.900 
hi I'm here to discuss about a Fe error
on<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.910> Nikon<00:00:06.470> DSLR<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.770> currently<00:00:08.069> have<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.639> D

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
on the Nikon DSLR I currently have a D

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.810 
on the Nikon DSLR I currently have a D
90<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.889> with<00:00:10.889> me<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:12.530> AF<00:00:13.530> nikkor<00:00:14.099> 50mm<00:00:15.800> f-18

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
90 and with me is a AF nikkor 50mm f-18

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.660 
90 and with me is a AF nikkor 50mm f-18
but<00:00:17.820> recently<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.300> noticed<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.170> notch

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
but recently I noticed that the notch

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.670 
but recently I noticed that the notch
has<00:00:20.670> been<00:00:21.119> broken<00:00:21.359> off<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.900> every<00:00:22.260> time<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
has been broken off and every time I

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.859 
has been broken off and every time I
snap<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.710> body<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.099> get<00:00:26.910> an<00:00:27.060> F<00:00:27.269> EE<00:00:27.480> error

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
snap it on the body I get an F EE error

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.759 
snap it on the body I get an F EE error
so<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.220> try<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.580> find<00:00:30.090> out<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.720> ways<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.960> fix<00:00:31.529> it

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
so I try to find out the ways to fix it

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.670 
so I try to find out the ways to fix it
but<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.239> expensive<00:00:33.510> if<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.110> take<00:00:34.530> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
but it's really expensive if I take it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.990 
but it's really expensive if I take it
into<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> store<00:00:35.370> since<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.480> price<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.290> UM

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
into the store since the price of the UM

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.840 
into the store since the price of the UM
the<00:00:39.000> lens<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.960> about<00:00:39.989> 139<00:00:40.980> dollars<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the lens is about 139 dollars and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
the lens is about 139 dollars and
probably<00:00:42.390> would<00:00:42.510> cost<00:00:42.690> me<00:00:42.899> about<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.290> hundred

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
probably would cost me about a hundred

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.549 
probably would cost me about a hundred
to<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> fix<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> quick<00:00:46.079> fix<00:00:46.350> for

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
to have it fix so I have a quick fix for

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
to have it fix so I have a quick fix for

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
band and just before you snap on the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
band and just before you snap on the
lens<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.510> camera<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.559> notch

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
lens to the camera you see this notch

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.680 
lens to the camera you see this notch
right<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.930> D<00:00:58.079> 90<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.859> probably

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
right here on the D 90 it's probably

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.670 
right here on the D 90 it's probably
about<00:01:00.690> eight<00:01:01.469> o'clock<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.870> face<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
the lens about 8 o'clock in the position

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.620 
the lens about 8 o'clock in the position
so<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.439> place<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.979> the

instruction earlier like before you put
in<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.860> lens<00:02:22.040> let<00:02:22.310> me<00:02:22.400> do<00:02:22.520> it<00:02:22.610> again

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
in the lens let me do it again

put the rubber band into the notch I'm
using<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.520> D<00:02:31.700> 90<00:02:32.180> actually<00:02:33.280> right<00:02:34.280> here<00:02:34.880> so

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
using a D 90 actually right here so

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.340 
using a D 90 actually right here so
let's<00:02:35.510> put<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.310> pulls<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.880> little

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
let's put it so it pulls that a little

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.160 
let's put it so it pulls that a little
then<00:02:39.350> try<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.709> snap<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.280> on<00:02:40.520> back<00:02:40.930> back<00:02:41.930> on<00:02:42.140> I

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
then try to snap it on back back on I
