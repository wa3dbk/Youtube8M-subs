00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
season i think is yeah looks so much

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.470 
season i think is yeah looks so much
more<00:00:10.590> comfortable<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.610> today<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.330> lot

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
more comfortable and today and a lot

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.900 
more comfortable and today and a lot
more<00:00:12.509> presence<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.139> midfield<00:00:13.320> as<00:00:13.740> well<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.490> it

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
more presence in midfield as well so it

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.400 
more presence in midfield as well so it
just<00:00:15.240> seemed<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.420> benefit<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.900> whole<00:00:16.080> team<00:00:16.379> i

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
just seemed to benefit the whole team i

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.349 
just seemed to benefit the whole team i
think<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.800> back<00:00:16.949> for<00:00:17.250> put<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.150> best

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
think the back for put in the best

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.060 
think the back for put in the best
performance<00:00:18.930> we've<00:00:19.050> seen<00:00:19.109> for<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> good<00:00:19.890> while

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
performance we've seen for a good while

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
performance we've seen for a good while
not<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:20.640> Evans<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.240> Ferdinand<00:00:21.660> were

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
not for Evans and Ferdinand were

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.460 
not for Evans and Ferdinand were
magnificent<00:00:22.740> really<00:00:23.100> both<00:00:23.279> really<00:00:23.850> really

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
magnificent really both really really

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.349 
magnificent really both really really
controlled<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.039> Evans<00:00:26.519> sign<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.119> get<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
controlled and Evans sign to get the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.359 
controlled and Evans sign to get the
farm<00:00:27.599> back<00:00:27.840> he<00:00:28.019> was<00:00:28.170> showing<00:00:28.349> middle<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.279> last

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
farm back he was showing middle of last

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.070 
farm back he was showing middle of last
season<00:00:29.910> when<00:00:30.029> he<00:00:30.179> had<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.510> good<00:00:30.689> run<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
season when he had a good run in the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.350 
season when he had a good run in the
team<00:00:31.820> what<00:00:32.820> do<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.940> think<00:00:33.090> about<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
team what do you think about the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.880 
team what do you think about the
substitution<00:00:33.899> day<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.020> think<00:00:34.290> second<00:00:34.739> half

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
substitution day I think second half

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.190 
substitution day I think second half
when<00:00:35.160> Newcastle<00:00:35.910> started<00:00:36.480> having<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> real<00:00:36.960> go

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
when Newcastle started having a real go

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.569 
when Newcastle started having a real go
got<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> bit<00:00:37.739> between<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.129> teeth<00:00:38.309> trying<00:00:38.489> to

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
got a bit between the teeth trying to

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.340 
got a bit between the teeth trying to
get<00:00:38.670> back<00:00:38.850> into<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.360> thought<00:00:39.750> Sir<00:00:39.930> Alex<00:00:40.170> made

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
get back into it I thought Sir Alex made

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.110 
get back into it I thought Sir Alex made
it<00:00:40.440> made<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> really<00:00:40.800> good<00:00:41.219> decision<00:00:41.700> he<00:00:41.940> took

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
it made a really good decision he took

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.420 
it made a really good decision he took
Kagawa<00:00:42.660> off<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:43.379> Valenti<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
Kagawa off what Valenti on just to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
Kagawa off what Valenti on just to
stretch<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.180> game<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> little<00:00:45.600> bit<00:00:45.719> wide<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
stretch the game a little bit wide and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
stretch the game a little bit wide and
Newcastle<00:00:47.039> didn't<00:00:47.309> dominate<00:00:47.460> quite<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.000> much

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
Newcastle didn't dominate quite so much

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.200 
Newcastle didn't dominate quite so much
after<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.860> yeah<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> think<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.550> made<00:00:50.789> sense

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
after that yeah I think it made sense

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.000 
after that yeah I think it made sense
really<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:51.809> cagal<00:00:52.170> Rossi<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.590> floating

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
really because cagal Rossi was floating

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.040 
really because cagal Rossi was floating
a<00:00:53.100> bit<00:00:53.250> more<00:00:53.399> coming<00:00:53.730> inside<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
a bit more coming inside and I think the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.260 
a bit more coming inside and I think the
shin<00:00:55.260> mamao<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.129> Valencia<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.850> he's<00:00:57.059> able

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
shin mamao in the Valencia is he's able

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.049 
shin mamao in the Valencia is he's able
to<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:58.020> back<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.500> support<00:00:58.920> Rafael<00:00:59.820> with

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
to get back and support Rafael with

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.819 
to get back and support Rafael with
sound<00:01:00.300> when<00:01:00.480> benef<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:01.109> starting<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
sound when benef was starting to get a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.709 
sound when benef was starting to get a
bit<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.070> an<00:01:02.129> influence<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> game<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.180> then

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
bit of an influence on the game and then

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
bit of an influence on the game and then
obviously<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.260> forward<00:01:04.890> he's<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
obviously going forward he's just a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
obviously going forward he's just a
machine<00:01:06.150> he's<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.170> difficult<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.040> him

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
machine he's very difficult to get him

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.160 
machine he's very difficult to get him
off<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> ball<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.299> thought<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> very

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
off the ball so I thought it was a very

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.230 
off the ball so I thought it was a very
clever<00:01:10.650> substitution<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> think<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
clever substitution really I think you

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.910 
clever substitution really I think you
just<00:01:12.420> took<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> wind<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.470> Newcastle

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
just took the wind out and Newcastle

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.679 
just took the wind out and Newcastle
sales<00:01:14.189> somewhat<00:01:14.700> obviously<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.570> helps

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
sales somewhat obviously it helps

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
sales somewhat obviously it helps
scoring<00:01:16.140> two<00:01:16.350> goals<00:01:16.380> from<00:01:16.740> set-pieces<00:01:17.130> two

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
scoring two goals from set-pieces two

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.340 
scoring two goals from set-pieces two
goals<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.119> seven<00:01:18.390> minutes<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.049> court<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
goals in seven minutes with in court of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.990 
goals in seven minutes with in court of
an<00:01:19.439> hour<00:01:19.530> away<00:01:19.619> from<00:01:19.740> home<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.490> find<00:01:20.729> yourself

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
an hour away from home you find yourself

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.690 
an hour away from home you find yourself
tune<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:22.049> Sir<00:01:22.259> Alex<00:01:22.650> was<00:01:23.189> actually

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
tune up I think Sir Alex was actually

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.960 
tune up I think Sir Alex was actually
playing<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.630> diamond<00:01:25.229> formation<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
playing that diamond formation and that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.539 
playing that diamond formation and that
Newcastle<00:01:27.509> couldn't<00:01:27.750> set<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:27.990> against<00:01:28.350> it

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
Newcastle couldn't set up against it

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.730 
Newcastle couldn't set up against it
yeah<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> mean<00:01:29.850> that's<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.270> was<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.960> first<00:01:31.290> 15

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
yeah I mean that's it was the first 15

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.380 
yeah I mean that's it was the first 15
20<00:01:32.070> minutes<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> was<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.729> consistent

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
20 minutes it was just consistent

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.359 
20 minutes it was just consistent
pressure<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.560> soon<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> ball<00:01:35.310> was

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
pressure and as soon as the ball was

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.219

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
played against Spurs last week when I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.149 
played against Spurs last week when I
seen<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> much<00:01:48.810> different<00:01:49.079> game<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.530> was<00:01:49.860> just

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
seen a much different game it was just

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.460 
seen a much different game it was just
great<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.119> for<00:01:51.360> us<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.840> I'm<00:01:52.170> glad

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
great to see for us and I'm glad

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.109 
great to see for us and I'm glad
cleverly<00:01:53.040> had<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.369> good<00:01:53.579> game<00:01:53.759> as<00:01:53.970> well

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
cleverly had a really good game as well

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.580 
cleverly had a really good game as well
cuz<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.390> thinking<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.990> running<00:01:55.470> that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
cuz I'm thinking of is running that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.380 
cuz I'm thinking of is running that
sounds<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.310> takes<00:01:56.579> some<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
sounds it just takes some of the

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.690 
sounds it just takes some of the
workload<00:01:57.899> off<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.170> Carrick<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:59.040> well<00:01:59.280> so

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
workload off of Carrick as well so

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.179 
workload off of Carrick as well so
hopefully<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.719> forward<00:02:01.110> that'll<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
hopefully going forward that'll be the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.380 
hopefully going forward that'll be the
way<00:02:02.369> we're<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> try<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:02.909> play<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> bit

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
way we're going to try and play a bit

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.359 
way we're going to try and play a bit
more<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.810> think<00:02:04.380> also<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.799> helped<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.219> today

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
more I think also what helped you today

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.789 
more I think also what helped you today
was<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> formation<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.990> Newcastle<00:02:07.590> head<00:02:07.710> as

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
was the formation that Newcastle head as

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.249 
was the formation that Newcastle head as
well<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.039> went<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.429> 42<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.810> trying<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> fit

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
well they went for 42 it's trying to fit

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.410 
well they went for 42 it's trying to fit
bar<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.770> CJ<00:02:11.190> into<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> same<00:02:11.760> team<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.180> don't

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
bar and CJ into the same team I don't

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.610 
bar and CJ into the same team I don't
think<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.690> helps<00:02:12.959> them

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
think it helps them

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.839 
think it helps them
after<00:02:13.799> in<00:02:13.920> there<00:02:14.069> as<00:02:14.190> well<00:02:14.220> very<00:02:14.610> lightweight

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
after in there as well very lightweight

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.580 
after in there as well very lightweight
and<00:02:15.150> really<00:02:15.480> with<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.659> back<00:02:15.959> five<00:02:16.290> their<00:02:16.500> head

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
and really with the back five their head

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.320 
and really with the back five their head
out<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.890> back<00:02:16.920> fall<00:02:17.340> there<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:17.670> need<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> bit

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
out the back fall there that need a bit

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.940 
out the back fall there that need a bit
more<00:02:18.360> protection<00:02:18.690> once<00:02:19.230> man<00:02:19.440> united<00:02:19.799> got

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
more protection once man united got

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.470 
more protection once man united got

those two goals the marking from

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
those two goals the marking from

time I saw out for it was it was a week

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.759 
time I saw out for it was it was a week
back<00:02:36.959> for<00:02:37.260> for<00:02:37.650> them<00:02:37.829> so<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.370> didn't<00:02:38.849> seem<00:02:39.090> too

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
back for for them so it didn't seem too

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.600 
back for for them so it didn't seem too
particularly<00:02:40.769> strong<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.280> them<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.519> have

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
particularly strong for them to have

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.520 
particularly strong for them to have
only<00:02:41.819> T<00:02:42.180> old<00:02:42.329> say<00:02:42.569> kind<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:42.959> sitting<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.290> front

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
only T old say kind of sitting in front

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.080 
only T old say kind of sitting in front
of<00:02:43.739> them<00:02:43.829> he<00:02:43.950> did<00:02:44.129> seem<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.489> make<00:02:44.610> more<00:02:44.819> sense

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
of them he did seem to make more sense

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.270 
of them he did seem to make more sense
that<00:02:45.420> about<00:02:45.540> somebody<00:02:46.470> else<00:02:46.799> in<00:02:47.040> there

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
that about somebody else in there

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.099 
that about somebody else in there
supporting<00:02:47.879> him<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.150> obviously<00:02:48.569> for<00:02:48.870> once

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
supporting him and obviously for once

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.780 
supporting him and obviously for once
we've<00:02:49.349> taken<00:02:49.620> advantage<00:02:50.099> of<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.430> where<00:02:50.640> was

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
we've taken advantage of that where was

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.670 
we've taken advantage of that where was
in<00:02:50.970> recent<00:02:51.180> weeks<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:51.780> been<00:02:51.840> live<00:02:52.470> way

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
in recent weeks it's been live way

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.199 
in recent weeks it's been live way
around<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.579> other<00:02:53.730> teams<00:02:53.970> have<00:02:54.090> been

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
around and the other teams have been

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.819 
around and the other teams have been
taking<00:02:54.569> advantage<00:02:54.599> of<00:02:54.930> our<00:02:55.049> weakness<00:02:55.560> there

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
taking advantage of our weakness there

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.770 
taking advantage of our weakness there
so<00:02:56.129> it's<00:02:56.790> Nassif<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.239> other<00:02:57.359> side<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.569> that

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
so it's Nassif on the other side of that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.949 
so it's Nassif on the other side of that
once<00:02:58.109> Steve<00:02:58.829> developing<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.430> we<00:02:59.730> sir<00:03:00.540> alex<00:03:00.810> he

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
once Steve developing is we sir alex he

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.800 
once Steve developing is we sir alex he
buys<00:03:01.200> robin<00:03:01.799> van<00:03:01.920> persie<00:03:02.000> saying<00:03:03.000> there's<00:03:03.209> 25

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.080 
goalscorers now and it's nice we're
starting<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.459> spread<00:03:20.669> them<00:03:20.849> out<00:03:20.940> again

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
starting to spread them out again

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.990 
starting to spread them out again
because<00:03:21.569> after<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.370> Ronaldo<00:03:23.370> when<00:03:23.579> it<00:03:23.730> seems

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
because after and Ronaldo when it seems

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.879 
because after and Ronaldo when it seems
to<00:03:24.150> drop<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.389> lot<00:03:24.720> on<00:03:24.900> Seward's<00:03:25.380> Rooney

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
to drop a lot on Seward's Rooney

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.039 
to drop a lot on Seward's Rooney
shoulders<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.669> deliver<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.480> goals<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.959> I

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
shoulders to deliver the goals and I

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.020 
shoulders to deliver the goals and I
think<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.470> had<00:03:28.919> an<00:03:29.040> effect<00:03:29.099> on<00:03:29.430> his<00:03:29.579> overall

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
think that had an effect on his overall

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.659 
think that had an effect on his overall
game<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.629> now<00:03:30.780> he's<00:03:30.959> got<00:03:31.169> a<00:03:31.200> bit<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.829> bit<00:03:32.549> of

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
game and now he's got a bit of a bit of

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:34.339 
game and now he's got a bit of a bit of
more<00:03:32.819> options<00:03:33.239> there<00:03:33.480> we've<00:03:33.660> Welbeck<00:03:34.139> van

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
more options there we've Welbeck van

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.039 
more options there we've Welbeck van
Persie<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:35.340> others<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.299> can<00:03:36.419> step<00:03:36.690> up<00:03:36.840> and

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
Persie and others that can step up and

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.839 
Persie and others that can step up and
score<00:03:37.349> goals<00:03:37.379> I<00:03:37.859> think<00:03:38.099> it<00:03:38.220> allows<00:03:38.400> Rooney<00:03:38.760> to

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
score goals I think it allows Rooney to

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.280 
score goals I think it allows Rooney to
play<00:03:39.030> more<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.269> his<00:03:39.450> own<00:03:39.599> game<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:39.900> not<00:03:40.169> have

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
play more of his own game and not have

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.439 
play more of his own game and not have
to<00:03:40.560> stress<00:03:40.799> out<00:03:41.400> sooo<00:03:41.730> much<00:03:41.910> about<00:03:42.120> try<00:03:42.329> and

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
to stress out sooo much about try and

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.420 
to stress out sooo much about try and
deliver<00:03:42.629> on<00:03:42.900> all<00:03:42.930> fronts<00:03:43.290> for<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.919> think<00:03:44.250> that's

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
deliver on all fronts for I think that's

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.129 
deliver on all fronts for I think that's
the<00:03:44.609> type<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.819> game<00:03:45.030> trying<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.540> do<00:03:45.870> now<00:03:46.079> and

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
wasn't totally convinced with the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.340 
wasn't totally convinced with the
performance<00:04:52.120> midweek<00:04:52.420> she<00:04:52.750> thinks<00:04:52.960> sir<00:04:53.050> Alex

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
performance midweek she thinks sir Alex

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.370 
performance midweek she thinks sir Alex
made<00:04:53.740> go<00:04:54.040> with<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.880> diamond<00:04:55.210> formation<00:04:55.510> when

he has to entertain European opposition

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.870 
he has to entertain European opposition
as<00:04:58.120> well<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.800> think<00:04:59.800> I<00:04:59.920> think<00:05:00.130> long-term<00:05:00.310> yes

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
as well I think I think long-term yes

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.790 
as well I think I think long-term yes
and<00:05:01.270> you'll<00:05:01.420> depend<00:05:01.810> a<00:05:01.960> lot<00:05:02.110> on<00:05:02.170> the<00:05:02.590> the

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
and you'll depend a lot on the the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.680 
and you'll depend a lot on the the
opposition<00:05:03.250> we're<00:05:03.370> playing<00:05:03.610> as<00:05:03.850> well<00:05:04.060> but<00:05:04.390> it

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
opposition we're playing as well but it

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.510 
opposition we're playing as well but it
does<00:05:04.960> seem<00:05:05.170> to<00:05:05.230> be<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.590> way<00:05:05.830> we're<00:05:06.010> trying<00:05:06.280> to

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
does seem to be the way we're trying to

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.640 
does seem to be the way we're trying to
see<00:05:06.670> were<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:07.450> change<00:05:07.720> now<00:05:08.080> mean<00:05:08.290> he<00:05:08.410> looks

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
see were to change now mean he looks

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.100 
see were to change now mean he looks
like<00:05:08.830> nanny<00:05:09.070> could<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:09.610> could<00:05:10.480> be<00:05:10.630> away<00:05:10.840> by

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
like nanny could and could be away by

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.370 
like nanny could and could be away by
this<00:05:11.830> nigga<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.640> sauna<00:05:12.850> coming<00:05:13.210> up<00:05:13.360> so<00:05:13.840> it

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
this nigga to sauna coming up so it

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.020 
this nigga to sauna coming up so it
wouldn't<00:05:14.680> surprise<00:05:14.770> me<00:05:15.010> if<00:05:15.280> it'll<00:05:15.610> start<00:05:15.910> to

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
wouldn't surprise me if it'll start to

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.230 
wouldn't surprise me if it'll start to
persist<00:05:16.450> with<00:05:16.660> that<00:05:16.870> we<00:05:17.020> do<00:05:17.170> see<00:05:17.410> more<00:05:17.650> of<00:05:17.860> and

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
persist with that we do see more of and

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.730 
persist with that we do see more of and
cleverly<00:05:19.240> alongside<00:05:19.510> Kari<00:05:20.080> command<00:05:20.620> may<00:05:20.680> be

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
cleverly alongside Kari command may be

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.460 
cleverly alongside Kari command may be
ruining<00:05:21.100> a<00:05:21.130> bit<00:05:21.280> more<00:05:21.460> withdrawn<00:05:21.970> so<00:05:22.480> I<00:05:22.810> think

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
ruining a bit more withdrawn so I think

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.960 
ruining a bit more withdrawn so I think
it'll<00:05:23.620> take<00:05:23.710> time<00:05:24.040> to<00:05:24.250> work<00:05:24.460> because<00:05:24.790> it's<00:05:24.910> a

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
it'll take time to work because it's a

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.750 
it'll take time to work because it's a
new<00:05:25.150> formation<00:05:25.570> for<00:05:25.960> everybody<00:05:26.290> but<00:05:26.650> I<00:05:26.980> think

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
new formation for everybody but I think

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.000 
new formation for everybody but I think
we'll<00:05:27.940> it<00:05:28.360> slowly<00:05:28.930> but<00:05:29.200> surely<00:05:29.500> become<00:05:29.800> the

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
we'll it slowly but surely become the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.970 
we'll it slowly but surely become the
the<00:05:30.340> defacto<00:05:30.940> way<00:05:31.240> of<00:05:31.360> playing<00:05:31.570> for<00:05:31.870> us<00:05:31.980> okay

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
the defacto way of playing for us okay
