00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.449 
oddest reason I don't even know what he
was<00:02:03.789> I<00:02:04.090> think<00:02:04.119> he<00:02:04.660> missed<00:02:04.929> clicked<00:02:05.259> I<00:02:05.500> don't

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
was I think he missed clicked I don't

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:07.949 
was I think he missed clicked I don't
know<00:02:06.580> how<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.759> explain<00:02:06.970> that<00:02:07.239> one<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:07.780> instead

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
know how to explain that one so instead

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.979 
know how to explain that one so instead
of<00:02:08.020> my<00:02:08.140> stealth<00:02:08.410> rocks<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.979> he<00:02:09.039> stays<00:02:09.340> in

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
of my stealth rocks and he stays in

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.630 
of my stealth rocks and he stays in
which<00:02:10.989> was<00:02:11.200> cool<00:02:11.410> but<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.069> guess<00:02:12.250> he<00:02:12.280> wants<00:02:12.580> to

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
which was cool but I guess he wants to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.400 
which was cool but I guess he wants to
stay<00:02:12.879> in<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.510> he<00:02:13.599> can<00:02:13.750> sweep<00:02:14.080> me<00:02:14.260> with<00:02:14.379> a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
stay in so that he can sweep me with a

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.619 
stay in so that he can sweep me with a
rock<00:02:14.650> polishing<00:02:15.220> donphan<00:02:15.700> because<00:02:16.480> this

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
rock polishing donphan because this

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.479 
rock polishing donphan because this
banded<00:02:17.230> waterville<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:17.890> not<00:02:18.099> going<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.370> do

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
banded waterville is not going to do

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.140 
banded waterville is not going to do
much<00:02:18.780> pisses<00:02:19.780> me<00:02:19.900> off<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.500> he<00:02:21.190> wakes<00:02:21.640> up<00:02:21.940> this

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
much pisses me off and he wakes up this

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.449 
much pisses me off and he wakes up this
turn<00:02:22.450> I'm<00:02:22.720> a<00:02:22.810> little<00:02:23.019> ahead<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.230> myself<00:02:23.459> it

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
turn I'm a little ahead of myself it

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.280 
turn I'm a little ahead of myself it
wakes<00:02:24.640> up<00:02:24.910> gets<00:02:25.150> an<00:02:25.269> earthquake<00:02:25.629> off<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.200> I

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
wakes up gets an earthquake off and I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.440 
wakes up gets an earthquake off and I
don't<00:02:26.530> think<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.099> carvanha<00:02:27.879> is<00:02:28.150> going<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.360> be

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
don't think that carvanha is going to be

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.710 
don't think that carvanha is going to be
able<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:29.129> yeah<00:02:30.129> not<00:02:30.340> really<00:02:30.400> Nemo<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.420> going<00:02:31.660> to

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
able to yeah not really Nemo is going to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.530 
able to yeah not really Nemo is going to
faint<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.610> I've<00:02:33.760> only<00:02:33.910> got<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.120> couple<00:02:34.300> options

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
faint so I've only got a couple options

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.750 
faint so I've only got a couple options
left<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.530> go<00:02:35.560> into<00:02:35.830> Logan<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> sister

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
left and I go into Logan the sister

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.050 
left and I go into Logan the sister
because<00:02:37.180> Logan<00:02:37.510> sister<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> blob<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.970> was

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
because Logan sister is a blob and I was

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.309 
because Logan sister is a blob and I was
going<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.269> go<00:02:40.360> for<00:02:40.480> earthquake<00:02:40.900> doesn't<00:02:41.260> do

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
going to go for earthquake doesn't do

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.069 
going to go for earthquake doesn't do
too<00:02:41.499> much<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:41.980> get<00:02:42.189> the<00:02:42.219> stock<00:02:42.640> pile<00:02:42.939> up<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
too much but I get the stock pile up and

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.540 
too much but I get the stock pile up and
that<00:02:44.349> means<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.650> can<00:02:44.890> survive

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
that means I can survive

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.270 
that means I can survive
two<00:02:45.700> or<00:02:46.210> one<00:02:46.600> something<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.040> don't
