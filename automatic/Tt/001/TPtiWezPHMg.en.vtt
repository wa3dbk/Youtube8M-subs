what everyone wants to see where they

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.459 
what everyone wants to see where they
can<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.300> offense<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> often<00:00:37.140> scant

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
can do it the offense the often scant

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
can do it the offense the often scant
get<00:00:37.590> any<00:00:37.770> worse<00:00:37.950> seems<00:00:38.399> we've<00:00:38.579> been<00:00:38.700> saying

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
get any worse seems we've been saying

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
get any worse seems we've been saying
that<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.719> three<00:00:39.750> or<00:00:40.020> four<00:00:40.050> years<00:00:40.410> now<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that for three or four years now and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.420 
that for three or four years now and
it's<00:00:41.309> skies<00:00:42.149> burn<00:00:42.510> everything<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.430> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it's skies burn everything so the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.970 
it's skies burn everything so the
defense<00:00:44.820> has<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> solid<00:00:45.690> foundation<00:00:46.050> not<00:00:46.829> only

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
defense has a solid foundation not only

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.369 
defense has a solid foundation not only
with<00:00:47.160> players<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.270> scheme<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.079> Jeff

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
with players but the scheme that Jeff

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.990 
with players but the scheme that Jeff
Collins<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.950> terminology<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.700> Jeff

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
Collins and the terminology that Jeff

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.060 
Collins and the terminology that Jeff
Collins<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.449> using<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.960> similar<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.890> there's

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
Collins is using is similar and there's

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.500 
Collins is using is similar and there's
a<00:00:53.160> lot<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.370> stuff<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:53.699> carrying<00:00:54.149> over<00:00:54.360> from

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510

you<00:05:36.400> know<00:05:36.490> which<00:05:36.699> has<00:05:36.849> allowed<00:05:37.120> us<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:39.610> know

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
you know which has allowed us you know

you know which has allowed us you know
to<00:05:39.789> play<00:05:40.030> a<00:05:40.360> lot<00:05:40.539> of<00:05:40.690> different<00:05:40.720> personnel

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
to play a lot of different personnel

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.939 
to play a lot of different personnel
groups<00:05:41.650> defensively<00:05:42.340> as<00:05:42.580> we<00:05:42.820> match<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.949> part

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
groups defensively as we match and part

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.210 
groups defensively as we match and part
of<00:05:45.039> what<00:05:45.160> you<00:05:45.340> try<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.639> do<00:05:46.710> offensively<00:05:47.710> is

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
of what you try to do offensively is

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.540 
of what you try to do offensively is
give<00:05:48.580> as<00:05:48.760> many<00:05:48.940> different<00:05:49.630> type<00:05:49.900> looks<00:05:50.370> so<00:05:51.370> the

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
give as many different type looks so the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.070 
give as many different type looks so the
defense<00:05:52.090> has<00:05:53.080> a<00:05:53.110> chance<00:05:53.760> to<00:05:54.760> play<00:05:55.690> against

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
defense has a chance to play against

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.450 
defense has a chance to play against
those<00:05:56.229> because<00:05:56.500> you<00:05:56.620> never<00:05:56.830> know<00:05:56.949> when<00:05:57.280> they

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
those because you never know when they

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.089 
those because you never know when they
come<00:05:57.639> up<00:05:57.849> so<00:05:58.599> for<00:05:58.840> example<00:05:58.870> today<00:05:59.440> was<00:05:59.800> heavy

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 
come up so for example today was heavy

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.170 
come up so for example today was heavy
stacks<00:06:00.580> and<00:06:00.849> bunches<00:06:01.360> with<00:06:01.840> motions<00:06:02.940> this<00:06:03.940> was

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
stacks and bunches with motions this was

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.320 
stacks and bunches with motions this was
the<00:06:04.210> first<00:06:04.330> day<00:06:04.659> we<00:06:04.930> traded<00:06:05.380> you<00:06:05.889> know<00:06:06.330> Yahoo

nah suit and all that kind of stuff with
the<00:06:10.090> tight<00:06:10.300> ends<00:06:10.539> so<00:06:11.320> we<00:06:11.560> started<00:06:11.889> an

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
the tight ends so we started an

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.800 
the tight ends so we started an

unbalanced tomorrow we'll give someone
true<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:14.320> balanced<00:06:14.770> so<00:06:15.039> you<00:06:15.130> try<00:06:15.520> to<00:06:15.930> match

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
true and balanced so you try to match

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.730 
true and balanced so you try to match
what<00:06:17.409> you<00:06:17.590> do<00:06:17.770> to<00:06:17.949> build<00:06:18.250> your<00:06:18.930> PlayBook<00:06:19.930> build

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
what you do to build your PlayBook build

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.760 
what you do to build your PlayBook build
your<00:06:20.919> toolbox<00:06:21.810> offensively<00:06:22.810> yet<00:06:23.470> at<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:23.740> same

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
your toolbox offensively yet at the same

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.670 
your toolbox offensively yet at the same
time<00:06:24.120> then<00:06:25.120> it<00:06:25.360> matches<00:06:25.900> what<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.200> defense

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
time then it matches what the defense

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.290 
time then it matches what the defense
has<00:06:26.889> no

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
has no

in that day so they have an opportunity
to<00:06:29.879> work<00:06:30.210> on<00:06:30.449> it<00:06:30.599> so<00:06:30.810> it's<00:06:30.960> not<00:06:31.139> like<00:06:31.409> something

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 
to work on it so it's not like something

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.620 
to work on it so it's not like something
new<00:06:32.280> when<00:06:32.639> you<00:06:32.759> get<00:06:32.970> into<00:06:33.120> you<00:06:33.870> know<00:06:33.930> fall<00:06:34.319> camp
