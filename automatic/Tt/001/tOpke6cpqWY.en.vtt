we<00:00:00.269> are<00:00:00.390> asked<00:00:00.840> what<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.620> the<00:00:01.800> difference

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
we are asked what is the difference

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.080 
we are asked what is the difference
between<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.360> polar<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.940> non-polar<00:00:05.940> bond<00:00:06.779> and

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
between a polar and a non-polar bond and

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
covalent bond the bond in which two

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.400 
covalent bond the bond in which two
hydrogen<00:00:21.060> atoms<00:00:21.270> share<00:00:21.890> a<00:00:22.890> pair<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.550> electrons

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
hydrogen atoms share a pair of electrons

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.299 
hydrogen atoms share a pair of electrons

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.540

at<00:01:39.330> another<00:01:39.420> example<00:01:39.660> of<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.800> non-polar<00:01:41.460> bond

at another example of a non-polar bond
when<00:01:44.550> we<00:01:44.789> draw<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.060> lewis<00:01:45.509> structure<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
when we draw the lewis structure for the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:55.010 
when we draw the lewis structure for the
molecule<00:01:47.540> cl2

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.080 

we<00:01:56.020> have<00:01:56.140> 14<00:01:56.680> valence<00:01:56.950> electrons<00:01:57.790> because

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
we have 14 valence electrons because

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.340 
we have 14 valence electrons because
chlorine<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.900> in<00:01:59.050> group<00:01:59.230> 7<00:01:59.860> a<00:02:00.100> or<00:02:00.310> 17<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.350> we

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
chlorine is in group 7 a or 17 and we

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.880 
chlorine is in group 7 a or 17 and we
can<00:02:02.530> make<00:02:02.650> octet<00:02:03.130> in<00:02:03.520> exactly<00:02:03.970> that<00:02:04.210> manner

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
can make octet in exactly that manner

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.850 
can make octet in exactly that manner
well<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.010> can<00:02:06.190> say<00:02:06.370> exactly<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.510> same<00:02:07.540> thing

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
well we can say exactly the same thing

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:20.480 
well we can say exactly the same thing
about<00:02:08.860> CL<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:10.770> each<00:02:11.770> nucleus<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:13.350> identical

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.540 

and<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.900> we<00:02:23.140> can<00:02:23.320> make<00:02:23.470> exactly<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.310> same

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
and so we can make exactly the same

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.540 
and so we can make exactly the same
statement<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:26.230> electrons<00:02:26.800> are<00:02:26.800> evenly

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
statement the electrons are evenly

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.290 
statement the electrons are evenly
shared<00:02:28.530> there<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.680> no<00:02:29.920> preference<00:02:30.640> for<00:02:31.060> one

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
shared there is no preference for one

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.260 
shared there is no preference for one
chlorine<00:02:31.630> nucleus<00:02:32.320> over<00:02:32.710> another<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
chlorine nucleus over another and

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.560 
chlorine nucleus over another and
therefore<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.840> also<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.710> a<00:02:36.030> non-polar<00:02:37.030> bond

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
therefore this also is a non-polar bond

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.690 
therefore this also is a non-polar bond
but<00:02:40.570> now<00:02:40.810> let's<00:02:41.530> look<00:02:41.830> at<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.220> molecule

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
but now let's look at the molecule

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.810 
but now let's look at the molecule
formed<00:02:43.360> when<00:02:43.660> h2<00:02:44.200> reacts<00:02:44.890> with<00:02:45.160> cl<00:02:45.610> 2<00:02:46.050> namely<00:02:47.050> h

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.520

CL<00:02:51.270> once<00:02:52.270> again<00:02:52.480> we<00:02:52.959> draw<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.170> lewis

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.780 
CL once again we draw the lewis
structure<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:57.940> so<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.830> we<00:02:59.830> think<00:03:00.100> about<00:03:00.459> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
structure like so and we think about the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.940 
structure like so and we think about the
distribution<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.720> nuclear<00:03:02.350> char<00:03:02.770> of

distribution of nuclear char of
electronic<00:03:03.640> charge<00:03:05.340> now<00:03:06.340> hydrogen<00:03:08.040> has<00:03:09.040> a

to the hydrogen nucleus therefore this

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.850

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:27.200 

and<00:05:24.689> we<00:05:24.900> can<00:05:25.080> symbolize<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.740> in<00:05:26.490> a<00:05:26.849> number<00:05:27.060> of

and we can symbolize that in a number of
ways<00:05:29.810> one<00:05:30.810> way<00:05:30.840> is<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:32.219> draw<00:05:32.729> the<00:05:32.789> molecule<00:05:34.669> and

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
ways one way is to draw the molecule and

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.459 
ways one way is to draw the molecule and
give<00:05:37.710> a<00:05:38.129> small<00:05:38.849> partial<00:05:39.599> charge<00:05:40.879> to<00:05:41.879> each

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:42.469 
give a small partial charge to each

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:46.189 
give a small partial charge to each
nucleus<00:05:44.210> reminding<00:05:45.210> ourselves<00:05:45.330> that<00:05:45.900> there

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
nucleus reminding ourselves that there

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.309 
nucleus reminding ourselves that there
will<00:05:46.319> be<00:05:46.469> a<00:05:46.500> slight<00:05:46.979> negative<00:05:47.460> charge<00:05:48.319> around

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
will be a slight negative charge around

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.610 
will be a slight negative charge around
the<00:05:49.710> chlorine<00:05:50.129> and<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.930> deficit<00:05:51.930> of<00:05:52.020> electrons

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
the chlorine and a deficit of electrons

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.969 
the chlorine and a deficit of electrons
and<00:05:52.949> therefore<00:05:53.340> a<00:05:53.370> positive<00:05:54.000> charge<00:05:54.300> around

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
and therefore a positive charge around

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.010 
and therefore a positive charge around
hydrogen<00:05:55.979> this<00:05:56.190> is<00:05:56.340> not<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:56.550> full<00:05:56.969> positive<00:05:57.840> or

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.600 
hydrogen this is not a full positive or
negative<00:05:58.199> charge<00:05:58.710> we're<00:05:59.039> not<00:05:59.190> talking<00:05:59.490> about

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
negative charge we're not talking about

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.080 
negative charge we're not talking about

ions present in gaseous HCl it has no

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.950 
ions present in gaseous HCl it has no
ions<00:06:03.479> but<00:06:04.139> it<00:06:04.289> is<00:06:04.440> strongly<00:06:05.250> polar<00:06:05.719> so<00:06:06.719> the

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
ions but it is strongly polar so the

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.119 
ions but it is strongly polar so the
electrons<00:06:07.860> are<00:06:08.479> distributed<00:06:09.479> in<00:06:09.599> that<00:06:09.810> way

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:10.129 
electrons are distributed in that way

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:18.920 
electrons are distributed in that way
another<00:06:11.129> way<00:06:11.340> is<00:06:11.840> to<00:06:12.840> draw<00:06:13.379> a<00:06:13.620> dipole<00:06:17.930> these

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
another way is to draw a dipole these

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:33.370 
another way is to draw a dipole these
really<00:06:19.319> have<00:06:19.500> the<00:06:19.650> same<00:06:19.919> meaning

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.090 

a<00:06:33.910> dipole<00:06:34.910> shows<00:06:35.840> the<00:06:36.290> distribution<00:06:36.440> of

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
a dipole shows the distribution of

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.730 
a dipole shows the distribution of
charge<00:06:37.460> with<00:06:38.330> the<00:06:38.360> positive<00:06:38.960> end<00:06:39.170> as<00:06:39.470> you<00:06:39.560> can

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
charge with the positive end as you can

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.770 
charge with the positive end as you can
see<00:06:40.010> that's<00:06:40.340> a<00:06:40.490> plus<00:06:40.700> sign<00:06:41.090> and<00:06:41.390> the<00:06:41.480> tail<00:06:41.750> of

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
see that's a plus sign and the tail of

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.350 
see that's a plus sign and the tail of
the<00:06:41.990> arrow<00:06:42.460> towards<00:06:43.460> the<00:06:43.580> hydrogen<00:06:44.150> and<00:06:44.300> the

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
the arrow towards the hydrogen and the
