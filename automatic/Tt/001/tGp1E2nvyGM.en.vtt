00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
zone there's instructions at the back of

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.290 
zone there's instructions at the back of
them<00:00:44.749> both<00:00:45.050> packages<00:00:46.030> it's<00:00:47.030> quite

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
them both packages it's quite

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.360 
them both packages it's quite
straightforward<00:00:47.539> for<00:00:48.170> example<00:00:48.679> dependent<00:00:49.309> on

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
straightforward for example dependent on

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.700 
straightforward for example dependent on
obviously<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.929> length<00:00:51.109> of<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.379> hair<00:00:51.559> and

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
obviously and the length of the hair and

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.410 
obviously and the length of the hair and
things<00:00:51.920> like<00:00:52.069> that<00:00:52.129> it<00:00:52.670> depends<00:00:52.909> on<00:00:53.030> how<00:00:53.239> much

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
things like that it depends on how much

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.349 
things like that it depends on how much
powder<00:00:53.719> and<00:00:54.140> liquid<00:00:54.679> peroxide<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.789> you<00:00:56.210> mix

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
powder and liquid peroxide and you mix

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.599 
powder and liquid peroxide and you mix
together<00:00:56.569> but<00:00:57.350> at<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.499> moment<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:58.309> think<00:00:58.519> I

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
together but at the moment I think I

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.369 
together but at the moment I think I
start<00:00:58.850> off<00:00:58.969> by<00:00:59.120> just<00:00:59.149> putting<00:00:59.479> two<00:00:59.749> scoops<00:01:00.170> but

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
start off by just putting two scoops but

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.079 
start off by just putting two scoops but
I<00:01:00.409> later<00:01:00.679> find<00:01:01.039> that<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:01.429> is<00:01:01.579> not<00:01:01.729> enough<00:01:01.940> so

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
I later find that this is not enough so

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.660 
I later find that this is not enough so
i<00:01:02.120> have<00:01:02.359> to<00:01:02.479> add<00:01:02.600> some<00:01:02.809> more<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.250> i<00:01:04.250> just<00:01:04.549> like

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
i have to add some more and i just like

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.210 
i have to add some more and i just like
she<00:01:04.790> mix<00:01:04.940> it<00:01:05.150> into<00:01:05.299> quite<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.020> bit<00:01:06.409> consistency

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
she mix it into quite a bit consistency

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.060 
she mix it into quite a bit consistency
thick<00:01:07.549> but<00:01:07.760> not<00:01:07.790> too<00:01:08.240> thick<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:09.070> spreadable

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
thick but not too thick and spreadable

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.800 
thick but not too thick and spreadable
thick<00:01:10.420> as<00:01:11.420> i<00:01:11.630> say<00:01:11.890> so<00:01:12.890> but<00:01:13.700> but<00:01:14.090> before<00:01:14.390> i<00:01:14.420> start

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
thick as i say so but but before i start

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.770

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.110 

I<00:02:14.540> keep<00:02:15.540> mixing<00:02:15.780> until<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.319> feel<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.940> a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
I keep mixing until I feel it's a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.000
