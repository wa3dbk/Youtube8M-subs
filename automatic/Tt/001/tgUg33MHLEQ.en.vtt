like newspaper on the floor and that's

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.560 
like newspaper on the floor and that's
just<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.280> polish<00:02:19.730> doesn't<00:02:20.000> go<00:02:20.090> everywhere<00:02:20.510> and

shiny like that

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.159 
shiny like that
be<00:05:22.339> careful<00:05:22.789> that<00:05:22.819> you<00:05:22.969> don't<00:05:23.180> scratch<00:05:23.899> off

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169
