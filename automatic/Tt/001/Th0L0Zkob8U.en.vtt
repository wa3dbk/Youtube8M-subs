00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.270
 first in the center of the shirt and 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.790
 then connect with the diagonals that go 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.280

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.350
 that provokes you in the chest as a species 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.140
 of a maximum already leaving the neck of the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.140
 Free and short shirt very carefully 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.640

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.390

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.970
 about 2 centimeters approximately open 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.310
 several solitos on the edge of each side 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.780
 of the shirt this thinking parallel 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.819
