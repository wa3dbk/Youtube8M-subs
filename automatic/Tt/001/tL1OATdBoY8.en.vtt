positioned reflectors on the surface of
the<00:00:36.060> moon<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:36.480> gonna<00:00:36.570> shoot<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.930> laser

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the moon and we're gonna shoot a laser

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.990 
the moon and we're gonna shoot a laser
off<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.890> them<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.280> let<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.520> light<00:00:38.670> bounce

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
off one of them and let the light bounce

cool<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:43.380> question<00:00:43.830> how<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.000> sure<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
cool one question how can you be sure it

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.279 
cool one question how can you be sure it
won't<00:00:45.449> blow<00:00:45.600> up<00:00:45.629> uh<00:00:46.699> a<00:00:47.699> laser<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.600> moon

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.060 

see<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.519> man<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:54.089> penny

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
see now this is a man for penny

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.270 
see now this is a man for penny
that's<00:00:57.060> a<00:00:57.300> great<00:00:57.570> question<00:00:57.810> Zach<00:00:58.380> no<00:00:58.860> it's<00:00:59.070> not

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that's a great question Zach no it's not

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.210 
that's a great question Zach no it's not
Sheldon<00:01:00.120> play<00:01:00.990> nice<00:01:01.230> what's<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:01.920> great

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
Sheldon play nice what's not a great

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.920 
Sheldon play nice what's not a great
question<00:01:02.880> how<00:01:03.180> could<00:01:03.330> somebody<00:01:03.540> possibly

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
question how could somebody possibly

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.180 
question how could somebody possibly
think<00:01:04.559> we're<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.949> blow<00:01:05.190> up<00:01:05.340> the<00:01:05.520> moon

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
think we're going to blow up the moon

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.740 
think we're going to blow up the moon
that's<00:01:08.190> a<00:01:08.400> great<00:01:08.580> question

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
that's a great question

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.390 
that's a great question
don't<00:01:11.750> worry<00:01:11.930> about<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.350> moon<00:01:12.500> we<00:01:12.710> we<00:01:13.010> set<00:01:13.250> our

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
don't worry about the moon we we set our

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.280 
don't worry about the moon we we set our
laser<00:01:13.550> to<00:01:13.880> stun

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
laser to stun

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.940 
laser to stun
smart<00:01:16.810> now<00:01:17.810> we'll<00:01:18.080> be<00:01:18.200> able<00:01:18.230> to<00:01:18.470> see<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.800> beam

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
smart now we'll be able to see the beam

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.170 
smart now we'll be able to see the beam
when<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:19.220> leaves<00:01:19.460> but<00:01:19.730> it<00:01:19.790> won't<00:01:19.940> be<00:01:20.030> strong

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
when it leaves but it won't be strong

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.700 
when it leaves but it won't be strong
enough<00:01:20.420> when<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:20.690> comes<00:01:20.900> back<00:01:21.110> to<00:01:21.170> be<00:01:21.410> seen<00:01:21.560> by

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
enough when it comes back to be seen by

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.390 
enough when it comes back to be seen by
the<00:01:21.770> naked<00:01:21.920> eye

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400

right<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:29.430> yet<00:01:29.610> funny<00:01:30.680> job<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.490> device

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
right now yet funny job that device

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.639 
right now yet funny job that device
there<00:01:33.180> will<00:01:33.570> measure<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> photons<00:01:34.500> that

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
there will measure the photons that

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:35.840 
there will measure the photons that
return<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.220> let<00:01:35.369> us<00:01:35.460> see<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.729> this

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
return and let us see it on this

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.899 
return and let us see it on this

make<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.890> so

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.459 

there<00:01:55.679> it<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.950> there's<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> spike<00:01:57.469> 2.5

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
there it is there's the spike 2.5

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.719 
there it is there's the spike 2.5
seconds<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> light<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.159> return<00:01:59.490> that's

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729

experiment

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.710 
experiment
I'll<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.649> her<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> line<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> stream<00:02:08.720> yeah

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
I'll have her a line on the stream yeah

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.440 
I'll have her a line on the stream yeah
but<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> think<00:02:10.590> about<00:02:11.009> what<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.489> represents

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
but I think about what this represents

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.240 
but I think about what this represents
the<00:02:12.750> fact<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.110> we<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.379> do<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> only

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
the fact that we can do this is the only

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.190 
the fact that we can do this is the only
way<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.760> definitively<00:02:15.420> proving<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.049> there

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
way of definitively proving that there

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.589 
way of definitively proving that there
are<00:02:16.230> man-made<00:02:16.319> objects<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.610> moon<00:02:17.849> put

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
are man-made objects on the moon put

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.150 
are man-made objects on the moon put
there<00:02:18.780> by<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.959> member<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.500> species<00:02:19.739> at<00:02:20.040> only

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
there by a member of a species at only

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.949 
there by a member of a species at only
60<00:02:20.580> years<00:02:20.610> before<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.360> invented<00:02:21.870> the
