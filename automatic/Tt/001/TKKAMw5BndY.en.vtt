00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.460 
quite a few battles and I got to say
they<00:03:18.770> didn't<00:03:19.100> all<00:03:19.280> go<00:03:19.520> very<00:03:19.880> well<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.300> think<00:03:20.470> it

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
they didn't all go very well I think it

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.590 
they didn't all go very well I think it
depends<00:03:21.920> on<00:03:22.250> what<00:03:22.610> pets<00:03:22.910> you're<00:03:23.239> facing

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
depends on what pets you're facing

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.620 
depends on what pets you're facing
because<00:03:24.350> every<00:03:24.800> single<00:03:25.130> pet<00:03:25.340> has<00:03:25.630> advantages

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
because every single pet has advantages

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.900 
because every single pet has advantages
and<00:03:26.900> disadvantages<00:03:27.709> over<00:03:28.190> other<00:03:28.459> certain

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
and disadvantages over other certain

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.490 
and disadvantages over other certain
types<00:03:29.150> of<00:03:29.330> pets<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.930> they<00:03:30.290> all<00:03:30.470> have

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
types of pets and they all have

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.530 
types of pets and they all have
different<00:03:30.920> abilities<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:32.000> don't<00:03:32.300> get

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
different abilities and you don't get

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.630 
different abilities and you don't get
any<00:03:32.750> new<00:03:32.900> abilities<00:03:33.380> until<00:03:33.680> your<00:03:33.980> pet<00:03:34.220> levels

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
any new abilities until your pet levels

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
any new abilities until your pet levels

so here I do battle with a shale spider

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.010 
so here I do battle with a shale spider

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:08.409 
bloody gonna FK and you're all standing
around<00:05:07.310> waiting<00:05:07.580> for<00:05:07.729> them<00:05:07.909> to<00:05:07.940> come<00:05:08.180> back

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
around waiting for them to come back

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.600 
around waiting for them to come back
personally<00:05:09.199> i<00:05:09.229> don't<00:05:09.469> believe<00:05:10.069> i<00:05:10.310> will<00:05:10.370> be

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
personally i don't believe i will be

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.730 
personally i don't believe i will be
using<00:05:10.819> the<00:05:11.150> pet<00:05:11.479> battle<00:05:11.870> system<00:05:12.319> for<00:05:12.530> any

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
using the pet battle system for any

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.920 
using the pet battle system for any
other<00:05:13.039> reason<00:05:13.280> other<00:05:13.759> than<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.120> just<00:05:14.300> simply

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
other reason other than to just simply

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.890 
other reason other than to just simply
pass<00:05:15.199> the<00:05:15.469> time<00:05:15.710> but<00:05:16.250> we<00:05:16.490> shall<00:05:16.729> see<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.360> can

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
pass the time but we shall see I can

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.270 
pass the time but we shall see I can
imagine<00:05:18.110> for<00:05:18.440> some<00:05:18.620> people<00:05:18.979> this<00:05:19.099> will

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
imagine for some people this will

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.730 
imagine for some people this will
probably<00:05:19.460> become<00:05:19.819> quite<00:05:20.270> addictive<00:05:20.810> but<00:05:21.259> if

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
probably become quite addictive but if

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.490 
probably become quite addictive but if
you<00:05:22.129> can't<00:05:22.460> use<00:05:22.940> it<00:05:23.180> in<00:05:23.210> safe<00:05:23.690> areas<00:05:23.930> such<00:05:24.469> as

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
you can't use it in safe areas such as

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.860 
you can't use it in safe areas such as
dormant<00:05:25.310> like<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.669> had<00:05:25.819> to<00:05:25.969> leave<00:05:26.090> storm<00:05:26.479> into

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
dormant like I had to leave storm into

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.129 
dormant like I had to leave storm into
even<00:05:27.169> create<00:05:27.919> a<00:05:27.949> pet<00:05:28.340> battle<00:05:28.819> then<00:05:29.210> I<00:05:29.629> don't

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
even create a pet battle then I don't

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.170 
even create a pet battle then I don't
know<00:05:30.289> maybe<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.800> won't<00:05:30.949> work<00:05:31.190> in<00:05:31.430> instances<00:05:32.000> we

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
know maybe it won't work in instances we

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.120 
know maybe it won't work in instances we
have<00:05:32.270> to<00:05:32.449> wait<00:05:32.599> and<00:05:32.750> see<00:05:32.810> about<00:05:33.080> that<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.949> me

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
have to wait and see about that to me

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.339 
have to wait and see about that to me
this<00:05:34.400> whole<00:05:34.729> new<00:05:35.120> system<00:05:35.419> seems<00:05:35.900> like<00:05:36.080> a<00:05:36.110> bit

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:36.349 
this whole new system seems like a bit

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:38.439 
this whole new system seems like a bit
of<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.529> gimmick<00:05:36.860> but<00:05:37.250> I<00:05:37.610> know<00:05:37.729> there's<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.210> lot<00:05:38.240> of

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
of a gimmick but I know there's a lot of

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.390 
of a gimmick but I know there's a lot of
people<00:05:39.050> that<00:05:39.199> have<00:05:39.259> been<00:05:39.650> really<00:05:40.009> looking

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
people that have been really looking

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.999 
people that have been really looking
forward<00:05:40.969> to<00:05:41.000> this<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:41.569> if<00:05:42.229> you<00:05:42.469> are<00:05:42.740> one<00:05:42.889> of

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
forward to this and if you are one of

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.649 
forward to this and if you are one of
those<00:05:43.099> people<00:05:43.159> I'd<00:05:43.699> be<00:05:43.849> interested<00:05:44.029> to<00:05:44.509> hear

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:44.659 
those people I'd be interested to hear

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.540 
those people I'd be interested to hear
from<00:05:45.139> you<00:05:45.380> have<00:05:45.770> you<00:05:45.889> been<00:05:46.009> looking<00:05:46.159> forward

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
from you have you been looking forward

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.390 
from you have you been looking forward
to<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:46.880> pet<00:05:47.360> battle<00:05:47.719> system<00:05:48.050> coming<00:05:48.319> out<00:05:48.590> why

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
to the pet battle system coming out why

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.180 
to the pet battle system coming out why
does<00:05:49.849> it<00:05:50.060> appeal<00:05:50.659> to<00:05:50.930> you<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:51.409> alternatively

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
does it appeal to you and alternatively

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.670 
does it appeal to you and alternatively
are<00:05:52.610> you<00:05:52.909> someone<00:05:53.659> like<00:05:53.900> me<00:05:54.169> who<00:05:54.409> probably

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
are you someone like me who probably

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.339 
are you someone like me who probably
can't<00:05:55.130> see<00:05:55.310> yourself<00:05:55.880> using<00:05:55.969> this<00:05:56.659> system<00:05:56.930> and

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
can't see yourself using this system and

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.379 
can't see yourself using this system and
why<00:05:57.830> do<00:05:57.889> you<00:05:58.099> feel<00:05:58.370> that<00:05:58.400> way<00:05:58.759> leave<00:05:59.000> a<00:05:59.029> comment
