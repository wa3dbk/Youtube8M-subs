00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello youtube partners today I go back 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.250
 with one of my dinosaur videos and 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.960
 touch a tyrannosaurid das cleto saurus 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.030
 das plett or saurus was a genre of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.179
 dinosaurs saurischians theropods 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.770
 tyrannosaurids that inhabited Canada makes 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:22.289
 between 77 and 74 million years ago 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.380
 of the Cretaceous during the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.680
 they change or their first remains were 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.109
 found in alberta in 1921 and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.890
 mistakenly identified as gorgos 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.410
 auroux but it was in 1970 when the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.450
 russell paleontologist he found 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.850
 it was a new genre and what 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 baptized as das fletÃ³ saurus that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.719
 means the frightening lizard of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.670
 moment this is the genre of 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.530
 tyrannosaurids of which more species are 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.350
 have discovered even though 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.590
 only one dish has been described 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.750
 august its among the peculiarities of 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.760
 this theropod should be noted that its 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.489
 teeth are among the longest 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.739
 all the dinosaurs some of the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.150
 found so far measured more than 20 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.490
 centimeters 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.950
 he owned two rows of big daggers and 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.980
 curved backwards located in the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.390
 strong jaws of a huge skull 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.580
 this allows you to think that you were chartered 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.040
 Sauros could be an effective and dangerous 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.220
 hunter also owned a few tiny 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.200
 superciliary horns lightly by 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.180
 above and in front of each eye 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.190
 It is important to note the dimensions of 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.010
 dash plett or saurus because its fossils 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.020
 have been confused on occasion 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.480
 with those of an Alberto Saurus slightly 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.850
 greater than usual complete about 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.310
 average 9 meters and a half long 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.590
 three and a half meters tall and weighed 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.210
 around three tons for the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.910
 data that I have and until it 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.890
 prove otherwise if they are true 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.260
 das hallet saurus was the largest carnivore 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.450
 terrestrial area until it did 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.930
 appearance about 70 million years ago 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.580
 the famous tiranosaurus rex which no longer 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.520
 It is considered the largest dinosaur 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.170
 carnivore but still holds the position 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.620
 of the largest carnivorous dinosaur of 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.660
 North America 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.970
 these are the data that I have of two 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.340
 auroux dishes if you liked it you can 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.720
 I like it if you did not like it 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.340
 you can give I do not like with the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.320
