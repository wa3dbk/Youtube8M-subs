fabric wrapping is now caught in the peg

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.300 
fabric wrapping is now caught in the peg
box<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> take<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:50.090> okay

box so you want to take that out okay
Jen<00:01:53.310> strings<00:01:54.030> will<00:01:54.270> generally<00:01:54.810> break<00:01:55.080> in<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
Jen strings will generally break in the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.850 
Jen strings will generally break in the
peg<00:01:55.740> box<00:01:56.010> when<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.940> over<00:01:57.390> tune<00:01:57.690> with<00:01:58.410> general

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
peg box when you over tune with general

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.340 
peg box when you over tune with general
wear<00:01:59.190> sometimes<00:02:00.150> you'll<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> little<00:02:00.900> ended

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
wear sometimes you'll see a little ended

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.210 
wear sometimes you'll see a little ended
in<00:02:01.560> denture<00:02:02.369> or<00:02:02.940> a<00:02:02.970> little<00:02:03.600> split<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
in denture or a little split in the

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.060 
in denture or a little split in the
metal<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.509> means<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
metal and that means that it's going to

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.249 
metal and that means that it's going to
break<00:02:08.310> wherever<00:02:08.820> that<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.600> it<00:02:09.810> might<00:02:10.050> it

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
break wherever that is like it might it

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.840 
break wherever that is like it might it
usually<00:02:10.649> breaks<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.610> first

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
usually breaks like here in first

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.900 
usually breaks like here in first
position<00:02:12.350> so<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.410> have<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.070> choice<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.640> wait

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
position so you have a choice to wait

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.060 
position so you have a choice to wait
till<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.300> breaks<00:02:15.480> or<00:02:15.810> replace<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.650> this

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
till it breaks or replace it in this

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.390 
till it breaks or replace it in this
case<00:02:17.340> where<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.610> over<00:02:18.030> tuned<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:19.190> it's<00:02:20.190> pretty

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
case where I over tuned it's it's pretty

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.920 
case where I over tuned it's it's pretty
obvious<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.090> usually<00:02:21.450> breaks<00:02:21.690> in<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
obvious that it usually breaks in the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.979 
obvious that it usually breaks in the
peg<00:02:22.140> box<00:02:22.350> like<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.250> what<00:02:23.910> we<00:02:24.060> have<00:02:24.270> here<00:02:24.300> now<00:02:24.780> is

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
peg box like so what we have here now is

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.729 
peg box like so what we have here now is
a<00:02:25.020> broken<00:02:25.590> string<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:27.300> need<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.470> throw<00:02:28.650> that

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
a broken string you need to throw that

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.540 
a broken string you need to throw that
away<00:02:29.010> because<00:02:29.430> it's<00:02:29.820> very<00:02:30.000> pointy<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:30.930> sharp

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
away because it's very pointy and sharp

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.210 
away because it's very pointy and sharp
so<00:02:32.550> now<00:02:33.300> that<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.630> have<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.080> we<00:02:34.530> need<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.950> get

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
so now that we have that we need to get

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.710 
so now that we have that we need to get
a<00:02:35.250> new<00:02:35.489> string<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.690> what<00:02:37.200> we<00:02:37.350> need<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.739> do<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.220> a

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
a new string so what we need to do is a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.710 
a new string so what we need to do is a
bunch<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.870> strings<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.880> will<00:02:41.880> choose<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
bunch of strings here I will choose the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.370 
bunch of strings here I will choose the
E<00:02:43.080> string<00:02:44.570> which<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.750> thinnest<00:02:46.260> string

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
E string which is the thinnest string

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.320 
E string which is the thinnest string
you<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.400> know<00:02:47.519> what<00:02:47.730> your<00:02:47.880> strings<00:02:48.150> look

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
you have to know what your strings look

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.870 
you have to know what your strings look
like<00:02:48.540> as<00:02:48.720> well<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> new<00:02:50.580> east

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
like as well so this is the new east

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.039 
like as well so this is the new east
ring<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.360> I'll<00:02:51.480> put<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> way<00:02:54.989> you

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
ring that I'll put on and the way you

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.720 
ring that I'll put on and the way you
put<00:02:55.410> strings<00:02:55.739> on<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:58.010> little<00:02:59.010> bit<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.370> tricky

peg which I took off if you notice in
the<00:03:37.440> peg<00:03:38.000> there<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.300> a<00:03:39.330> little<00:03:39.750> hole<00:03:40.050> there

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
the peg there is a little hole there

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.290 
the peg there is a little hole there
and<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:41.010> want<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.280> try<00:03:41.460> to<00:03:41.520> make<00:03:41.850> sure<00:03:41.880> that

and you want to try to make sure that

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.690 
and you want to try to make sure that
the<00:03:42.480> LM<00:03:42.840> string<00:03:43.170> gets<00:03:43.920> into<00:03:44.660> needing

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
the LM string gets into needing

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.170 
the LM string gets into needing
sewing<00:03:47.700> here<00:03:48.030> um<00:03:49.370> have<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> steady<00:03:50.610> hand<00:03:50.730> and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
make sure that the string gets into the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.700 
make sure that the string gets into the
peg<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.670> then<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.880> start<00:03:54.120> winding<00:03:54.360> it<00:03:54.710> first

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
peg and then you start winding it first

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.580 
peg and then you start winding it first
of<00:03:55.830> all<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.100> peg<00:03:56.310> has<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.640> be<00:03:56.790> in<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.150> peg<00:03:57.360> box

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
of all the peg has to be in the peg box

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.980 
of all the peg has to be in the peg box
okay<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.340> put<00:03:59.550> that<00:03:59.640> back<00:03:59.790> in<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.720> find

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
okay so you put that back in you find

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.840 
okay so you put that back in you find
where<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.290> little<00:04:01.740> hole<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.490> and<00:04:02.610> you<00:04:02.670> kind

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
where that little hole is and you kind

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.200 
where that little hole is and you kind
of<00:04:02.910> thread<00:04:03.240> it<00:04:03.360> through<00:04:04.790> this<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:06.000> take<00:04:06.180> a

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
of thread it through this can take a

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.280 
of thread it through this can take a
little<00:04:06.330> bit<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.600> time<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.960> want<00:04:07.050> to<00:04:07.170> make<00:04:07.260> sure

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
little bit of time you want to make sure

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.520 
little bit of time you want to make sure
they<00:04:07.530> have<00:04:07.620> adequate<00:04:08.100> light<00:04:09.260> okay<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:10.320> you

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
they have adequate light okay so you

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.070 
they have adequate light okay so you
want<00:04:10.770> to<00:04:10.860> make<00:04:10.980> sure<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.750> end<00:04:12.750> of<00:04:12.960> the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
want to make sure that the end of the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.890 
want to make sure that the end of the
string<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.680> poking<00:04:14.370> out<00:04:14.520> like<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.690> if<00:04:15.750> you

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
string is poking out like so so if you

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.690 
string is poking out like so so if you
don't<00:04:16.110> but<00:04:16.410> if<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.860> don't<00:04:17.070> have<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.400> string

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
don't but if you don't have the string

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.910 
don't but if you don't have the string
poking<00:04:18.180> out<00:04:18.330> at<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.600> other<00:04:18.720> end<00:04:18.870> it's<00:04:19.410> going

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
poking out at the other end it's going

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.500 
poking out at the other end it's going
to<00:04:20.010> unravel<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:20.880> then<00:04:21.120> you'll<00:04:21.239> be<00:04:21.390> very

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
to unravel and then you'll be very

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.780 
to unravel and then you'll be very
unhappy<00:04:21.870> these<00:04:22.230> are<00:04:22.350> spring<00:04:22.560> will<00:04:22.710> be<00:04:22.860> loose

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
unhappy these are spring will be loose

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.280 
unhappy these are spring will be loose
and<00:04:24.090> then<00:04:24.330> you'll<00:04:24.480> have<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.780> try<00:04:24.960> this<00:04:25.140> whole

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
and then you'll have to try this whole

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.710 
and then you'll have to try this whole
thing<00:04:25.470> again<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:25.890> I'm<00:04:26.490> holding<00:04:27.150> this<00:04:27.300> straight

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
thing again so I'm holding this straight

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.160 
thing again so I'm holding this straight
in<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:27.990> peg<00:04:28.230> box<00:04:28.470> try<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.310> turn<00:04:29.700> try<00:04:30.480> to<00:04:30.540> wind<00:04:30.930> a

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
in the peg box try to turn try to wind a

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.840 
in the peg box try to turn try to wind a
little<00:04:31.860> bit<00:04:33.740> try<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.800> wind<00:04:35.190> a<00:04:35.370> little<00:04:35.520> bit

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
little bit try to wind a little bit

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.850 
little bit try to wind a little bit
um<00:04:36.950> rewind<00:04:37.950> is<00:04:38.160> this<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.430> not<00:04:38.610> good<00:04:39.800> try<00:04:40.800> to

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
um rewind is this is not good try to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.300 
um rewind is this is not good try to
make<00:04:41.220> sure<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:41.550> it's<00:04:42.360> coiled<00:04:43.020> nicely<00:04:43.980> next

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
make sure that it's coiled nicely next

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.430 
make sure that it's coiled nicely next
to<00:04:44.400> one<00:04:44.550> another<00:04:44.580> now<00:04:45.330> if<00:04:45.510> you<00:04:45.630> cross<00:04:46.020> make

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
to one another now if you cross make

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.710 
to one another now if you cross make
sure<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:46.770> cross<00:04:47.040> early<00:04:47.850> because<00:04:48.150> if<00:04:48.600> you

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
sure you cross early because if you

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.830 
sure you cross early because if you
cross<00:04:48.960> too<00:04:49.230> late<00:04:49.940> then<00:04:50.940> you<00:04:51.180> have<00:04:51.450> a<00:04:51.480> tendency

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
cross too late then you have a tendency

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.350 
cross too late then you have a tendency
to<00:04:52.080> break<00:04:52.380> your<00:04:52.620> string<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.640> way<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:53.910> wind

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
to break your string the way you wind

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.260 
to break your string the way you wind
strings<00:04:55.140> are<00:04:55.380> actually<00:04:55.800> extremely<00:04:56.460> important

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
strings are actually extremely important

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.620 
strings are actually extremely important
because<00:04:58.580> you<00:04:59.580> want<00:04:59.760> to<00:04:59.820> make<00:05:00.000> sure<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.480> it's

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
because you want to make sure that it's

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.460 
because you want to make sure that it's
on<00:05:00.870> right<00:05:01.460> so<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.550> don't<00:05:02.760> break<00:05:03.570> it<00:05:03.930> by<00:05:04.110> known

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
on right so you don't break it by known

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.830 
on right so you don't break it by known
cause<00:05:04.830> of<00:05:05.070> your<00:05:05.160> own<00:05:05.400> but<00:05:05.760> just<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:06.480> fact<00:05:06.720> that

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
cause of your own but just the fact that

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.940 
cause of your own but just the fact that
you've<00:05:07.080> found<00:05:07.410> it

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
you've found it

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.660 
you've found it
and<00:05:09.100> correctly<00:05:09.670> so<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.450> kind<00:05:10.630> of<00:05:10.690> lies<00:05:10.900> nicely

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
and correctly so it kind of lies nicely

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.060 
and correctly so it kind of lies nicely
next<00:05:12.670> to<00:05:12.910> one<00:05:13.060> another<00:05:13.360> but<00:05:14.080> sometimes<00:05:14.650> on<00:05:14.830> top

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
next to one another but sometimes on top

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.640 
next to one another but sometimes on top
but<00:05:17.610> right<00:05:18.610> so<00:05:19.060> you<00:05:19.780> don't<00:05:19.990> want<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.350> strings

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
but right so you don't want the strings

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.530 
but right so you don't want the strings
to<00:05:20.830> be<00:05:20.950> too<00:05:21.250> close<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.640> the<00:05:21.730> peg<00:05:21.940> box<00:05:22.120> because

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
to be too close to the peg box because

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.420 
to be too close to the peg box because
that'll<00:05:22.810> actually<00:05:23.020> have<00:05:23.440> a<00:05:23.470> tendency<00:05:24.250> to<00:05:24.370> snap

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
that'll actually have a tendency to snap

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.550 
that'll actually have a tendency to snap
as<00:05:24.880> well<00:05:25.120> so<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:25.720> make<00:05:25.960> sure<00:05:26.170> that<00:05:26.200> your

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
as well so you make sure that your

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.340 
as well so you make sure that your
string<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:26.890> right<00:05:27.250> over<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:28.270> little<00:05:28.570> notch<00:05:28.900> on

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
string is right over the little notch on

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.380 
string is right over the little notch on
the<00:05:29.650> bridge<00:05:29.890> sometimes<00:05:30.790> they<00:05:30.910> have<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.060> string

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
the bridge sometimes they have a string

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.050 
the bridge sometimes they have a string
protector<00:05:31.960> which<00:05:32.470> is<00:05:32.650> good<00:05:32.860> so<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:33.550> string

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
protector which is good so the string

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.730 
protector which is good so the string
doesn't<00:05:34.360> carve<00:05:34.540> right<00:05:34.930> into<00:05:35.200> the<00:05:35.290> bridge<00:05:35.530> and

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
doesn't carve right into the bridge and

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.590 
doesn't carve right into the bridge and
that<00:05:35.950> can<00:05:36.220> come<00:05:36.400> that<00:05:36.760> can<00:05:36.970> cause<00:05:37.120> breakage

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
that can come that can cause breakage

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.160 
that can come that can cause breakage
also<00:05:38.170> so<00:05:39.100> sometimes<00:05:39.940> breakage<00:05:40.480> is<00:05:40.630> not<00:05:40.810> caused

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
also so sometimes breakage is not caused

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.960 
also so sometimes breakage is not caused
by<00:05:41.320> just<00:05:41.650> simply<00:05:41.950> tuning<00:05:42.430> it<00:05:42.550> with<00:05:42.670> a<00:05:42.730> peg

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
by just simply tuning it with a peg

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.590 
by just simply tuning it with a peg
breakage<00:05:43.810> can<00:05:44.080> be<00:05:44.940> breakage<00:05:45.940> can<00:05:46.240> be<00:05:46.420> as<00:05:46.570> a

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
breakage can be breakage can be as a

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.540 
breakage can be breakage can be as a
result<00:05:47.050> of<00:05:47.760> winding<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:48.880> string<00:05:49.470> incorrectly

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
result of winding the string incorrectly

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.040 
result of winding the string incorrectly
winding<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.670> string<00:05:51.730> too<00:05:52.090> far<00:05:52.390> apart<00:05:52.510> from

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
winding the string too far apart from

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.210 
winding the string too far apart from
one<00:05:53.140> another<00:05:54.300> also<00:05:55.300> maybe<00:05:56.050> even<00:05:56.220> cutting

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
one another also maybe even cutting

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.890 
one another also maybe even cutting
through<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.640> bridge<00:05:57.910> so<00:05:58.210> it<00:05:58.270> can<00:05:58.420> break<00:05:58.630> right

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
through the bridge so it can break right

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.660 
through the bridge so it can break right
there<00:05:59.140> as<00:05:59.290> well<00:05:59.560> so<00:06:00.040> there's<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.460> lot<00:06:00.490> of

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
there as well so there's a lot of

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.230 
there as well so there's a lot of
factors<00:06:01.180> in<00:06:01.300> why<00:06:02.040> it's<00:06:03.040> from<00:06:03.220> my

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
factors in why it's from my

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.089 
factors in why it's from my
then<00:06:05.750> I<00:06:05.780> would<00:06:06.020> go<00:06:06.199> ahead<00:06:06.319> and<00:06:06.560> proceed<00:06:06.889> to

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
then I would go ahead and proceed to

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:08.290 
then I would go ahead and proceed to
tune<00:06:07.460> my<00:06:07.699> instrument

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
tune my instrument

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.180 
tune my instrument
it's<00:06:08.419> a<00:06:08.569> coddling<00:06:09.020> first<00:06:09.349> away<00:06:09.710> from<00:06:09.979> your

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
it's a coddling first away from your

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.360 
it's a coddling first away from your
face<00:06:10.400> and<00:06:10.639> then<00:06:11.150> tuning<00:06:12.020> again<00:06:12.349> with<00:06:12.740> my<00:06:13.160> boat

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
face and then tuning again with my boat

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.290 
face and then tuning again with my boat
so<00:06:14.330> one<00:06:14.630> note<00:06:14.870> I<00:06:14.960> had<00:06:15.199> is<00:06:16.039> about<00:06:16.250> strings<00:06:16.880> make

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
so one note I had is about strings make

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.089 
so one note I had is about strings make
sure<00:06:17.599> that<00:06:17.900> you<00:06:18.050> get<00:06:18.229> the<00:06:18.349> appropriate<00:06:18.470> sized

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
sure that you get the appropriate sized

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.460 
sure that you get the appropriate sized
string<00:06:19.580> for<00:06:19.940> your<00:06:20.030> instrument<00:06:20.569> if<00:06:20.780> you<00:06:21.259> have<00:06:21.440> a

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
string for your instrument if you have a

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.650 
string for your instrument if you have a
4/4<00:06:22.130> size<00:06:22.430> instrument<00:06:22.880> which<00:06:23.210> is<00:06:23.240> a<00:06:23.360> full<00:06:23.630> size
