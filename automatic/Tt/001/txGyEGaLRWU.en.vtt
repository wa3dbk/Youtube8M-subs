00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
because i had EMP basically when i took

pretty low but I mean I don't play that
much<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:10.010> it's<00:04:10.190> not<00:04:10.310> like<00:04:10.549> I'm<00:04:10.819> a<00:04:10.989> super<00:04:11.989> nerd

this concludes this little taryn
strategy<00:04:23.330> display<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:23.870> guess<00:04:24.580> well<00:04:25.580> my<00:04:25.789> point

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060

for<00:04:26.270> this<00:04:26.419> was<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:27.020> explain<00:04:27.620> that<00:04:27.860> how

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
for this was to explain that how

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.890 
for this was to explain that how
important<00:04:28.639> build<00:04:28.850> orders<00:04:29.210> are<00:04:29.479> and<00:04:29.750> that

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
important build orders are and that

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.840 
important build orders are and that
everything<00:04:30.169> you<00:04:30.470> do<00:04:30.680> needs<00:04:31.490> to<00:04:31.610> serve<00:04:31.820> a

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
everything you do needs to serve a

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.640 
everything you do needs to serve a
purpose<00:04:32.150> like<00:04:32.720> those<00:04:32.870> missile<00:04:33.200> turrets<00:04:33.530> I

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
purpose like those missile turrets I

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.340 
purpose like those missile turrets I
built<00:04:34.210> might<00:04:35.210> not<00:04:35.360> seem<00:04:35.630> like<00:04:35.660> they<00:04:35.960> served<00:04:36.229> a

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
built might not seem like they served a

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.230 
built might not seem like they served a
purpose<00:04:36.530> and<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.340> two<00:04:37.550> that<00:04:37.729> were<00:04:37.789> there<00:04:38.120> at

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
purpose and the two that were there at

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.060 
purpose and the two that were there at
the<00:04:38.270> beginning<00:04:38.590> cost<00:04:39.590> me<00:04:39.770> two<00:04:39.950> hundred

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
the beginning cost me two hundred

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.820 
the beginning cost me two hundred
minerals<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.780> probably<00:04:42.320> would<00:04:42.530> have<00:04:42.590> cost

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
minerals but it probably would have cost

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.770 
minerals but it probably would have cost
me<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.160> game<00:04:43.190> had<00:04:43.760> I<00:04:43.789> just<00:04:44.120> let<00:04:44.360> them<00:04:44.389> fly

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
me the game had I just let them fly

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.140 
me the game had I just let them fly
around<00:04:44.900> and<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:46.310> Protoss<00:04:46.669> player<00:04:46.940> know

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
around and the Protoss player know

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.210 
around and the Protoss player know
everything<00:04:47.539> I<00:04:47.660> do<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:48.110> he<00:04:48.740> counts<00:04:49.099> are

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
everything I do and he counts are

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.850 
everything I do and he counts are
everything<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.669> hundred<00:04:49.940> percent<00:04:50.410> so<00:04:51.410> I<00:04:51.440> mean

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
everything a hundred percent so I mean

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.060 
everything a hundred percent so I mean
if<00:04:52.099> you<00:04:52.610> play<00:04:52.849> some<00:04:53.530> pretty<00:04:54.530> good<00:04:54.710> distance

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
if you play some pretty good distance

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.010 
if you play some pretty good distance
apart<00:04:55.639> just<00:04:56.090> enough<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.360> where<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:56.660> detection

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
apart just enough to where the detection

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.129 
apart just enough to where the detection
radius<00:04:57.530> from<00:04:57.830> one<00:04:58.099> reaches<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.729> other<00:04:59.139> you

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
radius from one reaches the other you

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.050 
radius from one reaches the other you
can<00:05:00.349> cover<00:05:00.620> a<00:05:00.770> whole<00:05:00.950> Basin<00:05:01.520> two<00:05:01.700> missile

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
can cover a whole Basin two missile

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.990 
can cover a whole Basin two missile
turrets<00:05:02.419> I<00:05:02.660> mean<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:03.950> you<00:05:04.010> don't<00:05:04.820> have<00:05:04.880> to

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
turrets I mean and you don't have to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.810 
turrets I mean and you don't have to
worry<00:05:05.210> so<00:05:05.450> much<00:05:05.510> about<00:05:06.310> it'll<00:05:07.310> being<00:05:07.550> over

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
worry so much about it'll being over

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.480 
worry so much about it'll being over
your<00:05:08.060> minerals<00:05:08.870> because<00:05:09.140> you<00:05:10.099> can<00:05:10.250> let<00:05:10.370> them

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
your minerals because you can let them

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.770 
your minerals because you can let them
sit<00:05:10.640> there<00:05:10.669> watch<00:05:10.970> your<00:05:11.150> minerals<00:05:11.479> all<00:05:11.630> day

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
sit there watch your minerals all day

this fine as long as they don't see what

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.680 
this fine as long as they don't see what
you're<00:05:15.889> building<00:05:16.099> that's<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.759> important

part and then you're going to eventually

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.029 
part and then you're going to eventually
get<00:05:19.970> both<00:05:20.210> gasp<00:05:20.479> and<00:05:20.900> fully<00:05:21.169> saturate<00:05:21.740> your

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
get both gasp and fully saturate your

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.760 
get both gasp and fully saturate your
your<00:05:22.759> main<00:05:23.030> so<00:05:23.509> they<00:05:23.960> want<00:05:24.199> to<00:05:24.289> watch<00:05:24.470> that

a game where i recorded my strategy for
that<00:05:39.379> but<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:41.300> phase<00:05:41.599> 2<00:05:41.990> replays<00:05:42.620> are<00:05:43.039> corrupt

just so happens that that game that i

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.999 
just so happens that that game that i
want<00:05:51.470> to<00:05:51.530> show<00:05:51.770> is<00:05:53.650> nothing<00:05:54.650> but<00:05:54.740> a<00:05:54.800> black

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
screen now so that's why i'm going to

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.960 
screen now so that's why i'm going to
start<00:05:57.229> recording<00:05:57.530> them<00:05:57.830> live<00:05:58.039> as<00:05:58.370> i<00:05:58.520> play<00:05:58.759> them

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970

start recording them live as i play them
it's<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.419> little<00:05:59.569> bit<00:05:59.690> more<00:05:59.810> difficult<00:05:59.960> for<00:06:00.229> me

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
it's a little bit more difficult for me
