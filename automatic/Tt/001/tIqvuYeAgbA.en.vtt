00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.340
 hello very good everyone I will explain 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.830
 how to fish sharks 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.889
 for this we need a machete is the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.870
 most effective weapon against sharks 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.700
 we could also attack them with the spear 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.540
 but it takes much longer you have to give them 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.480
 many more hits the best the machete 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:24.210
 once we have it we look for a shark 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:28.550
 They are easy to find because it starts 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.699
 the music to sound when I approach 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.950
 and we just look for it and we give it to 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.300
 the machete until until he dies 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.360
 It is easy 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.560
 I have not been attacked almost never alone 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.510
 once 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.820
 in the back again while you go 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.190
 attacking has never attacked me any there 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.370
 two types of sharks 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:54.110
 the tigers and the white sharks 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.110
 the easiest to kill are the tigers 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.399
 once we kill him 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 We give it when it is on the ground to 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.030
 turn it into pieces that can be 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.310
 eat 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.500
 and when we have the parts of the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.920
 shark we go back to the island and the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.920
 we cook 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.159
 when we have the improved camper 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.610
 We can put a piece of meat 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.070
 shark this piece that take the longest 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.140
 cooking gives us three types of meat 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.520
 the fin a steak and these pieces 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.630
 big 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.149
 This is the one that most recovers the hunger 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.940
 practically recover a whole bar 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.100
 just eating from this fell 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.140
 the fillets a little less and the fins 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.420
 Even less 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.820
 the part where we give it is important 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.920
 It is not the same if we give it in the queue or 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.670
 in his head the part that harmed him the most 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.670
 ago is the head 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.380
 Y 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.540
 we have to take care of the site 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.450
 where do we kill the shark if we want 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.390
 recover the meat we should not do it in 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.599
 the water in the open sea because the water is 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.760
 very deep and the shark that there is at 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.430
 background and we can not recover the meat 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.470
 to go down so deep we would have to 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.280
 have an oxygen cylinder and a 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.640
 Lantern 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.920
 and it's not worth spending oxygen on the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.770
 bottle that are scarce does not usually leave 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.630
 a lot in the game was not worth spending 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.120
 oxygen by looking for meats always not 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.730
 sharks usually come out next to the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.830
 island where we are mostly sharks 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.550
 tigers white sharks are also 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.100
 can kill as seen in this video 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.250
 but they tend to be further away from the 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.250
 coast 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.630
 or 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.700
 thereof 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.650
 as it looks more difficult to kill a shark 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.220
 white that a tiger shark give it 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.220
 many more times
