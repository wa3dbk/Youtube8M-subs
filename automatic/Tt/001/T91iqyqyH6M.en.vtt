00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
Yale like far away or up close and but

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.670 
Yale like far away or up close and but
on<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.300> Genesis<00:00:03.659> sequence<00:00:04.049> that<00:00:04.319> we<00:00:04.440> worked

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
on the Genesis sequence that we worked

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.160 
on the Genesis sequence that we worked
on<00:00:04.859> we<00:00:05.100> needed<00:00:05.400> all<00:00:05.549> scales<00:00:05.970> we<00:00:06.839> had<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.049> be

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
on we needed all scales we had to be

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.720 
on we needed all scales we had to be
down<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.680> surface<00:00:07.859> traveling<00:00:08.429> very<00:00:08.580> fast

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
down on the surface traveling very fast

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.879 
down on the surface traveling very fast
and<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:09.330> had<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.719> far<00:00:10.050> away<00:00:10.170> looking<00:00:10.620> at<00:00:10.740> it

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
and we had to be far away looking at it

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.090 
and we had to be far away looking at it
as<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.490> sphere<00:00:12.920> you<00:00:13.920> have<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:15.680> think<00:00:16.680> about<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
as a sphere you have to think about the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.370 
as a sphere you have to think about the
transition<00:00:17.760> between<00:00:17.970> these<00:00:18.300> two<00:00:18.570> scales<00:00:18.900> or

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
transition between these two scales or

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.019 
transition between these two scales or
these<00:00:19.529> many<00:00:19.980> scales<00:00:20.279> too<00:00:20.550> because<00:00:20.820> sometimes

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
these many scales too because sometimes

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.910 
these many scales too because sometimes
programs<00:00:21.600> work<00:00:21.840> well<00:00:22.050> at<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.350> scale<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:22.769> not

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
programs work well at one scale or not

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.040 
programs work well at one scale or not
at<00:00:23.039> another<00:00:23.630> and<00:00:24.630> we<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:26.750> spent<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:27.930> much

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
at another and we have a spent as much

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.750 
at another and we have a spent as much
time<00:00:28.109> worrying<00:00:28.680> about<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> transitions<00:00:29.609> as

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
time worrying about the transitions as

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.060 
time worrying about the transitions as
we<00:00:29.880> did<00:00:30.029> about<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.359> programs<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.140> worked<00:00:31.859> at

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
we did about the programs that worked at

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.490 
we did about the programs that worked at
the<00:00:32.099> individual<00:00:32.790> scales<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> had<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.380> be

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the individual scales so I had to be

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.709 
the individual scales so I had to be
smooth<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.980> seamless<00:00:35.239> as<00:00:36.239> well<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.600> these

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
smooth and seamless as well as these

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.049 
smooth and seamless as well as these
general<00:00:37.170> problems<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.100> task<00:00:38.340> also<00:00:38.760> called

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
general problems the task also called

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.780 
general problems the task also called
for<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> number<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.690> detailed<00:00:40.200> techniques<00:00:40.860> so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
for a number of detailed techniques so

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.490 
for a number of detailed techniques so
we<00:00:41.820> asked<00:00:42.239> Lauren<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> take<00:00:42.930> us<00:00:43.110> through<00:00:43.140> these

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
we asked Lauren to take us through these

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.850 
we asked Lauren to take us through these
in<00:00:43.829> sequence<00:00:44.100> okay<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.180> first<00:00:45.960> view<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.710> one

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
in sequence okay the first view that one

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.479 
in sequence okay the first view that one
sees<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> planet<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:49.460> cratered<00:00:50.460> moon

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
sees of the planet is a cratered moon

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.439 
sees of the planet is a cratered moon
and<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.870> was<00:00:52.020> done<00:00:52.260> by<00:00:52.620> Tom<00:00:52.949> Duff<00:00:53.300> who's<00:00:54.300> now

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and that was done by Tom Duff who's now

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.310 
and that was done by Tom Duff who's now
at<00:00:54.570> Bell<00:00:54.719> Laboratories<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:56.129> he<00:00:57.320> constructed

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
at Bell Laboratories and he constructed

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.990 
at Bell Laboratories and he constructed
a<00:00:59.030> map<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.270> where<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> craters<00:01:00.899> were<00:01:01.050> by

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
a map of where the craters were by

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.200 
a map of where the craters were by
randomly<00:01:03.000> dropping<00:01:03.359> mud<00:01:04.260> into<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.909> into<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
randomly dropping mud into a into a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.170 
randomly dropping mud into a into a
rectangle<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.430> seeing<00:01:08.430> how<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> splashed

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
rectangle and seeing how it splashed

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.179 
rectangle and seeing how it splashed
basically<00:01:10.020> that's<00:01:10.439> essentially<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.010> he<00:01:11.070> did

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
basically that's essentially what he did

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.370 
basically that's essentially what he did
on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> computer<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.330> given<00:01:13.200> this

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
on the computer and given this

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.840 
on the computer and given this
description<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.100> where<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> craters<00:01:14.670> were

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
description of where the craters were

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.550 
description of where the craters were
slump<00:01:15.270> somewhat<00:01:15.540> distorted<00:01:15.840> because<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
slump somewhat distorted because of the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.039 
slump somewhat distorted because of the
fact<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> sphere<00:01:17.930> then<00:01:18.930> he

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
fact that it was a sphere then he

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
fact that it was a sphere then he
wrapped<00:01:19.290> us<00:01:19.500> onto<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> sphere<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.430> made

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
wrapped us onto a sphere and made

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.910 
wrapped us onto a sphere and made
perspective<00:01:21.930> views<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.500> sphere<00:01:22.740> from

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
perspective views of the sphere from

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.170 
perspective views of the sphere from
different<00:01:23.220> directions<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.030> had<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
different directions and so we had a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
different directions and so we had a
cratered<00:01:24.540> sphere<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.979> was<00:01:26.100> done<00:01:26.310> very

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
cratered sphere and it was done very

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.550 
cratered sphere and it was done very
carefully<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:27.210> allow<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> shading<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
carefully to allow for the shading and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.440 
carefully to allow for the shading and
so<00:01:28.860> forth<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> way<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> light<00:01:29.790> bounces

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
so forth as the way the light bounces

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.710 
so forth as the way the light bounces
off<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:31.470> lumpy<00:01:32.009> surface<00:01:32.390> well<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.540> worked

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
off of a lumpy surface well that worked

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.859 
off of a lumpy surface well that worked
fine<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.200> until<00:01:34.350> about<00:01:35.130> five<00:01:36.119> thousand<00:01:36.659> miles

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
fine up until about five thousand miles

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.760 
fine up until about five thousand miles
or<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.470> and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
or so and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.770 
or so and
then<00:01:40.369> what<00:01:40.640> happened<00:01:41.030> was<00:01:41.149> that<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:41.479> the

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
then what happened was that this the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.660 
then what happened was that this the
texture<00:01:42.079> map<00:01:42.320> got<00:01:42.649> to<00:01:42.770> be<00:01:42.890> very<00:01:43.070> big<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.310> so

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
texture map got to be very big and so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.029 
texture map got to be very big and so
that<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.450> samples<00:01:45.289> of<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.649> altitudes

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
that the the samples of the altitudes

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.709 
that the the samples of the altitudes
got<00:01:46.219> to<00:01:46.340> be<00:01:46.460> far<00:01:46.729> apart<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:47.509> could

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
got to be far apart and so you could

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.300 
got to be far apart and so you could
start<00:01:47.899> seeing<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.259> graininess<00:01:48.649> of<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:50.090> so

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
start seeing the graininess of it and so

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.779 
start seeing the graininess of it and so
down<00:01:52.310> closer<00:01:52.640> then<00:01:53.119> we<00:01:53.360> went<00:01:53.539> to<00:01:53.659> fractals<00:01:54.200> and

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
down closer then we went to fractals and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.550 
down closer then we went to fractals and
where<00:01:55.789> you<00:01:55.880> can<00:01:56.060> see<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.420> relief<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.170> in

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
where you can see the relief and in

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.770 
where you can see the relief and in
valleys<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.219> lakes<00:01:58.429> and<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:58.880> on<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.420> then

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
valleys and lakes and so on and then

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.459 
valleys and lakes and so on and then
farther<00:02:00.140> away<00:02:00.439> again<00:02:00.920> we<00:02:01.159> went<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.909> a<00:02:01.939> painting

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
farther away again we went to a painting

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.669 
farther away again we went to a painting
which<00:02:03.469> had<00:02:04.429> color<00:02:04.939> in<00:02:05.179> it<00:02:05.329> and<00:02:05.509> clouds<00:02:06.170> and

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
which had color in it and clouds and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.140 
which had color in it and clouds and
oceans<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.909> so<00:02:08.030> forth<00:02:08.319> what<00:02:09.319> about<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.799> fire

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
oceans and so forth what about the fire

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.960 
oceans and so forth what about the fire
the<00:02:11.150> fire<00:02:11.180> yes<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:12.019> can't<00:02:12.349> forget<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.769> fire<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
the fire yes I can't forget the fire the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.600 
the fire yes I can't forget the fire the
fire<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.630> was<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.440> technique<00:02:15.829> that<00:02:15.890> was<00:02:16.160> added

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
fire is was a technique that was added

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.680 
fire is was a technique that was added
on<00:02:16.730> top<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.329> the<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:19.489> bumps<00:02:19.849> or<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.450> the

method where we compute the fire element
and<00:02:28.599> matted<00:02:29.599> over<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.260> cratered<00:02:31.220> planet<00:02:31.640> and

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
and matted over the cratered planet and

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.229 
and matted over the cratered planet and
this<00:02:33.709> matting<00:02:34.160> technique<00:02:34.579> which<00:02:34.880> we've

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
this matting technique which we've

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.750 
this matting technique which we've
developed<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> high<00:02:36.769> degree<00:02:36.799> around<00:02:37.579> here

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
developed to a high degree around here

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.000 
developed to a high degree around here
we<00:02:37.879> use<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.180> all<00:02:38.299> of<00:02:38.450> our<00:02:38.569> productions<00:02:39.079> and<00:02:39.379> so

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
we use in all of our productions and so

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.640 
we use in all of our productions and so
forth<00:02:40.250> but<00:02:40.849> it<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:41.329> it<00:02:41.450> allows<00:02:41.660> one<00:02:42.170> program<00:02:42.500> to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
forth but it so it allows one program to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.780 
forth but it so it allows one program to
worry<00:02:42.799> about<00:02:42.980> one<00:02:43.129> kind<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.430> thing<00:02:43.640> and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
worry about one kind of thing and

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.770 
worry about one kind of thing and
another<00:02:43.940> program<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.389> worry<00:02:44.540> about<00:02:44.660> another

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
another program to worry about another

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.819 
another program to worry about another
kind<00:02:44.989> of<00:02:45.109> thing<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.470> put<00:02:45.650> them<00:02:45.739> together

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
kind of thing and you put them together

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.039 
kind of thing and you put them together
with<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.489> very<00:02:46.730> simple<00:02:46.970> compositing<00:02:47.720> method

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
with a very simple compositing method

with a very simple compositing method
the<00:02:48.739> fire<00:02:49.010> was<00:02:49.220> done<00:02:49.370> by<00:02:49.489> Bill<00:02:49.670> Reeves<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.359> it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
the fire was done by Bill Reeves and it

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.559 
the fire was done by Bill Reeves and it
it<00:02:51.230> was<00:02:51.380> really<00:02:51.709> intended<00:02:52.190> as<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.450> from<00:02:53.450> my

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
it was really intended as a from my

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.160 
it was really intended as a from my
perspective<00:02:53.840> anyway<00:02:54.319> as<00:02:54.620> modeling<00:02:55.400> volcanoes

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170

we're<00:02:57.190> hot<00:02:58.190> projectiles<00:02:58.790> are<00:02:58.940> flung<00:02:59.239> out<00:02:59.420> on<00:02:59.569> a

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
we're hot projectiles are flung out on a

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.720 
we're hot projectiles are flung out on a
parabolic<00:03:00.079> arc<00:03:00.380> influenced<00:03:00.980> by<00:03:01.069> gravity<00:03:01.310> and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
parabolic arc influenced by gravity and

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.729 
parabolic arc influenced by gravity and
they<00:03:01.819> cool<00:03:02.060> as<00:03:02.269> they<00:03:02.420> travel<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:03.620> they

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
they cool as they travel and so they

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.360 
they cool as they travel and so they
change<00:03:04.040> color<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.780> direction<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.370> these

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
change color and direction and these

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.559 
change color and direction and these
were<00:03:07.639> all<00:03:07.670> happening<00:03:08.269> in<00:03:08.389> their<00:03:08.540> own

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
were all happening in their own

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.809 
were all happening in their own
reference<00:03:09.380> frame<00:03:09.709> as<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.010> camera<00:03:10.519> was<00:03:10.670> moving

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
reference frame as the camera was moving

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.199 
reference frame as the camera was moving
by<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.359> so<00:03:11.599> it<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:12.829> geometry<00:03:13.310> of<00:03:13.670> three

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.199 
by and so it all this geometry of three
dimensions<00:03:14.630> in<00:03:14.810> motion<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.410> stone<00:03:15.650> stuff

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
dimensions in motion and stone stuff

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.000 
dimensions in motion and stone stuff
gives<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:17.329> a<00:03:17.389> very<00:03:17.630> real<00:03:17.870> sense

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
gives it a very real sense

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.399 
gives it a very real sense
one<00:03:19.819> of<00:03:19.909> the<00:03:20.000> tricks<00:03:20.269> are<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.720> problems<00:03:21.200> with

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
one of the tricks are the problems with

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.009 
one of the tricks are the problems with
fire<00:03:21.800> was<00:03:22.099> making<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.550> dense<00:03:22.790> enough<00:03:23.120> because

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
fire was making it dense enough because

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.330 
fire was making it dense enough because
every<00:03:24.200> one<00:03:24.319> of<00:03:24.349> these<00:03:24.470> little<00:03:24.739> particles<00:03:25.040> only

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
every one of these little particles only

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.190 
every one of these little particles only
covered<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.849> small<00:03:25.970> piece<00:03:26.360> of<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.659> screen<00:03:26.989> and

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
covered a small piece of the screen and

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.869 
covered a small piece of the screen and
so<00:03:27.319> if<00:03:27.409> you<00:03:27.500> wanted<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.769> have<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:27.980> wall<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.640> fire

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
so if you wanted to have a wall of fire

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.360 
so if you wanted to have a wall of fire
or<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.260> region<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.349> fire<00:03:30.560> it<00:03:30.709> took<00:03:30.890> hundreds<00:03:31.250> of

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
or a region of fire it took hundreds of

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.660 
or a region of fire it took hundreds of
thousands<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.909> these<00:03:32.030> things<00:03:32.920> today<00:03:33.920> with<00:03:34.430> the

thousands of these things today with the

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
graphic standards that we have we make

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.050 
graphic standards that we have we make
much<00:03:36.560> higher<00:03:36.799> resolution<00:03:36.980> pictures<00:03:37.730> than<00:03:37.910> we

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
much higher resolution pictures than we

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.650 
much higher resolution pictures than we
did<00:03:38.180> back<00:03:38.420> then<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:39.970> in<00:03:40.970> fact<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.360> pictures

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
did back then and in fact the pictures

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.360 
did back then and in fact the pictures
that<00:03:41.690> we<00:03:41.959> made<00:03:42.170> back<00:03:42.319> then<00:03:42.560> appear<00:03:42.830> small<00:03:43.129> to

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
that we made back then appear small to

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.660 
that we made back then appear small to
us<00:03:43.519> today<00:03:43.790> with<00:03:44.720> big<00:03:45.110> fuzzy<00:03:45.530> pixels<00:03:46.069> it's<00:03:46.579> a

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
us today with big fuzzy pixels it's a

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.830 
us today with big fuzzy pixels it's a
funny<00:03:46.879> perspective<00:03:47.540> but<00:03:49.510> even<00:03:50.510> then<00:03:50.629> it<00:03:50.810> took

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
funny perspective but even then it took

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.240 
funny perspective but even then it took
hundreds<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:51.349> thousands<00:03:51.799> today<00:03:51.920> it<00:03:52.129> would

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
hundreds of thousands today it would

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.839 
hundreds of thousands today it would

you<00:04:24.229> know<00:04:24.320> like<00:04:24.500> 40<00:04:24.919> minutes<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.400> an<00:04:25.490> hour

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580

you know like 40 minutes to an hour
sometimes<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.539> that's<00:04:27.080> okay<00:04:27.410> for<00:04:27.440> video

resolution<00:04:28.880> production<00:04:29.330> but<00:04:29.479> we<00:04:29.599> were<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:29.870> the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
resolution production but we were in the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.379 
resolution production but we were in the
movie<00:04:30.200> business<00:04:30.320> we<00:04:30.919> wanted<00:04:31.220> films<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.910> that

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
movie business we wanted films that that

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.469 
movie business we wanted films that that
had<00:04:32.750> richness<00:04:33.380> of<00:04:33.590> detail<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.190> was<00:04:34.580> that<00:04:35.270> was

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
had richness of detail that was that was

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.379 
had richness of detail that was that was
good<00:04:35.690> as<00:04:35.810> live-action<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.210> means

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
good as live-action and so this means

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.360 
good as live-action and so this means
millions<00:04:38.750> of<00:04:39.080> pixels<00:04:39.470> not<00:04:39.680> just<00:04:39.950> hundreds<00:04:40.250> of

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
millions of pixels not just hundreds of

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.120 
millions of pixels not just hundreds of
thousands<00:04:40.849> and<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:41.990> means<00:04:42.139> compute<00:04:42.620> times<00:04:42.860> of

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
thousands and it means compute times of

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.040 
thousands and it means compute times of
ten<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.490> twenty<00:04:43.880> times<00:04:44.030> greater<00:04:44.539> because<00:04:44.930> we

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
ten and twenty times greater because we

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.779 
ten and twenty times greater because we
might<00:04:45.200> have<00:04:45.260> more<00:04:45.530> model<00:04:45.919> complexity<00:04:46.400> as<00:04:46.610> well

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
might have more model complexity as well

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.960 
might have more model complexity as well
as<00:04:46.940> greater<00:04:47.330> resolution
