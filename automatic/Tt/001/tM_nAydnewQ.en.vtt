00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
red I don't know I really don't know if

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.790 
red I don't know I really don't know if
they<00:02:30.220> use<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.490> same<00:02:30.520> material<00:02:31.330> but<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:32.410> think

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
they use the same material but I think

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.920 
they use the same material but I think
to<00:02:32.980> me<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.520> think<00:02:33.850> this<00:02:34.150> leather<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:34.570> just

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
to me I think this leather is just

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.900 
to me I think this leather is just
better<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.860> doesn't<00:02:36.160> doesn't<00:02:36.940> look<00:02:37.180> plasticky

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
better it doesn't doesn't look plasticky

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.750 
better it doesn't doesn't look plasticky
it's<00:02:39.910> ridiculous<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:41.190> lot<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.220> people<00:02:42.340> saying

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
it's ridiculous a lot of people saying

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.760 
it's ridiculous a lot of people saying
that<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.120> real<00:02:43.420> difference<00:02:43.690> between<00:02:44.410> them<00:02:44.590> is

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
that the real difference between them is

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.970 
that the real difference between them is
in<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.390> air<00:02:46.390> pocket<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.170> don't<00:02:47.350> know<00:02:47.410> whatever
