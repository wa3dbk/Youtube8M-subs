 hello that such good more yet another edition 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:11.889
 of your android channel venezuela the day of 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.049
 today I 'm going to show you a video that reflects 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.170
 the android world in this case I'm going to 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.710
 present a mobile device and it 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.120
 it's about singing or baiting really is 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.660
 a device that has impressed me 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.690
 quite for its simplicity for its speed 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.930
 and for his very good management of ram is a 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.429
 phone that in account with 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.550
 specifications of a 3.5 screen 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:38.679
 small inch is a phone 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.870
 practically pocket but of that 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.969
 has very very good performance of a 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.210
 phone pretty fast even though 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.640
 has 512 of ram let's see the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.230
 specifications that the alcatel one brings 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.840
 touch 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:58.020
 and we can and we go to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.060
 main menu of settings and about 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.110
 from the phone here we can see that it has 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.909
 a way to update if you want 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.170
 Guaranteed 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.670
 in its firmware version is 4.2.2 runs 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.670
 android 6 572 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.970
 as I told you it has 512 of ram 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.530
 as we can see here I'm going to 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.799
 show the number of applications that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.799
 I have downloaded to my phone 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.570
 here I have the chrome as we know the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.560
 google chrome the browser weighs pretty 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.159
 performance that has to have I have 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.710
 mega google + ball chair 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.610
 hockey keyboard I have telegram I have 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.860
 titanium I have youtube 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.510
 in order more than 20 applications and 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.970
 true that ram memory management 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.130
 it's pretty good another question has 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.410
 this cell phone which we can do 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.870
 mention does not have front camera we are going to 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.230
 see the camera section is a camera 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.060
 simple 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.430
 and hey, it's taking a little 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.740
 because we are recording the screen 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.330
 we can see the upper center with a 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.510
 nut and it is quite simple has 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.560
 for hdr for new panoramic in order 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.130
 have for video recording 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.739
 in a fairly simple camera which 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.440
 we can perfectly substitute 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.860
 some other application with older 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.860
 benefits 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.820
 runs twitter that is to say it supports a lot 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.280
 applications even though the ram is 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.930
 quite short the thrive launcher of 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.730
 Same person factory I do not like it for 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.020
 that this guy for nova lunch I have 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.530

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:10.879
 to a point against maybe the screen 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.489

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.650
