before you can use the big equipment to
bend<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.880> metal<00:03:11.910> all<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:13.050> equipment<00:03:13.470> does<00:03:13.620> is

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
bend the metal all the equipment does is

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.430 
bend the metal all the equipment does is
speed<00:03:14.310> up<00:03:14.460> your<00:03:14.580> production<00:03:14.790> time<00:03:15.330> but<00:03:16.260> if<00:03:16.350> you

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
speed up your production time but if you

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.660 
speed up your production time but if you
don't<00:03:16.590> know<00:03:16.650> how<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.800> use<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.160> it's<00:03:17.340> no<00:03:17.460> good

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
don't know how to use it it's no good
