00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
these are for duplication glitches that

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.060 
these are for duplication glitches that
still<00:00:09.269> work<00:00:09.510> on<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.840> PlayStation<00:00:10.290> 3<00:00:10.320> just<00:00:10.950> so

you know they work on the Xbox 360 also

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.480 
you know they work on the Xbox 360 also
so<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.469> first<00:00:13.710> one<00:00:13.920> that's<00:00:14.040> pretty<00:00:14.250> simple

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
so the first one that's pretty simple

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.490 
so the first one that's pretty simple
it's<00:00:15.089> just<00:00:15.269> any<00:00:15.450> block<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.929> can<00:00:16.049> be<00:00:16.199> broken

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
it's just any block that can be broken

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.320 
it's just any block that can be broken
down<00:00:16.710> or<00:00:17.160> changed<00:00:17.490> into<00:00:17.670> something<00:00:17.850> else<00:00:18.090> and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
down or changed into something else and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.910 
down or changed into something else and
it<00:00:18.660> has<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.990> block<00:00:19.260> obviously<00:00:19.740> cuz<00:00:19.859> you

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
it has to be a block obviously cuz you

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.200 
it has to be a block obviously cuz you
have<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.070> actually<00:00:20.160> break<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.820> then<00:00:20.939> place

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
have to actually break it and then place

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.790 
have to actually break it and then place
it<00:00:21.240> down<00:00:21.480> again<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.900> here<00:00:22.470> let's<00:00:22.619> see<00:00:22.710> if<00:00:22.740> I

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it down again and here let's see if I

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.470 
it down again and here let's see if I
can<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.340> just<00:00:23.369> break<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.029> right

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
can do it so you just break it and right

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.609 
can do it so you just break it and right
before<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.779> gets<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:24.960> your<00:00:24.990> Vettori<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.410> break

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
before it gets in your Vettori you break

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.769 
before it gets in your Vettori you break
it<00:00:25.769> or<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.160> place<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.820> down<00:00:26.910> again<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.330> then

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it or you place it down again and then

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.240 
it or you place it down again and then
there<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:27.960> go<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.439> here<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> actual

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
there you go see like here is the actual

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.950 
there you go see like here is the actual
block<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.210> duplicate<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> block<00:00:30.929> that

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
block and then I duplicate a block that

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.959 
block and then I duplicate a block that
in<00:00:31.170> our<00:00:31.619> inventory<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.250> need<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.640> break<00:00:32.820> it

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
in our inventory so I need to break it

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.720 
in our inventory so I need to break it
down<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.210> about<00:00:33.420> golden<00:00:34.160> ingots<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.550> there

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
down and about golden ingots out there

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.799 
down and about golden ingots out there
ya<00:00:35.969> go

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
ya go

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
ya go
then<00:00:37.140> there<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.410> go<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.250> select

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
then there you go so then you can select

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.549 
then there you go so then you can select
this<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.360> still<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> block<00:00:39.840> cheap<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:40.440> of

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this is still the block cheap get out of

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.530 
this is still the block cheap get out of
here<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.760> still<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> block<00:00:42.270> and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
here and this is still a block and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.700 
here and this is still a block and
select<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> duplicate<00:00:43.500> this

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
select you have the duplicate this

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.959 
select you have the duplicate this
actually<00:00:43.980> works<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.280> any<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.640> blocks

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
actually works for any of these blocks

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.229 
actually works for any of these blocks
there<00:00:45.180> was<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.480> an<00:00:45.690> iron<00:00:46.020> gold<00:00:46.289> lapis<00:00:46.770> go<00:00:47.190> uh

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
there was for an iron gold lapis go uh

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.729 
there was for an iron gold lapis go uh
diamond<00:00:48.239> whatever<00:00:48.570> actually<00:00:49.320> works<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.500> wood

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
diamond whatever actually works on wood

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.350 
diamond whatever actually works on wood
also<00:00:50.100> I'm<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.250> sure<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> really<00:00:51.090> was

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
also I'm not sure like it really was

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.819 
also I'm not sure like it really was
pretty<00:00:51.510> plentiful<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.320> wanted<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> do

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pretty plentiful but if you wanted to do

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.680 
pretty plentiful but if you wanted to do
it<00:00:52.980> let's<00:00:53.160> say<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.969> could<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.570> let's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it let's say you could do it and let's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.720 
it let's say you could do it and let's
you<00:00:55.199> need<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.649> obviously<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.550> can

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you need to do obviously for that I can

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.670 
you need to do obviously for that I can
axe<00:00:56.940> cuz<00:00:57.149> it'll<00:00:57.270> break<00:00:57.449> quicker<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
axe cuz it'll break quicker so but you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.990 
axe cuz it'll break quicker so but you
said<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.190> prints<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.489> same<00:00:59.670> thing<00:00:59.850> and<00:00:59.940> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
said you prints the same thing and the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.130 
said you prints the same thing and the
right<00:01:00.149> leg<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:00.600> inventory<00:01:00.690> hope<00:01:01.050> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
right leg it in your inventory hope I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.799 
right leg it in your inventory hope I
did<00:01:01.260> wrong<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.120> place<00:01:03.780> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
did wrong you have to actually place it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.719 
did wrong you have to actually place it
down<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.830> will<00:01:05.040> it'll<00:01:05.400> work

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
down and then it will it'll work

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.190 
down and then it will it'll work
hopefully<00:01:06.479> let's<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:06.930> get<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.110> one

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
hopefully let's see if we can get it one

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.980 
hopefully let's see if we can get it one
more<00:01:07.320> time<00:01:07.700> come<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.180> more<00:01:09.330> try<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:09.840> more

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
more time come on one more try one more

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.789 
more time come on one more try one more
try<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.530> go

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
try there we go

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.469 
try there we go
it<00:01:11.130> actually<00:01:11.369> duplicated<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.150> break<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
it actually duplicated like you break it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.760 
it actually duplicated like you break it
down<00:01:12.570> into<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> individual<00:01:13.260> planks<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
down into the individual planks and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.050 
down into the individual planks and
there<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.610> duplicated

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
there you go you have the duplicated

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.850 
there you go you have the duplicated

you<00:02:44.459> can<00:02:44.580> actually<00:02:44.670> break<00:02:44.970> them<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.300> your

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
you can actually break them in your

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.720 
you can actually break them in your
inventory<00:02:45.709> mmm<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.830> think<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.459> can<00:02:47.580> use<00:02:47.700> a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
inventory mmm I think you can use a

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.900 
inventory mmm I think you can use a
chest<00:02:48.060> or<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.330> crafting<00:02:49.170> table<00:02:49.290> also<00:02:49.590> but<00:02:50.280> I

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
chest or a crafting table also but I

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.790 
chest or a crafting table also but I
wouldn't<00:02:51.270> really<00:02:51.420> risk<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.110> unless<00:02:52.380> I've

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
wouldn't really risk it unless I've

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.229 
wouldn't really risk it unless I've
already<00:02:53.100> tested<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.520> out<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:53.940> know<00:02:54.060> I

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
already tested it out but you know I

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.550 
already tested it out but you know I
as<00:02:54.420> far<00:02:54.630> as<00:02:54.660> worse<00:02:54.870> than<00:02:55.020> your<00:02:55.110> long<00:02:55.410> as<00:02:55.500> it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
as far as worse than your long as it

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.380 
as far as worse than your long as it
works<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.770> your<00:02:55.830> inventory<00:02:56.300> then<00:02:57.300> it

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
works in your inventory then it

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.640 
works in your inventory then it
definitely<00:02:57.810> will<00:02:57.930> let<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.170> duplicate<00:02:58.530> it

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
definitely will let you duplicate it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.229 
definitely will let you duplicate it
okay<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.430> next<00:02:59.610> one's<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.820> little<00:03:00.030> bit<00:03:00.120> more

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
okay so the next one's a little bit more

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.910 
okay so the next one's a little bit more
complicated<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:01.200> actually<00:03:01.500> said<00:03:01.650> make<00:03:01.830> this

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
complicated you actually said make this

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.410 
complicated you actually said make this
little<00:03:02.160> contraption<00:03:02.520> so<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.940> redstone

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
little contraption so a redstone

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.729 
little contraption so a redstone
contraption<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.050> actually<00:03:04.410> makes<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.650> like

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
contraption that actually makes it like

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.320 
contraption that actually makes it like
a<00:03:04.770> like<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> repeater<00:03:05.970> type<00:03:06.209> of

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
a like it's like a repeater type of

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.550 
a like it's like a repeater type of
thing<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.480> it'll<00:03:06.840> just<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.080> keep<00:03:07.260> flashing

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
thing like it'll just I keep flashing

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.890 
thing like it'll just I keep flashing
and<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.940> know<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.150> sending<00:03:09.390> redstone<00:03:09.750> back

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
and you know like sending redstone back

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.090 
and you know like sending redstone back
and<00:03:10.080> forth<00:03:10.260> back<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.410> forth<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:10.980> actually

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
and forth back and forth and it actually

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.220 
and forth back and forth and it actually
move<00:03:11.459> this<00:03:11.610> piston<00:03:12.090> which<00:03:12.720> will<00:03:12.930> actually

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
move this piston which will actually

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.310 
move this piston which will actually
activate<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.920> move<00:03:14.430> these<00:03:14.670> these<00:03:15.209> rail<00:03:15.510> what

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
activate and move these these rail what

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.920 
activate and move these these rail what
I<00:03:16.380> call<00:03:16.560> redstone<00:03:17.130> rails<00:03:17.850> power<00:03:18.269> rails<00:03:18.570> my<00:03:18.750> bad

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
I call redstone rails power rails my bad

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.560 
I call redstone rails power rails my bad
I<00:03:19.170> don't<00:03:19.769> what<00:03:19.860> I<00:03:19.920> was<00:03:20.040> thinking<00:03:20.310> but<00:03:20.730> um<00:03:20.910> yeah

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
I don't what I was thinking but um yeah

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.759 
I don't what I was thinking but um yeah
it'll<00:03:21.750> actually<00:03:22.080> moved<00:03:22.290> them<00:03:22.410> back<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:22.739> forth

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
it'll actually moved them back and forth

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.170 
it'll actually moved them back and forth
and<00:03:23.070> actually<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.430> will<00:03:23.549> duplicate<00:03:23.880> them<00:03:24.000> so

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
and actually it will duplicate them so

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.430 
and actually it will duplicate them so
I'm<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.450> survival<00:03:24.840> mode<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.110> here<00:03:25.290> will

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
I'm in survival mode so here will

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.470 
I'm in survival mode so here will
activate<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.220> he<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:26.940> activated<00:03:27.390> like

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
activate it and he just activated like

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.820 
activate it and he just activated like
that<00:03:27.660> instead<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.230> it's<00:03:28.620> like

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
that instead of that it's like

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.080 
that instead of that it's like
duplicating<00:03:29.400> I'm<00:03:29.459> like<00:03:29.580> crazy

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
duplicating I'm like crazy

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.860 
duplicating I'm like crazy
oh<00:03:31.610> yeah<00:03:32.610> like<00:03:32.820> it<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.150> mean<00:03:33.299> it's<00:03:33.450> MEMS<00:03:33.660> it'll

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
oh yeah like it I mean it's MEMS it'll

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.240 
oh yeah like it I mean it's MEMS it'll
like<00:03:33.989> duplicate<00:03:34.500> him<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.709> push<00:03:34.890> him<00:03:34.920> forward

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
like duplicate him and push him forward

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.199 
like duplicate him and push him forward
which<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.459> kind<00:03:35.670> of<00:03:35.730> weird<00:03:35.850> but<00:03:35.940> yeah<00:03:36.060> it

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
which is kind of weird but yeah it

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.970 
which is kind of weird but yeah it
duplicate<00:03:36.570> some<00:03:36.690> like<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.620> stop<00:03:37.830> it

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
duplicate some like that and to stop it

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.289 
duplicate some like that and to stop it
obviously<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.549> stop<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.850> like<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.090> and

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
obviously you just stop it like that and

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.610 
obviously you just stop it like that and
how<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.750> build<00:03:39.930> one<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.200> these<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.410> pretty

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
how you build one of these is pretty

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.000 
how you build one of these is pretty
simple

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
simple

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.530 
simple
you<00:03:41.489> just<00:03:41.610> put<00:03:41.730> down<00:03:41.760> two<00:03:42.030> blocks<00:03:42.180> with<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
you just put down two blocks with the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.150 
you just put down two blocks with the
space<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.019> middle<00:03:43.049> you<00:03:43.830> put<00:03:43.920> down

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
space in the middle you put down

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.130 
space in the middle you put down
redstone<00:03:44.670> here<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.330> then<00:03:45.450> on<00:03:45.570> top<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.110> that

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
redstone here and then on top so that

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.870 
redstone here and then on top so that
you<00:03:46.260> make<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.470> little<00:03:46.620> line<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:46.920> this<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.340> you

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
you make a little line like this and you

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.059 
you make a little line like this and you
go<00:03:47.970> back<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.330> forth<00:03:48.390> like<00:03:48.750> that

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
go back and forth like that

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.559 
go back and forth like that
see<00:03:50.459> how<00:03:50.519> like<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:50.879> just<00:03:51.030> like<00:03:51.150> this<00:03:51.269> one<00:03:51.450> is

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
see how like it's just like this one is

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.000 
see how like it's just like this one is
then<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.930> put<00:03:52.080> some<00:03:52.230> redstone<00:03:52.379> torches<00:03:52.799> on

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
then you put some redstone torches on

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.009 
then you put some redstone torches on
each<00:03:53.159> on<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.730> backsides<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.659> each<00:03:54.810> one<00:03:54.989> of

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
each on the backsides of each one of

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.899 
each on the backsides of each one of
these<00:03:55.170> on<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:56.040> front<00:03:56.189> sides<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.670> each<00:03:56.760> one<00:03:56.879> of

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
these on the front sides of each one of

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.460 
these on the front sides of each one of
the<00:03:56.970> blocks<00:03:57.209> then<00:03:57.780> that's<00:03:58.019> it<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.290> then<00:03:58.409> you

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
the blocks then that's it and then you

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.750 
the blocks then that's it and then you
just<00:03:58.620> activate<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.040> just<00:03:59.280> put<00:03:59.489> down<00:03:59.610> the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
just activate you just put down the

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.759 
just activate you just put down the
piston<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.420> think<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.200> need<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.349> break<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
piston I think you need to break the

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.069 
piston I think you need to break the
piston<00:04:02.099> first<00:04:02.430> oh<00:04:02.670> my<00:04:03.090> bad<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.420> didn't<00:04:03.870> put<00:04:03.989> it

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
piston first oh my bad I didn't put it

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.479 
piston first oh my bad I didn't put it
far<00:04:04.170> enough<00:04:04.260> she<00:04:04.799> actually<00:04:04.920> didn't<00:04:05.189> put<00:04:05.280> one

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
far enough she actually didn't put one

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.130 
far enough she actually didn't put one
more<00:04:05.610> piece<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.819> redstone<00:04:06.060> in<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.780> middle<00:04:07.019> of

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
more piece of redstone in the middle of

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.080 
more piece of redstone in the middle of
these<00:04:07.290> two<00:04:07.349> connecting<00:04:08.099> them<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.760> there<00:04:08.940> you

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
these two connecting them and there you

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.670 
these two connecting them and there you
go<00:04:09.209> that's<00:04:09.569> how<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.750> do<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.230> then<00:04:10.349> how<00:04:10.650> you

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
go that's how you do it and then how you

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.500 
go that's how you do it and then how you
do<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.400> rails<00:04:11.610> it's<00:04:11.940> pretty<00:04:12.120> simple<00:04:12.390> to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
do the the rails it's pretty simple to

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.240 
do the the rails it's pretty simple to
use<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.349> make<00:04:13.470> sure<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.860> rails<00:04:14.069> are

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
use it to make sure that the rails are

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.360 
use it to make sure that the rails are
like<00:04:15.150> like<00:04:15.569> an<00:04:15.690> L<00:04:15.840> shape<00:04:16.289> like<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.769> and

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
like like an L shape like that and

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.590 
like like an L shape like that and
that's<00:04:17.430> like<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.789> best<00:04:17.940> way<00:04:18.120> I've<00:04:18.269> found<00:04:18.479> that

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
that's like the best way I've found that

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.300 
that's like the best way I've found that
they<00:04:18.720> actually<00:04:18.989> work<00:04:19.109> there<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.039> go<00:04:20.130> it's

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
they actually work there you go it's

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.490 
they actually work there you go it's
like<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:20.699> starts<00:04:20.910> duplicating<00:04:21.389> them<00:04:21.500> but

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
like it just starts duplicating them but

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
like it just starts duplicating them but
you<00:04:22.590> know<00:04:22.680> probably<00:04:22.770> want<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.100> let<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.310> run

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
you know probably want to let this run

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.710 
you know probably want to let this run
your<00:04:23.639> world<00:04:23.789> all<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.150> time<00:04:24.180> but<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.600> know<00:04:24.660> if

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
your world all the time but you know if

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.210 
your world all the time but you know if
you<00:04:24.810> need<00:04:25.050> some<00:04:25.229> power<00:04:25.440> rails<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.100> have

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
you need some power rails and you have

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.620 
you need some power rails and you have
three<00:04:26.610> two<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:26.910> have<00:04:27.030> three<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.300> work<00:04:27.449> with

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
three two you have three to work with

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.090 
three two you have three to work with
you<00:04:27.810> can<00:04:27.900> duplicate<00:04:28.289> it<00:04:28.440> pretty<00:04:28.650> easily<00:04:28.740> that

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
you can duplicate it pretty easily that

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.610 
you can duplicate it pretty easily that
was<00:04:29.639> kind<00:04:29.789> of<00:04:29.820> cool<00:04:30.000> okay<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.020> now<00:04:31.289> one<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:31.470> the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
was kind of cool okay so now one of the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.990 
was kind of cool okay so now one of the
last<00:04:31.800> duplication<00:04:32.400> which<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.610> got<00:04:32.760> for<00:04:32.940> you

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
last duplication which I got for you

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.100 
last duplication which I got for you
this<00:04:33.090> one<00:04:33.270> X<00:04:33.389> should<00:04:33.479> be<00:04:33.660> in<00:04:33.750> creative<00:04:34.080> mode

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
this one X should be in creative mode

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.170 
this one X should be in creative mode
you're<00:04:34.650> gonna<00:04:34.740> say<00:04:34.919> well<00:04:35.130> creative<00:04:35.910> mode<00:04:36.060> they

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
you're gonna say well creative mode they

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.060 
you're gonna say well creative mode they
automatically<00:04:36.660> duplicate<00:04:37.229> anyways<00:04:37.530> this

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
automatically duplicate anyways this

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.650 
automatically duplicate anyways this
actually<00:04:38.460> isn't<00:04:38.610> for<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.210> item<00:04:39.630> to

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
actually isn't for the item to

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.210 
actually isn't for the item to
duplicates<00:04:40.199> for<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.500> enchantment<00:04:41.160> to

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
duplicates for the enchantment to

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.770 
duplicates for the enchantment to
duplicate<00:04:41.639> so<00:04:42.180> let's<00:04:42.330> say<00:04:42.449> it's<00:04:42.690> actually

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
duplicate so let's say it's actually

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.480 
duplicate so let's say it's actually
more<00:04:43.080> for<00:04:43.199> like<00:04:43.320> let's<00:04:43.500> say<00:04:43.620> Matt<00:04:43.889> builders<00:04:44.310> or

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
more for like let's say Matt builders or

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.920 
more for like let's say Matt builders or
adventure<00:04:44.880> map<00:04:45.030> people<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:45.510> like<00:04:45.630> might

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
adventure map people that like might

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.260 
adventure map people that like might
need<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> whole<00:04:46.470> bunch<00:04:46.770> of<00:04:46.889> one<00:04:47.220> specific<00:04:47.520> type

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
need a whole bunch of one specific type

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.909 
need a whole bunch of one specific type
of<00:04:48.300> enchantment<00:04:48.930> which<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.500> thought<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.830> know

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
of enchantment which I thought you know

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.710 
of enchantment which I thought you know
like<00:04:50.070> this<00:04:50.190> was<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.400> really<00:04:50.940> handy<00:04:51.240> thing<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.479> do

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
like this was a really handy thing to do

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.600 
like this was a really handy thing to do
let's<00:04:52.320> say<00:04:52.440> like<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.710> all<00:04:52.889> needed<00:04:53.220> you<00:04:53.400> needed

let's say like you all needed you needed
this<00:04:53.820> sword<00:04:54.150> for<00:04:54.419> like<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.720> hundred<00:04:55.080> times<00:04:55.229> you

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
this sword for like a hundred times you

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.570 
this sword for like a hundred times you
didn't<00:04:55.650> want<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.830> go<00:04:55.919> through<00:04:56.160> all<00:04:56.370> the

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
didn't want to go through all the

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.890 
didn't want to go through all the
enchanting<00:04:57.030> which<00:04:57.150> it<00:04:57.270> would<00:04:57.389> take<00:04:57.599> to<00:04:57.780> get

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
enchanting which it would take to get

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.170 
enchanting which it would take to get
this<00:04:58.080> exact<00:04:58.530> same<00:04:58.830> one<00:04:59.130> or<00:04:59.400> just<00:04:59.910> fire<00:05:00.150> a

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
this exact same one or just fire a

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.400 
this exact same one or just fire a
specter<00:05:00.570> whatever<00:05:00.810> they<00:05:00.990> check<00:05:01.169> me<00:05:01.260> you<00:05:01.320> would

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
specter whatever they check me you would

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.320 
specter whatever they check me you would
want<00:05:01.620> basically<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:02.490> just<00:05:02.520> put<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:02.940> into<00:05:03.240> an

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
want basically you just put it into an

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.270 
want basically you just put it into an
item<00:05:03.570> for<00:05:03.720> him<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.050> it<00:05:04.530> creates<00:05:04.979> it<00:05:05.070> like<00:05:05.160> that

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
item for him and it creates it like that

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.890 
item for him and it creates it like that
and<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.669> don't<00:05:05.970> break<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.330> item<00:05:06.599> for<00:05:06.750> him

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
and you don't break the item for him

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.689 
and you don't break the item for him
because<00:05:07.320> it<00:05:07.410> just<00:05:07.500> was<00:05:07.740> deleted<00:05:08.130> we<00:05:08.490> have<00:05:08.610> to

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
because it just was deleted we have to

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.640 
because it just was deleted we have to
do<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:08.940> actually<00:05:09.240> break<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:09.690> block<00:05:09.930> behind<00:05:10.470> it

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
do is actually break the block behind it

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.710 
do is actually break the block behind it
and<00:05:10.860> then<00:05:11.250> eventually<00:05:11.490> it'll<00:05:11.760> it'll<00:05:12.120> you<00:05:12.630> know

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
and then eventually it'll it'll you know

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.800 
and then eventually it'll it'll you know
like<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:13.620> fall<00:05:13.919> down<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:15.030> know<00:05:15.120> oh<00:05:15.300> my<00:05:15.660> gosh
