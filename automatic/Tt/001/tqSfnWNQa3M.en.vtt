show you the jig which I made out of

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.900 
show you the jig which I made out of
wood<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:16.310> there's<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.699> layer<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.260> wood<00:00:19.340> a<00:00:20.340> piece

wood and there's a layer of wood a piece
of<00:00:21.090> bicycle<00:00:21.510> inner<00:00:21.630> tube<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.140> acts<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
of bicycle inner tube that acts as a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.000 
of bicycle inner tube that acts as a
seal<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.160> another<00:00:24.090> piece<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.359> wood<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.500> the

seal and another piece of wood now the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.939 
seal and another piece of wood now the
top<00:00:26.220> piece<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.490> wood<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.970> solid<00:00:27.480> as<00:00:27.650> you<00:00:28.650> can

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
top piece of wood is solid as you can

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.290 
top piece of wood is solid as you can
see<00:00:29.359> so<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.320> fits<00:00:31.529> over<00:00:31.740> there<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.300> then

can't just hold it still like that at

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.990 
can't just hold it still like that at
the<00:02:03.869> metal<00:02:04.140> it'll<00:02:04.409> burn<00:02:04.619> through<00:02:05.009> if<00:02:05.850> you've

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the metal it'll burn through if you've

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.180 
the metal it'll burn through if you've
never<00:02:06.180> welded<00:02:06.930> before<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:07.770> oxy<00:02:08.129> acetylene

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
never welded before with oxy acetylene

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.240 
never welded before with oxy acetylene
torch<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.780> move<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.050> around<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.979> in

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
torch you have to move it around like in

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.110 
torch you have to move it around like in
a<00:02:11.370> circular<00:02:11.610> motion

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
a circular motion

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.970 
a circular motion
to<00:02:13.360> just<00:02:13.569> kind<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:13.840> heat<00:02:14.260> everything<00:02:14.530> real

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
to just kind of heat everything real

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.100 
to just kind of heat everything real
nice<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.400> even<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.909> don't<00:02:16.540> want<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.840> hold<00:02:16.930> it

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
nice and even you don't want to hold it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.229 
nice and even you don't want to hold it
in<00:02:17.170> one<00:02:17.260> place<00:02:17.440> like<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.459> said<00:02:18.670> it'll<00:02:18.909> get<00:02:19.090> too

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
in one place like I said it'll get too

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.210 
in one place like I said it'll get too
hot<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.569> an<00:02:19.870> area<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.379> just<00:02:20.560> burn<00:02:20.739> through<00:02:21.010> and

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
hot in an area and just burn through and

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.100 
hot in an area and just burn through and
you<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:21.879> hold<00:02:22.269> it<00:02:22.420> there<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.659> just<00:02:22.900> kind<00:02:23.080> of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
you just hold it there and just kind of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.530 
you just hold it there and just kind of
watch<00:02:23.349> it<00:02:23.560> as<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.799> pulls<00:02:24.040> apart<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.299> metal

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
watch it as it pulls apart and the metal

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.210 
watch it as it pulls apart and the metal
starts<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.930> reform<00:02:26.290> itself<00:02:26.560> into<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.010> tube

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
starts to reform itself into the tube

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.789 
starts to reform itself into the tube
and<00:02:27.580> then<00:02:28.569> once<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.930> starts<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.409> move<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.769> want

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
and then once it starts to move you want

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.860 
and then once it starts to move you want
to<00:02:29.980> pull<00:02:30.190> back<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:31.239> kind<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.480> watch<00:02:31.659> it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
to pull back and just kind of watch it

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.630 
to pull back and just kind of watch it
to<00:02:31.989> make<00:02:32.170> sure<00:02:32.379> that<00:02:32.620> it's<00:02:33.220> not<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.549> to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
to make sure that it's not going to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.970 
to make sure that it's not going to
expand<00:02:34.180> too<00:02:34.420> much<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:34.989> if<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.349> does<00:02:35.530> start<00:02:35.680> to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
expand too much and if it does start to

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.369 
expand too much and if it does start to
you<00:02:36.250> can<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:36.549> your<00:02:36.700> assistant<00:02:37.290> hit<00:02:38.290> the

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
you can have your assistant hit the

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.289 
you can have your assistant hit the
release<00:02:38.680> valve<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.129> the<00:02:39.159> tube<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.730> let<00:02:40.180> the

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
release valve of the tube to let the

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.699 
release valve of the tube to let the
pressure<00:02:40.540> out<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.170> doesn't<00:02:41.230> over

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
pressure out so that it doesn't over

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.890 
pressure out so that it doesn't over
expand<00:02:42.209> that's<00:02:43.209> pretty<00:02:43.450> much<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.750> trick<00:02:45.900> well

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
expand that's pretty much the trick well

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.869 
expand that's pretty much the trick well
it<00:02:47.200> worked<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.829> did<00:02:48.069> have<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.370> braise<00:02:48.549> a<00:02:48.579> little

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
it worked I did have to braise a little

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.640 
it worked I did have to braise a little
hole<00:02:49.060> because<00:02:49.329> I<00:02:49.450> got<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.690> little<00:02:50.019> too<00:02:50.170> hot<00:02:50.379> on

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
hole because I got a little too hot on

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.830 
hole because I got a little too hot on
my<00:02:50.890> first<00:02:51.160> try<00:02:51.629> not<00:02:52.629> a<00:02:52.660> problem<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:54.660> let's<00:02:55.660> see

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
my first try not a problem but let's see

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.630 
my first try not a problem but let's see
you<00:02:56.019> can<00:02:56.170> see<00:02:56.319> this<00:02:56.440> one<00:02:56.620> out<00:02:56.739> here<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:59.140> was

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
you can see this one out here that was

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.920 
you can see this one out here that was
crushed<00:03:00.640> pretty<00:03:00.909> good<00:03:01.120> now<00:03:01.540> it's<00:03:01.720> nice<00:03:01.900> and

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
crushed pretty good now it's nice and

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.110 
crushed pretty good now it's nice and
pretty<00:03:02.680> darn<00:03:02.890> round<00:03:03.780> same<00:03:04.780> thing<00:03:04.959> over<00:03:05.109> here

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
pretty darn round same thing over here

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.479 
pretty darn round same thing over here
it's<00:03:07.120> looking<00:03:07.359> pretty<00:03:07.510> good

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
it's looking pretty good

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.680 
it's looking pretty good
plus<00:03:09.489> see<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.790> could<00:03:09.940> manipulate<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.629> with

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
plus see you could manipulate it with

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.589 
plus see you could manipulate it with
the<00:03:10.780> pliers<00:03:10.959> a<00:03:11.140> little<00:03:11.349> bit<00:03:11.470> too<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:12.250> one

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
the pliers a little bit too this one

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.039 
the pliers a little bit too this one
pretty<00:03:13.599> round<00:03:13.930> now<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.709> was<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> pretty<00:03:15.459> smashed

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
pretty round now it was a pretty smashed

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.440 
pretty round now it was a pretty smashed
oil<00:03:17.049> go<00:03:17.200> right<00:03:17.470> through<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.709> now<00:03:18.329> there<00:03:19.329> was

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
oil go right through that now there was

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.199 
oil go right through that now there was
another<00:03:19.480> one<00:03:19.810> over<00:03:19.959> here<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:21.700> was<00:03:21.910> crushed

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
another one over here that was crushed

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.890 
another one over here that was crushed
in<00:03:22.620> it's<00:03:23.620> good<00:03:23.859> eye<00:03:24.239> pressure<00:03:25.239> tested<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.780> to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
in it's good eye pressure tested it to

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.270 
in it's good eye pressure tested it to
100<00:03:26.230> psi<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:28.410> way<00:03:29.410> more<00:03:29.440> than<00:03:29.859> the<00:03:30.099> oil

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
100 psi it's way more than the oil

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.530 
100 psi it's way more than the oil
pressures<00:03:30.760> going<00:03:30.879> to<00:03:30.970> be<00:03:31.060> going<00:03:31.209> through<00:03:31.389> this

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
pressures going to be going through this

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.349 
pressures going to be going through this
so<00:03:31.780> it's<00:03:32.109> good<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.530> go<00:03:32.910> now<00:03:33.910> I'm<00:03:33.970> going<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.180> do

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
so it's good to go now I'm going to do

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.030 
so it's good to go now I'm going to do
another<00:03:34.569> one<00:03:34.660> this<00:03:35.340> one's<00:03:36.340> really<00:03:36.669> severe<00:03:38.040> you

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
another one this one's really severe you

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.240 
another one this one's really severe you
can<00:03:39.250> see<00:03:39.459> how<00:03:39.609> crushed<00:03:40.299> that<00:03:40.599> is<00:03:40.949> it's<00:03:41.949> pretty

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
can see how crushed that is it's pretty

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.509 
can see how crushed that is it's pretty
damaged<00:03:43.470> but<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:46.560> all<00:03:47.560> this<00:03:47.769> one<00:03:47.949> over<00:03:48.129> here<00:03:48.310> -

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
damaged but and all this one over here -

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.670 
damaged but and all this one over here -
this<00:03:48.699> is<00:03:48.849> a<00:03:48.879> long<00:03:49.209> one<00:03:49.480> it'll<00:03:50.410> be<00:03:50.530> interesting

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
this is a long one it'll be interesting

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.349 
this is a long one it'll be interesting
to<00:03:50.919> see<00:03:51.129> how<00:03:51.280> far<00:03:51.519> this<00:03:51.699> goes<00:03:51.790> might<00:03:52.180> have<00:03:52.269> to

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
to see how far this goes might have to

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.580 
to see how far this goes might have to
get<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.540> pliers<00:03:52.750> out<00:03:52.959> on<00:03:53.109> this<00:03:53.199> one<00:03:53.410> while

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
get the pliers out on this one while

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.710 
get the pliers out on this one while
it's<00:03:53.769> hot<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.190> see<00:03:54.310> if<00:03:54.819> I<00:03:54.940> can<00:03:55.090> kind<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.329> reform

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
it's hot and see if I can kind of reform

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.189 
it's hot and see if I can kind of reform
it<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.900> little<00:03:56.079> bit<00:03:57.540> all<00:03:58.540> right<00:03:58.599> this<00:03:58.930> time

ISA pliers just a little bit when it was
cooling<00:04:18.250> down<00:04:18.720> but<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.930> air<00:04:20.320> pushed<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.859> all

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
cooling down but the air pushed it all

pieces the wood

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:32.320 
pieces the wood
to<00:04:26.480> fit<00:04:26.630> around<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.930> pipe<00:04:28.210> so<00:04:31.060> piece<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.210> inner

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
to fit around the pipe so piece of inner

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.650 
to fit around the pipe so piece of inner
tube<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.780> seal<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.170> on<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.380> end<00:04:33.700> so<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:35.090> goes

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
tube to seal it on the end so it goes

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:46.480 
tube to seal it on the end so it goes
like<00:04:35.810> this<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:38.890> inner<00:04:39.890> tube<00:04:41.350> together<00:04:45.490> clamp

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
like this that inner tube together clamp

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.080 
like this that inner tube together clamp
on<00:04:46.700> both<00:04:46.880> sides<00:04:48.400> you<00:04:49.400> don't<00:04:49.490> have<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:49.730> clamp<00:04:49.910> it

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
on both sides you don't have to clamp it

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.910 
on both sides you don't have to clamp it
too<00:04:50.210> hard<00:04:50.450> pump<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.080> up<00:04:51.170> full<00:04:51.320> of<00:04:51.350> air<00:04:51.560> you're

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
too hard pump it up full of air you're

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.300 
too hard pump it up full of air you're
good<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.130> go

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
good to go
