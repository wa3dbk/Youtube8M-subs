00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.230
 Hello UTB to desert today 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.110
 I will give you a little digression on 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.490
 upcoming update what has changed coming 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.830
 see the game and immediately see 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.420
 updated game interface ie 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.810
 changed menu 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.160
 color in principle the very look form and rear 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:30.190
 background well background is taken if new card 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.840
 changed the top panel to here writes 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.850
 nickname can change it also 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.519
 your general information is displayed this 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.860
 level amount of money experience you can 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.680
 turn off or turn on the sound 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.570
 finally a full mode screen 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.450
 finally this feature has been adapted 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.680
 and you can sit fools cry not even when 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.960
 you go out of battle you can watch the top 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.190
 50 players and put settings on 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.360
 fit part of the settings already 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.520
 saved completely you don't need 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.469
 each time put them again for example 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.590
 entering the battle after refreshing the page 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.420
 or reopen the application each 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.310
 time needed to re-establish 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.470
 screen resolution for fullscreen 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.000
 now it is not necessary to do everything 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.069
 the settings you set 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.770
 click save and they will remain until 

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:19.810
 you do not change their values shop 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.429
 In principle, nothing really does not 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.149
 only the external has changed 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:24.459
 registration 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.970
 for example on the icon with things was 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:29.530
 added ribbons that showed 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.459
 In general, information is things that is bought 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.690
 or new here it is in battles in principle 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.720
 nothing has changed and so same 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.020
 name card mode level number 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.969
 the man on the card is card mode and 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.250
 proper key enter 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.020
 chat is also not changed in principle all of 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.060
 you were sitting to consider it makes no sense 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.560
 everyone knows how to use cheat clans 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.049
 shown at all 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.390
 information chapter deputy level 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.219
 the coat of arms everything is like here before 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.520
 displays information about nested 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.390
 rubles and votes you can invest in 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.489
 clan or his job off what 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.679
 related to work left as before 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.170
 the door of work has not changed only 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.599
 changed the design here start work 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.580
 Here is currently unavailable work 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.940
 in principle, what can be said for 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.140
 menu design is all now moving 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.140
 to the next part of my review 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.989
 well now let's take a closer look at the game itself 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.540
 firstly the camera behavior was changed 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.940
 she became more alive here if you leave 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.099
 character in a state of rest, you see 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.230
 yes he understand what that movement is 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.500
 added a lot of different animations 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.590
 also here is a little delay after 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.360
 turning after mouse movement and an example 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.730
 The animation is clearly visible on the weapon for example 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.299
 landing moment also different animations 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.390
 can be seen by the very same movement 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.040
 rbg mutant model was changed was 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.269
 changed the sight of the RPP he now became 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.549
 Optical has become much easier as per 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.239
 it's much easier for me to climb the stairs 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.980
 so their mechanics were improved it became 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.180
 much more realistic as you see me 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.040
 here we are climbing the stairs 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.160
 the most pleasant thing is that now you can 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.860
 calmly turn blew in any direction and 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.620
 don't fall like before 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.180
 see also changed the model of the gun 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.090
 on principle, nothing new you it for you 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.120
 perfectly seen from the pictures by the screenshot 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.120
 in a group before that but which is much more important 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.660
 I think the model was changed from Lana 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.480
 as for me here the elephant is just a fairy tale 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.420
 unlike the previous version only 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.150
 moment by the way was added recoil from 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.910
 about how I shot him about where 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.790
 the opportunity became available 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.069
 changes of clan coats of arms were 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.160
 fixed damage calculation errors 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.340
 gauss damage has become increased and the player himself 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.709
 began to get damage from gauss as 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.810
 it seems very silly before that 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.489
 anybody bought gauss 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.560
 not only that he kills from the first 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.349
 shot so you can still just freebie 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.870
 shooting yourself under your feet so a little bit 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.900
 it was not correct therefore it was accepted 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.729
 decision anomalies by the way now become not 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.549
 so harmless what understanding 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.910
 Approximately 15 fps removes even 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.419
 20 that is, a little too spoils the whole 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.210
 the picture 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.490
 opportunity to lie down now was removed 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.690
 the player can only be position 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.419
 standing and sitting 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.610
 the tracers from bullets have been fixed now 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.860
 you canâ€™t get into ordinary bugs by the way 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.080
 the way it was before will give to those 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.210
 god that were previously already blocked 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.729
 maybe there are new bugs the problem is not 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.540
 there is always but the developers will be their 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.190
 clean up now we are actively working on 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.500
 an application so work is boiling 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.180
 the mechanics of the rifle were changed 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.490
 weapons are a little easier with him now 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.440
 contact crystal menus other 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.160
 a new card was added as usual 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.430
 jail 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.120
 review in the group you have already seen it 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.840
 Gauss replaced 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:11.380
 riflescope on the mechanical here it is 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.289
 Now all this was supposed to finish in 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.720
 In principle, I think that on the topic of updating 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.090
 all that could be said I already said 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.020
 literally very soon you can do it yourself 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.280
 try it out by eye new cards 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.610
 get great pleasure from but 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.310
 we will introduce you in case of any course 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:34.139
 innovations to all thank you all so far with 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.139
 you were a deserter of a good game
