00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
now we are going to finish our water

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.809 
now we are going to finish our water
lily<00:00:02.790> we<00:00:03.240> folded<00:00:03.659> our<00:00:03.870> blitzes<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.770> we<00:00:05.400> folded

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
lily we folded our blitzes and we folded

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.190 
lily we folded our blitzes and we folded
the<00:00:05.970> notches<00:00:06.180> in<00:00:06.600> now<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.259> are<00:00:07.589> going<00:00:07.890> to

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
the notches in now we are going to

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.039 
the notches in now we are going to
reverse<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.860> petals<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.750> tricky

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
reverse the petals this is the tricky

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.099 
reverse the petals this is the tricky
part<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.730> requires<00:00:15.150> some<00:00:15.420> persistence

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
part and it requires some persistence

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.330 
part and it requires some persistence
and<00:00:16.379> patience<00:00:17.449> so<00:00:18.449> holding<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.590> unit<00:00:20.070> in

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and patience so holding the unit in

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.200 
and patience so holding the unit in
between<00:00:21.060> your<00:00:21.210> hands<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.840> your<00:00:22.020> thumb<00:00:22.470> is

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
between your hands so that your thumb is

between your hands so that your thumb is
pushing<00:00:24.210> down<00:00:24.390> all<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.869> center<00:00:25.199> points<00:00:26.390> note

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
pushing down all the center points note

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.209 
pushing down all the center points note
the<00:00:28.740> pockets<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.269> other<00:00:30.480> side<00:00:31.040> here<00:00:32.040> we

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the pockets on the other side here we

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.910 
the pockets on the other side here we
are<00:00:32.340> going<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.730> take<00:00:32.940> our<00:00:33.149> fingers<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.930> put

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
are going to take our fingers and put

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.280 
are going to take our fingers and put
them<00:00:35.130> under<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.610> pocket<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> with<00:00:36.780> our<00:00:36.930> thumb

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
them under the pocket and with our thumb

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.670 
them under the pocket and with our thumb
push<00:00:38.100> down<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.629> little<00:00:39.930> notch<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.559> we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
push down on this little notch that we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.090 
push down on this little notch that we
had<00:00:40.890> made<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.379> reverse<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:44.040> petal<00:00:45.890> this<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
had made and reverse the petal this is

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790 
had made and reverse the petal this is
why<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.520> require<00:00:47.760> some<00:00:48.390> soft<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.140> pliable

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
why we require some soft and pliable

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.990 
why we require some soft and pliable
paper<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:51.149> way<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.690> won't<00:00:51.840> rip<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.379> us<00:00:53.000> again

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
paper that way it won't rip on us again

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.830 
paper that way it won't rip on us again
we'll<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.079> for<00:00:55.590> all<00:00:55.860> four<00:00:56.610> petals<00:00:59.840> holding

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
we'll do it for all four petals holding

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:10.870 
we'll do it for all four petals holding
the<00:01:00.989> center<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:03.500> reversed<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.430> petals

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.050 

these<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.300> first<00:01:12.510> sets<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.080> petals<00:01:14.060> now

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
these are the first sets of petals now

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.680 
these are the first sets of petals now
there<00:01:15.390> are<00:01:15.510> more<00:01:16.580> there<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.730> four<00:01:18.000> more<00:01:18.270> here

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
there are more there are four more here

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:28.300 
there are more there are four more here
and<00:01:19.110> we're<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.620> reverse<00:01:20.160> them<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.910> well

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.690 

and<00:01:30.350> finally<00:01:32.150> we<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:33.360> last<00:01:33.830> set<00:01:34.830> of<00:01:35.100> pedals

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and finally we have a last set of pedals

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.170 
and finally we have a last set of pedals
to<00:01:36.090> refold<00:01:36.510> reverse<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
to refold reverse and this is the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
to refold reverse and this is the
trickiest<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:40.080> all<00:01:40.230> because<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.890> one

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
trickiest one of all because it's one

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.440 
trickiest one of all because it's one
layer<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:43.050> tear<00:01:43.380> more<00:01:44.160> easily<00:01:44.610> so

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
layer and it can tear more easily so

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.380 
layer and it can tear more easily so
here<00:01:46.790> very<00:01:47.840> gently<00:01:49.610> we're<00:01:50.610> going<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.970> reverse

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
here very gently we're going to reverse

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.969 
here very gently we're going to reverse
that<00:01:51.420> petal<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.390> don't<00:01:54.510> rip<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.110> very

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
that petal so that we don't rip the very

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.110 
that petal so that we don't rip the very
edges<00:01:57.350> very<00:01:58.350> gently<00:01:58.880> reverse<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.150> pedal<00:02:02.120> our

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
edges very gently reverse that pedal our

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.219 
edges very gently reverse that pedal our
third<00:02:03.540> one<00:02:04.520> oops<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.910> ripped<00:02:06.660> it<00:02:07.820> that's<00:02:08.820> okay

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
third one oops I ripped it that's okay

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:19.880 
third one oops I ripped it that's okay
and<00:02:11.540> then<00:02:12.540> finally<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:15.360> last<00:02:15.390> petal<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:18.890> then

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
and then finally the last petal and then

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.500 
and then finally the last petal and then
go<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:21.060> there<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.630> kind<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.470> reform<00:02:23.510> your

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
go in there and kind of reform your

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.290 
go in there and kind of reform your
water<00:02:24.959> lily<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:26.970> correct<00:02:27.450> shape<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.790> you

water lily to the correct shape and you

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.890 
water lily to the correct shape and you
have<00:02:30.510> your<00:02:31.170> water<00:02:31.380> lily
