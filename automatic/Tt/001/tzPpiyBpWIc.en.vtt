00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
here it is right here and I wanted to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.400 
here it is right here and I wanted to
apologize<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.539> doesn't<00:00:27.570> look<00:00:27.810> all<00:00:27.990> nice<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
apologize it doesn't look all nice and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.200 
apologize it doesn't look all nice and
neat<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.800> does<00:00:29.310> look<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.730> browning<00:00:30.060> has

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
neat it does look like the browning has

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.310 
neat it does look like the browning has
been<00:00:30.390> taken<00:00:30.689> out<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.929> reason<00:00:31.169> why<00:00:31.259> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
been taken out the reason why the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.930 
been taken out the reason why the
instructions<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.040> say<00:00:32.279> take<00:00:32.790> out<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
instructions do say take out the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.750 
instructions do say take out the
Browning<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.540> heat<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:35.220> rest<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.550> stuff

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
Browning and heat up the rest of stuff

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.970 
Browning and heat up the rest of stuff
so<00:00:36.120> that's<00:00:36.570> why<00:00:36.720> I<00:00:36.750> doesn't<00:00:37.020> look<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.290> picture

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
and this is the one I tried before those

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.580 
and this is the one I tried before those
mashed<00:02:21.660> potatoes<00:02:22.020> were<00:02:22.110> actually<00:02:22.380> really

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
mashed potatoes were actually really

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.230 
mashed potatoes were actually really
good<00:02:22.740> they<00:02:23.400> should<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.760> keep<00:02:23.850> with<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.060> same

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
good they should just keep with the same

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.900 
good they should just keep with the same
formula<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.830> try<00:02:25.980> with<00:02:26.100> this<00:02:26.130> one<00:02:26.400> it's

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
formula and try with this one it's

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.640 
formula and try with this one it's
missing<00:02:27.240> no<00:02:27.480> it's<00:02:27.690> not<00:02:27.810> bad<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.350> just<00:02:28.410> it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
missing no it's not bad it's just it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.130 
missing no it's not bad it's just it
feels<00:02:29.100> like<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.400> lacking<00:02:29.640> stuff<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.540> doesn't

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
feels like it's lacking stuff it doesn't

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.230 
feels like it's lacking stuff it doesn't
taste<00:02:31.260> awful<00:02:31.770> but<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.670> feels<00:02:32.850> like<00:02:32.880> stacking

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
taste awful but just feels like stacking

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.550 
taste awful but just feels like stacking
stuff<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:33.720> just<00:02:33.930> give<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:35.810> boneless<00:02:36.810> I'm

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.340 
stuff so just give this a boneless I'm
hoping<00:02:37.950> bonus<00:02:38.550> fried<00:02:38.760> chicken<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:40.530> takes<00:02:42.350> okay

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
hoping bonus fried chicken it takes okay

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.900 
hoping bonus fried chicken it takes okay
first<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:43.980> all<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.070> don't<00:02:44.160> like<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.460> coloring

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
first of all I don't like the coloring

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.430 
first of all I don't like the coloring
on<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.210> or<00:02:45.690> she<00:02:45.810> could<00:02:45.930> be<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.050> little<00:02:46.290> bit

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
on that or she could be a little bit

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.090 
on that or she could be a little bit
more<00:02:46.560> browner<00:02:48.680> there's<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.740> piece<00:02:49.920> right<00:02:50.010> there

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
more browner there's a piece right there

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.170 
more browner there's a piece right there
it<00:02:50.340> looks<00:02:50.490> like<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.760> big<00:02:50.970> piece<00:02:51.150> of

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
it looks like it's a big piece of

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:01.310 
it looks like it's a big piece of
chicken<00:02:58.940> has<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> texture<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.110> frozen

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
chicken has a texture of the of a frozen

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.300 
chicken has a texture of the of a frozen
I<00:03:01.820> mean<00:03:02.820> because<00:03:02.970> that's<00:03:03.210> what<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:04.310> doesn't

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
I mean because that's what it is doesn't

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.540 
I mean because that's what it is doesn't
taste<00:03:05.760> as<00:03:06.530> far<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.650> texture<00:03:07.980> texture<00:03:08.430> wise

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
taste as far as a texture texture wise

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.390 
taste as far as a texture texture wise
it<00:03:08.880> doesn't<00:03:09.480> feel<00:03:09.630> like<00:03:09.690> it's<00:03:09.990> fresh<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
it doesn't feel like it's fresh but the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.260 
it doesn't feel like it's fresh but the
flavoring<00:03:12.020> isn't<00:03:13.020> too<00:03:13.200> bad<00:03:14.180> something<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.240> can

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
flavoring isn't too bad something I can

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.180 
flavoring isn't too bad something I can
live<00:03:15.540> with<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.900> do<00:03:18.960> like<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.290> give<00:03:19.620> two<00:03:20.010> big

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
live with and I do like to give two big

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.150 
live with and I do like to give two big
pieces<00:03:23.360> about<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.630> all<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:25.010> think<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.070> would

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
pieces about it all I think it would

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.230 
pieces about it all I think it would
come<00:03:26.250> out<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.400> lot<00:03:26.610> better<00:03:26.790> if<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.120> use<00:03:27.150> the

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
come out a lot better if you use the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.730 
come out a lot better if you use the
convention<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.960> i<00:03:28.080> just<00:03:28.110> happen<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.560> use<00:03:28.710> a

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
convention of it i just happen to use a

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.860 
convention of it i just happen to use a
microwave<00:03:29.210> pressure<00:03:30.210> commission<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.750> it

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
microwave pressure commission of it

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.730 
microwave pressure commission of it
would<00:03:31.020> probably<00:03:31.200> come<00:03:31.410> out<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.530> little<00:03:31.590> bit

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
would probably come out a little bit

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.590 
would probably come out a little bit
better<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.730> chicken<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.090> not<00:03:33.210> bad<00:03:33.390> it's

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
better but the chicken is not bad it's

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.410 
better but the chicken is not bad it's
it's<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.710> it's<00:03:34.980> par<00:03:35.550> it's<00:03:35.940> part<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.300> all

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
it's it's a it's par it's part with all

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.750 
it's it's a it's par it's part with all
the<00:03:36.510> frozen<00:03:36.810> ones<00:03:37.050> i<00:03:37.290> think<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.370> chickens<00:03:38.700> a

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
the frozen ones i think of chickens a

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.400 
the frozen ones i think of chickens a
little<00:03:38.790> bit<00:03:39.240> better<00:03:39.330> than<00:03:39.540> some<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.350> the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
little bit better than some of the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.050 
little bit better than some of the
frozen<00:03:40.560> boneless<00:03:41.550> chicken<00:03:41.940> I've<00:03:42.060> tried<00:03:44.060> now

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
frozen boneless chicken I've tried now

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.030 
frozen boneless chicken I've tried now

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
that's definitely a star definitely hmm

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.850 
that's definitely a star definitely hmm
my<00:03:53.040> place<00:03:53.250> was<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.400> lot<00:03:53.580> better<00:03:53.700> okay<00:03:54.120> i<00:03:54.860> will

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
definitely maybe you fix it up a little

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.800 
definitely maybe you fix it up a little
