won't be the wire won't see I won't be
able<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.380> close<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.680> doors

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.160 

next<00:01:57.250> time<00:01:57.490> we're<00:01:57.880> going<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.150> be<00:01:58.330> taking<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.900> set

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
next time we're going to be taking a set

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.580 
next time we're going to be taking a set
of<00:01:59.290> Records<00:01:59.770> models<00:02:00.300> photographs<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:01.690> the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
of Records models photographs and the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.160 
of Records models photographs and the
cephalometric<00:02:03.100> x-ray<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.940> jogs<00:02:04.240> right<00:02:04.570> I'm

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
cephalometric x-ray the jogs right I'm

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.200 
cephalometric x-ray the jogs right I'm
going<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.410> see<00:02:05.560> how<00:02:05.740> close<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.979> is<00:02:09.160> in<00:02:09.670> terms<00:02:10.000> of

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
going to see how close to is in terms of

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.270 
going to see how close to is in terms of
the<00:02:10.360> decompensation<00:02:11.350> in<00:02:11.680> terms<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.070> getting

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
the decompensation in terms of getting

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.400 
the decompensation in terms of getting
her<00:02:12.610> ready<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:13.090> surgery<00:02:13.330> they<00:02:14.080> know<00:02:14.230> that

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
her ready for surgery they know that

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.890 
her ready for surgery they know that
bite<00:02:15.040> isn't<00:02:15.250> correct<00:02:15.760> because<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.660> jaw

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
bite isn't correct because of the jaw

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.550 
bite isn't correct because of the jaw
discrepancy<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.760> ideally<00:02:19.630> this<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.380> what

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
discrepancy so ideally this is what

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.530 
discrepancy so ideally this is what
we're<00:02:20.709> going<00:02:20.890> for<00:02:21.070> worthy<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.970> jaws<00:02:22.240> are

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
we're going for worthy the jaws are

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.240 
we're going for worthy the jaws are
aligned<00:02:22.990> properly<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.770> teeth<00:02:24.040> fit

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
aligned properly and the teeth fit

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.380 
aligned properly and the teeth fit
together<00:02:24.550> properly<00:02:25.540> now<00:02:26.530> bites<00:02:27.520> downs<00:02:27.850> she

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
together properly now bites downs she

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.900 
together properly now bites downs she
bites<00:02:28.600> down<00:02:28.810> something<00:02:29.350> like<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.910> because

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
bites down something like this because

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.300 
bites down something like this because
of<00:02:31.270> her<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.840> underlying<00:02:32.230> jaw<00:02:32.470> discrepancy<00:02:33.160> so

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
of her the underlying jaw discrepancy so

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.790 
of her the underlying jaw discrepancy so
what<00:02:33.489> we're<00:02:33.610> going<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.820> do<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.570> next<00:02:35.230> time<00:02:35.410> I've

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
what we're going to do is next time I've

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.979 
what we're going to do is next time I've
aligned<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.310> upper<00:02:36.580> teeth<00:02:36.850> relativity<00:02:37.660> upper

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
aligned the upper teeth relativity upper

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.290 
aligned the upper teeth relativity upper
jaw<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:39.070> lower<00:02:39.280> teeth<00:02:39.610> relative<00:02:40.150> to

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
jaw and the lower teeth relative to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.449 
jaw and the lower teeth relative to
lower<00:02:40.540> John<00:02:40.900> they're<00:02:41.140> aligned<00:02:41.620> independent

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
lower John they're aligned independent

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.940 
lower John they're aligned independent
of<00:02:42.610> each<00:02:42.730> other<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.870> what<00:02:44.050> we<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.350> is<00:02:44.380> when<00:02:44.860> we

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
of each other so what we do is when we

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.340 
of each other so what we do is when we
get<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.220> models<00:02:45.640> next<00:02:46.000> time<00:02:46.209> we'll<00:02:47.110> be<00:02:47.140> able

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
get the models next time we'll be able

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.150 
get the models next time we'll be able
to<00:02:47.590> see<00:02:48.690> how<00:02:49.920> they<00:02:50.920> fit<00:02:51.130> together<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.850> that's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
to see how they fit together and that's

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.949 
to see how they fit together and that's
that<00:02:54.160> kind<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.489> shows<00:02:54.820> us<00:02:54.850> what<00:02:55.239> happens<00:02:55.720> as<00:02:55.930> a

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
that kind of shows us what happens as a

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.170 
that kind of shows us what happens as a
result<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.560> surgery<00:02:56.799> it'll<00:02:57.700> let<00:02:57.910> me<00:02:58.030> know

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
result of the surgery it'll let me know

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.020 
result of the surgery it'll let me know
if<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.480> have<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.810> do<00:02:58.930> any<00:02:59.110> other<00:02:59.530> type<00:02:59.830> of

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
