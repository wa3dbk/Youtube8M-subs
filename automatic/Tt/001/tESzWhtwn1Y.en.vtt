 Hello everyone I am sonic sonic the hedgehog 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.240
 new i am ricardo vázquez alias in you in 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.360
 inwood works and then today 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.280
 I bring a gameplay from a game that I saw 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.890
 they were advertising on television 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.600
 that was free and I decided to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.600
 download what is the 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.570
 need for speed world and then the truth 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.630
 I come to recommend you this I am not 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.100
 very expert in the i by speed really 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.840
 I consider myself a player more or not of 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.700
 that kind of games but let's try 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.730
 how are you really already played a 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.130
 race here in this game and it's very 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.670
 well the truth apart from that it has then 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:01.220
 good graphics is played online you can 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.080
 find more players you find 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.290
 with cool cars I have there 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.220
 a dodge 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.220
 I think 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.850
 and it really is a very good game 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.520
 Yes I really liked this truth not 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.369
 it takes a long time to download 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.789
 and then he is very father really is very 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.789
 father 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.930
 well I tell you really is a very good 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.450
 game 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.280
 I will continue to investigate the truth here 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.090
 because I do not understand this much about the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.400
 racing games and then yes I would like 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.440
 gather more people to do a little bit of 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.280
 Desmadre here in the city of need 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.050
 for speed world 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.630
 this I will leave in the description 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:52.259
 Well the way how to download it 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.900
 and well apart from that much more games 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.390
 to download both this 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.610
 it's so good it's a good selection of 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.830
 games but he called me more the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.280
 attention and for speed world that most 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.280
 I was going to say 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.420
 with respect to what are fund oops 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.030
 many no longer look for some reasons 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.480
 I have here there will be much pando 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.750
 beni channel on my channel sorry I will continue 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.670
 going up gameplays 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.700
 and the whole bit of that - it goes by 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.060
 There I received several requests for 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.300
 several messages to make some sides with 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.240
 others 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.270
 and I really like the truth that if 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:42.270
 they will call me for projects of pando but 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.569
 for the moment I'll leave them there 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.989
 and well 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.599
 I hope you enjoyed downloading 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.760
