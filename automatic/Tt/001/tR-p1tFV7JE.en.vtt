how<00:00:05.040> do<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.160> handle<00:00:05.339> splits<00:00:05.810> when<00:00:06.810> you're

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
how do you handle splits when you're

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.049 
how do you handle splits when you're
left<00:00:07.080> with<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> split<00:00:07.560> sometimes<00:00:08.490> people<00:00:08.730> panic

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
left with a split sometimes people panic

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.299 
left with a split sometimes people panic
and<00:00:09.090> they<00:00:09.900> figure<00:00:10.139> they<00:00:10.230> can't<00:00:10.440> make<00:00:10.620> them<00:00:10.800> but

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
and they figure they can't make them but

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.430 
and they figure they can't make them but
most<00:00:11.519> splits<00:00:11.790> are<00:00:11.940> pretty<00:00:12.630> much<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> hardest

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
most splits are pretty much a hardest

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.379 
most splits are pretty much a hardest
spare<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.799> make<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.639> align<00:00:14.910> itself<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.299> a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
spare to make and to align itself with a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.880 
spare to make and to align itself with a
split<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.170> not<00:00:16.320> much<00:00:16.470> different<00:00:16.740> than<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
split is not much different than a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.740 
split is not much different than a
regular<00:00:16.920> spare<00:00:17.490> there's<00:00:18.390> more<00:00:18.539> risk

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
regular spare there's more risk

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.480 
regular spare there's more risk
obviously<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.859> little<00:00:20.130> harder<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.430> make

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
obviously it's a little harder to make

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.189 
obviously it's a little harder to make
but<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.300> definitely<00:00:21.630> make<00:00:21.779> them<00:00:21.900> at<00:00:22.109> least

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
but you definitely make them at least

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.810 
but you definitely make them at least
make<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> good<00:00:22.680> attempt<00:00:23.070> if<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.609> use<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
make a good attempt if you use the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.599 
make a good attempt if you use the
methods<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.269> your<00:00:24.930> spare<00:00:25.199> shots<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.949> 369

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609

methods of your spare shots the 369
method<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.720> least<00:00:27.840> aligned<00:00:28.109> yourself<00:00:28.199> up

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740

with<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.550> certain<00:00:29.910> part<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.269> spare<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.779> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
split you have different pins you look

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.720 
split you have different pins you look
at<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.079> look<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> left<00:00:35.010> side<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.489> right

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
at you look at the left side the right

at you look at the left side the right
side<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> pin<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.660> little<00:00:37.230> bit<00:00:37.500> earlier<00:00:38.190> on

side of the pin a little bit earlier on
a<00:00:38.489> lane<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.450> look<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> different<00:00:40.020> angle

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
a lane you can look at a different angle

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.479 
a lane you can look at a different angle
there's<00:00:40.770> different<00:00:41.040> ways<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.340> actually

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
there's different ways of actually

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.119 
there's different ways of actually
making<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.969> split<00:00:42.300> at<00:00:43.020> least<00:00:43.170> attempting<00:00:43.649> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
making a split at least attempting to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.630 
making a split at least attempting to
make<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.200> 6<00:00:46.200> 7<00:00:46.440> 10<00:00:46.590> split<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:47.520> we

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
make one for the 6 7 10 split that we

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.369 
make one for the 6 7 10 split that we
have<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.629> best<00:00:48.870> way<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> approaching

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
have here the best way of approaching

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.950 
have here the best way of approaching
that<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.430> basically<00:00:51.000> go<00:00:51.300> for<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> 10<00:00:51.750> pin

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that is to basically go for a 10 pin

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.689 
that is to basically go for a 10 pin
you're<00:00:52.440> aligned<00:00:52.710> itself<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.280> 10<00:00:53.489> pin

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
you're aligned itself up with a 10 pin

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.479 
you're aligned itself up with a 10 pin
and<00:00:53.910> allow<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.809> ball<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and allow the ball to just get the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.520 
and allow the ball to just get the
corner<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> 6<00:00:57.600> pin<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.020> slide<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.350> over<00:00:58.410> to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
corner of the 6 pin and slide it over to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.130 
corner of the 6 pin and slide it over to
the<00:00:58.680> 7<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.820> other<00:00:59.910> words<00:01:00.120> approaching<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the 7 so in other words approaching a

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.689 
the 7 so in other words approaching a
split<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.010> much<00:01:02.160> different<00:01:02.460> than<00:01:02.579> making

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
split is that much different than making

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.990 
split is that much different than making
a<00:01:02.910> spare<00:01:03.239> when<00:01:03.719> approaching<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.350> split

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
a spare when approaching is split

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.910 
a spare when approaching is split
especially<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.060> 6<00:01:06.450> 7<00:01:06.600> 10<00:01:06.869> split<00:01:06.930> you're<00:01:07.830> gonna

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
especially a 6 7 10 split you're gonna

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.320 
especially a 6 7 10 split you're gonna
line<00:01:08.130> yourself<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.790> same<00:01:08.970> way<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.210> would

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
line yourself up the same way you would

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.600 
line yourself up the same way you would
for<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> 10<00:01:09.720> pin<00:01:10.130> your<00:01:11.130> body's<00:01:11.400> gonna<00:01:11.490> be

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
for a 10 pin your body's gonna be

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.810 
for a 10 pin your body's gonna be
aligned<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.229> with<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.320> 10<00:01:13.470> pin<00:01:13.680> spare<00:01:14.189> but

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
aligned up with the 10 pin spare but

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
aligned up with the 10 pin spare but
you're<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.210> looking<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.259> right

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
you're going to be looking on the right

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.190 
you're going to be looking on the right
side<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.310> sixth<00:01:17.520> pin<00:01:17.689> in<00:01:18.689> order<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> slide

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
side of the sixth pin in order to slide

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.140 
side of the sixth pin in order to slide

that six pin over to the 7 pin and
complete<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> spare

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.710 

for<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.369> particular<00:01:31.520> spare<00:01:32.090> or<00:01:32.390> split

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
for that particular spare or split

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.630 
for that particular spare or split
that's<00:01:32.930> one<00:01:33.560> out<00:01:33.650> of<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.799> thousand<00:01:34.220> shots<00:01:34.460> for

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
that's one out of a thousand shots for

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.430 
that's one out of a thousand shots for
an<00:01:34.729> average<00:01:34.820> bowler<00:01:35.150> that's<00:01:35.990> something<00:01:36.320> that

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
an average bowler that's something that

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.350 
an average bowler that's something that
you<00:01:36.530> approach<00:01:36.860> very<00:01:37.670> often<00:01:38.090> if<00:01:38.270> you're

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
you approach very often if you're

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.410 
you approach very often if you're
competitive<00:01:38.690> bowler<00:01:39.020> but<00:01:39.650> as<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:40.420> recreational

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
competitive bowler but as a recreational

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.240 
competitive bowler but as a recreational
bowler<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:42.080> may<00:01:42.259> see<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.590> once<00:01:42.860> in<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.040> while

approach<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.920> lane<00:01:49.130> as<00:01:49.369> if<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.700> was<00:01:49.820> making<00:01:50.030> in

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
approach the lane as if I was making in

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.719 
approach the lane as if I was making in
spare<00:01:50.450> going<00:01:51.110> for<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.290> 10<00:01:51.500> pin<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:52.369> using<00:01:52.640> my

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
spare going for a 10 pin and using my

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.810 
spare going for a 10 pin and using my
visual<00:01:53.210> aid<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:54.680> basically<00:01:54.950> line<00:01:55.190> myself<00:01:55.369> up

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
visual aid to basically line myself up

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.789 
visual aid to basically line myself up
with<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.540> right<00:01:56.750> side<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.140> six<00:01:57.320> pin<00:01:57.560> in

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
with the right side of the six pin in

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.830 
with the right side of the six pin in
order<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.100> clip<00:01:58.369> that<00:01:58.520> pin<00:01:59.000> across<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.690> lane

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
order to clip that pin across the lane

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.930 
order to clip that pin across the lane
but<00:02:00.410> still<00:02:00.649> making<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:00.979> 10<00:02:01.160> pin<00:02:01.369> that's<00:02:01.820> how

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
but still making the 10 pin that's how

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.700 
but still making the 10 pin that's how
you<00:02:02.000> make<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.720> six<00:02:02.960> 710<00:02:03.350> split

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
you make the six 710 split

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.970 
you make the six 710 split
that's<00:02:04.310> how<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.520> handle<00:02:04.759> any<00:02:05.090> split

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
that's how you handle any split

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.339 
that's how you handle any split
