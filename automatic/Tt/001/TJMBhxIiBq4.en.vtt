and then basically you can just pull
them<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.080> then<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.530> lock<00:02:58.100> them<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.519> a

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
them and then you lock them in a

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.730 
them and then you lock them in a
submission<00:02:59.000> and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
submission and

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.860

out<00:03:50.860> right<00:03:51.130> away<00:03:51.420> very<00:03:52.420> quick<00:03:52.810> match<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.650> think

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
out right away very quick match I think

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.540 
out right away very quick match I think
it<00:03:54.460> was<00:03:54.580> under<00:03:54.820> two<00:03:55.090> minutes<00:03:55.330> actually<00:03:56.550> and

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
it was under two minutes actually and

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.390 
it was under two minutes actually and
then<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.570> have<00:03:58.780> your<00:03:59.020> new<00:03:59.230> champions<00:03:59.890> crowned

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
then you have your new champions crowned

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.100 
then you have your new champions crowned
and<00:04:00.820> then<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.240> should<00:04:01.300> be<00:04:01.630> able<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.870> get<00:04:01.990> the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
and then you should be able to get the

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.890 
and then you should be able to get the
match<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.950> would<00:04:03.820> try<00:04:04.180> for<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.570> New<00:04:04.750> Age
