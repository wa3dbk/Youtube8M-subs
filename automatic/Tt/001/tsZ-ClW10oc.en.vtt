lot of our body's systems struggle that
are<00:00:56.839> helping<00:00:57.230> us<00:00:57.410> build<00:00:57.769> lean<00:00:58.010> muscle<00:00:58.040> without

this is a system inside our body

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.360 
this is a system inside our body
responsible<00:01:03.050> for<00:01:03.350> releasing<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.980> muscle

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
the most muscle without fat such as

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.410 
the most muscle without fat such as

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.149 
levels dip below six hours per night we
really<00:01:14.690> tend<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.080> see<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:15.260> significant<00:01:15.830> drop<00:01:16.010> in

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
really tend to see a significant drop in

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.130 
really tend to see a significant drop in
those<00:01:16.490> muscle<00:01:16.850> building<00:01:17.090> hormones<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:17.690> on

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
those muscle building hormones and on

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.710 
those muscle building hormones and on
top<00:01:18.440> of<00:01:18.470> that<00:01:18.710> arise<00:01:19.640> in<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:20.060> fat<00:01:20.270> storing

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
top of that arise in the fat storing

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.480 
top of that arise in the fat storing
hormones<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.260> catabolic<00:01:21.650> hormones<00:01:22.190> inside

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
hormones and catabolic hormones inside

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.890 
hormones and catabolic hormones inside
of<00:01:22.610> our<00:01:22.700> body<00:01:22.910> so<00:01:23.450> that's<00:01:23.630> definitely

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
of our body so that's definitely

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.930 
of our body so that's definitely
something<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.350> want<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.620> stay<00:01:24.770> away<00:01:24.950> from<00:01:24.980> yes

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
something you want to stay away from yes

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.670 
something you want to stay away from yes
you<00:01:26.480> can<00:01:26.630> play<00:01:26.870> with<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.200> amount<00:01:27.410> of<00:01:27.500> sleep

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
you can play with the amount of sleep

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.410 
you can play with the amount of sleep
that<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:27.890> have<00:01:28.070> but<00:01:28.220> really<00:01:28.670> try<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.120> stay

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
that you have but really try and stay

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.960 
that you have but really try and stay
above<00:01:29.870> six<00:01:30.140> hours<00:01:30.470> if<00:01:30.620> at<00:01:30.740> all<00:01:30.890> possible<00:01:31.190> that

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
above six hours if at all possible that

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.160 
above six hours if at all possible that
being<00:01:32.180> said<00:01:32.390> there<00:01:32.540> are<00:01:32.630> other<00:01:32.720> systems

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
being said there are other systems

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.630 
being said there are other systems
inside<00:01:33.470> our<00:01:33.620> body<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.950> struggles<00:01:34.340> such<00:01:34.490> as

inside our body the struggles such as
our<00:01:34.760> immune<00:01:35.060> system<00:01:35.510> I<00:01:35.690> mean<00:01:35.990> we<00:01:36.110> know<00:01:36.290> that<00:01:36.500> we

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
our immune system I mean we know that we

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.960 
our immune system I mean we know that we
need<00:01:36.650> to<00:01:36.860> stay<00:01:37.010> healthy<00:01:37.220> if<00:01:37.490> we<00:01:37.610> want<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.880> work

metabolism also slows down which puts us

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.860 
metabolism also slows down which puts us
in<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.950> state<00:01:52.160> more<00:01:52.490> app<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:53.150> storing<00:01:53.570> fat

in a state more app to storing fat

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.350 
in a state more app to storing fat
rather<00:01:54.410> than<00:01:54.650> building<00:01:54.950> muscle<00:01:55.340> all<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:56.210> that

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
rather than building muscle all of that

rather than building muscle all of that
being<00:01:56.570> said<00:01:56.780> there's<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.080> few<00:01:57.320> tips<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.710> I
