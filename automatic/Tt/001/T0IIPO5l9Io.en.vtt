00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.290
 and not 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:08.770
 hello friends here we are with lego that is 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.770
 Your chance 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.130
 a bow I do not know when parents do not 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.960
 they want to buy and if you have a leader 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.230
 little ones that has been bought for years 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.260
 and you do not have a stone anymore 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.410
 you can copy from the face and draw in 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.410
 a leaf 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.840
 and that also 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:39.130
 for example, how am I going to build a habitat 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.130
 what is it 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.350
 first I do not know what this is called but it 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:51.180
 put this piece the piece 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.180
 and another piece 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.030
 please 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.060
 well then when you can not touch 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.930
 with the pieces 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.930
 between the two arms 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.560
 and that this piece manages 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.560
 well so I know where 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 before placing the subtle head it 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.210
 place the arms because in case first 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.030
 they place it on the head of the arms 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.110
 also time is broken 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.260
 If you do not have this, you can play with 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.160
 paper shoes 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.120
 They make small planes of shoes are lawful 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.880
 of paper 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.670
 Y 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.670
 the kind of things but I do not have 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.409
 and if the pieces fit I'm fine not 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.150
 I have life 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.940
 but never of this 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.180
 but he does not have the ego 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.640
 but I share with him now if we put together 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.470
 the log 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.350
 and what should be done to put colors 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.740
 for what 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.130
 of serving so that the brightness of 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:29.180
 any color if they have another color 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.970
 You can put any color because 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.830
 in some they come in another color after 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.520
 to put together this we will continue to 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.520
 next step 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.519

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.970
