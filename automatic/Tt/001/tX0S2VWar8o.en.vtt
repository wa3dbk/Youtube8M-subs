reason<00:01:58.380> I

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.039 

one<00:02:01.540> thing<00:02:01.750> about<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:02.140> assembling<00:02:02.649> is<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
one thing about this assembling is that

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.190 
one thing about this assembling is that
the<00:02:05.049> items<00:02:05.409> always<00:02:05.890> go<00:02:06.159> in<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.430> same<00:02:06.610> spot<00:02:07.200> so

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the items always go in the same spot so

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.559 
the items always go in the same spot so
i<00:02:08.229> disassemble<00:02:08.979> bring<00:02:09.849> protection<00:02:10.000> on<00:02:10.360> top

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
i disassemble bring protection on top

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.770

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
always the same every single time so you

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.820 
always the same every single time so you
can<00:02:16.599> always<00:02:16.930> pick<00:02:17.080> up<00:02:17.200> your<00:02:17.260> items<00:02:17.680> really

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
constant use of rabid will actually

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.479 
constant use of rabid will actually
drain<00:02:47.049> your<00:02:47.230> very<00:02:47.470> small<00:02:47.739> man<00:02:47.890> pull<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.340> like

level eight seven little eight is

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.830 
level eight seven little eight is
usually<00:02:51.640> when<00:02:51.760> your<00:02:51.970> first<00:02:52.209> point<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.510> rabbit

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
usually when your first point and rabbit

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.500 
usually when your first point and rabbit
if<00:02:53.290> you're<00:02:53.500> going<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.680> do<00:02:53.920> one<00:02:54.880> point<00:02:55.120> rabbit

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
if you're going to do one point rabbit

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.080 
if you're going to do one point rabbit
early<00:02:55.920> other<00:02:56.920> than<00:02:57.099> that<00:02:57.220> maybe<00:02:57.459> opal<00:02:57.940> mine

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
early other than that maybe opal mine

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.220 
early other than that maybe opal mine
would<00:02:58.299> be<00:02:58.390> when<00:02:58.569> you're<00:02:58.720> four<00:02:58.840> deep<00:02:58.870> first

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
would be when you're four deep first

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.319 
would be when you're four deep first
point<00:02:59.500> but<00:02:59.709> at<00:02:59.829> those<00:03:00.040> low<00:03:00.190> levels<00:03:00.579> your<00:03:01.090> mana

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
point but at those low levels your mana

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.090 
point but at those low levels your mana
pool<00:03:01.420> is<00:03:01.720> really<00:03:01.989> small<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.950> using<00:03:04.829> gravid<00:03:05.829> and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
pool is really small so using gravid and

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.430 
pool is really small so using gravid and
using<00:03:06.459> battle<00:03:06.940> cry<00:03:07.150> you'll<00:03:07.870> actually<00:03:08.019> run<00:03:08.350> out

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
using battle cry you'll actually run out

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.500 
using battle cry you'll actually run out
of<00:03:08.470> mana<00:03:08.680> further<00:03:09.040> quickly<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> little<00:03:10.390> bit

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
of mana further quickly so a little bit

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.849 
of mana further quickly so a little bit
of<00:03:10.569> armor<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.959> little<00:03:11.290> bit<00:03:11.380> of<00:03:11.470> rain<00:03:11.590> every<00:03:11.620> day

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
of armor a little bit of rain every day

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.069 
of armor a little bit of rain every day
and<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.130> actually<00:03:12.250> helps<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.670> lot<00:03:12.790> not<00:03:13.780> everyone

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
and it actually helps a lot not everyone

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.780 
and it actually helps a lot not everyone
has<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.410> go<00:03:14.530> for<00:03:14.769> that<00:03:14.920> especially<00:03:15.310> if<00:03:15.640> you're

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
has to go for that especially if you're

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.300 
has to go for that especially if you're
just<00:03:15.880> gonna<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.900> know<00:03:17.019> AFK<00:03:17.920> farm<00:03:18.190> or

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
just gonna you know AFK farm or

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.300 
just gonna you know AFK farm or
something<00:03:18.340> like<00:03:18.639> that<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:20.709> do<00:03:20.859> that<00:03:20.889> just

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
something like that so to do that just

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.309 
something like that so to do that just
make<00:03:21.489> sure<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.639> pick<00:03:21.880> up<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.989> ring<00:03:23.170> your

movement<00:04:30.610> speed<00:04:30.820> with<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.030> brown<00:04:31.240> boots

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
movement speed with the brown boots

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.600 
movement speed with the brown boots
brown<00:04:32.530> boots<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:32.860> can<00:04:32.950> get<00:04:33.070> five<00:04:33.280> ten

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610

so<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.910> phase<00:04:37.090> boots<00:04:37.300> don't<00:04:37.510> really<00:04:37.750> give<00:04:37.900> a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
so the phase boots don't really give a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.430 
so the phase boots don't really give a
