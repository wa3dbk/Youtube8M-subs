not<00:02:25.269> as<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> boy<00:02:26.159> everybody<00:02:27.159> is<00:02:27.280> equal<00:02:27.579> what

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
not as a boy everybody is equal what

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.520 
not as a boy everybody is equal what
difference<00:02:28.060> does<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.209> make<00:02:28.480> how<00:02:28.659> I<00:02:28.689> compete<00:02:29.260> it

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.319 
difference does it make how I compete it
makes<00:02:29.859> a<00:02:30.040> difference<00:02:30.400> because<00:02:30.459> men<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.060> women

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329
