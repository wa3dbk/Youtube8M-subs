be<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> little<00:00:35.190> different<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.540> aware

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
be a little different so just be aware

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.470 
be a little different so just be aware
of<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:36.980> but<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.250> Revlon<00:00:38.879> age-defying

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
of that but the Revlon age-defying

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.819 
of that but the Revlon age-defying
concealer<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:41.180> 02<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.870> called<00:00:43.200> medium

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
concealer in 02 which is called medium

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:58.170 
concealer in 02 which is called medium
seems<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.789> be<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.899> me<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.500> very<00:00:46.559> light<00:00:47.399> color

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.720 

so<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.360> color<00:00:59.630> itself<00:00:59.930> right<00:01:00.620> there<00:01:00.950> is<00:01:01.220> a

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
so the color itself right there is a

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.520 
so the color itself right there is a
fairly<00:01:04.730> light<00:01:05.210> color<00:01:05.510> to<00:01:05.690> be<00:01:05.780> called<00:01:05.990> medium

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
fairly light color to be called medium

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.030 
fairly light color to be called medium
in<00:01:06.740> my<00:01:07.100> opinion<00:01:07.930> tamiya<00:01:08.930> medium<00:01:09.350> usually<00:01:09.620> is<00:01:10.010> a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
in my opinion tamiya medium usually is a

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.640 
in my opinion tamiya medium usually is a
much<00:01:10.340> deeper<00:01:10.729> tone<00:01:11.150> I<00:01:11.390> would<00:01:12.020> call<00:01:12.200> this<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.620> be

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
much deeper tone I would call this to be

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.460 
much deeper tone I would call this to be
light<00:01:13.210> I<00:01:14.210> think<00:01:14.570> there's<00:01:14.720> fair<00:01:15.020> which<00:01:15.320> is

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
light I think there's fair which is

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.500 
light I think there's fair which is
really<00:01:15.800> light<00:01:15.979> than<00:01:16.250> light<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.820> then<00:01:16.970> medium

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
really light than light and then medium

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.810 
really light than light and then medium
and<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:17.869> on<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.260> I<00:01:18.619> feel<00:01:18.770> like<00:01:18.800> medium<00:01:19.340> is<00:01:19.520> kind

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
and so on and I feel like medium is kind

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.219 
and so on and I feel like medium is kind

good four and a half out of five
packaging<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.240> think<00:04:29.509> their<00:04:29.630> packaging<00:04:30.050> is

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
packaging I think their packaging is

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.110 
packaging I think their packaging is
very<00:04:30.199> similar<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.800> others<00:04:31.250> just<00:04:31.639> the<00:04:31.880> whole

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
very similar to others just the whole

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.409 
very similar to others just the whole
concept<00:04:32.570> of<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:33.710> packaging<00:04:34.460> with<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:34.940> doe

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
concept of the packaging with the doe

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.210 
concept of the packaging with the doe
foot<00:04:35.659> applicator<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:36.409> think<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:36.800> works<00:04:37.039> out

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
foot applicator I think it works out

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.879 
foot applicator I think it works out
well<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.759> I<00:04:38.389> think<00:04:38.599> the<00:04:38.690> packaging<00:04:39.169> is<00:04:39.289> nice<00:04:39.560> I

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
well and I think the packaging is nice I

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.890 
well and I think the packaging is nice I
think<00:04:39.949> it's<00:04:40.220> a<00:04:40.280> good<00:04:40.400> four<00:04:40.669> out<00:04:40.759> of<00:04:40.909> five<00:04:41.090> price

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
think it's a good four out of five price

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.020 
think it's a good four out of five price
you<00:04:42.139> can't<00:04:42.380> be<00:04:42.560> it's<00:04:42.830> only<00:04:43.039> five<00:04:43.250> six<00:04:43.610> dollars

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
you can't be it's only five six dollars

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.279 
you can't be it's only five six dollars
and<00:04:44.210> there's<00:04:44.360> always<00:04:44.599> some<00:04:44.780> sort<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.050> deal

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
and there's always some sort of deal

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.379 
and there's always some sort of deal
going<00:04:45.320> on<00:04:45.650> at<00:04:45.830> drugstores<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.430> Alton<00:04:46.880> target

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
going on at drugstores and Alton target

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.960 
going on at drugstores and Alton target
so<00:04:48.169> that's<00:04:48.590> a<00:04:48.710> five<00:04:48.889> out<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.099> five<00:04:49.340> product

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
so that's a five out of five product

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.670 
so that's a five out of five product
overall<00:04:50.300> in<00:04:50.449> this<00:04:50.539> I<00:04:50.720> think<00:04:51.020> this<00:04:51.139> is<00:04:51.320> one<00:04:51.470> for
