00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.050 
know I've don't worry about saying
machine<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:49.980> machine<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.340> fortress<00:03:50.760> PG

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
machine so the machine of fortress PG

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.870 
machine so the machine of fortress PG
and<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.510> back<00:03:51.750> with<00:03:52.370> Express<00:03:53.370> right

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
and just and back with Express right

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.180 
and just and back with Express right
I<00:03:53.910> seem<00:03:54.780> dry<00:03:54.989> Roy<00:03:55.110> gets<00:03:55.380> over<00:03:55.530> everything<00:03:55.860> when

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
I seem dry Roy gets over everything when

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.430 
I seem dry Roy gets over everything when
attacked<00:03:56.550> something<00:03:56.970> again<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.390> goes<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.600> 2300

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
attacked something again it goes to 2300

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.320 
attacked something again it goes to 2300

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
so most things it can get over this

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.840 
so most things it can get over this
