face<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.019> they<00:03:07.109> did<00:03:07.549> well<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.819> guess<00:03:09.269> that's

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
that it's a little different cuz the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.770 
that it's a little different cuz the
background<00:03:11.730> was<00:03:11.819> more<00:03:11.940> realistic<00:03:12.299> but<00:03:12.660> that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
background was more realistic but that

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.039 
background was more realistic but that
kind<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:12.989> made<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.319> faces<00:03:13.889> look<00:03:14.069> weird<00:03:14.280> but

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049
