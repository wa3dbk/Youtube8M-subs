00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.680

so it's a nice fruit punch
they<00:03:49.690> actually<00:03:50.019> pair<00:03:50.230> well<00:03:50.440> together<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.830> get

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
they actually pair well together you get

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.420 
they actually pair well together you get
a<00:03:50.950> little<00:03:51.129> sweet<00:03:51.400> from<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:53.280> cookies<00:03:54.280> and

a little sweet from the cookies and
cream<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:56.110> then<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:56.349> can<00:03:56.590> wash<00:03:57.010> it<00:03:57.040> down<00:03:57.310> with

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
cream and then you can wash it down with

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.100

some fruit punch I'm not getting the
whole<00:04:02.140> cookies<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:02.769> cream<00:04:02.980> here<00:04:08.580> not<00:04:09.580> really

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
whole cookies and cream here not really

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.240 
whole cookies and cream here not really
I<00:04:12.870> mean<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:13.930> get<00:04:14.110> more<00:04:14.380> of<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.560> chocolate<00:04:14.829> but

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
I mean you get more of the chocolate but

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.280 
I mean you get more of the chocolate but
I<00:04:15.430> don't<00:04:16.209> understand<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.780> cookies<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.229> cream

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
I don't understand the cookies and cream

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.479 
I don't understand the cookies and cream
concept<00:04:18.100> here

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
concept here

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.860 
concept here
I<00:04:22.560> guess<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.740> tastes<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.220> vanilla<00:04:24.870> and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
I guess that tastes like a vanilla and

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.850 
I guess that tastes like a vanilla and
then<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.110> match<00:04:26.260> it<00:04:26.290> with<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.620> chocolate

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
then you match it with the chocolate

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.640 
then you match it with the chocolate
maybe<00:04:27.820> that's<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:30.810> there's<00:04:31.810> about<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:32.320> don't

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
maybe that's it there's about I don't

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.020 
maybe that's it there's about I don't
know<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.770> ton<00:04:32.889> of<00:04:33.100> these<00:04:33.340> different<00:04:33.729> kinds<00:04:33.850> of

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030
