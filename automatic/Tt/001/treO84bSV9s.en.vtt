00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
minute and then there's obviously a fine

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.219 
minute and then there's obviously a fine
option<00:01:02.190> where<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.670> find<00:01:03.329> let's<00:01:03.899> say

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
option where you can find let's say

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
option where you can find let's say
about<00:01:06.950> may<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> let's<00:01:08.220> find<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> word<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
about may I let's find the word out and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.630 
about may I let's find the word out and
you<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.450> hit<00:01:09.689> next<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.409> find<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> other

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you can hit next and find all the other

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.730 
you can hit next and find all the other
words<00:01:11.820> will<00:01:12.030> about<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.560> that's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
words will about in it so that's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.859 
words will about in it so that's
basically<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.700> features<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.659> I

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
basically the features of that if I

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.789 
basically the features of that if I
return<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.630> next<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.799> getting

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
return now to the next one getting

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
return now to the next one getting
started<00:01:19.979> actually<00:01:20.280> loads<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.670> PDF<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
started actually loads of PDF and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.840 
started actually loads of PDF and
explains<00:01:22.140> probably<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> features<00:01:23.490> batchman

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
explains probably the features batchman

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.359 
explains probably the features batchman
in<00:01:24.210> more<00:01:24.720> advanced<00:01:25.020> detail<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
in more advanced detail but as you can

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.039 
in more advanced detail but as you can
see<00:01:26.549> I'll<00:01:26.700> shake<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> view<00:01:27.360> modes<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.810> here

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
see I'll shake the view modes in here

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.380 
see I'll shake the view modes in here
that<00:01:28.470> single<00:01:28.920> pages<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.060> as<00:01:30.119> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
that single pages on now so as you

scroll you'll get um a new page every

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.840 
scroll you'll get um a new page every
single<00:01:33.900> time<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.829> continuous<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.640> like

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
single time with continuous it's like

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.569 
single time with continuous it's like
word<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:37.079> scroll<00:01:37.439> down<00:01:37.650> slowly<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.400> get

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.270 
couple of things here just about touch
sensitivity<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.409> how<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.649> use<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> touch

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
sensitivity in how you use the touch

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.280 
sensitivity in how you use the touch
sensitivity<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:48.149> obviously<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.110> isn't

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
sensitivity but obviously that isn't

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.020 
sensitivity but obviously that isn't
going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> actually<00:01:49.860> happen<00:01:50.040> peered<00:01:50.939> in

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
going to actually happen peered in

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.819 
going to actually happen peered in
simply<00:01:51.329> because<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.960> haven't<00:01:52.380> got<00:01:52.470> touch<00:01:52.680> on

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
simply because I haven't got touch on

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.429 
simply because I haven't got touch on
this<00:01:52.950> machine<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:54.240> yeah<00:01:54.990> there's<00:01:55.229> not<00:01:55.350> really

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
this machine so yeah there's not really

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.530 
this machine so yeah there's not really
much<00:01:55.590> else<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> other<00:01:56.369> than<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.030> will

much else to it other than that I will

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.510
