hey guys blink here from into mobile and
today<00:00:08.610> we're<00:00:08.760> going<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.910> check<00:00:09.240> out<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.750> new<00:00:09.929> S

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
today we're going to check out the new S

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.400 
today we're going to check out the new S
beam<00:00:10.559> feature<00:00:10.830> on<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.280> samsung<00:00:11.820> galaxy<00:00:12.269> s3<00:00:12.420> so

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
beam feature on the samsung galaxy s3 so

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.799 
beam feature on the samsung galaxy s3 so
this<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> feature<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.809> essentially

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
this this is a feature that essentially

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.170 
this this is a feature that essentially
adds<00:00:16.609> puts<00:00:17.609> NFC<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.510> Wi-Fi<00:00:18.869> direct<00:00:19.140> together

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
adds puts NFC and Wi-Fi direct together

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.269 
adds puts NFC and Wi-Fi direct together
it's<00:00:21.180> also<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:22.020> basically<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.769> tweaked

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
it's also just basically a tweaked

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.470 
it's also just basically a tweaked
Android<00:00:24.029> Beam<00:00:24.390> feature<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:27.240> basically

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
Android Beam feature and it basically

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.660 
Android Beam feature and it basically
you<00:00:28.019> initiate<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> connection<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.310> Wi-Fi

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
you initiate the connection of Wi-Fi

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.299 
you initiate the connection of Wi-Fi
direct<00:00:30.109> through<00:00:31.109> NFC<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:31.980> actually<00:00:32.279> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
direct through NFC so it's actually a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.709 
direct through NFC so it's actually a
little<00:00:32.460> easier<00:00:33.000> than<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.420> having<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
little easier than just having to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.410 
little easier than just having to
connect<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.200> wait<00:00:34.489> wait<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.640> connect<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
connect and wait wait to connect to the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.900 
connect and wait wait to connect to the
other<00:00:36.570> person<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.070> our<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.460> galaxy

this one is on and ready no alright so
now<00:01:31.770> we're<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> beam<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.930> just<00:01:33.930> like

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
now we're going to beam it and just like

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.800 
now we're going to beam it and just like
any<00:01:34.380> any<00:01:34.770> Android<00:01:35.700> Beam<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.360> would<00:01:36.479> do<00:01:36.600> we

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
any any Android Beam you would do we

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.480 
any any Android Beam you would do we
just<00:01:36.990> put<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> two<00:01:37.500> devices<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:40.490> touch

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
just put the two devices on and touch

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.240 
just put the two devices on and touch
the<00:01:41.700> beam<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.090> says<00:01:42.990> ready<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.649> send<00:01:43.979> files

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the beam and says ready to send files

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.080 
the beam and says ready to send files
via<00:01:44.520> s<00:01:44.790> beam<00:01:45.090> separate<00:01:45.689> devices<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:47.090> then

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
via s beam separate devices and then

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.539 
via s beam separate devices and then
they're<00:01:48.479> connecting<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.409> then<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.159> picture

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
they're connecting and then the picture

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:59.080 
they're connecting and then the picture
should<00:01:50.729> show<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.409> very<00:01:52.409> quickly<00:01:56.090> receiving

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
should show up very quickly receiving

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.830 
should show up very quickly receiving
loading<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> there<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:01.610> s<00:02:02.610> beam<00:02:03.479> in

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
loading and there you go s beam in

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.560 
loading and there you go s beam in
action<00:02:04.880> alright<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.090> was<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.390> quick

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
action alright that was just a quick

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.020 
action alright that was just a quick
look<00:02:06.810> at<00:02:07.020> s<00:02:07.619> beam<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.670> with<00:02:08.729> much

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
look at s beam you can do this with much

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.020 
look at s beam you can do this with much
larger<00:02:09.209> files<00:02:09.629> including<00:02:10.259> videos<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.640> but

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
larger files including videos and but

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.700 
larger files including videos and but
it's<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.390> be<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> lot<00:02:12.720> quicker<00:02:12.840> with

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it's going to be a lot quicker with

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.920 
it's going to be a lot quicker with
pictures<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.210> nice<00:02:15.360> step<00:02:15.630> forward

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
pictures but it's a nice step forward

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.470 
pictures but it's a nice step forward
for<00:02:15.960> Android<00:02:16.650> Beam<00:02:16.860> even<00:02:17.220> though<00:02:17.310> its

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
for Android Beam even though its

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.610 
for Android Beam even though its
existing<00:02:18.480> technologies<00:02:19.050> we<00:02:19.260> already<00:02:19.500> know

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
existing technologies we already know

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.740
