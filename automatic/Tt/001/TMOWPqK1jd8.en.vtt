prone to biting that they can actually

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.560 
prone to biting that they can actually
desensitize<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.399> rat<00:00:59.609> from<00:00:59.940> becoming<00:01:00.359> a

desensitize the rat from becoming a
biter<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:01.140> from<00:01:01.649> continuing<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> behavior<00:01:02.820> of

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
biter or from continuing the behavior of

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.880 
biter or from continuing the behavior of
biting<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> point<00:01:04.739> where

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
biting and get them to the point where

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
biting and get them to the point where
the<00:01:05.100> rat<00:01:05.309> will<00:01:05.549> actually<00:01:05.909> trust<00:01:06.270> them<00:01:06.510> enough

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the rat will actually trust them enough

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.219 
the rat will actually trust them enough
to<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.500> feel<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> need<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.189> fear<00:01:08.549> bite

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
to not feel the need to fear bite

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.289 
to not feel the need to fear bite
basically<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> requires<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.830> commitment<00:01:11.299> time

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
basically it requires a commitment time

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
basically it requires a commitment time
and<00:01:12.689> patience<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.950> desire<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.340> actually

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
and patience and the desire to actually

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.820 
and patience and the desire to actually
have<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.360> rat<00:01:15.689> become<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:16.619> not

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
have this rat become one that's not

going to bite or nip for no reason
oftentimes<00:01:19.890> people<00:01:20.430> learn<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.850> they<00:01:20.970> can

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
oftentimes people learn that they can

to be fearful the biting is not a very
common<00:01:35.520> problem<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.420> most<00:01:37.079> cases<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.860> rat<00:01:38.040> is
