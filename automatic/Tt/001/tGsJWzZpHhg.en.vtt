sorry<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:37.070> next<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:39.450> got<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.660> fennel<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.230> I

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260

not<00:01:42.000> only<00:01:42.300> in<00:01:42.840> desserts<00:01:43.410> but<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.680> think<00:01:43.920> it's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
not only in desserts but I think it's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.350 
not only in desserts but I think it's
really<00:01:44.280> underrated<00:01:44.580> when<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.090> comes<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
really underrated when it comes to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.050 
really underrated when it comes to
savory<00:01:45.690> dishes<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:46.080> well<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:47.070> chop<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.760> up<00:01:47.820> nice

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
savory dishes as well so chop it up nice

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.180 
savory dishes as well so chop it up nice
and<00:01:48.090> thin<00:01:48.500> then<00:01:49.500> what<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.650> want<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.830> do<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.010> just

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
and thin then what we want to do is just

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
put a few of these slices just in the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080 
put a few of these slices just in the
base<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.230> our<00:01:53.070> cake<00:01:53.370> unless<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.880> cake

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
you add the rest of them so almost half

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.150 
you add the rest of them so almost half
mix<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:23.940> add<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> remainder<00:02:25.160> and

carefully<00:02:26.760> fold<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.270> but<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.540> need<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.720> do

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
carefully fold it in but you need to do

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.240 
carefully fold it in but you need to do
it<00:02:27.900> quite<00:02:28.110> quickly<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.920> same<00:02:29.040> way<00:02:29.190> as

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
it quite quickly so it's the same way as

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.620 
it quite quickly so it's the same way as
making<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.610> souffle<00:02:29.970> get<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.390> oven<00:02:30.420> as

my folding it from the bottom up now we

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.120 
my folding it from the bottom up now we
do<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:34.380> pour<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:34.950> over<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:36.300> top<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.890> our

degrees centigrade and this wants to go

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.580 
degrees centigrade and this wants to go
in<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.150> 20<00:02:42.420> minutes<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:42.870> if<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.050> can<00:02:43.200> continue
