00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230 

I<00:00:00.060> have<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.380> xbox<00:00:02.220> connected<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.149> the

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
I have the xbox connected to the

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.039 
I have the xbox connected to the
computer<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:05.330> my<00:00:06.330> wii<00:00:06.509> remotes<00:00:06.870> are

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
computer and my wii remotes are

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.549 
computer and my wii remotes are
connected<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.440> computer<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.480> here<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.660> due<00:00:09.870> to

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
connected to computer and here is due to

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.279 
connected to computer and here is due to
the<00:00:10.679> router<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:12.080> now<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:14.269> have<00:00:17.060> some<00:00:18.289> simple

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the router and now I have some simple

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.990 
the router and now I have some simple
commands<00:00:20.010> using<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:21.529> behavior<00:00:22.529> proxy<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
commands using the behavior proxy so I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.910 
commands using the behavior proxy so I
just<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> behavior<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.680> box

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
just have a behavior it's just a one box

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.019 
just have a behavior it's just a one box
behavior<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:28.160> relaxes<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.220> joints<00:00:29.609> not<00:00:29.910> too

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
behavior that relaxes the joints not too

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.170 
behavior that relaxes the joints not too
relaxed<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:31.170> push<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.470> button<00:00:32.000> now<00:00:33.000> it's

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
relaxed I can push this button now it's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.910 
relaxed I can push this button now it's
stiff<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.890> then<00:00:35.840> push<00:00:36.840> another<00:00:37.110> button<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:39.920> be

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
stiff and then push another button to be

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.150 
stiff and then push another button to be
affirmed<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.399> sitting<00:00:41.640> position<00:00:42.950> or<00:00:43.950> not

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
affirmed the sitting position or not

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
affirmed the sitting position or not
let's<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.520> stand<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:46.370> that's<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.550> i<00:00:48.050> have

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
let's just stand up that's right i have

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.110 
let's just stand up that's right i have
if<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.559> already<00:00:49.860> sitting<00:00:50.219> i<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.820> have

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
if it's already sitting i have to have

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.430 
if it's already sitting i have to have
to<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.420> another<00:00:51.600> black<00:00:51.899> never<00:00:52.170> force

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
to have another black never force

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830 
to have another black never force
decision

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
decision

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.860 
decision
alright<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.710> stood<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.310> now<00:00:56.870> this

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
alright it stood up so now this

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.650 
alright it stood up so now this
controller<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:59.160> i<00:00:59.340> press<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.150> button<00:01:00.240> on

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
controller is if i press the a button on

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.520 
controller is if i press the a button on
here<00:01:02.000> it'll<00:01:03.000> start<00:01:03.360> to<00:01:03.420> mimic<00:01:03.750> my<00:01:03.930> emotion<00:01:04.410> and

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
here it'll start to mimic my emotion and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.150 
here it'll start to mimic my emotion and
this<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.710> using<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.720> joint<00:01:09.720> based<00:01:09.990> stuff<00:01:10.350> so

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
this is using the joint based stuff so

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.420 
this is using the joint based stuff so
he's<00:01:11.940> netted<00:01:12.119> emission<00:01:12.800> using<00:01:13.800> AOL<00:01:13.979> motion

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
he's netted emission using AOL motion

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.020 
he's netted emission using AOL motion
yeah<00:01:15.270> using<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> motion<00:01:16.290> proxy<00:01:16.740> i<00:01:17.030> am

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
yeah using the motion proxy i am

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
yeah using the motion proxy i am
directly<00:01:18.930> controlling<00:01:19.770> each<00:01:20.010> individual

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
directly controlling each individual

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.920 
directly controlling each individual
joints<00:01:20.910> of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> arms<00:01:21.410> to<00:01:22.410> match<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:23.700> joints<00:01:24.210> as

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
joints of the arms to match my joints as

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.889 
joints of the arms to match my joints as
close<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.350> possible<00:01:28.640> right<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.090> no

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
close as possible right now is no

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.940 
close as possible right now is no
inverse<00:01:31.500> kinetics<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.550> direct<00:01:33.950> but

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
inverse kinetics it's all direct but

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.460 
inverse kinetics it's all direct but
that's<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:35.910> i'm<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.330> direct<00:01:36.600> mode<00:01:36.899> if

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
that's because i'm in the direct mode if

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.170 
that's because i'm in the direct mode if
i<00:01:37.710> switched<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:39.140> inverse<00:01:40.140> kinetics<00:01:40.590> mode

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.240 

other<00:01:45.180> goes<00:01:45.470> now<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.740> using<00:01:47.009> inverse

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
other goes now it's using inverse

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.010 
other goes now it's using inverse
kinematics<00:01:49.220> so<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:51.060> do<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.300> internet<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.869> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
kinematics so to do the internet do you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.639 
kinematics so to do the internet do you
prefer<00:01:52.520> what<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.789> best<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.450> avoid<00:01:54.570> well<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
prefer what is the best to avoid well it

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.969 
prefer what is the best to avoid well it
turns<00:01:55.680> out<00:01:56.070> i<00:01:56.310> need<00:01:56.640> fo<00:01:56.960> because<00:01:57.960> with<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
turns out i need fo because with the

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.809 
turns out i need fo because with the
inverse<00:01:59.250> kinematics<00:02:00.890> what's<00:02:01.890> doing<00:02:02.160> is<00:02:02.310> I'm

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
inverse kinematics what's doing is I'm

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.240 
inverse kinematics what's doing is I'm
using<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.390> comparing<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> nows<00:02:04.560> torso

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
using the comparing the nows torso

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.430 
using the comparing the nows torso
position<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.030> his<00:02:06.179> hand<00:02:06.420> position<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.289> the

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
position to his hand position to do the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.680 
position to his hand position to do the
control<00:02:07.800> so<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:08.610> based<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.149> height<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
control so then based on my height I

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.809 
control so then based on my height I
just<00:02:10.289> create<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.770> same<00:02:10.920> vector<00:02:11.340> between<00:02:11.490> my

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
just create the same vector between my

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.720 
just create the same vector between my
torso<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.569> my<00:02:12.690> hands<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.380> tells<00:02:14.130> yet<00:02:14.370> so

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
torso and my hands and tells yet so

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.550 
torso and my hands and tells yet so
inverse<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.420> max<00:02:15.750> mode<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.349> can<00:02:17.280> make<00:02:18.410> kind<00:02:19.410> of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
inverse can max mode I can make kind of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.390 
inverse can max mode I can make kind of
very<00:02:19.740> slow<00:02:20.569> adjustments

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
very slow adjustments

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.089 
very slow adjustments
and<00:02:23.790> then<00:02:24.030> when<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.209> stop<00:02:24.569> moving<00:02:24.930> it's

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
and then when I stop moving it's

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.110 
and then when I stop moving it's
relatively<00:02:26.099> stable<00:02:26.459> yeah<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:27.989> can<00:02:28.230> move

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
relatively stable yeah and I can move

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.860 
relatively stable yeah and I can move
kind<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.239> precisely<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:32.209> his<00:02:33.209> hand<00:02:33.689> position

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
kind of precisely and his hand position

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.100 
kind of precisely and his hand position
is<00:02:34.500> kind<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.040> close<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:36.209> where<00:02:36.750> my<00:02:36.780> hand

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
is kind of close to where my hand

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.559 
is kind of close to where my hand
position<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.590> relative<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.459> body<00:02:38.670> okay

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
position is relative to the body okay

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.920 
position is relative to the body okay
pretty<00:02:40.140> pretty<00:02:41.069> close<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.579> think<00:02:41.609> but<00:02:42.569> with<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
pretty pretty close I think but with the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.569 
pretty pretty close I think but with the
inverse<00:02:43.200> kinematics<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:45.510> slow<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.620> also<00:02:47.340> if

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
inverse kinematics it's slow and also if

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.099 
inverse kinematics it's slow and also if
my<00:02:47.790> arm<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.209> in<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.420> position<00:02:48.689> that<00:02:48.959> the

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
my arm is in the position that the

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.410 
my arm is in the position that the
universe<00:02:49.379> can<00:02:49.530> max<00:02:49.739> can't<00:02:50.040> calculate<00:02:50.420> it

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
universe can max can't calculate it

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.720 
universe can max can't calculate it
won't<00:02:51.629> do<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.019> okay<00:02:52.439> I<00:02:52.590> don't<00:02:52.799> have<00:02:52.920> any<00:02:53.159> intern

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
won't do it okay I don't have any intern

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.869 
won't do it okay I don't have any intern
so<00:02:53.909> in<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.150> case<00:02:54.420> then<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:55.639> switched<00:02:56.639> to<00:02:56.790> the

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
so in that case then I switched to the

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.550 
so in that case then I switched to the
direct<00:02:57.180> mode<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.629> I<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.870> kind<00:02:58.079> of<00:02:58.109> do<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.379> big

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
direct mode and I can kind of do the big

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.949 
direct mode and I can kind of do the big
motion<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.190> a<00:03:00.000> direct<00:03:00.299> mode<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.629> can<00:03:00.659> move

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
motion and a direct mode I can move

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.699 
motion and a direct mode I can move
faster<00:03:01.200> too<00:03:01.859> okay<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:03.209> use<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.780> everything's

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
faster too okay you use it everything's

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.300 
faster too okay you use it everything's
quite<00:03:05.599> reactive<00:03:06.599> it's<00:03:07.349> fine<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.829> robot<00:03:08.040> is

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
quite reactive it's fine to a robot is

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.360 
quite reactive it's fine to a robot is
checking<00:03:08.549> of<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:08.970> no<00:03:09.709> lights<00:03:10.709> or<00:03:10.920> what<00:03:11.099> is<00:03:11.280> a

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
checking of it no lights or what is a

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.720 
checking of it no lights or what is a
movie<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:12.019> it's<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.109> little<00:03:13.290> bit<00:03:13.409> jerky

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
movie like it's a little bit jerky

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.509 
movie like it's a little bit jerky
twitching<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.819> little<00:03:14.849> bit<00:03:15.120> um<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.829> data<00:03:17.129> from

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
twitching a little bit um the data from

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.059 
twitching a little bit um the data from
the<00:03:17.609> kinect<00:03:17.939> of<00:03:18.480> shaking<00:03:19.200> just<00:03:19.409> like<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.950> you

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
the kinect of shaking just like that you

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.879 
the kinect of shaking just like that you
can<00:03:20.250> use<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.629> militia<00:03:21.629> to<00:03:21.959> smooth<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.409> repeated

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
can use a militia to smooth it repeated

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.710 
can use a militia to smooth it repeated
um<00:03:23.359> yeah<00:03:24.859> this<00:03:25.859> is<00:03:26.040> very<00:03:26.549> direct<00:03:27.000> path<00:03:27.389> right

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
um yeah this is very direct path right

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.930 
um yeah this is very direct path right
now<00:03:27.750> again<00:03:28.199> not<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> nice<00:03:28.769> algorithm<00:03:29.220> we<00:03:29.760> did

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
now again not a nice algorithm we did

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.909 
now again not a nice algorithm we did
just<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.419> love<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.900> things<00:03:31.109> together<00:03:33.739> look<00:03:34.739> if

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
just I love the things together look if

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.349 
just I love the things together look if
you<00:03:35.010> could<00:03:35.129> upload<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.669> to<00:03:35.819> lose<00:03:36.000> into

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
you could upload it to lose into

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.930 
you could upload it to lose into
something<00:03:36.660> like<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:36.930> well<00:03:37.709> yeah<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.639> get<00:03:38.819> us

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
something like this well yeah I get us

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.670 
something like this well yeah I get us
back<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.419> chance<00:03:39.720> as<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.139> knew<00:03:40.319> somewhere

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
back to the chance as I knew somewhere

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.740 
back to the chance as I knew somewhere
Oh<00:03:40.859> in<00:03:41.280> between<00:03:41.699> this<00:03:41.790> mission<00:03:42.180> in<00:03:42.299> this<00:03:42.449> yeah

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
Oh in between this mission in this yeah

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.629 
Oh in between this mission in this yeah
i<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:42.989> had<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.260> interpolate<00:03:43.680> smoothly

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.660 
little mr. Keith
kavo<00:03:50.610> but<00:03:51.230> in<00:03:52.230> between<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.830> jerks<00:03:53.070> in<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.340> ik

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
kavo but in between the jerks in the ik

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.230 
kavo but in between the jerks in the ik
mode<00:03:53.910> it's<00:03:54.330> probably<00:03:55.910> calculating<00:03:56.910> universe

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
mode it's probably calculating universe

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.690 
mode it's probably calculating universe
to<00:03:57.420> Maddox<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.940> then<00:04:00.980> be<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:04.620> kinect<00:04:04.980> doesn't

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
to Maddox so then be the kinect doesn't

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.110 
to Maddox so then be the kinect doesn't
have<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.200> can't<00:04:07.200> track<00:04:07.590> your<00:04:07.800> wrist<00:04:08.040> data<00:04:08.340> so

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
have a can't track your wrist data so

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.760 
have a can't track your wrist data so
i'm<00:04:09.270> using<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.660> rotation<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.260> wii<00:04:10.410> remote

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
i'm using the rotation of the wii remote

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.470 
i'm using the rotation of the wii remote
to<00:04:11.340> control<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:13.230> guy's<00:04:13.440> wrist<00:04:13.770> and<00:04:14.640> then<00:04:15.060> this

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
to control the guy's wrist and then this

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.320 
to control the guy's wrist and then this
button<00:04:15.780> here<00:04:16.010> goes<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.190> hand<00:04:17.400> but<00:04:17.940> actually

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
button here goes the hand but actually

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.060 
button here goes the hand but actually
um<00:04:18.540> that<00:04:19.380> hand<00:04:19.650> motion<00:04:21.049> it's<00:04:22.049> kind<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.620> slow<00:04:22.890> in

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
um that hand motion it's kind of slow in

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.930 
um that hand motion it's kind of slow in
turkey<00:04:23.840> test<00:04:25.190> maybe<00:04:26.190> I'll<00:04:26.340> change<00:04:26.370> my<00:04:26.670> co

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
turkey test maybe I'll change my co

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.750 
turkey test maybe I'll change my co
button<00:04:27.240> via<00:04:27.420> one<00:04:27.780> point<00:04:29.960> 8.16<00:04:31.160> version<00:04:32.160> the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
button via one point 8.16 version the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.700 
button via one point 8.16 version the
hand<00:04:32.970> opening<00:04:33.360> closing<00:04:33.660> with<00:04:33.930> smooth<00:04:34.200> yeah

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
hand opening closing with smooth yeah

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.340 
hand opening closing with smooth yeah
and<00:04:34.920> now<00:04:35.070> it's<00:04:35.310> kind<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.760> doing<00:04:36.360> this<00:04:36.510> oh<00:04:36.750> but<00:04:37.320> I

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
and now it's kind of doing this oh but I

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.770 
and now it's kind of doing this oh but I
think<00:04:37.440> I'm<00:04:37.830> flooding<00:04:38.310> too<00:04:38.580> many<00:04:38.820> messages

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
think I'm flooding too many messages

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.230 
think I'm flooding too many messages
into<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:43.010> forefoot<00:04:44.010> emotionality<00:04:44.640> i<00:04:44.790> think

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
into the forefoot emotionality i think

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.320 
into the forefoot emotionality i think
i'm<00:04:45.540> doing<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.840> motion<00:04:46.080> on<00:04:46.260> high<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:47.090> yeah<00:04:48.090> oh

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
i'm doing the motion on high and yeah oh

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.500 
i'm doing the motion on high and yeah oh
I<00:04:49.070> got<00:04:50.070> it<00:04:50.100> recently<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.790> connect<00:04:51.060> here<00:04:51.210> there

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
I got it recently to connect here there

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.390 
I got it recently to connect here there
we<00:04:51.600> go<00:04:51.720> so<00:04:52.290> so<00:04:52.530> you're<00:04:52.680> going<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:52.950> have<00:04:53.010> some

we go so so you're going to have some

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.250 
we go so so you're going to have some
headed<00:04:53.880> form<00:04:54.150> directly<00:04:54.450> photos<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:55.080> guy<00:04:55.200> you

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
headed form directly photos of guy you

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.269 
headed form directly photos of guy you
would

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:56.279 
would

00:04:56.279 --> 00:05:06.119 
would
the<00:04:57.900> position<00:04:58.900> negley<00:05:00.719> liquid<00:05:01.719> at<00:05:01.840> you<00:05:05.129> hmm

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
the position negley liquid at you hmm

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.790 
the position negley liquid at you hmm
yeah<00:05:06.969> definitely<00:05:07.659> the<00:05:07.930> motion<00:05:08.620> can<00:05:08.770> be

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
yeah definitely the motion can be

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.950 
yeah definitely the motion can be
improved<00:05:09.129> for<00:05:09.939> that<00:05:11.669> so<00:05:12.669> what<00:05:13.150> you<00:05:13.330> just<00:05:13.569> fell

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
improved for that so what you just fell

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.480 
improved for that so what you just fell
is<00:05:14.259> a<00:05:15.509> youth<00:05:16.509> oh<00:05:16.659> oh<00:05:16.960> we<00:05:17.529> have<00:05:17.620> a<00:05:17.650> clutch<00:05:17.919> yeah
