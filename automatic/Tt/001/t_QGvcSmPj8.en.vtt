 hello and welcome to a new video of 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.500
 our wef channel or metro in which 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.799
 this time we want to show you how 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:19.390
 It is possible to return with our Nokia 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:22.180
 Lumia 920 from windows 10 test to 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.800
 windows form 8.1 then little to what reason 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.840
 if we have any problem 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.300
 performance or does not finish us 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.860
 convince this trial version or by 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.410
 any other reason then we can 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.079
 back to windows was 8.1 and have a 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.940
 stable version for it the software 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.249
 that in this case in this case we are going to 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.230
 use is the software and recovery lumia 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:43.650
 tool to me personally I know that they are going 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.560
 like in the case of a lumia 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.650
 in the article that will be associated with 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.520
 this video and you will have how to download and 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.520
 how to install the application 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.570
 in this case, well, we will open the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.880
 which is the application check to 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.730
 perform the different checks that 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.800
 is updated if it is not 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.570
 you can not automatically continue and 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.040
 you will have to perform the installation with 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.820
 which will always have the last 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.640
 software version and compatible with the 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.520
 most phones and good we see that 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.270
 has installed me has recognized me has 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.860
 recognized the phone was not 1920 and 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.729
 Well, what kind then the model 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.729
 and some of those more 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.620
 in this case he tells me that there is already a 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.710
 version for this phone and we will give it 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:44.180
 to install will take me out to all 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.150
 content of the phone leaving it with 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.240
 a 28.1 like moving from factory 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.340
 let's install it tells me that I understand 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.610
 good post I'm going to erase all the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.560
 content etc. we give you to continue 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.210
 and is ready to download the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.490
 package in this case I already had it 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.820
 downloaded with what what happens to 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.360
 do is checking in this step if 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.550
 it was not downloaded of course 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.890
 will recognize the phone and proceed to 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.320
 Internet download after 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.930
 yesterday are the check and that has given 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.490
 that is ok then proceed to the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.440
 software installation the phone 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.660
 how can you see the phone 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.320
 it has automatically rebooted and 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.500
 off and start writing the software 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.360
 on the phone we can see how he has 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.620
 changed how it has been restarted and now 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.490
 some words of nokia appear with a 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.360
 red screen so you can see it better 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.360
 I'm going to approach 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.380
 and a blue bar appears 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.290
 of progress 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.920
 where a download will be made 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.920
 of the firmware 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.390
 this normal process that takes a while 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.580
 It also depends on the speed of 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.890
 your usb port but good is not going either 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.220
 to be too over time 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.250
 of course the phone you should never 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.569
 disconnect it from turning it off or any 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.569
 another option has to be 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.910
 completely connected during all the 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.370
 time and good if of course it has load 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.130
 enough better than better once 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.190
 has come to the end we can see how the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.340
 phone automatically restarts and 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.730
 starts running starts normally 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.819
 as if he was saying received from 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.970
 factory the software stays waiting 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.670
 on the phone indicating that you are 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.800
 restarting and that is not disconnected 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.989
 the cable in such a way that also in its 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.610
 web will detect if the boot has been 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.610
 correct or has not been correctly 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.320
 and how can we check well the 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.920
 restart has finished has started the 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.190
 computer configuration assistant 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.960
 it has detected it and it indicates to me that it has 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.730
 correctly installed the software to 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.430
 now we have our 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.430
 Windows Phone 8.1 as it
