speakers<00:00:44.010> here's<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.730> quick<00:00:44.940> comparison<00:00:45.120> at

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
speakers here's a quick comparison at

00:00:45.600 --> 00:01:10.110 
speakers here's a quick comparison at
full<00:00:45.750> volume

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.760 

the<00:01:11.120> old<00:01:11.240> mixer<00:01:11.480> seven<00:01:11.780> maybe<00:01:11.990> louder<00:01:12.380> but

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
the old mixer seven maybe louder but

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.220 
the old mixer seven maybe louder but
it'll<00:01:12.980> make<00:01:13.100> your<00:01:13.220> ears<00:01:13.340> bleed

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
it'll make your ears bleed

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
so how about dimensions the new Nexus 7

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.550 
so how about dimensions the new Nexus 7
is<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.330> little<00:01:17.600> bit<00:01:17.720> smaller<00:01:17.990> than<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.320> older

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
is a little bit smaller than the older

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.990 
is a little bit smaller than the older
model<00:01:18.800> just<00:01:19.040> on<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.340> two<00:01:19.490> millimeters

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000
