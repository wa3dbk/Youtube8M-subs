00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.470
 hello how about the institute welcome another bishop uriarte remember we will lose 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.380
 act to modify 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.029
 commented - the ex-wife of michael 

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:13.029
 of windows 7 or what 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.920
 good refrains at the request of erc did not obstruct users 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:21.919
 with this biden is not a long time 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.099
 tutorials that represented what it says 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.019
 in this very medicated world 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.449
 is that what I have 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.329
 how videos are put in slow motion 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.890
 I seemed to be the first arrested few teams to offer you 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.060
 how to put 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.790
 the videos in bed talent that the suggested cruise and diaz and also 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.960
 set aside viesques 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.530
 I see as something to decide a video that in three parts efe 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.610
 then these requests for cuéllar 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.610
 will answer the equipment mallet 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.730
 the average data 2010 p 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.260
 then start the video tutorial here I have the compulsion already divided 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.310
 can see several parts 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.310
 It has been divided 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.800
 and here 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.860
 is in slow motion and here in more total transparency 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.750
 but I think what the president 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.970
 n 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.350
 today I believe that there 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.350
 but with the Serbian I have 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.909
 bush we eliminate start again but project 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.940
 john to companies though 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.260
 and I always recommend that you drag the videos to the composition 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.970
 and by definition a video that lasts 15 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.630
 a civil died last was sung 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.300
 it lasted up to twenty seconds 80 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.980
 with this team, I believe it, we are going to promote it to divide it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.320
 do it more 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.210
 clinton faster and me with monday fetus good the cuéllar my style 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.690
 Christian that 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.850
 good let's start with eczema 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.470
 mentions 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.620
 in visual effect and excuse 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.109
 we will go 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.439
 the actress confessed 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.439
 left here in brightness we can tell you 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.459
 in the most updated version I think so 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.459
 Sunday Dublin 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.599
 and then yamanaka we can apply you work from the bench 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.459
 this effect very very simple but 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.309
 it is very useful to get closer in order 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:36.009
 well now they want it 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:37.869
 now what we are going to do 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.699
 it is short the video clip for example in certain parts 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.239
 / ap to the neck 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.729
 and for example 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.699
 car offices 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.699
 pete siebold 4 seconds 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.119
 let's click and right and we're going to give you divide or what 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:01.139
 and actually divide 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.439
 always eye having the line where just the quirós depart from 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.349
 we divide 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.349
 kiko can see and the video clip is divided 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.079
 time you can simply see these controls were 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.629
 they can exist and second dakar 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.459
 keep coming 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.609
 On one side 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.719
 how good are we going to shout 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.479
 and academics 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.919
 the video remix 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.189
 pose in dividing or keita 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:36.719
 in this practically 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.659
 the same thing then we would eliminate this one that does not work 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:44.779
 but it only keeps other josephs 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.959
 then if these steps can be divided get a part 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.709
 amestoy greet rock 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.519
 nesta we go to go 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.519
 propose him a camera 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.309
 the jail 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.449
 the project 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.370
 in children by space nearby 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.120
 here too 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.120
 we did 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:43.770
 and hard 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.199
 because that part here does not work we eliminate son can see if well in 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.740
 several parts 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.530
 this always advisable for I know if these parts in slow motion in this 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.379
 example 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.379
 I'm doing a video clip in slow motion 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:01.490
 part company specified the organism 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.259
 let's do 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.710
 and that is in this part in slow motion or what and how this daughter 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.860
 then ipad usually up to the biomedical procedure 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.120
 the same intense branch and live at speed or that 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.990
 as you know, you denounced 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.919
 if they want to be camera 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.150
 faster 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.250
 they want to give 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.419
 of the world until apple 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.860
 in places the normal camera but if it is normal today has been the day more quickly 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.900
 that of 2 400 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.979
 remove in slow motion will be what issued 25- and cocaine 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.849
 I see in this case 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.629
 21 25 and as you can see on video the second-serve duraznenses 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.830
 his work was questioned 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.319
 nine seconds when cutting it 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:49.319
 can not see and is more current beds to boost 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.930
 if you can not enter an uncertain prison g 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:58.339
 then the summer doors serve 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.249
 for example here supposedly I was without a video 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:05.469
 / Celestial ap 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.469
 fidel min this part as it collects reuters 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.460
 tostao part manaos in slow motion although this time city 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.379
 zero as 125 cc recognized after the conflict that 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:22.440
 as you can see 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.800
 decided has not been cut until the second goal 18 

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:31.059
 if we are left frame by frame 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.610
 there are too many photographers 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.550
 what will you use as a hotel on your own 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.990
 in this case of pérez in a camera gesture 6 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.039
 youkilis a camera that has only 25 frames 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.819
 that there will be very few more digital camcorders 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:52.930
 and until apartheid 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.089
 has some effects we think how to divide 

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:59.089
 Ireland also like 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.499
 like and live a video 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:05.289
 and how to speed up 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:06.749
 much faster 

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:08.729
 as slower p 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.729
 kiko an extra effect that will take a shine 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:15.930
 good because I hope he liked it 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.999
 these work elements 

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:19.899
 to find 

00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:24.239
 I hope that it really took state 6f republic and if we have until the next 

00:07:24.239 --> 00:07:26.080
 victory and waited 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.539
 comment subscribe 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:31.229
 odendaal a recommendation kelly 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.550
 quillo semester answering that they push
