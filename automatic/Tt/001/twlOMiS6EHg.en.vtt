 this other 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.639
 good little one, rather this will be the 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.199
 slot is where it goes 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:47.979
 in memory ok then here it tells you 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:50.300
 positive or negative we put the battery and 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.080
 let's learn it now yes 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.080
 okay 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.840
 this has a 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.840
 dual-core 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:08.090
 let's see how to start this phone 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:12.319
 it is very beautiful the screen is 4 of 4 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.150
 inches degenerate around here is very 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:15.710
 tied does not reach to perceive equal in 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.349
 the camera although it is a camera that I have 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.639
 it's high definition but it does not 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.349
 they reach to see or the one of you will see me 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.249
 they reached the m 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.249
 let's see if I can 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.410
 I show the light that is strong enough 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.410
 emits 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:33.779
 okay 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.500
 a little better 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:46.960
 fast that is paid or that is very well 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:50.460
 and also 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.460
 although this phone 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.710
 two 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.699
 12 34 no 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.539
 and I was wrong again 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:31.910
 in fact I got tired of looking for ways to 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.130
 pass the activation of that phone but 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.480
 I will try another way differently to 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.480
 see if this time it works 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.070
 the charros 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.810
 in July 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:14.610
 so I would like you to stay and see 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.729
 already worked one can not be 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.160
 nothing 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:23.780
 have solved 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:26.320
 I do not think I can not believe 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.320
 ah
