00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
rotary engine but just wanted to quickly

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.580 
rotary engine but just wanted to quickly
highlight<00:00:15.549> the<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.840> body<00:00:16.990> condition<00:00:17.410> of<00:00:17.529> the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
highlight the the body condition of the

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.429 
highlight the the body condition of the
vehicle<00:00:17.949> so<00:00:18.550> quick<00:00:19.029> scan<00:00:19.539> through<00:00:19.990> here<00:00:20.289> I'm

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
vehicle so quick scan through here I'm

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.070 
vehicle so quick scan through here I'm
not<00:00:20.590> seeing<00:00:21.039> anything<00:00:21.670> just<00:00:22.150> a<00:00:22.300> little<00:00:22.869> bit<00:00:22.990> of

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
not seeing anything just a little bit of

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.750 
not seeing anything just a little bit of

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760 
scratching or whatnot but I think they

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.380 
scratching or whatnot but I think they

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
you can see that it's a little pitted

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.220 
you can see that it's a little pitted
all<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:51.940> way<00:00:52.059> through<00:00:52.359> a<00:00:52.600> little<00:00:53.109> bit<00:00:53.199> of

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
all the way through a little bit of

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.310 
all the way through a little bit of
pitting<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.640> then<00:00:54.820> again<00:00:55.090> once<00:00:55.270> you<00:00:55.930> get<00:00:56.199> in

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
pitting and then again once you get in

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.380 
pitting and then again once you get in
through<00:00:56.469> here<00:00:56.949> just<00:00:57.340> in<00:00:57.489> this<00:00:57.579> bender<00:00:57.969> I'm

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
through here just in this bender I'm

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.509 
through here just in this bender I'm
looking<00:00:58.780> at<00:00:58.870> this<00:00:59.050> in<00:00:59.440> it's<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.890> good<00:01:00.070> indicator

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
looking at this in it's a good indicator

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.779 
looking at this in it's a good indicator
of<00:01:00.820> door<00:01:01.780> dings<00:01:02.050> in<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.320> garage<00:01:02.649> so<00:01:03.430> that's<00:01:03.640> what

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
of door dings in a garage so that's what

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.970 
of door dings in a garage so that's what
I<00:01:03.850> think<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.120> problem<00:01:04.420> is<00:01:04.540> here<00:01:04.840> but<00:01:05.710> keep<00:01:05.830> in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
I think the problem is here but keep in

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.220 
I think the problem is here but keep in
mind<00:01:06.160> it's<00:01:06.430> a<00:01:06.550> 2002<00:01:07.420> with<00:01:07.600> very<00:01:07.810> very<00:01:08.050> low

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
mind it's a 2002 with very very low

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.700 
mind it's a 2002 with very very low
miles

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
miles

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.590 
miles
so<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.340> positives<00:01:09.940> are<00:01:10.150> certainly<00:01:10.420> gonna

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
so the positives are certainly gonna

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.110 
so the positives are certainly gonna
outlay<00:01:11.200> or

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
outlay or

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.150 
outlay or
outweigh<00:01:13.120> rather<00:01:13.570> the<00:01:14.530> negatives<00:01:14.860> in<00:01:15.010> this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
outweigh rather the negatives in this

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.820 
outweigh rather the negatives in this
vehicle<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.510> interior<00:01:16.990> here<00:01:17.260> you've<00:01:17.650> got
