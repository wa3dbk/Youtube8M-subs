looking above the team's logo the
controls<00:03:09.920> are<00:03:10.069> decent<00:03:10.579> but<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.819> game<00:03:11.000> in

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
controls are decent but the game in

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.660 
controls are decent but the game in
general<00:03:11.599> is<00:03:11.840> horribly<00:03:12.439> broken<00:03:12.739> don't<00:03:13.370> believe

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
general is horribly broken don't believe

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.849 
general is horribly broken don't believe
me<00:03:13.970> well<00:03:14.389> for<00:03:14.720> starters<00:03:15.109> you<00:03:15.290> can't<00:03:15.590> really

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
me well for starters you can't really

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.920 
me well for starters you can't really
maneuver<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:16.549> this<00:03:16.700> game<00:03:16.939> the<00:03:17.389> non-playable

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
maneuver in this game the non-playable

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.929 
maneuver in this game the non-playable
characters<00:03:18.439> have<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.709> speed<00:03:19.219> advantage<00:03:19.250> over

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
characters have a speed advantage over

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:21.819 
characters have a speed advantage over
you<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:20.389> therefore<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:20.989> makes<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.379> impossible

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
you so therefore it makes it impossible

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.339 
you so therefore it makes it impossible
to<00:03:22.340> do<00:03:22.519> any<00:03:22.790> fancy<00:03:23.060> skating<00:03:23.750> around<00:03:24.019> them

to do any fancy skating around them

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.440 
to do any fancy skating around them
