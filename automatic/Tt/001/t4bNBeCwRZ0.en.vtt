 Max Normans this video we'll talk 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.510
 about one wonderful t-34 tanks 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.270
 which is machine level five 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:46.489
 Soviet branch of the development of medium tanks 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:49.589
 talk a little now about the history of the tank 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.900
 t-34 had a huge impact on the outcome 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.300
 war and the further development of the world 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.700
 tank building thanks to the aggregate 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.190
 fighting qualities of the t-34 was recognized by many 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.649
 experts and military experiments 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.080
 one of the best tanks of the second world 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.090
 wars when recreating soviet 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.420
 designers managed to find the best 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.530
 the relationship between the main combat 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.780
 tactical running gear 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.869
 and technological characteristics 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.970
 moreover, the T-34 tank is the most 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.759
 famous Soviet tanks in life 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.560
 so in our game good dpm on and 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.259
 gun-to m which is approximately 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.759
 2 seconds and good dynamics 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.700
 which saves fast moving 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.159
 Tank on the map make it great 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.759
 tank of the fifth level of the base we are with you 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.500
 discussed 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.500
 let's talk about the details in battle 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.720
 in which pine and will be the whole chip 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.060
 this video I'm on t-34 sixth level 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.220
 battles against a lot of kvass 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.710
 hulk species kawasaki pretty strong 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.320
 machines and achieved not crush rewind 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.750
 the most interesting part of him in which I am 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.820
 I thought we were going to merge 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.100
 but my sovzvodny encourages me 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.130
 after which I wipe snot read a prayer 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.920
 Serb and loud we smooth in this battle not 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.380
 die my pins have already withstood 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.330
 some amount of hits and I'm going for 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.470
 which route class left 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.170
 I take it from the guard earlier 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.600
 This 4 is not necessary because it is Soviet 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.180
 tank after which I understand what you need 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.590
 quickly run to capture capture where already 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.470
 costs 3 tanks 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.489
 there is 2 because it is our lag 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.610
 favorite replay 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.280
 and you crash guys meanwhile centered 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.769
 rides and somehow lights up 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.510
 enemy collagen traitor soviet 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.110
 nations which meanwhile took our 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.570
 base but i'm set fire fall lay and not 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.450
 leaving a chance to win because I 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.090
 I beat the capture with him I also replace 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.799
 t28 is also a soviet traitor who 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.019
 took our base 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.440
 I leave no chance to him either 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:03.680
 victory and start to disassemble it leaving 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.329
 138 132 gpk I live in numbers confusing and themes 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.549
 just pick up enough time 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:11.209
 style for some reason I am the blind jesters 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.590
 it is not clear why our T-34 is taking away now 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.560
 85 hellqueta 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.700
 this sad score of 8:12 which we 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.010
 seen before we turn the score 11:12 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.859
 unwrap to go for 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.040
 kvass but here I see American 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:31.340
 he has no chance 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.829
 because I stand above it I stand and 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.950
 I shoot him in the port and calm myself 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.590
 I am taking American nagibator 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.049
 which it really isn't already 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.580
 nagibator oh well enemy to whom 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.880
 then I get my ass stuffed 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.310
 and now he will take me but passes 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.710
 more than five seconds, I understand that when 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.960
 it's already over a 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.790
 for if it ended already killed me 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.920
 but it doesnâ€™t kill me and therefore i mean 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.600
 the light disappeared that his gun 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.240
 miss because she's not like that 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.960
 cool what are my and I calm myself 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.170
 him 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.970
 trying to kill really just 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.180
 I try because I have chances here 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.280
 no, no, because no matter how much 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.820
 I did not shoot until one 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.580
 to get but still 5 frags 1500 experience 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.410
 really want a warrior but how do you 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.800
 everyone knew really so in the random 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.280
 nice and cool because of course 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.070
 random randomness here is the mass of all 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.590
 owns you were look like you were 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.410
 still how strong was this fight 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.130
 I am quietly on my side 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.820
 humming a little song and notice that I notice 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.970
 kvass 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.570
 50s classes right there I see him and 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.860
 shoot him in the mask of the gun guys here 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.860
 so I'm lucky 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.970
 but for now you are considering the results of the battle 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.410
 I will share a little personal feelings 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.389
 T-34 tanks 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.400
 he is definitely worthy of 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.680
 visit your hangar and not only 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.479
 as a passable tank and as headlights 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.639
 a machine capable of farming silver and 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.280
 bring pleasure to its owner 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.680
 guys I hope you like the video 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.720
 tried very hard if that's the case 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.360
 subscribe to my channel for me this 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.610
 great joy and many likes 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.120
 they motivate me to create new ones 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.120
