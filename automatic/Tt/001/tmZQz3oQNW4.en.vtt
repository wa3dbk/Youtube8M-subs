00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
there and the key is you mix it till you

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.679 
there and the key is you mix it till you
get<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.319> consistency<00:01:12.310> that<00:01:12.340> you<00:01:12.579> want<00:01:13.479> you

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689

liquid<00:01:18.329> consistency<00:01:19.329> like<00:01:19.929> for<00:01:20.409> oil<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.939> you

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:21.969 
liquid consistency like for oil so you

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.510 
liquid consistency like for oil so you
can<00:01:22.389> put<00:01:22.569> more<00:01:22.810> in<00:01:23.020> here<00:01:23.350> if<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.799> want<00:01:24.100> if<00:01:24.340> you

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
can put more in here if you want if you

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.039 
can put more in here if you want if you
want<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.810> make<00:01:26.020> more<00:01:26.409> of<00:01:26.740> this<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:28.420> like<00:01:28.689> I<00:01:28.840> say

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
want to make more of this but like I say

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.580 
want to make more of this but like I say
I<00:01:29.079> would<00:01:29.499> make<00:01:29.619> a<00:01:29.649> little<00:01:29.979> bit<00:01:30.899> so<00:01:31.899> okay<00:01:32.319> this

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
I would make a little bit so okay this

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.580 
I would make a little bit so okay this
is<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.799> good<00:01:33.039> consistency<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:33.999> like<00:01:34.359> this<00:01:34.719> so

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
is a good consistency I like this so

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.419 
is a good consistency I like this so
after<00:01:36.490> I've<00:01:36.609> mixed<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.119> up<00:01:37.499> then<00:01:38.499> I<00:01:38.920> will<00:01:39.159> put

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
after I've mixed it up then I will put

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.040 
after I've mixed it up then I will put
it<00:01:39.549> in<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.850> microwave<00:01:40.299> and

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
it in the microwave and

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:49.490 
it in the microwave and
melted

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.680 

all<00:01:50.310> right<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> got<00:01:50.670> two<00:01:50.820> samples<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.510> this

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
all right I got two samples for you this

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.990 
all right I got two samples for you this
is<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.110> heating<00:01:52.500> oil<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:53.370> made<00:01:53.730> another

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
is the heating oil here I made another

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.910 
is the heating oil here I made another
one<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.230> show<00:01:55.260> you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
one just to show you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.330 
one just to show you
so<00:01:56.310> I'll<00:01:56.400> heat<00:01:56.730> it<00:01:56.760> up<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.300> melt<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.650> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
so I'll heat it up and melt it and the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.820 
so I'll heat it up and melt it and the
reason<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.730> heat<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.150> for<00:02:00.510> 30<00:02:00.780> seconds<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.650> so

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
reason I heat it for 30 seconds is so

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.980 
reason I heat it for 30 seconds is so
that<00:02:02.010> it<00:02:02.190> will<00:02:02.370> combine<00:02:03.060> together<00:02:03.480> and<00:02:03.810> get

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
that it will combine together and get

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.380 
that it will combine together and get
all<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.200> air<00:02:04.350> bubbles<00:02:04.380> out<00:02:04.890> now<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.790> one<00:02:06.150> is

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
all the air bubbles out now this one is

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.020 
all the air bubbles out now this one is
the<00:02:06.570> one<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:06.780> made<00:02:07.080> for<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.950> said<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.790> in<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the one I made for you I said it in the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.660 
the one I made for you I said it in the
freezer<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:09.570> a<00:02:09.810> few<00:02:09.929> minutes<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
freezer for a few minutes and this is a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.810 
freezer for a few minutes and this is a
consistency<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:13.470> it's<00:02:14.010> very<00:02:14.280> nice

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
consistency that I like it's very nice

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.110 
consistency that I like it's very nice
and<00:02:15.120> spreadable<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:16.200> use<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.070> my<00:02:17.130> scalp<00:02:17.640> I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
and spreadable I use it on my scalp I
