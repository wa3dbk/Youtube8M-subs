00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.210
 so she dollars specifically for this 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 video I bought a brand new Rubik cube 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:11.659
 I just decided 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:13.709
 Solov'ev 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.889
 need to rest now the operator who 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.490
 opens 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.419
 25 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.689
 since it was actually released 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.689
 there is more than 80 years 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.949
 mean m 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.130
 this is the most ordinary cube 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.640
 rubik 3 for 3 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.130
 and we will probably start 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.620
 to understand 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.720
 somewhere that fall confirm here nisepi 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.290
 gum of concepts that I want 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.260
 to explain 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.890
 the country will deal 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.940
 lived then country be nix 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.890
 calculation the rest does not matter 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.120
 otherwise everything is on the sides 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.210
 now if i say that 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 bring up this means we that 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.320
 We have closer white efforts 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.950
 they are from this deal actually of course 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.460
 the cube will be constantly upside down 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.420
 because 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.270
 gref gathering easy Khamis 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.540
 as if difficult 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.250
 nevertheless we will still talk 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.190
 that 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.190
 It's low 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.650
 Now 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.800
 next week which 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.800
 in this cubes there is this 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.020
 3 by 3 cubes 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.030
 centers 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.899
 always in the same 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.500
 position relative to each other 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.560
 they always 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.040
 white opposite yellow 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.370
 red opposite orange and green 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.230
 opposite blue is pretty easy 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.610
 remember 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.880
 But if you still remember what kind of a 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.360
 also located to the left of the green 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.410
 the color is found on the left I appreciate it at all 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.410
 wonderful 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.809
 but for the time being it is necessary to understand that 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:12.969
 root of it 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.439
 dice 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.759
 does not change its position 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:18.259
 so 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.479
 we have to bring all the other cubes 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.399
 or parts like makhon call 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:25.909
 according 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.359
 in connection with this core 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:29.669
 this cup 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:31.669
 which never changes 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:33.609
 all cubes rest 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.609
 walk around the core 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.839
 the next moment 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.629
 we will not try to collect in one 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.649
 the side 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:43.779
 we will immediately 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:46.089
 try 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.509
 bring the cube the desired state for example 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:49.109
 here 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.889
 here is one detail 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.789
 yes side cube 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.479
 and he's having two stickers 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:56.760
 orange squirrels 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.020
 so we have to 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.810
 immediately place it in the right 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.159
 position 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.739
 here is this corner cube 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.799
 he has three stickers 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.199
 also green white teach us right away 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.329
 should have been able to lead in position 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:09.919
 out of the game 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.369
 not only collect bella storno immediately 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:14.889
 arrange cubes correctly 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.599
 Well, now mother Kube knead like 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.819
 and see what we get 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.349
 the rights 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.729
 in particular 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:27.729
 calcium zinc 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:30.169
 I do not even know what day 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.039
 I didn't even look 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.229
 greatest in this state 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.799
 hardly ever 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.359
 in good condition 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.749
 Well, let's see maybe until it is unclear tenth 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.179
 video 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.939
 Well, in general, replace 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.189
 no matter how much we put it in well 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.189
 or bad but as deputies 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.359
 but then the first operation when we 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.729
 going to do this lead 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:00.729
 here are these four side cubes 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.839
 country limits 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:06.169
 first dastan will be called whites 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.059
 because the core is not white the center is white 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.069
 OK 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.129
 mean the simplest thing first look at 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.810
 jennings 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.399
 do we have a dice case here 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:17.449
 odd was not 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:18.670
 OK then 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.470
 because if for example he was there from 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.200
 for example from 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.249
 here it is, let's say there is this year 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:25.460
 blue white 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.009
 then it's very simple 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.009
 we are just stocks blue core 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.770
 with him at the center 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.999
 I'm such a turn than 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.870
 and it turns out that we immediately 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.020
 killed two birds with one stone 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.080
 Immediately put the cube 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.599
 to the right place it coincides with white and 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.749
 blue side 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:50.229
 so I will not repeat anything 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.969
 because if he already has an account to put the question 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.129
 can rewind the video back 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.930
 this is the first time 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.529
 next case 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.519
 for example, the cube has nitrogen 

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:01.259
 down here 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.110
 so we want it 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.169
 to put 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.699
 so it turns out 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.389
 right because 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.680
 and you feet up 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.949
 what we need to do 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.620
 nevertheless we must arrange it 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.569
 right arsenyev 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.270
 right because 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.449
 the center is so located 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.460
 then we need him 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.460
 put the court 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.270
 move raise blue 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.319
 position it on the left 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.259
 wrap up 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.150
 we do not break anything because 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.150
 all this we have a little bit destroyed blue 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.649
 but we immediately just as we arranged 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:48.620
 the old cupavna immediately brought it back 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.650
 we made it 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.830
 pralno located 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.370
 side cubes 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.760
 there is no matter how the head cover 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.210
 located by current 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.009
 think about the side 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.210
 here again this one for example has already come 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.330
 myself 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.349
 can be regarded as lucky but not 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:08.669
 it's always luck because sometimes 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.190
 it would be better 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.760
 because it knocks the meaning necessary 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.590
 stick to our plan for example 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.229
 in this case 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.740
 everything is beautiful because it is enough 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.050
 turn one once and he already got on 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.009
 a place 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.110
 but here and the fourth of us are eight 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.809
 person 

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:24.249
 that is, the case is quite difficult 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:25.360
 because he 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.749
 there is a plot between 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:28.650
 collected 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.740
 in parts therefore he was appointed to withdraw 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.009
 from here 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:34.379
 wherein 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.709
 without breaking the top because shas and we will start 

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.119
 output we close the videos breaking can 

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:40.279
 osh we collected 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:42.169
 what do not you want Panama immediately this 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.249
 restore 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.020
 let's start output from there 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.020
 the first health to be cleaned in order 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.379
 to restore what we violated 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:52.249
 Here he immediately installed what 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:53.660
 the cube is broken now 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.349
 not located 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.589
 between them we brought out for this state 

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:58.599
 now we mean 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:06:59.599
 should him 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:01.949
 bring green 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.710
 and look like a lot 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.780
 put where we need to put on 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.139
 white green here 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.330
 again here so he does not think it means 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.930
 need to 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.499
 somehow 

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:16.119
 bring there yes 

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:18.719
 let's we wait then ourselves through the other side 

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:21.229
 so I want him to get up here 

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:23.409
 this cube is white green so that it becomes 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.210
 here 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.210
 he can come all yes and then here 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.900
 This is where the simplest started. 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.690
 Bryansk 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.089
 must first 

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.360
 turn like this 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.199
 at the same time we have brown white 

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:44.330
 leaves 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.569
 after we are green whites 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:47.860
 put in place 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.159
 we immediately install 

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:52.499
 makes brown back 

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:54.649
 and we have a cross 

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:57.289
 I think that every person is tinkering 5 

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:00.569
 10 minutes with such cubes 

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:03.369
 can make this cross 

00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:06.049
 all that is required for the first part 

00:08:06.049 --> 00:08:06.809
 only 

00:08:06.809 --> 00:08:08.449
 you are comfortable enough 

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:10.569
 feel high exercise 

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:13.409
 you can move to the next saw 

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:15.449
 here thanks thanks for watching
