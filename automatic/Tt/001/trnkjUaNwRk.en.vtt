00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.679 

all<00:00:01.439> right<00:00:01.560> so<00:00:01.770> I<00:00:02.100> got<00:00:02.490> another<00:00:02.669> request<00:00:03.120> to

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
all right so I got another request to

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.039 
all right so I got another request to
take<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.080> look<00:00:04.319> at<00:00:04.529> v-ray<00:00:05.009> proxy<00:00:05.210> objects<00:00:06.210> this

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
take a look at v-ray proxy objects this

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.049 
take a look at v-ray proxy objects this
is<00:00:07.230> something<00:00:07.529> new<00:00:07.710> in<00:00:07.950> v-ray<00:00:08.460> 1.5<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:10.200> I'm<00:00:10.620> in

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
is something new in v-ray 1.5 so I'm in

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.600 
is something new in v-ray 1.5 so I'm in
v-ray<00:00:12.059> or<00:00:12.269> sorry<00:00:12.690> Renault<00:00:12.929> 5<00:00:13.280> and<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
v-ray or sorry Renault 5 and in the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.700 
v-ray or sorry Renault 5 and in the
v-ray<00:00:15.000> toolbar<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.839> can<00:00:16.020> see<00:00:16.260> there's<00:00:16.650> a

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
v-ray toolbar here you can see there's a

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.429 
v-ray toolbar here you can see there's a
kind<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.640> tree<00:00:18.000> symbol<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.869> that's

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
kind of a tree symbol here and that's

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.070 
kind of a tree symbol here and that's
the<00:00:19.619> import<00:00:20.189> proxy<00:00:21.029> object<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.570> also<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
the import proxy object and also the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.029 
the import proxy object and also the
right<00:00:22.320> proxy<00:00:22.980> object<00:00:23.720> now<00:00:24.720> proxy<00:00:25.560> object<00:00:25.920> is

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
right proxy object now proxy object is

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.740 
right proxy object now proxy object is
essentially<00:00:26.609> kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.060> distilled<00:00:27.570> down

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
essentially kind of a distilled down

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.040 
essentially kind of a distilled down
piece<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.650> geometry<00:00:28.890> let's<00:00:29.490> say<00:00:29.730> an<00:00:30.599> example

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
piece of geometry let's say an example

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.170 
piece of geometry let's say an example
we'll<00:00:31.199> look<00:00:31.289> at<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> tree<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.070> tree<00:00:32.430> will<00:00:33.000> have

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
we'll look at a tree a tree will have

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.720 
we'll look at a tree a tree will have
many<00:00:33.719> many<00:00:33.989> many<00:00:34.260> facets<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.920> leaves<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.579> if

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
many many many facets for leaves and if

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.680 
many many many facets for leaves and if
I<00:00:35.880> put<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.390> say<00:00:37.110> 500<00:00:37.890> trees<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> scene<00:00:38.850> then

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I put in say 500 trees in the scene then

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229 
I put in say 500 trees in the scene then
the<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.920> model<00:00:41.280> might<00:00:41.430> start<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:41.940> bogged

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the the model might start to get bogged

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.700 
the the model might start to get bogged
down<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:42.840> there's<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.170> too<00:00:43.440> much

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
down because there's just too much

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.000 
down because there's just too much
information<00:00:44.300> with<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> proxy<00:00:45.780> object<00:00:46.230> it'll

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
information with a proxy object it'll

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.670 
information with a proxy object it'll
really<00:00:47.309> reduce<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.180> number<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> faces<00:00:49.440> within

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
really reduce the number of faces within

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.950 
really reduce the number of faces within
the<00:00:50.010> scene<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.000> render<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.750> will

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the scene but when you render it will

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.819 
the scene but when you render it will
render<00:00:52.199> all<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.699> material<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.449> there

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
render all of the material that is there

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.110 
render all of the material that is there
so<00:00:55.829> we're<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.340> take<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> quick<00:00:56.760> look<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so we're going to take a quick look of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.119 
so we're going to take a quick look of
how<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> set<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.079> could<00:00:58.829> model

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
how to set that up you could model

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.529 
how to set that up you could model
anything<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.820> if<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.030> wanted<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> come<00:01:00.510> in

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
anything in here if I wanted to come in

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
anything in here if I wanted to come in
and<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.770> make<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> cylinder<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.570> could

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and just make a cylinder like so I could

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.260 
and just make a cylinder like so I could
apply<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.830> material<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.960> then<00:01:08.240> save<00:01:09.240> it

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
apply a material to it and then save it

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
apply a material to it and then save it
as<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:10.049> proxy<00:01:10.470> object<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.950> come<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
as a very proxy object and come in and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.859 
as a very proxy object and come in and
put<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> whole<00:01:11.640> bunch<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> them<00:01:12.060> really<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
put a whole bunch of them really a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.810 
put a whole bunch of them really a
cylinder<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.500> incredibly<00:01:14.010> simple<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.549> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
cylinder is incredibly simple so it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.510 
cylinder is incredibly simple so it
wouldn't<00:01:15.360> save<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> too<00:01:15.990> much<00:01:16.310> but<00:01:17.310> that's

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
wouldn't save you too much but that's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.620 
wouldn't save you too much but that's
why<00:01:17.700> we're<00:01:17.850> looking<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> tree<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
why we're looking at the tree it's a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.570 
why we're looking at the tree it's a
little<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:18.930> in-depth<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:20.159> I'm<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> go

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
little more in-depth so I'm going to go

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.410 
little more in-depth so I'm going to go
file<00:01:21.060> import<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> tree<00:01:23.520> obj<00:01:24.240> this

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
file import and I have a tree obj this

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.700 
file import and I have a tree obj this
is<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.720> something<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.080> downloaded<00:01:25.439> from<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
is just something I downloaded from the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.580 
is just something I downloaded from the
internet<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.840> say<00:01:28.080> keep<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> as

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
internet and we can say keep it as

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
internet and we can say keep it as
groups<00:01:28.920> that's<00:01:29.250> fine<00:01:29.520> import<00:01:30.479> all<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
groups that's fine import all the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.710 
groups that's fine import all the
objects<00:01:31.079> great<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.000> isn't<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
objects great and so this isn't the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.469 
objects great and so this isn't the
v-ray<00:01:34.020> proxy<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.310> an<00:01:35.549> actual<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.390> know

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
v-ray proxy this is an actual you know

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
v-ray proxy this is an actual you know
piece<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.689> geometry<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> have

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
piece of geometry and you can see I have

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.370 
piece of geometry and you can see I have
ton<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> leaves<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.479> tree<00:01:39.840> trunk<00:01:39.990> here

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
ton of leaves and a tree trunk here

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.770 
ton of leaves and a tree trunk here
the<00:01:40.799> leaves<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.220> one<00:01:41.369> group<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.360> trunk<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the leaves are one group the trunk is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.080 
the leaves are one group the trunk is
another<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> need<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> make<00:01:44.850> some

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
another so now I need to make some

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.649 
another so now I need to make some
materials<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.130> object<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:48.570> if

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
materials to go on to this object so if

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.359 
materials to go on to this object so if
I<00:01:48.750> come<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.320> my<00:01:49.409> materials<00:01:49.860> panel<00:01:50.250> I'm

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I come up to my materials panel I'm

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.149 
I come up to my materials panel I'm
going<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.579> create<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.210> new<00:01:51.540> material<00:01:52.159> standard

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
going to create a new material standard

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.929 
going to create a new material standard
and<00:01:53.399> we'll<00:01:53.579> call<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.140> trunk<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.579> just<00:01:56.820> have

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
and we'll call it trunk and I just have

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.700 
and we'll call it trunk and I just have
a<00:01:56.969> bark<00:01:57.299> texture<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.840> I'll<00:01:57.960> load<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.170> with<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
a bark texture that I'll load up with a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.679 
a bark texture that I'll load up with a
bitmap<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.939> you're<00:02:00.149> unfamiliar<00:02:00.570> with

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
bitmap if you're unfamiliar with

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.240 
bitmap if you're unfamiliar with
creating<00:02:01.229> your<00:02:01.350> own<00:02:01.439> materials<00:02:01.890> check<00:02:02.100> out

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
creating your own materials check out

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.760 
creating your own materials check out
the<00:02:02.369> other<00:02:02.490> tutorial<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> site<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:03.770> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the other tutorial on the site here and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.919 
the other tutorial on the site here and
I'll<00:02:04.890> use<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.689> tree<00:02:06.689> number<00:02:06.960> 5<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:09.899> we

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
I'll use the tree number 5 so now if we

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.920 
I'll use the tree number 5 so now if we
see<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.920> bark<00:02:11.400> which<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.940> great

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
see that I just bark which is great

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.319 
see that I just bark which is great
the<00:02:12.989> next<00:02:13.260> create<00:02:13.680> standard<00:02:14.609> material<00:02:15.090> and

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
the next create standard material and

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:19.390 
the next create standard material and
this<00:02:15.420> one<00:02:15.599> will<00:02:15.840> be<00:02:15.870> Leafs<00:02:16.349> or<00:02:16.799> leaves<00:02:17.840> plural

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
this one will be Leafs or leaves plural

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.910 
this one will be Leafs or leaves plural
so<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.579> again<00:02:20.730> I'm<00:02:21.120> going<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.299> make<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.569> bitmap

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
so here again I'm going to make a bitmap

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.259 
so here again I'm going to make a bitmap
as<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.129> red<00:02:23.310> leaf<00:02:23.549> okay

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
as the red leaf okay

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.270 
as the red leaf okay
and<00:02:24.359> this<00:02:24.989> has<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> transparency<00:02:25.890> map<00:02:26.069> that

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
and this has a transparency map that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.270 
and this has a transparency map that
goes<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.849> which<00:02:27.359> is<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:28.280> which

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
goes with it which is the which

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.369 
goes with it which is the which
basically<00:02:29.879> cuts<00:02:30.239> out<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.659> shape<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:30.989> that

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
basically cuts out that shape so that

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.709 
basically cuts out that shape so that
the<00:02:31.500> each<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.889> those<00:02:31.980> facets<00:02:32.459> will<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:33.120> leaf

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
the each of those facets will be a leaf

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.839 
the each of those facets will be a leaf
shape<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.230> not<00:02:34.469> you<00:02:35.010> know<00:02:35.129> kind<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.489> just<00:02:35.579> a

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
shape and not you know kind of just a

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.750 
shape and not you know kind of just a
weird<00:02:36.090> red<00:02:36.510> box<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.049> leaf<00:02:37.290> imprint<00:02:37.769> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
weird red box with a leaf imprint the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.830 
weird red box with a leaf imprint the
one<00:02:38.879> thing<00:02:39.060> with<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.329> is<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.510> actually<00:02:39.659> have

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
one thing with this is I actually have

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.809 
one thing with this is I actually have
to<00:02:39.959> invert<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.319> black<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.219> white<00:02:41.430> needs<00:02:41.639> to

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
to invert it black and white needs to

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.940 
to invert it black and white needs to
flip<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.750> when<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:42.959> preview<00:02:43.469> this<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.799> can

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
flip so that when I preview this you can

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.789 
flip so that when I preview this you can
see<00:02:44.689> it's<00:02:45.689> just<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.109> leave<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.439> can<00:02:46.560> see<00:02:46.709> this

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
see it's just the leave you can see this

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.349 
see it's just the leave you can see this
little<00:02:47.010> bit<00:02:47.220> here<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.700> actually<00:02:47.819> shaped

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
little bit here it's actually shaped

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.509 
little bit here it's actually shaped
around<00:02:48.599> a<00:02:48.750> sphere<00:02:49.079> which<00:02:49.349> is<00:02:49.500> fine<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.459> I'm

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
around a sphere which is fine so I'm

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.369 
around a sphere which is fine so I'm
going<00:02:50.639> to<00:02:50.669> click<00:02:51.060> my<00:02:51.090> leaves<00:02:51.450> right<00:02:51.870> click<00:02:52.169> and

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
going to click my leaves right click and

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.710 
going to click my leaves right click and
apply<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:52.650> selection<00:02:53.430> click<00:02:54.239> my<00:02:54.419> trunk

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
apply this selection click my trunk

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.860 
apply this selection click my trunk
right<00:02:55.319> click<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.189> apply<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:56.879> to<00:02:57.840> my

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
right click and apply this to my

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.899 
right click and apply this to my
selection<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:59.069> now<00:02:59.219> if<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.519> were<00:02:59.639> to<00:02:59.669> render

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
selection so now if I were to render

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.670 
selection so now if I were to render
this<00:03:00.180> we<00:03:00.450> would<00:03:00.599> see<00:03:00.870> let's<00:03:01.290> see<00:03:01.439> I<00:03:01.469> can

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
this we would see let's see I can

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.709 
this we would see let's see I can
actually<00:03:01.769> do<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.159> really<00:03:02.310> quickly<00:03:02.719> I'm

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
actually do that really quickly I'm

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.390 
actually do that really quickly I'm
using<00:03:03.900> again<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.819> VA<00:03:05.819> V<00:03:06.450> v-ray<00:03:07.400> default

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
using again the VA V v-ray default

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.339 
using again the VA V v-ray default
settings<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.849> GI<00:03:09.150> IR<00:03:09.689> matte<00:03:09.900> medium

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
settings of GI IR matte medium

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.709 
settings of GI IR matte medium
let's<00:03:11.189> my<00:03:11.549> kind<00:03:11.909> of<00:03:11.969> go<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.180> I've<00:03:12.540> got<00:03:12.689> a

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
let's my kind of go to I've got a

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.140 
let's my kind of go to I've got a
physical<00:03:13.319> camera<00:03:13.500> turned<00:03:13.769> on<00:03:13.889> I'll<00:03:14.819> quickly

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
physical camera turned on I'll quickly

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.369 
physical camera turned on I'll quickly
throw<00:03:15.979> the<00:03:16.979> Sun<00:03:17.220> in<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.909> scene<00:03:18.319> right<00:03:19.319> here

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
throw the Sun in the scene right here

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.110 
throw the Sun in the scene right here
and<00:03:19.889> I'll<00:03:19.979> put<00:03:20.099> an<00:03:20.220> infinite<00:03:20.669> plane<00:03:20.879> on<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
and I'll put an infinite plane on the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.300 
and I'll put an infinite plane on the
ground<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.750> then<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:22.560> I<00:03:22.680> set<00:03:22.859> up<00:03:22.949> my<00:03:23.040> camera

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
ground and then if I set up my camera

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.240 
ground and then if I set up my camera
here<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:24.349> actually<00:03:25.349> one<00:03:25.590> last<00:03:25.799> thing<00:03:25.949> I<00:03:26.069> want

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
here and actually one last thing I want

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.719 
here and actually one last thing I want
to<00:03:26.280> do<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:27.299> come<00:03:27.479> to<00:03:27.569> my<00:03:27.659> output<00:03:28.250> get<00:03:29.250> my<00:03:29.340> aspect

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
to do is come to my output get my aspect

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.759 
to do is come to my output get my aspect
ratio<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.479> make<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.930> really<00:03:31.079> small<00:03:31.379> right<00:03:31.709> now

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
ratio and make it really small right now

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.069 
ratio and make it really small right now
we<00:03:31.919> you<00:03:32.549> can<00:03:32.699> already<00:03:32.879> see<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.689> Rhino

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
we you can already see that that Rhino

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.659 
we you can already see that that Rhino
is<00:03:34.229> kind<00:03:34.409> of<00:03:34.470> laggy<00:03:34.799> just<00:03:35.280> because<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.609> the

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
is kind of laggy just because of the

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.469 
is kind of laggy just because of the
amount<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.909> geometry<00:03:36.060> in<00:03:36.449> this<00:03:36.599> one<00:03:37.109> tree<00:03:38.479> but

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.479 
amount of geometry in this one tree but

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:40.759 
amount of geometry in this one tree but
if<00:03:39.569> I<00:03:39.629> did<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> quick<00:03:40.079> render<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.530> won't<00:03:40.680> even

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
if I did a quick render and I won't even

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.140 
if I did a quick render and I won't even
let<00:03:40.949> this<00:03:41.099> finish<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.579> can<00:03:41.729> see<00:03:41.879> that<00:03:42.060> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
let this finish you can see that the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.670 
let this finish you can see that the
bark<00:03:42.389> is<00:03:42.540> there<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.989> we've<00:03:43.139> got<00:03:43.290> red<00:03:43.470> leaves

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
bark is there and we've got red leaves

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.069 
bark is there and we've got red leaves
and<00:03:44.069> as<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.000> kind<00:03:45.090> of<00:03:45.180> gets<00:03:45.389> more<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:45.989> more

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
and as it kind of gets more and more

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.659 
and as it kind of gets more and more
resolved<00:03:46.590> you'll<00:03:46.739> see<00:03:46.889> there's<00:03:47.099> like<00:03:47.250> you

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
resolved you'll see there's like you

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.699 
resolved you'll see there's like you
know<00:03:47.759> an<00:03:47.909> actual<00:03:48.090> leaf<00:03:48.449> on<00:03:48.720> there<00:03:49.139> but<00:03:49.650> I'm

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
know an actual leaf on there but I'm

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.719 
know an actual leaf on there but I'm
going<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.889> cancel<00:03:50.159> that<00:03:50.189> because<00:03:50.459> that's<00:03:50.609> not

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
going to cancel that because that's not

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:51.979 
going to cancel that because that's not
why<00:03:50.939> we're<00:03:51.120> here<00:03:51.150> we're<00:03:51.389> here<00:03:51.419> for<00:03:51.689> v-ray

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989

why we're here we're here for v-ray
proxy<00:03:52.019> objects<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:53.549> if<00:03:53.639> I<00:03:53.699> click<00:03:53.970> both<00:03:54.359> things

proxy objects so if I click both things
the<00:03:54.989> trunk<00:03:55.259> and<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.470> leave<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.919> I

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
the trunk and the leave and I

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.640 
the trunk and the leave and I
right-click<00:03:57.090> here<00:03:57.389> that<00:03:57.840> uses<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.409> right

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
right-click here that uses the right

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.499 
right-click here that uses the right
command<00:03:59.310> we're<00:03:59.459> going<00:03:59.579> to<00:03:59.639> write<00:03:59.879> the<00:04:00.060> proxy

command we're going to write the proxy

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.379 
command we're going to write the proxy
so<00:04:01.199> right<00:04:01.379> click<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.799> we<00:04:02.430> come<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:02.729> very<00:04:02.879> proxy

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.710 
so right click it we come to very proxy
and<00:04:03.720> I'm<00:04:03.810> going<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.019> call<00:04:04.169> this<00:04:04.319> tree<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:06.359> it's

going to be this VR mesh it's just a

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
separate files we're going to try to

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.719 
separate files we're going to try to
keep<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.570> as<00:04:21.659> one<00:04:21.989> I'm<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.979> little<00:04:23.130> worried

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
keep it as one I'm a little worried

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.020 
keep it as one I'm a little worried
because<00:04:23.760> we<00:04:24.510> have<00:04:24.690> two<00:04:24.930> textures<00:04:25.320> and

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
because we have two textures and

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.330 
because we have two textures and
may<00:04:27.360> not<00:04:27.540> know<00:04:27.810> which<00:04:28.110> texture<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.890> keep<00:04:29.100> but

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
may not know which texture to keep but

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.500 
may not know which texture to keep but
we're<00:04:29.490> going<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:29.640> try<00:04:29.790> it<00:04:29.910> is<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.150> first<00:04:30.360> one

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
we're going to try it is the first one

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.150 
we're going to try it is the first one
and<00:04:30.720> if<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.320> doesn't<00:04:31.500> work<00:04:31.680> we'll<00:04:31.830> come<00:04:32.010> back

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
and if it doesn't work we'll come back

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.880 
and if it doesn't work we'll come back
so<00:04:32.760> there<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.900> already<00:04:34.080> wrote<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.620> file

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
so there it it already wrote that file

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.640 
so there it it already wrote that file
now<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.910> is<00:04:36.060> actually<00:04:36.420> a<00:04:36.450> v-ray<00:04:36.930> proxy<00:04:36.960> option

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
now it is actually a v-ray proxy option

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.010 
now it is actually a v-ray proxy option
here<00:04:37.980> it's<00:04:38.640> still<00:04:38.880> an<00:04:39.030> open<00:04:39.180> mesh<00:04:39.630> but<00:04:39.810> we<00:04:39.900> get

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
here it's still an open mesh but we get

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.990 
here it's still an open mesh but we get
this<00:04:40.110> little<00:04:40.230> dialogue<00:04:40.770> box<00:04:40.800> dialog<00:04:41.580> box<00:04:41.820> that

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
this little dialogue box dialog box that

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.120 
this little dialogue box dialog box that
and<00:04:42.240> know<00:04:42.480> we<00:04:42.690> know<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.170> proxy<00:04:43.590> also<00:04:44.040> you

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
and know we know it's a proxy also you

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.280 
and know we know it's a proxy also you
can<00:04:44.280> tell<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.700> there's<00:04:45.030> like<00:04:45.210> no<00:04:45.780> geometry

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
can tell that there's like no geometry

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.240 
can tell that there's like no geometry
left<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.710> scene<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:48.150> if<00:04:48.240> we<00:04:48.300> render<00:04:48.540> again

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
left of the scene and if we render again

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.210 
left of the scene and if we render again
let's<00:04:50.250> see<00:04:50.460> it<00:04:51.030> maintains<00:04:51.720> textures<00:04:52.530> so<00:04:53.130> you

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
let's see it maintains textures so you

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.440 
let's see it maintains textures so you
can<00:04:53.340> see<00:04:53.490> we<00:04:53.580> already<00:04:53.700> have<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:54.000> trunk<00:04:54.270> right

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
can see we already have the trunk right

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.570 
can see we already have the trunk right
there<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:55.820> we<00:04:56.820> have<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.630> leaves<00:04:58.430> which<00:04:59.430> is

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
there and we have the leaves which is

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.600 
there and we have the leaves which is
great<00:04:59.820> so<00:05:00.210> now<00:05:00.740> you<00:05:01.740> know<00:05:01.830> with<00:05:02.040> with<00:05:02.310> a<00:05:02.370> much

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
great so now you know with with a much

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.750 
great so now you know with with a much
smaller<00:05:03.120> file<00:05:03.690> I<00:05:04.050> can<00:05:04.650> take<00:05:04.830> my<00:05:04.980> proxy<00:05:05.520> and

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
smaller file I can take my proxy and

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.470 
smaller file I can take my proxy and
copy<00:05:06.690> it<00:05:07.130> I'm<00:05:08.130> just<00:05:08.280> going<00:05:08.400> to<00:05:08.430> hold<00:05:08.669> shift<00:05:08.940> so

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
copy it I'm just going to hold shift so

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.880 
copy it I'm just going to hold shift so
you<00:05:09.510> can<00:05:09.690> go<00:05:09.840> non<00:05:10.140> ortho<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.650> I'm<00:05:10.710> gonna<00:05:10.800> hold

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
you can go non ortho and I'm gonna hold

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.300 
you can go non ortho and I'm gonna hold
alt<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.460> don't<00:05:11.669> snapped<00:05:12.000> anything<00:05:12.419> I<00:05:13.310> will

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
alt so I don't snapped anything I will

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.830 
alt so I don't snapped anything I will
put<00:05:14.520> in<00:05:14.700> a<00:05:15.650> whole<00:05:16.650> bunch<00:05:16.919> of<00:05:17.070> trees<00:05:17.840> they'll

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
put in a whole bunch of trees they'll

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.750 
put in a whole bunch of trees they'll
they'll<00:05:19.440> be<00:05:19.590> odd<00:05:19.890> because<00:05:20.250> they're<00:05:20.520> all<00:05:20.640> going

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
they'll be odd because they're all going

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.140 
they'll be odd because they're all going
to<00:05:20.820> be<00:05:20.940> facing<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:22.140> exact<00:05:22.380> same<00:05:22.560> direction<00:05:23.150> if

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
to be facing the exact same direction if

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.490 
to be facing the exact same direction if
you<00:05:24.210> wanted<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:24.750> suppose<00:05:25.110> you<00:05:25.230> could<00:05:25.380> go

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
you wanted to I suppose you could go

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.720 
you wanted to I suppose you could go
into<00:05:25.650> a<00:05:27.140> grasshopper<00:05:28.140> script<00:05:28.710> and<00:05:28.950> there's

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
into a grasshopper script and there's

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
help you array and randomized proxy

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.909 
help you array and randomized proxy
objects<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.360> haven't<00:05:37.290> got<00:05:37.380> it<00:05:37.500> working<00:05:37.650> and

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
objects I haven't got it working and

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:38.780 
objects I haven't got it working and
that's<00:05:38.070> really<00:05:38.190> not<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.460> point<00:05:38.580> of<00:05:38.729> this

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
that's really not the point of this

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.880 
that's really not the point of this
tutorial<00:05:39.300> it's<00:05:39.419> just<00:05:39.600> to<00:05:39.690> show<00:05:39.750> you<00:05:39.930> that<00:05:40.050> here

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
tutorial it's just to show you that here

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.580 
tutorial it's just to show you that here
you<00:05:41.040> know<00:05:41.130> I<00:05:41.160> have<00:05:41.400> a<00:05:41.669> ton<00:05:42.510> of<00:05:42.540> trees<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.229> I<00:05:43.440> can

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
you know I have a ton of trees and I can

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.719 
you know I have a ton of trees and I can
even<00:05:43.880> copy<00:05:44.880> more<00:05:46.729> we'll<00:05:47.729> make<00:05:47.880> a<00:05:47.910> quick<00:05:48.210> forest

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
even copy more we'll make a quick forest

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.340 
even copy more we'll make a quick forest
holding<00:05:50.729> old<00:05:50.910> ship<00:05:51.300> so<00:05:51.600> I'm<00:05:51.840> not<00:05:51.960> snapping

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
holding old ship so I'm not snapping

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.810 
holding old ship so I'm not snapping
anything<00:05:52.740> some<00:05:53.160> of<00:05:53.250> these<00:05:53.310> will<00:05:53.490> be<00:05:53.520> weird

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
anything some of these will be weird

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.980 
anything some of these will be weird
because<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.240> trees<00:05:54.450> will<00:05:54.630> actually<00:05:54.900> be

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
because the trees will actually be

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.730 
because the trees will actually be
overlapping<00:05:55.410> with<00:05:55.620> one<00:05:55.770> another<00:05:56.010> but<00:05:56.580> fine<00:05:57.740> so

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
overlapping with one another but fine so

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.690 
overlapping with one another but fine so
let's<00:05:58.950> get<00:05:59.100> a<00:05:59.160> nice<00:05:59.370> camera<00:05:59.850> view<00:06:00.000> here<00:06:00.680> always

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
let's get a nice camera view here always

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.290 
let's get a nice camera view here always
not<00:06:02.700> ever<00:06:03.270> a<00:06:03.450> fan<00:06:03.780> of<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.110> 50<00:06:04.410> millimeter<00:06:05.300> so

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
not ever a fan of the 50 millimeter so

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.360 
not ever a fan of the 50 millimeter so
come<00:06:06.510> in<00:06:06.630> like<00:06:06.660> this<00:06:06.960> it's<00:06:07.620> it's<00:06:08.160> kind<00:06:08.340> of

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
come in like this it's it's kind of

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.460 
come in like this it's it's kind of
funny<00:06:08.550> that<00:06:08.610> they're<00:06:08.850> all<00:06:08.970> just<00:06:09.169> the<00:06:10.169> exact

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
funny that they're all just the exact

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.150 
funny that they're all just the exact
same<00:06:10.740> tree<00:06:12.229> but<00:06:13.229> fine<00:06:13.650> we'll<00:06:13.860> go<00:06:13.979> with<00:06:14.130> that

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
same tree but fine we'll go with that

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.030 
same tree but fine we'll go with that
and<00:06:14.550> then<00:06:15.210> I'm<00:06:16.200> going<00:06:16.350> to<00:06:16.410> do<00:06:16.560> just<00:06:16.860> a<00:06:16.919> quick

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
and then I'm going to do just a quick

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.560 
and then I'm going to do just a quick
render<00:06:17.340> and<00:06:17.669> this<00:06:18.030> will<00:06:18.180> probably<00:06:18.300> take<00:06:18.450> a

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
render and this will probably take a

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.909 
render and this will probably take a
little<00:06:18.750> bit<00:06:18.990> so<00:06:19.169> I'll<00:06:19.260> fast<00:06:19.470> forward<00:06:19.560> and<00:06:19.800> see

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
little bit so I'll fast forward and see

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:32.129 
little bit so I'll fast forward and see
it<00:06:20.010> on<00:06:20.070> the<00:06:20.190> other<00:06:20.220> side

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:39.510 

you

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.820 

all<00:06:40.389> right<00:06:40.539> so<00:06:40.750> there<00:06:41.110> you<00:06:41.199> go<00:06:41.349> you<00:06:41.410> can<00:06:41.530> see

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 
all right so there you go you can see

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.499 
all right so there you go you can see
obviously<00:06:42.280> the<00:06:42.370> render<00:06:42.759> settings<00:06:42.970> were<00:06:43.210> not

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
obviously the render settings were not

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.290 
obviously the render settings were not
quite<00:06:43.960> right<00:06:44.199> I'm<00:06:45.039> pretty<00:06:45.220> far<00:06:45.460> off<00:06:45.490> also<00:06:45.970> the

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
quite right I'm pretty far off also the

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.180 
quite right I'm pretty far off also the
infinite<00:06:47.259> plane<00:06:47.349> was<00:06:47.590> just<00:06:47.770> white<00:06:47.949> there<00:06:48.159> is

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
infinite plane was just white there is

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.279 
infinite plane was just white there is
no<00:06:48.340> material<00:06:48.789> on<00:06:48.879> it<00:06:49.080> but<00:06:50.080> it's<00:06:50.199> pretty

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:50.289 
no material on it but it's pretty

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:52.589 
no material on it but it's pretty
overexposed<00:06:51.120> I'm<00:06:52.120> not<00:06:52.240> going<00:06:52.360> to<00:06:52.419> run<00:06:52.509> the

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 
overexposed I'm not going to run the

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:54.480 
overexposed I'm not going to run the
rendering<00:06:52.930> again<00:06:53.169> because<00:06:54.039> it<00:06:54.129> was<00:06:54.190> just<00:06:54.400> a

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
rendering again because it was just a

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.670 
rendering again because it was just a
test<00:06:54.669> but<00:06:55.360> you<00:06:55.389> can<00:06:55.539> see<00:06:55.659> that<00:06:55.840> there<00:06:56.020> is<00:06:56.050> a<00:06:56.199> ton

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
test but you can see that there is a ton

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.149 
test but you can see that there is a ton
of<00:06:56.710> geometry<00:06:57.550> in<00:06:57.699> the<00:06:58.030> scene<00:06:58.060> on<00:06:59.159> casting

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:00.159 
of geometry in the scene on casting

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:03.240 
of geometry in the scene on casting
shadows<00:07:00.520> and<00:07:00.940> there's<00:07:01.479> lots<00:07:01.690> of<00:07:02.129> shove<00:07:03.129> us

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
shadows and there's lots of shove us

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.520 
shadows and there's lots of shove us
within<00:07:03.400> the<00:07:03.550> trees<00:07:03.849> themselves<00:07:04.330> and<00:07:05.319> that<00:07:05.409> all

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
within the trees themselves and that all

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.100 
within the trees themselves and that all
came<00:07:05.680> from<00:07:05.830> the<00:07:05.949> proxy<00:07:06.340> objects<00:07:06.720> so<00:07:07.720> let's<00:07:07.930> see

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
came from the proxy objects so let's see

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.749 
came from the proxy objects so let's see
if<00:07:08.229> we<00:07:08.349> can<00:07:08.500> minimize<00:07:08.889> this<00:07:09.159> yes<00:07:09.370> so<00:07:09.400> you<00:07:09.610> can

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 
if we can minimize this yes so you can

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:13.999 
if we can minimize this yes so you can
see<00:07:09.909> how<00:07:10.210> full<00:07:10.720> these<00:07:11.440> are<00:07:11.680> and<00:07:11.949> how<00:07:12.479> small

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.009 
see how full these are and how small

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.040 
see how full these are and how small
these<00:07:15.009> are<00:07:15.280> the<00:07:15.490> proxy<00:07:15.699> actually<00:07:16.210> has<00:07:16.360> you

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
these are the proxy actually has you

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.520 
these are the proxy actually has you
know<00:07:17.139> only<00:07:17.349> a<00:07:17.440> few<00:07:19.080> indications<00:07:20.080> of<00:07:20.319> where<00:07:20.470> the

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.530 
know only a few indications of where the

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.649 
know only a few indications of where the
leaves<00:07:20.680> are<00:07:20.860> so<00:07:21.849> that's<00:07:22.000> how<00:07:22.120> you<00:07:22.180> use<00:07:22.389> them<00:07:22.509> I

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:22.659 
leaves are so that's how you use them I

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:24.960 
leaves are so that's how you use them I
hope<00:07:22.840> it's<00:07:23.020> helpful<00:07:23.110> if<00:07:23.500> you<00:07:23.819> have<00:07:24.819> any
