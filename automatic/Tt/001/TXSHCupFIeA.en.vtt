the time stuff order goes the fifth guys
next<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:06.170> then<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:06.350> goes<00:01:06.440> back<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.830> first

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
next and then it goes back to the first

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.929 
next and then it goes back to the first
now<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.439> explain<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.070> key<00:01:10.280> aspects<00:01:10.729> of<00:01:10.820> this

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
now to explain the key aspects of this

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.760 
now to explain the key aspects of this
fight<00:01:11.270> it's<00:01:11.719> pretty<00:01:11.960> much<00:01:12.140> doing<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.530> lot<00:01:12.710> of

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
fight it's pretty much doing a lot of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.980 
fight it's pretty much doing a lot of
damage<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.460> them<00:01:13.579> in<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:14.119> small<00:01:14.689> amount<00:01:14.899> of

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
damage to them in the small amount of

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.780 
damage to them in the small amount of
time<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:15.350> have<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:15.860> really<00:01:16.159> only<00:01:16.340> have<00:01:16.460> the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
time you have you really only have the

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.179 
time you have you really only have the
time<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.210> three<00:01:17.990> time<00:01:18.200> steps<00:01:18.530> which<00:01:18.860> gets

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
time of three time steps which gets

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.950 
time of three time steps which gets
shorter<00:01:19.549> each<00:01:19.850> time<00:01:20.210> due<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.479> diminishing

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
shorter each time due to diminishing

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.600 
shorter each time due to diminishing
returns<00:01:21.320> and<00:01:21.530> after<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:21.920> third<00:01:22.100> time<00:01:22.340> stuff

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
returns and after the third time stuff

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.249 
returns and after the third time stuff
the<00:01:22.909> fourth<00:01:23.180> will<00:01:23.390> no<00:01:23.509> longer<00:01:23.539> affect<00:01:24.110> them

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
the fourth will no longer affect them

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.480 
the fourth will no longer affect them
until<00:01:24.649> after<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.250> phase<00:01:25.430> shift<00:01:26.439> so<00:01:27.439> when<00:01:28.369> you

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
until after the phase shift so when you

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.310 
until after the phase shift so when you
time<00:01:28.700> stuff<00:01:28.939> you<00:01:29.180> generate<00:01:29.659> five<00:01:29.930> shock

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
time stuff you generate five shock

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.289 
time stuff you generate five shock
charges<00:01:30.829> which<00:01:31.250> then<00:01:31.700> when<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:31.969> use<00:01:32.149> your

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
charges which then when you use your

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.389 
charges which then when you use your
shock<00:01:32.659> lands<00:01:33.049> it'll<00:01:33.530> do<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.740> lot<00:01:34.039> more<00:01:34.070> damage

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
shock lands it'll do a lot more damage

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:35.649 
shock lands it'll do a lot more damage
and<00:01:34.670> when<00:01:34.880> other<00:01:35.119> people<00:01:35.390> have<00:01:35.509> their

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
and when other people have their

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.410 
and when other people have their
temporal<00:01:36.020> rift<00:01:36.170> sup<00:01:36.439> they<00:01:36.890> get<00:01:37.420> shocked

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
temporal rift sup they get shocked

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.929 
temporal rift sup they get shocked
charges<00:01:38.869> from<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.109> damage<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:39.740> do<00:01:39.950> then

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
charges from the damage you do then

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.550 
charges from the damage you do then
after<00:01:41.420> you<00:01:41.509> chocolates<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.109> next<00:01:42.380> guy<00:01:42.500> will

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
after you chocolates the next guy will

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.580 
after you chocolates the next guy will
go<00:01:42.859> and<00:01:43.070> he'll<00:01:43.939> then<00:01:44.149> have<00:01:44.420> like<00:01:45.140> three<00:01:45.500> or

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
go and he'll then have like three or

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.889 
go and he'll then have like three or
four<00:01:45.649> shock<00:01:46.369> charges<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.060> then<00:01:47.149> his<00:01:47.450> though

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
four shock charges and then his though

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.779 
four shock charges and then his though
that<00:01:48.200> damage<00:01:48.560> he<00:01:48.710> does<00:01:48.890> will<00:01:49.189> help<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.520> others

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
that damage he does will help the others

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.029 
that damage he does will help the others
generate<00:01:50.329> more<00:01:50.509> charges<00:01:50.960> in<00:01:51.140> matters<00:01:51.530> of<00:01:51.560> 10

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
generate more charges in matters of 10

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.950 
generate more charges in matters of 10
so<00:01:52.729> pretty<00:01:52.909> much<00:01:53.000> do<00:01:53.359> a<00:01:53.390> lot<00:01:53.570> of<00:01:53.600> damage<00:01:53.810> you

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
so pretty much do a lot of damage you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.870 
so pretty much do a lot of damage you
want<00:01:54.229> to<00:01:54.289> be<00:01:54.380> just<00:01:54.679> generating<00:01:55.219> as<00:01:55.369> many<00:01:55.609> shock

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
want to be just generating as many shock

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.789 
want to be just generating as many shock
church<00:01:56.210> as<00:01:56.359> you<00:01:56.450> can<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:56.869> this<00:01:57.409> is<00:01:57.560> easily

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
church as you can and this is easily

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.999 
church as you can and this is easily
done<00:01:57.979> following<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:58.939> rotation<00:01:59.710> now<00:02:00.710> this<00:02:00.859> is

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
done following the rotation now this is

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.859 
done following the rotation now this is
also<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.399> reason<00:02:01.520> why<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:02.210> want<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.840> be

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
also the reason why you want to be

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.599 
also the reason why you want to be
shocked<00:02:03.200> cleansing<00:02:03.649> after<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.100> time<00:02:04.310> stock

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
shocked cleansing after the time stock

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:06.310 
shocked cleansing after the time stock
because<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.119> time<00:02:05.329> stuff<00:02:05.539> gives<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:06.020> five

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
because the time stuff gives you five

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.400 
because the time stuff gives you five
shock<00:02:06.679> judges<00:02:07.390> all<00:02:08.390> in<00:02:08.660> all<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:09.050> not<00:02:09.229> that

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
shock judges all in all it's not that

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.900 
shock judges all in all it's not that
hard<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.740> fight<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.100> may<00:02:10.250> take<00:02:10.460> a<00:02:10.490> little

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
getting used to but besides that I

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.890 
getting used to but besides that I
thought<00:02:13.190> was<00:02:13.340> lost

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
thought was lost

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.559 
thought was lost
and<00:02:13.989> thanks<00:02:14.650> for<00:02:14.739> watching

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569
