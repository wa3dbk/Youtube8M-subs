at<00:00:30.119> silk<00:00:30.480> touch<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:32.009> diamond<00:00:32.340> pickaxe

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
at silk touch one on the diamond pickaxe

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.060 
at silk touch one on the diamond pickaxe
or<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.970> guess<00:00:33.210> any<00:00:33.420> pickaxe<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.960> general<00:00:34.260> it's

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
or I guess any pickaxe in general it's

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.830 
or I guess any pickaxe in general it's
going<00:00:35.250> back<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.550> normal<00:00:35.910> view<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.570> we'll

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
going back to normal view and we'll

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.759 
going back to normal view and we'll
check<00:00:37.080> this<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.710> alright<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:39.620> just<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> start

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
check this out alright so just to start

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.150 
check this out alright so just to start
off<00:00:41.190> none<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.360> had<00:00:42.900> bad<00:00:43.260> ratings<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.040> all

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
off none of these had bad ratings at all

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.330 
off none of these had bad ratings at all
there<00:00:44.309> was<00:00:44.400> no<00:00:44.460> bad<00:00:45.059> rating<00:00:45.720> in<00:00:45.870> general<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.650> if

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
there was no bad rating in general so if

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.080 
there was no bad rating in general so if
you<00:00:48.180> were<00:00:48.330> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:49.190> do<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.460> level<00:00:50.579> 18

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you were going to do it on level 18

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.799 
you were going to do it on level 18
level<00:00:51.540> 22<00:00:51.899> 28<00:00:52.290> 30<00:00:52.760> 28<00:00:53.760> 30<00:00:54.120> they're<00:00:54.450> about<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
level 22 28 30 28 30 they're about the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.310 
level 22 28 30 28 30 they're about the
same

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.720 

22:18<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> little<00:00:58.800> bit<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.070> difference<00:00:59.460> but

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
22:18 a little bit of a difference but

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.790 
22:18 a little bit of a difference but
either<00:01:00.210> way<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:00.690> I'm<00:01:00.780> trying<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> say<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
either way what I'm trying to say is you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680 
either way what I'm trying to say is you
have<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.950> pretty<00:01:02.309> good<00:01:02.489> chance<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.969> any<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.480> them

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
have a pretty good chance on any of them

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.290 
have a pretty good chance on any of them
so<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.259> only<00:01:04.470> 18<00:01:04.979> levels<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.550> it's

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
so if you have only 18 levels and it's

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.940 
so if you have only 18 levels and it's
gonna<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.539> really<00:01:06.690> hard<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.020> get<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.800> would

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
gonna be really hard to get more I would

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.150 
gonna be really hard to get more I would
go<00:01:08.070> ahead<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.430> try<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.670> okay<00:01:09.539> so<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.890> doing

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
go ahead and try it okay so for doing

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.719 
go ahead and try it okay so for doing
some<00:01:11.490> touch<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.910> on<00:01:12.060> pickaxes<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.490> for<00:01:14.490> level

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
some touch one on pickaxes and for level

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.109 
some touch one on pickaxes and for level
18<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.330> got<00:01:15.479> 10<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> 162<00:01:16.890> which<00:01:17.580> compared

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
18 we got 10 out of 162 which compared

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.670 
18 we got 10 out of 162 which compared
to<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.390> my<00:01:18.539> other<00:01:18.570> videos<00:01:18.780> that's<00:01:19.380> pretty

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
to all my other videos that's pretty

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320 
to all my other videos that's pretty
good<00:01:19.890> thanks<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> highest<00:01:20.880> we've<00:01:21.000> had<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.299> far

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
good thanks the highest we've had so far

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.149 
good thanks the highest we've had so far
maybe<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.229> lower<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.040> that's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
maybe just a little bit lower so that's

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.130 
maybe just a little bit lower so that's
a<00:01:23.250> six<00:01:23.490> point<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:23.939> seven<00:01:24.210> chance<00:01:24.630> guys<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
a six point one seven chance guys and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.770 
a six point one seven chance guys and
then<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:26.010> level<00:01:26.430> 22<00:01:26.810> we<00:01:27.810> did<00:01:28.549> 162<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.659> got

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
then for level 22 we did 162 and we got

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.140 
then for level 22 we did 162 and we got
twenty-one<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.710> 162<00:01:32.670> which<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
twenty-one I have 162 which is the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.730 
twenty-one I have 162 which is the
twelve<00:01:33.420> point<00:01:33.750> nine<00:01:33.810> percent<00:01:33.990> chance<00:01:34.619> now

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
twelve point nine percent chance now

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.170 
twelve point nine percent chance now
that's<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.220> think<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> highest

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that's I think that's one of the highest

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.010 
that's I think that's one of the highest
we<00:01:36.420> had<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.229> pretty<00:01:37.500> good<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:39.020> if

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
we had and it's pretty good because if

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.710 
we had and it's pretty good because if
you<00:01:40.170> guys<00:01:40.259> don't<00:01:40.560> know<00:01:40.619> what's<00:01:40.830> up<00:01:41.009> touch<00:01:41.250> does

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
you guys don't know what's up touch does

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.740 
you guys don't know what's up touch does
basically<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.210> let's<00:01:45.210> see<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.689> run

basically if you have a let's see we run

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.530 
basically if you have a let's see we run
creative<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.430> know<00:01:47.579> how<00:01:47.790> if<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.270> take

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
creative here but you know how if I take

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.210 
creative here but you know how if I take
a<00:01:50.090> second<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.150> redstone<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.869> redstone<00:01:52.680> ore<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
a second of redstone a redstone ore and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.789 
a second of redstone a redstone ore and
you<00:01:53.340> would<00:01:53.460> see<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.119> cave<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.409> used

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
you would see this in a cave if you used

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.969 
you would see this in a cave if you used
a<00:01:56.130> silk<00:01:56.970> touch<00:01:57.240> pick<00:01:57.659> let's<00:01:58.140> find<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.890> we

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
a silk touch pick let's find one that we

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.700 
a silk touch pick let's find one that we
had<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.189> here<00:01:59.689> there's<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.560> use<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
had in here there's one if you use a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.620 
had in here there's one if you use a
soap<00:02:02.040> touch<00:02:02.280> pick<00:02:02.579> now<00:02:02.790> obviously<00:02:03.329> because

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
soap touch pick now obviously because

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.200 
soap touch pick now obviously because
I'm<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.960> creative<00:02:04.470> it's<00:02:04.950> gonna<00:02:05.100> come<00:02:05.399> out<00:02:05.430> like

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
I'm in creative it's gonna come out like

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.359 
I'm in creative it's gonna come out like
that<00:02:06.270> either<00:02:06.689> way<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.950> use<00:02:08.040> a<00:02:08.070> sub

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that either way but if you use a sub

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.789 
that either way but if you use a sub
touch<00:02:08.579> pick<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.269> mind<00:02:09.570> it<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:10.350> would<00:02:10.560> come

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
touch pick and you mind it it would come

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.580 
touch pick and you mind it it would come
back<00:02:11.009> as<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.910> or<00:02:12.239> right<00:02:12.660> here<00:02:13.019> they<00:02:13.470> will

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
back as this or right here they will
