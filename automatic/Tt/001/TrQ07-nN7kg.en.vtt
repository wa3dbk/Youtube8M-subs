00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
dollars and she said it was only ten

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.130 
dollars and she said it was only ten
dollars<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.110> i<00:02:07.290> definitely<00:02:07.860> got<00:02:08.250> these

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
dollars so i definitely got these

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.100 
dollars so i definitely got these
even<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.260> she's<00:02:11.190> under<00:02:11.400> with<00:02:11.520> Tony<00:02:11.760> at<00:02:11.970> over<00:02:12.810> 30

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
even if she's under with Tony at over 30

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.360 
even if she's under with Tony at over 30
i<00:02:13.230> probably<00:02:13.500> would<00:02:13.710> have<00:02:13.770> gotten<00:02:13.950> them<00:02:14.130> to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
i probably would have gotten them to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.660 
i probably would have gotten them to
just<00:02:14.670> because<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:15.900> rare<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.230> find<00:02:16.670> boots

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
just because it's so rare to find boots

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.570 
just because it's so rare to find boots
like<00:02:17.880> these<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.420> it's<00:02:19.260> even<00:02:19.470> more<00:02:20.130> rare<00:02:20.190> to

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
like these and it's even more rare to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.520 
like these and it's even more rare to
find<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:20.970> my<00:02:21.120> size<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.660> just<00:02:22.260> think<00:02:22.350> it's

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
find it in my size I just think it's

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.470 
find it in my size I just think it's
really<00:02:22.620> hard<00:02:22.890> from<00:02:23.310> my<00:02:23.610> motto<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.060> if<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.300> fits

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
really hard from my motto is if it fits

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.210 
really hard from my motto is if it fits
you<00:02:24.540> buy<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.200> but<00:02:25.650> that's<00:02:25.890> probably<00:02:26.100> not

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
you buy it but that's probably not

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.720 
you buy it but that's probably not
really<00:02:26.460> good<00:02:26.580> morrow<00:02:26.930> anyway<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.400> these

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
really good morrow anyway so these

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.220 
really good morrow anyway so these
aren't<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> four<00:02:30.240> items<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.720> got<00:02:30.930> at<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
aren't the four items that I got at the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.800 
aren't the four items that I got at the
LA<00:02:31.410> fashion<00:02:31.710> district<00:02:31.980> today<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.810> everything

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
LA fashion district today and everything

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.900 
LA fashion district today and everything
together<00:02:34.020> was<00:02:34.380> twenty<00:02:34.650> dollars<00:02:34.980> total<00:02:35.460> I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
together was twenty dollars total I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.570 
together was twenty dollars total I
think<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.930> was<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.590> was<00:02:37.710> really<00:02:38.010> fun<00:02:38.310> I

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
think that it was it was really fun I

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.140 
think that it was it was really fun I
went<00:02:38.790> with<00:02:39.000> my<00:02:39.270> friend<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.110> my<00:02:40.230> boyfriend<00:02:40.410> and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150
