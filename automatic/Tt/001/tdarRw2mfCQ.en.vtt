00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 there's this moments then have the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.370
 he just got out of the way 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.720
 so it happens to me sometimes and so 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.820
 then i have no hair died 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.010
 then I'll show you how I feel 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.780
 without any equipment and like me 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.759
 so that my optimal yoga hairstyle 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560
 I clearly found something like that 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.270
 happens then you have open hair and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.890
 Of course, still no brush to have like 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.260
 for most users first hair 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.980
 take together and steer easily 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.890
 see 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.359
 then there is a loop I run 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.769
 should be as close as possible 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.990
 so maybe one or two 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.550
 finger lay depending on how long and the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.860
 I am taking the whole golde hair 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.450
 hand but leave the thumb away with it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.000
 really smaller is the otherwise to 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 example lazy rappers what now 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600
 still left by the han is against the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.399
 turn clockwise around the base 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.629
 You can easily do that too 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.000
 a turn then it still holds 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.260
 a little bit better 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.120
 important the tips really well below 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.610
 stuff under it then we take the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.789
 bend and storm you over the whole 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.190
 around her wound, I see instead of best 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.600
 everything from below underneath and she 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.019
 then everything from the top a bit more 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.400
 further out this is under circumstances 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.010
 right when the bend is small 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 but that is exactly what it is now 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.130
 goal because then it keeps the good that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.960
 looks different with me every time 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.780
 under circumstances this is out 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.830
 agonizing part also not very nice 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.049
 But the hairstyle is incredible 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.640
 practically 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.380
 I hope he also this little 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.170
 loose back again so that it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.220
 just looks a bit better than 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.049
 she ever went to dutts without equipment 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.579
 and you could have searched that way 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.939
 just over another was the antibodies 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.530
 Time 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.100
 I did not want to do that without comment 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.540
 let it go under from below 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.670
 to form the hair around the bend and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.200
 turn it around once more and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.229
 Of course, the rest again outside 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.880
 Personally, I'll wrap you up 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.250
 then not so good and stable over it 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.570
 stumbled like a variant but 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.720
 Of course you can do it anyway 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.240
 try the whole thing stopped it 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.530
 of course it stays the same but receives 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.450
 as I said, not so good 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.909
 maybe it's just an exercise 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.079
 and habitual thing no idea then 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.119
 we come to the part with the yoga 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.770
 Hairstyle for different sports 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.690
 I usually day different hairstyles 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.040
 but it's usually pretty 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.360
 clearly what works and what does not 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.980
 In some positions you have to with the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.430
 simply lie flat on the floor 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.980
 can 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.620
 and there a high up there on the head 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.810
 Berlin has to be a job 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.340
 I share the hall I'm easy 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.629
 at the neck but a bit different 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.310
 that is more stable 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.909
 you can imagine yourself as one 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.040
 First, I'll tell who's starting to sleep 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.720
 close and sometimes from the bottom 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.840
 Part then again two games in the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.220
 I share them from top to bottom with 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.439
 these three games maybe not on 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.909
 Beach to the bottom of one of the best 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.909
 Examples for me it was a shock 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.579
 must be the shoulder is standing but 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.569
 once I honestly was a braid too 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.120
 quite impractical 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.470
 he was with constantly through the area and 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.750
 you have to be careful that you are not in the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.599
 hands on it rises and sometimes beats 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.680
 he can easily face, of course 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.389
 I give them from one to the other 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.790
 put shoulder and watch that he always 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.319
 fitting fits but I honestly want me 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.720
 all the time thinking about my job 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.459
 I use that now 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.900
 same technology as before just just with 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.620
 a braid that makes it all 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.870
 stable 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.389
 you can like the bend etc again 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.489
 by making the talk about the 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.220
 hand really lays down why 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.500
 forefinger and thumb at this 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.909
 But it does not matter 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.180
 the main thing is that he makes a loop 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:30.909
 Wraps the rest around and stuffs 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.560
 it then again not clear we 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.169
 flat the tips extra thoroughly 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.299
 stuff underneath and then the 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.500
 Loosely braid through the bend 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.019
 pull it out 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.970
 then the whole thing is stable with 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.379
 some exercise that is totally fast and easy 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.879
 then I can change as needed but 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.639
 I just have a braid or one now 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.169
 there need for me and my hair 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.329
 the optimal solution for it 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.799
 see if their hairstyles more sport 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.000
 want to tell me the comments 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.000
 See you
