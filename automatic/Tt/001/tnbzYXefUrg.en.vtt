and more nuanced and amazing than

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.039 
and more nuanced and amazing than
anything<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.819> totally<00:02:42.120> original<00:02:42.299> unnoticed

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
anything is totally original unnoticed

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.559 
anything is totally original unnoticed
after<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.470> yeah<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:44.640> i<00:02:44.670> think<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.269> vitamin

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
after that yeah but i think this vitamin

Universal if you read despite many comic

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.860 
Universal if you read despite many comic
books<00:02:47.430> there's<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.000> many<00:02:48.120> characters<00:02:48.659> like

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
books there's so many characters like

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.770 
books there's so many characters like
venom<00:02:49.260> or<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.650> Sinister<00:02:50.040> Six<00:02:50.120> or<00:02:51.120> carnagey

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
venom or the Sinister Six or carnagey

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.880 
venom or the Sinister Six or carnagey
then<00:02:51.959> we<00:02:52.739> have<00:02:53.900> deserve<00:02:54.900> or<00:02:55.110> warm<00:02:55.379> movies<00:02:55.769> in

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
then we have deserve or warm movies in

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.849 
then we have deserve or warm movies in
their<00:02:56.010> own<00:02:56.160> right<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.640> know<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:57.299> can<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.709> I

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
their own right you know you can and I

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.240 
their own right you know you can and I
think<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.220> idea<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.760> to<00:03:00.180> expand<00:03:01.140> outwards<00:03:01.890> and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
think the idea is to expand outwards and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.699 
think the idea is to expand outwards and
engage<00:03:02.879> as<00:03:03.480> many<00:03:03.629> of<00:03:04.019> those<00:03:04.140> characters<00:03:04.590> that

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
engage as many of those characters that

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.830 
engage as many of those characters that
are<00:03:04.890> worthy<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.609> movies<00:03:06.120> into<00:03:06.359> those<00:03:06.480> four

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
are worthy of movies into those four

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.530 
are worthy of movies into those four
that<00:03:07.560> are<00:03:07.590> worthy<00:03:07.829> of<00:03:07.980> movies<00:03:08.579> for<00:03:09.180> themselves

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
that are worthy of movies for themselves

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.619 
that are worthy of movies for themselves
to<00:03:10.290> give<00:03:10.440> them<00:03:10.590> movies<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.629> technical

the<00:03:30.780> first<00:03:31.169> summer<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.440> want<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.859> shoot<00:03:32.040> on<00:03:32.750> in

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
the first summer I want to shoot on in

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.629 
the first summer I want to shoot on in
stara<00:03:34.200> because<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.560> wanted<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:34.980> 3ds<00:03:35.310> be<00:03:35.519> as

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
stara because I wanted the 3ds be as

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.940 
stara because I wanted the 3ds be as
faithful<00:03:35.910> as<00:03:36.209> possible<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.079> what<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.620> learned

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
faithful as possible and what I learned

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.009 
faithful as possible and what I learned
or<00:03:38.310> what<00:03:38.639> had<00:03:38.790> developed<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.359> time<00:03:39.720> between

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
or what had developed the time between

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.690 
or what had developed the time between
the<00:03:40.560> first<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:40.950> second<00:03:41.280> movie<00:03:41.489> was<00:03:41.669> a

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
the first and second movie was a

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.180 
the first and second movie was a
technique<00:03:42.569> of<00:03:42.780> 3d<00:03:43.109> which<00:03:43.319> is<00:03:43.470> where<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.099> would

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
technique of 3d which is where you would

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.699 
technique of 3d which is where you would
shoot<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.639> scene<00:03:44.880> with<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.720> single<00:03:46.109> camera<00:03:46.319> which

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
shoot a scene with a single camera which

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.289 
shoot a scene with a single camera which
was<00:03:46.919> smaller<00:03:47.280> not<00:03:47.609> a<00:03:47.639> small<00:03:47.849> affected

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
was smaller not a small affected

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:49.789 
was smaller not a small affected
flinging<00:03:48.599> around<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:48.930> move<00:03:49.049> it<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.319> change

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
flinging around and move it and change

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.140 
flinging around and move it and change
the<00:03:49.889> lenses<00:03:50.130> as<00:03:50.280> quickly<00:03:50.519> as<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.760> needed<00:03:50.970> to

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
the lenses as quickly as I needed to

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.220 
the lenses as quickly as I needed to
which<00:03:51.329> helped<00:03:51.599> out<00:03:51.690> think<00:03:51.900> with<00:03:51.989> everything

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
which helped out think with everything

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.110 
which helped out think with everything
the<00:03:52.889> performances<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.639> would<00:03:53.819> take<00:03:54.030> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
the performances and I would take the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.270 
the performances and I would take the
actors<00:03:54.450> out<00:03:54.569> and<00:03:54.810> reshoot<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.739> scene<00:03:55.919> again

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
actors out and reshoot the scene again

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.460 
actors out and reshoot the scene again
and<00:03:56.489> by<00:03:56.819> doing<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.359> became<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.959> second<00:03:58.380> I

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
and by doing that it became the second I

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.839 
and by doing that it became the second I
so<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.489> was<00:03:59.639> a<00:04:00.019> volvo<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.290> conversion<00:04:01.919> so<00:04:02.609> it

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
so it was a volvo of conversion so it

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.909 
so it was a volvo of conversion so it
was<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.180> new<00:04:03.720> technique<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.319> then<00:04:04.410> we<00:04:04.560> put

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
was a new technique and then we put

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.050 
was a new technique and then we put
those<00:04:05.040> two<00:04:05.340> eyes<00:04:05.489> together<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.269> created<00:04:06.750> a

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
those two eyes together and created a

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.099 
those two eyes together and created a
level<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.090> dimensionality<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:09.930> could

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
level of dimensionality that I could

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.349 
level of dimensionality that I could
control<00:04:10.709> afterwards<00:04:11.489> so<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.060> could<00:04:12.209> actually

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
control afterwards so I could actually

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.110 
control afterwards so I could actually
push<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.169> film<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.680> have<00:04:14.459> more<00:04:14.639> control<00:04:14.790> over

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
experimentation I love technical but

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.860 
experimentation I love technical but
parts<00:04:26.160> of<00:04:26.220> filming<00:04:26.550> I'd<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.480> go<00:04:27.600> into<00:04:27.750> a
