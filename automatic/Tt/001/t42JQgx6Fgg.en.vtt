message that it's cold and you would put

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.350 
message that it's cold and you would put
the<00:00:45.510> ice<00:00:45.690> down<00:00:46.610> there's<00:00:47.610> another<00:00:47.700> part<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> our

the ice down there's another part of our

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.940 
the ice down there's another part of our

nervous system which we don't have much
control<00:00:50.460> over<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> autonomic

sympathetic nervous system responds to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.560 
sympathetic nervous system responds to
stress<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.229> prepares<00:01:07.799> us<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.010> action<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.330> our

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
stress and prepares us for action so our

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.679 
stress and prepares us for action so our
pupils<00:01:10.260> become<00:01:10.590> dilated<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.479> ready

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
pupils become dilated and we get ready

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.620 
pupils become dilated and we get ready
for<00:01:13.020> action<00:01:13.790> sort<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.210> ran<00:01:15.479> into

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
for action sort of like if you ran into

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.469
