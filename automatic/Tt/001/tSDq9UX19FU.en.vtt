00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
quickly unlock both phones because I got

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.929 
quickly unlock both phones because I got
past<00:00:26.160> cord<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:27.420> both<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.840> these<00:00:27.960> two<00:00:28.260> phones

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
past cord on both of these two phones

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.930 
past cord on both of these two phones
budget<00:00:29.939> phones<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.369> both<00:00:32.550> phones<00:00:32.759> are

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
budget phones so so both phones are

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.220 
budget phones so so both phones are
basically<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.290> Android<00:00:35.160> 4.4.4<00:00:35.820> kitkat<00:00:36.450> so

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
basically on the Android 4.4.4 kitkat so

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.780 
basically on the Android 4.4.4 kitkat so
it's<00:00:37.469> gonna<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.739> fun<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> test<00:00:38.610> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
it's gonna be fun to do the test and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.090 
it's gonna be fun to do the test and
have<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:40.110> different<00:00:40.290> type<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:41.930> UI<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.500> mean

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
have like a different type of UI I mean

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.090 
have like a different type of UI I mean
different<00:00:44.789> processor<00:00:45.329> without<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> mediatek

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
different processor without the mediatek

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.840 
different processor without the mediatek
hair<00:00:47.370> versus<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.059> Snapdragon<00:00:48.809> 410<00:00:49.670> which<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
hair versus the Snapdragon 410 which is

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.170 
hair versus the Snapdragon 410 which is
or<00:00:51.420> surrogate<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.079> head<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.320> think<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:53.180> think

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
or surrogate for head I think I think

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.750 
or surrogate for head I think I think
it's<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> 64-bit<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.379> don't<00:00:55.800> really<00:00:56.399> know

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it's a 64-bit one I don't really know

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
it's a 64-bit one I don't really know
should<00:00:57.539> confirm<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> because<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.829> just

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
should confirm it because it's it's just

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.560 
should confirm it because it's it's just
you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.489> for<00:01:00.390> quite<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.320> while<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.390> let's<00:01:03.390> just

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you know for quite a while so let's just

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.500 
you know for quite a while so let's just
quickly<00:01:03.660> power<00:01:04.170> off<00:01:04.470> both<00:01:05.100> phones<00:01:08.270> yeah<00:01:09.270> it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
quickly power off both phones yeah it's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.359 
quickly power off both phones yeah it's
actually<00:01:09.720> Qualcomm<00:01:10.409> Snapdragon<00:01:10.500> 410<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
actually Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 I

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.609 
actually Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 I
remember<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.479> called<00:01:12.900> cops<00:01:13.080> driving<00:01:13.260> for

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
remember it is called cops driving for

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.749 
remember it is called cops driving for
10<00:01:13.830> 64-bit<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.420> gonna<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.689> fun<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.920> test

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
10 64-bit so it's gonna be fun to test

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
10 64-bit so it's gonna be fun to test
out<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.299> here<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.630> go<00:01:21.860> let's<00:01:22.860> see<00:01:23.100> which

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
out here here we go let's see which

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.480 
out here here we go let's see which
we're<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.600> faster

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:42.360 

it's<00:01:32.490> taking<00:01:32.790> some<00:01:32.970> time

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.920 

Samson<00:01:43.330> logo<00:01:43.810> Wow<00:01:44.320> galaxy<00:01:45.280> grand<00:01:45.460> prime<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:46.120> up

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
Samson logo Wow galaxy grand prime is up

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.550 
Samson logo Wow galaxy grand prime is up
and<00:01:47.500> running<00:01:48.040> just<00:01:48.810> gonna<00:01:49.810> quickly<00:01:49.990> enter<00:01:50.410> the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
and running just gonna quickly enter the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.320 
and running just gonna quickly enter the
passcode<00:01:50.830> here<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:53.530> mediatek<00:01:54.040> processor<00:01:54.330> is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
passcode here this mediatek processor is

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.450 
passcode here this mediatek processor is
slow<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:58.230> heard<00:01:59.230> a<00:01:59.380> little<00:01:59.530> vibration<00:02:00.190> I<00:02:00.280> think

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
slow I heard a little vibration I think

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.340 
slow I heard a little vibration I think
it's<00:02:00.580> gonna<00:02:00.700> be<00:02:00.940> on<00:02:01.210> in<00:02:01.810> any<00:02:01.960> minute

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
it's gonna be on in any minute

it's gonna be on in any minute
Wow<00:02:03.160> so<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.500> can<00:02:05.650> see<00:02:05.830> that<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.820> grande<00:02:07.060> prime

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
Wow so you can see that the grande prime

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.850 
Wow so you can see that the grande prime
is<00:02:07.660> faster<00:02:08.410> and<00:02:09.780> now<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.840> know<00:02:11.140> my<00:02:11.290> past<00:02:11.530> court

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
is faster and now you know my past court

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.640 
is faster and now you know my past court
but<00:02:12.100> anyways<00:02:12.520> I<00:02:12.640> will<00:02:12.790> change<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.690> but<00:02:14.260> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
but anyways I will change it but the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.340 
but anyways I will change it but the
galaxy<00:02:15.490> grand<00:02:15.640> prime<00:02:16.030> here<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.570> faster<00:02:17.140> and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
galaxy grand prime here is faster and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.870 
galaxy grand prime here is faster and
have<00:02:17.740> like<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.810> slightly<00:02:19.810> better<00:02:20.110> processor

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
have like a slightly better processor

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.950 
have like a slightly better processor
but<00:02:21.880> overall<00:02:22.270> you're<00:02:22.510> not<00:02:22.630> going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.840> notice

that<00:02:23.110> much<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.590> difference<00:02:23.710> in<00:02:24.010> terms<00:02:24.130> of

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
that much of a difference in terms of

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.220 
that much of a difference in terms of
performance<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.790> all<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.960> want<00:02:26.170> to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
performance and all that if you want to

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.970 
performance and all that if you want to
check<00:02:26.740> out<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> more<00:02:27.370> in-depth<00:02:27.970> video<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.830> can

check out a more in-depth video you can
find<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.340> my<00:02:30.370> channel<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:31.030> might<00:02:31.540> do<00:02:31.720> another

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
find it on my channel I might do another

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.640 
find it on my channel I might do another
speed<00:02:32.260> test

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
speed test

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.700 
speed test
I'll<00:02:33.010> cover<00:02:33.310> up<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.610> apps<00:02:33.820> so<00:02:34.510> yeah<00:02:35.140> that's<00:02:35.470> it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
I'll cover up the apps so yeah that's it
