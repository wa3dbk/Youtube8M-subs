00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
branch off in two different little areas

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.120 
branch off in two different little areas
like<00:05:42.520> in<00:05:42.700> Super<00:05:43.000> Mario<00:05:43.030> Brothers<00:05:43.420> 3<00:05:43.950> but<00:05:44.950> for

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
like in Super Mario Brothers 3 but for

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.800 
like in Super Mario Brothers 3 but for
the<00:05:45.220> most<00:05:45.370> part<00:05:45.520> it's<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.240> somewhat<00:05:46.570> fixed

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
the most part it's a somewhat fixed

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:54.690 
the most part it's a somewhat fixed
linear<00:05:47.260> progression
