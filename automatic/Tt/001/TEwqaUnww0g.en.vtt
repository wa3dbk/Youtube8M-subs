cancer<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.480> i<00:01:03.539> think<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.110> generally<00:01:04.739> a

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
cancer but i think it's it's generally a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.390 
cancer but i think it's it's generally a
cancer<00:01:06.299> awareness<00:01:06.630> thing<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.250> is

cancer awareness thing what I think is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.310 
cancer awareness thing what I think is
bullshit<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:10.880> charities<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.320> corporations

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
bullshit is charities and corporations

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.820 
bullshit is charities and corporations
like<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.650> NFL<00:01:16.369> profiteering<00:01:17.369> from<00:01:18.830> cancer

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
like the NFL profiteering from cancer

supposed to be for cancer research I
just<00:03:01.590> think<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:02.040> know<00:03:03.380> what<00:03:04.380> don't<00:03:04.620> don't

breast cancer awareness is people that

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.840 
breast cancer awareness is people that
misrepresent<00:03:33.520> it<00:03:33.700> as<00:03:34.650> being<00:03:35.650> akin<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:36.370> cancer

mean cancer research they are two very

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.160 
mean cancer research they are two very
different<00:03:42.070> things<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.970> just<00:03:43.810> because<00:03:44.140> you

to cancer to actual cancer research
doesn't<00:03:54.640> mean<00:03:55.090> that<00:03:55.480> you're<00:03:55.660> doing<00:03:55.930> cancer

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
doesn't mean that you're doing cancer

doesn't mean that you're doing cancer
research<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:57.040> don't<00:03:57.760> think<00:03:57.940> you<00:03:58.000> get<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.210> tout

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
research I don't think you get to tout

million dollars last year and we donated

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.830 
million dollars last year and we donated

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
treatment research that doesn't make you

a cancer researcher that just makes you

a cancer researcher that just makes you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
you know somebody who donated once kinda

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.270 
you know somebody who donated once kinda
to<00:04:13.200> get<00:04:14.200> an<00:04:14.410> actual<00:04:14.820> cure<00:04:15.820> finding<00:04:16.450> effort

cancer awareness is not a cure finding
effort<00:04:20.380> at<00:04:21.100> least<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:22.110> primary<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.530> know<00:04:23.620> on

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
effort at least a primary you know on

effort at least a primary you know on
the<00:04:23.950> first<00:04:24.220> order<00:04:26.850> just<00:04:27.850> be<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:27.970> think<00:04:28.180> people

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
the first order just be I think people

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.570 
the first order just be I think people
are<00:04:28.720> blur<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.350> line<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.800> little<00:04:30.010> bit<00:04:30.160> too<00:04:30.370> much

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
are blur that line a little bit too much

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.580 
are blur that line a little bit too much
and<00:04:31.240> I<00:04:31.630> think<00:04:31.840> they<00:04:31.930> should<00:04:32.110> be<00:04:32.200> a<00:04:32.230> little<00:04:32.440> bit

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
and I think they should be a little bit

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.280 
and I think they should be a little bit
more<00:04:32.740> clear<00:04:32.980> about<00:04:33.010> what<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.960> awareness<00:04:34.960> and

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
more clear about what is awareness and

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.590

come<00:05:10.930> from<00:05:11.169> this<00:05:11.259> it's<00:05:11.500> not<00:05:11.560> just<00:05:11.979> a<00:05:12.069> weight

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.599 
come from this it's not just a weight
loss<00:05:12.610> it's<00:05:12.909> not<00:05:13.030> just<00:05:13.240> about<00:05:13.330> weight<00:05:13.539> loss
