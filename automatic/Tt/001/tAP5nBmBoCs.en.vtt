00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.420 
like sunlight erosion and sort of the
fact<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:47.959> I've<00:02:48.140> been<00:02:48.170> using<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:48.950> long<00:02:49.160> and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
fact that I've been using it so long and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.780 
fact that I've been using it so long and
then<00:02:50.150> my<00:02:50.420> MacBook<00:02:51.019> which<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.650> just<00:02:51.950> yeah<00:02:52.760> I

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
then my MacBook which is just yeah I

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.410 
then my MacBook which is just yeah I
mean<00:02:54.280> you've<00:02:55.280> seen<00:02:55.489> several<00:02:55.760> several<00:02:56.209> games

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
mean you've seen several several games

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.559 
mean you've seen several several games
long<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:57.349> and<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:58.549> don't<00:02:58.819> think<00:02:59.150> I'll<00:02:59.480> be

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
long this and I don't think I'll be

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.539 
long this and I don't think I'll be
getting<00:02:59.690> an<00:02:59.900> upgrade<00:03:00.230> on<00:03:00.379> that<00:03:00.590> anytime<00:03:01.280> soon

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
getting an upgrade on that anytime soon

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.210 
getting an upgrade on that anytime soon
so<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.299> think<00:03:02.629> I<00:03:02.720> can<00:03:02.870> quickly<00:03:03.049> just<00:03:03.349> go<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.680> the

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
so I think I can quickly just go to the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.000 
so I think I can quickly just go to the
windows<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:07.360> here<00:03:08.360> I'll<00:03:08.480> just<00:03:08.739> restart<00:03:09.739> so

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
windows and here I'll just restart so

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.030 
windows and here I'll just restart so
now<00:03:10.129> I<00:03:10.160> set<00:03:10.549> it<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.150> whenever<00:03:11.989> I<00:03:12.140> restart

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
now I set it so that whenever I restart

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.620 
now I set it so that whenever I restart
I<00:03:13.400> am<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:15.650> goes<00:03:16.370> straight<00:03:16.610> into<00:03:16.910> Mac<00:03:17.239> because<00:03:17.600> I

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
I am it goes straight into Mac because I

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.110 
I am it goes straight into Mac because I
use<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.079> Mac<00:03:18.260> side<00:03:18.500> more<00:03:18.920> I<00:03:18.980> mean<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:19.549> even

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
mean I was at some fear that it wasn't

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.500 
mean I was at some fear that it wasn't
gonna<00:03:37.519> be<00:03:38.889> because<00:03:39.889> it<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.609> was<00:03:40.760> advertised<00:03:41.269> as

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
gonna be because it it was advertised as

Windows<00:03:44.239> Vista<00:03:44.540> Windows<00:03:44.840> XP<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:45.769> then<00:03:46.730> I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
Windows Vista Windows XP and then I

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.670 
Windows Vista Windows XP and then I
plugged<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:47.269> it<00:03:47.419> worked<00:03:47.599> fine<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.109> and

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680

plugged it in and it worked fine so and
the<00:03:49.549> real<00:03:49.760> like<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.269> selling<00:03:50.660> point<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.019> this

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
the real like the selling point of this

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.229 
the real like the selling point of this
is<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.500> its<00:03:51.799> mechanical<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:52.639> each<00:03:52.849> key<00:03:53.090> has<00:03:53.209> a

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
is that its mechanical so each key has a

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.990 
is that its mechanical so each key has a
spring<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.989> that<00:03:54.889> you<00:03:55.040> can<00:03:55.220> hit<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.639> entire

spring and that you can hit the entire

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.659 
spring and that you can hit the entire
keyboard<00:03:56.540> at<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.690> same<00:03:56.780> time<00:03:57.319> and<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:58.519> will

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
keyboard at the same time and it will

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.849 
keyboard at the same time and it will
like<00:03:59.359> press<00:03:59.780> all<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.079> keys<00:04:00.230> at<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.440> same<00:04:00.620> time

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
like press all the keys at the same time

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.589 
like press all the keys at the same time
