00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
of dough what w prepared this so what

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.580 
of dough what w prepared this so what
are<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.360> ingredients<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.960> I've<00:00:52.110> added<00:00:52.320> in

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
are the ingredients that I've added in

grams of corn flour and also bit of salt
so<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.930> need<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.500> mix<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.890> well<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.910> should

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
so you need to mix it well as it should

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.359 
so you need to mix it well as it should
be<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.660> soft<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.350> how<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> mix<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.129> for

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
be really soft like how you mix it for

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.600 
be really soft like how you mix it for
Puri<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.960> mix<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.590> make<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
Puri so you can mix that and make it and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.210 
Puri so you can mix that and make it and
make<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.299> like<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.439> we'll<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
make it like this and then we'll have to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.300 
make it like this and then we'll have to
go<00:01:11.460> ahead<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.820> prepare<00:01:12.479> muumuus<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.229> this

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.800 

ok<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.340> I'm<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> show<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.450> how<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
ok so I'm going to show you how to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.080 
ok so I'm going to show you how to
flatten<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.680> door<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
flatten this door this is one of the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.240 
flatten this door this is one of the
technique<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.930> use<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.619> most<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
technique that they use it in most of

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.450 
technique that they use it in most of
the<00:01:23.549> hotels<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.619> all<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.009> need<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the hotels so this all you need to do a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.730 
the hotels so this all you need to do a
what<00:01:26.820> I'm<00:01:27.000> basically<00:01:27.659> doing<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.530> I'm

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
what I'm basically doing here is I'm

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.670 
what I'm basically doing here is I'm
only<00:01:29.070> flattening<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.030> edge<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.229> dough

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
only flattening the edge of the dough

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.429 
only flattening the edge of the dough
because<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> center<00:01:33.150> has<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> bit<00:01:34.079> thick

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
because the center has to be a bit thick

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.100 
because the center has to be a bit thick
so<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.700> when<00:01:35.939> we<00:01:36.090> are<00:01:36.180> folding<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so you know when we are folding it it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:47.219 
so you know when we are folding it it
shouldn't<00:01:37.439> break<00:01:37.740> off

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.060 

okay<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:49.190> how<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.729> is<00:01:49.909> done<00:01:50.740> okay<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:51.770> you

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
okay so this how it is done okay so you

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.780 
okay so this how it is done okay so you
can<00:01:52.369> see<00:01:52.580> here<00:01:52.820> it's<00:01:53.150> a<00:01:53.450> bit<00:01:53.659> flat<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:54.409> and<00:01:55.159> at

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
can see here it's a bit flat so and at

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.540 
can see here it's a bit flat so and at
the<00:01:56.000> edges<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.659> in<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.350> center<00:01:57.770> it's<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.340> bit

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
the edges and in the center it's a bit

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.359 
the edges and in the center it's a bit
thick<00:01:59.450> so<00:01:59.720> that's<00:02:00.320> how<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.619> should<00:02:00.650> be<00:02:00.830> if

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
thick so that's how it should be if

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.460 
thick so that's how it should be if
you'd<00:02:01.610> like<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:02.000> can<00:02:02.150> make<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.600> like<00:02:03.170> how<00:02:03.409> you

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
you'd like you can make it like how you

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.469 
you'd like you can make it like how you
do<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.009> for<00:02:04.220> poori<00:02:04.460> also<00:02:04.940> you<00:02:05.030> can<00:02:05.240> do<00:02:05.390> it

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
do it for poori also you can do it

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.240 
do it for poori also you can do it
because<00:02:05.810> if<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.259> are<00:02:06.350> not<00:02:06.409> aware<00:02:06.860> of<00:02:06.920> this

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
because if you are not aware of this

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.279 
because if you are not aware of this

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
ahead and do that okay so as we flatten

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.690 
ahead and do that okay so as we flatten
the<00:02:17.780> dough<00:02:17.810> right<00:02:18.260> like<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.280> we're<00:02:19.550> going

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
the dough right like this so we're going

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.479 
the dough right like this so we're going
to<00:02:19.820> add<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.060> mixture<00:02:20.450> into<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:22.220> show<00:02:22.430> you

to add the mixture into it to show you

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.970 
to add the mixture into it to show you
you<00:02:23.090> can<00:02:23.239> add<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> border<00:02:23.720> tablespoon<00:02:24.650> that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.030 
know the most doesn't get stuck to the
and<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.579> cantina<00:03:25.569> so<00:03:26.200> I'm<00:03:26.349> gonna<00:03:26.560> arrange<00:03:26.889> the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.300 
movers in this case and we will have to
cook<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.579> homos<00:03:30.940> for<00:03:31.150> about<00:03:31.530> say<00:03:32.530> 10<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:32.950> 15

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.979 
cook the homos for about say 10 to 15
minutes<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.849> think<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.299> should<00:03:34.569> do

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
minutes I think I should do

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.599 
minutes I think I should do
by<00:03:35.170> then<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.500> Momo<00:03:35.680> should<00:03:35.799> be<00:03:36.129> cooked<00:03:36.370> well

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
by then the Momo should be cooked well

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:44.210 
by then the Momo should be cooked well
