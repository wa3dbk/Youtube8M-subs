00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.269
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.059
 sew a button 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.599
 so for kick in a button on off it 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.050
 lives since 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:26.039
 and we take the double thread we do 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.480
 our not surrounding around the thumb and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:35.130
 we say like that here after we take 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.379
 our aupic fabric always upside down 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.550
 to hide the knot we pass the button 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.550
 on the wire like a pearl 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.550
 then we put in the hole the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.750
 second round of the button we repeat 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.219
 operation 2 3 times more if the holes 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.219
 are very wide 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.750
 here is a button that is made for 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.090
 to pass in a buttonhole 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.140

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.440
 make it easier 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.870
 so we will pass our needle just 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.530
 behind the button without the past by the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.170
 button holes we will turn the wire or 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.450
 turn behind the button what will the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:30.210
 take off slightly from the fabric then a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:34.290
 once it's done we go into the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.760
 world in which we move the cables and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.740
 eight names the loop what will we do 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.270
