00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
headphones a lot I know that all

I<00:01:05.400> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.850> accepted<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.650> always

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
I kind of accepted that but I always

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.160 
I kind of accepted that but I always
wondered<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:09.120> headphones<00:01:09.540> could<00:01:09.870> sound

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170

wondered what my headphones could sound
like<00:01:10.290> Sennheiser<00:01:11.220> asked<00:01:11.700> me<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.150> design<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
like Sennheiser asked me to design a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.870 
like Sennheiser asked me to design a
headphone<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.410> that<00:01:13.800> fits<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.310> demands<00:01:14.730> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
headphone and that fits the demands of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.420 
headphone and that fits the demands of
our<00:01:15.090> best<00:01:15.390> models<00:01:15.870> I<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.620> so<00:01:16.770> excited<00:01:17.130> because

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
our best models I was so excited because

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.310 
our best models I was so excited because
obviously<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.510> needed<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.900> come<00:01:19.050> up<00:01:19.080> with

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
obviously we needed to come up with

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.290 
obviously we needed to come up with
something<00:01:19.560> completely<00:01:19.920> new<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.880> fit<00:01:21.120> the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
something completely new to fit the

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.510 
something completely new to fit the
demands<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.870> our<00:01:22.020> high-end<00:01:22.440> headphones<00:01:22.620> we

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
demands of our high-end headphones we

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.820 
demands of our high-end headphones we
had<00:01:23.730> this<00:01:23.880> idea<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.660> coming<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.440> with<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
had this idea of coming up with a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.370 
had this idea of coming up with a
completely<00:01:26.580> symmetrical<00:01:26.820> design<00:01:27.600> because

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
completely symmetrical design because

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
completely symmetrical design because
from<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> recording<00:01:29.310> studios<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:30.000> knew<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
from the recording studios we knew it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 
from the recording studios we knew it
would<00:01:30.600> give<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.930> perfect<00:01:31.170> sound<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:32.220> even

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
would give the perfect sound we even

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.520 
would give the perfect sound we even
went<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.790> far<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.390> make<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.930> symmetrical

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
went as far as to make one symmetrical

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.100 
went as far as to make one symmetrical
amplifier<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.280> drive<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.210> under<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.810> hood<00:01:36.840> now
