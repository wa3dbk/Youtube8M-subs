00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
your website now a sitemap is basically

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.620 
your website now a sitemap is basically
a<00:00:07.830> document<00:00:08.069> that<00:00:08.460> looks<00:00:08.610> just<00:00:08.970> like<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.420> and

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
a document that looks just like this and

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.830 
a document that looks just like this and
it's<00:00:10.290> used<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.280> allow<00:00:11.550> search<00:00:12.360> engines<00:00:12.389> to

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
it's used to allow search engines to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.770 
it's used to allow search engines to
better<00:00:13.549> find<00:00:14.549> your<00:00:14.759> content<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.509> your<00:00:15.570> website

frequently on search results and so

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.880 
frequently on search results and so
basically<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.599> file<00:00:27.810> layout<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.529> follows

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
basically the file layout is as follows

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.450 
basically the file layout is as follows
you<00:00:29.519> always<00:00:29.939> have<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.830> at<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.009> top<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.369> the

you always have this at the top of the
website<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.480> also<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.410> at<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
website and you also have this at the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.360 
website and you also have this at the
bottom<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> website<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.730> each<00:00:37.100> URL<00:00:38.100> on

bottom of the website and each URL on

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.700 
bottom of the website and each URL on
your<00:00:38.430> website<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> gonna<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.629> its<00:00:39.960> gonna<00:00:40.559> be

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
your website is gonna have its gonna be

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
contained within these tags right here

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.720 
contained within these tags right here

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.549 
so this is one entry for one website
this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> another<00:00:48.239> entry<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:49.020> another<00:00:49.260> site

still on your website and yet another
entry<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.539> basically<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.170> job<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.590> our<00:00:55.739> PHP

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
entry so basically this job of our PHP

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
entry so basically this job of our PHP
script<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:57.120> create<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.690> document<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
script is to create this document and

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.880 
script is to create this document and
dynamically<00:00:59.340> insert<00:01:00.120> these<00:01:00.390> entries<00:01:00.930> for<00:01:01.620> us

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
dynamically insert these entries for us

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.000 
dynamically insert these entries for us
and<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.120> by<00:01:04.010> transversing

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and we can do that by transversing

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.270 
and we can do that by transversing
through<00:01:05.250> our<00:01:05.460> entire<00:01:06.260> domain<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.560> finding

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
through our entire domain and finding

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.880 
through our entire domain and finding
every<00:01:08.549> file<00:01:08.820> ending<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.420> PHP<00:01:09.990> or<00:01:10.170> HTML

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
every file ending in PHP or HTML

every file ending in PHP or HTML
whichever<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.490> before<00:01:11.880> okay<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
whichever you before okay so for the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.899 
whichever you before okay so for the
actual<00:01:13.560> script<00:01:13.890> we're<00:01:14.159> gonna<00:01:14.310> begin<00:01:14.729> by

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
actual script we're gonna begin by

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.460 
actual script we're gonna begin by
defining<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:16.350> couple<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.070> HTML<00:01:18.030> tags<00:01:18.470> basically

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
defining a couple of HTML tags basically

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.649 
defining a couple of HTML tags basically
the<00:01:19.619> head<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.189> body<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.729> we're<00:01:21.540> gonna

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the head and the body and we're gonna

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.960 
the head and the body and we're gonna
and<00:01:22.020> create<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> form<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.100> time<00:01:23.310> okay<00:01:23.729> so

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and create a form at this time okay so

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.450 
and create a form at this time okay so
the<00:01:24.270> form<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.659> very<00:01:24.960> simple<00:01:25.470> basically<00:01:26.340> it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the form is very simple basically it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.060 
the form is very simple basically it
does<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.909> create<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.720> username<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> password

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
does this create a username and password

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.850 
does this create a username and password
form<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.970> upon<00:01:30.780> clicking<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> submit<00:01:31.710> button

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
form and upon clicking the submit button

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.510 
form and upon clicking the submit button
we're<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.210> submit<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:34.140> form<00:01:34.530> back<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
we're going to submit this form back to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.230 
we're going to submit this form back to
this<00:01:35.759> PHP<00:01:36.270> file<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.490> at<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.759> point<00:01:39.000> we'll

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
this PHP file and at that point we'll

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.789 
this PHP file and at that point we'll
start<00:01:39.630> creating<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:41.150> sitemap<00:01:42.409> okay<00:01:43.409> next<00:01:43.619> we

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
start creating the sitemap okay next we

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
start creating the sitemap okay next we
can<00:01:43.950> actually<00:01:44.100> begin<00:01:44.399> writing<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> script

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
can actually begin writing the script

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.109 
can actually begin writing the script
that's<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.140> generate<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.970> sitemap<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that's going to generate the sitemap and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.719 
that's going to generate the sitemap and
we'll<00:01:49.079> first<00:01:49.320> begin<00:01:49.680> by<00:01:49.710> defining<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.460> couple

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
we'll first begin by defining a couple

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.969 
we'll first begin by defining a couple
variables<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.299> we'll<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.630> needing<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
variables that we'll be needing the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.399 
variables that we'll be needing the
first<00:01:53.220> one<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.520> basically<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.240> complete<00:01:55.079> path

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
first one is basically the complete path

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.170 
first one is basically the complete path
to<00:01:55.740> your<00:01:56.570> web<00:01:57.570> servers<00:01:58.189> user<00:01:59.189> accounts<00:01:59.909> that's

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
to your web servers user accounts that's

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.179 
to your web servers user accounts that's
so<00:02:00.689> basically<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.259> directory<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:01.979> where

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
so basically the directory for where

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.319 
so basically the directory for where
your<00:02:02.700> site<00:02:03.570> lives<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.590> web<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:06.060> course

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
your site lives on the web and of course

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.930 
your site lives on the web and of course
you<00:02:06.630> also<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.350> your<00:02:07.560> domain<00:02:07.920> name<00:02:08.160> which

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
you also can have your domain name which

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.460 
you also can have your domain name which
is<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.330> these<00:02:09.569> are<00:02:09.629> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:09.989> combined

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
is all these are going to be combined

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.760 
is all these are going to be combined
together<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:11.160> form<00:02:11.940> one<00:02:12.420> long<00:02:12.690> string

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
together to form one long string

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.680 
together to form one long string
and<00:02:14.180> file<00:02:15.180> data<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.770> be

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
and file data this is going to be

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.170 
and file data this is going to be
basically<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.170> documents<00:02:19.860> okay<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.880> we're

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
basically the documents okay so we're

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.500 
basically the documents okay so we're
gonna<00:02:21.300> each<00:02:22.290> time<00:02:22.710> we<00:02:22.980> find<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.580> file<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.360> we

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
gonna each time we find a file that we

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.010 
gonna each time we find a file that we
want<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.960> insert<00:02:25.740> into<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.250> XML<00:02:27.180> document

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
want to insert into this XML document

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.770 
want to insert into this XML document
we're<00:02:28.200> going<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.950> basically<00:02:29.400> join<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.630> add

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
we're going to basically join it and add

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.750 
we're going to basically join it and add
it<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:30.990> this<00:02:31.350> string<00:02:31.710> right<00:02:31.740> here<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.310> more<00:02:32.640> on

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
it to this string right here and more on

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
it to this string right here and more on
this<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.210> bit<00:02:33.240> now<00:02:33.750> let's<00:02:34.350> create<00:02:34.530> a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
this in a bit now let's create a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.230 
this in a bit now let's create a
function<00:02:35.190> that's<00:02:35.340> going<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.940> be<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
function that's going to be the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.600 
function that's going to be the
workhorse<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.440> entire<00:02:37.770> script<00:02:38.160> what<00:02:38.490> it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
workhorse of this entire script what it

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.360 
workhorse of this entire script what it
does<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:39.000> takes<00:02:39.360> two<00:02:39.600> arguments<00:02:40.110> one<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.130> going

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
does is takes two arguments one is going

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.970 
does is takes two arguments one is going
to<00:02:41.490> be<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.150> path<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.720> describes<00:02:43.170> this

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
to be the path that describes this

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.160 
to be the path that describes this
entire<00:02:44.370> thing<00:02:44.670> or<00:02:44.970> here<00:02:45.300> plus<00:02:45.660> each

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
entire thing or here plus each

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.830 
entire thing or here plus each
individual<00:02:47.160> file<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.760> then<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.150> course<00:02:48.180> we

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
individual file and then of course we

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.680 
individual file and then of course we
can<00:02:48.990> have<00:02:49.230> file<00:02:49.740> name<00:02:50.460> itself<00:02:50.670> without<00:02:51.450> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
can have file name itself without the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.870 
can have file name itself without the
complete<00:02:52.500> path<00:02:52.830> right<00:02:53.130> here<00:02:53.370> it's<00:02:53.550> just<00:02:53.640> going

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
complete path right here it's just going

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.210 
complete path right here it's just going
to<00:02:53.940> be<00:02:54.090> like<00:02:54.270> example<00:02:54.780> indexed<00:02:55.470> up<00:02:55.590> huge<00:02:55.860> world

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
and at the same time we're going to make

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.210 
and at the same time we're going to make
these<00:03:06.330> same<00:03:06.720> variables<00:03:07.230> over<00:03:07.440> here<00:03:07.500> Global's

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
these same variables over here Global's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.950 
these same variables over here Global's
so<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.550> can<00:03:08.700> reference<00:03:08.910> them<00:03:09.330> inside<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.750> this

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
so we can reference them inside of this

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.140 
so we can reference them inside of this
function<00:03:10.440> because<00:03:10.770> anytime<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.760> enter<00:03:11.970> a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
function because anytime you enter a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.650 
function because anytime you enter a
function<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.290> define<00:03:13.650> another<00:03:14.070> variable

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
function and define another variable

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.780 
function and define another variable
even<00:03:15.660> though<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.050> has<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.410> same<00:03:16.560> name<00:03:16.980> as<00:03:17.280> over

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
even though it has the same name as over

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.790 
even though it has the same name as over
here<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.390> will<00:03:18.570> not<00:03:18.750> point<00:03:18.990> to<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.290> same<00:03:19.500> data

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
here it will not point to the same data

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.070 
here it will not point to the same data
so<00:03:20.220> we'll<00:03:20.490> just<00:03:20.700> make<00:03:21.000> these<00:03:21.180> global<00:03:21.930> because

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
so we'll just make these global because

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.750 
so we'll just make these global because
the<00:03:22.320> script<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.709> going<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.100> walk<00:03:23.340> through<00:03:23.610> your

every single file on your web domain
there<00:03:28.770> are<00:03:28.860> some<00:03:29.040> files<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.700> want<00:03:29.880> to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
there are some files so you want to

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.750 
case may be I'm only interested in PHP
files<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.440> therefore<00:03:40.830> I'm<00:03:41.040> going<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.520> search

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
files so therefore I'm going to search

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.360 
files so therefore I'm going to search
for<00:03:41.790> only<00:03:42.390> PHP<00:03:42.870> files<00:03:43.140> with<00:03:43.650> respect<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.250> this

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
for only PHP files with respect to this

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.590 
for only PHP files with respect to this
pattern<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.290> here<00:03:46.890> if<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:47.400> find<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:48.060> path

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.560 
comes in we check to see if this new
path<00:06:01.860> information<00:06:02.520> here<00:06:02.760> I've<00:06:02.940> indicated

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
path information here I've indicated

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.650 
path information here I've indicated
here<00:06:03.840> we<00:06:04.229> check<00:06:04.440> to<00:06:04.560> see<00:06:04.590> if<00:06:04.740> it's<00:06:05.310> a<00:06:05.669> directory

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
here we check to see if it's a directory

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.690 
here we check to see if it's a directory
itself<00:06:06.960> and<00:06:07.289> if<00:06:07.650> it<00:06:07.800> is<00:06:07.919> it<00:06:08.070> director<00:06:08.370> itself

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
itself and if it is it director itself

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.940 
itself and if it is it director itself
we're<00:06:08.940> gonna<00:06:09.060> repeat<00:06:09.930> calling<00:06:10.380> this<00:06:10.500> function

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
we're gonna repeat calling this function

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.620 
we're gonna repeat calling this function
and<00:06:11.070> it<00:06:11.310> does<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.550> same<00:06:11.729> thing<00:06:11.789> over<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:12.539> over

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
and it does the same thing over and over

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.810 
and it does the same thing over and over
again<00:06:12.870> and<00:06:13.320> that's<00:06:13.530> it<00:06:13.740> for<00:06:13.919> the<00:06:14.010> function<00:06:14.490> the

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
again and that's it for the function the

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.629 
again and that's it for the function the
last<00:06:15.060> bit<00:06:15.630> of<00:06:15.750> code<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:16.320> do<00:06:16.770> is<00:06:17.070> to<00:06:17.490> actually

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
last bit of code to do is to actually

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.300 
last bit of code to do is to actually
process<00:06:18.210> this<00:06:18.630> documents<00:06:19.320> we<00:06:19.800> begin<00:06:20.160> by

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
process this documents we begin by

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.120 
process this documents we begin by
making<00:06:20.520> sure<00:06:20.700> first<00:06:21.300> firstly<00:06:22.169> that<00:06:22.440> the<00:06:22.889> user

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
making sure first firstly that the user

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.040 
making sure first firstly that the user
actually<00:06:23.430> this<00:06:23.820> submit<00:06:24.210> this<00:06:24.450> submit<00:06:24.900> the

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
actually this submit this submit the

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.500 
actually this submit this submit the
form<00:06:25.349> to<00:06:25.620> the<00:06:26.340> script<00:06:26.639> and<00:06:26.910> we<00:06:27.090> do<00:06:27.210> that<00:06:27.360> by

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
form to the script and we do that by

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.140 
form to the script and we do that by
checking<00:06:27.840> to<00:06:28.110> see<00:06:28.289> if<00:06:28.320> the<00:06:29.039> create<00:06:29.460> map<00:06:29.700> which

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
checking to see if the create map which

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.050 
checking to see if the create map which
is<00:06:30.330> equal<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.800> submit<00:06:32.250> button<00:06:32.430> whose<00:06:32.789> name

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
is equal to the submit button whose name

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.300 
is equal to the submit button whose name
we<00:06:33.330> check<00:06:33.570> to<00:06:33.660> see<00:06:33.690> if<00:06:34.020> it's<00:06:34.229> defined<00:06:34.620> or<00:06:34.919> set

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
we check to see if it's defined or set

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.770 
we check to see if it's defined or set
and<00:06:35.550> if<00:06:35.640> it<00:06:35.760> is<00:06:35.909> we<00:06:36.120> go<00:06:36.330> ahead<00:06:36.360> and<00:06:36.539> continue

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
and if it is we go ahead and continue

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.469 
and if it is we go ahead and continue
with<00:06:37.080> our<00:06:37.260> execution<00:06:37.800> next<00:06:38.580> we<00:06:38.669> want<00:06:38.909> to<00:06:39.150> make

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
with our execution next we want to make

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:40.610 
with our execution next we want to make
sure<00:06:39.510> that<00:06:40.020> only

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
sure that only

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.100 
sure that only
the<00:06:40.680> administrative<00:06:41.639> users<00:06:42.090> can<00:06:42.510> create<00:06:42.960> a

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
the administrative users can create a

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.740 
the administrative users can create a
sitemap<00:06:43.440> from<00:06:43.949> your<00:06:44.130> website<00:06:44.360> and<00:06:45.360> we<00:06:45.479> do<00:06:45.600> that

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
sitemap from your website and we do that

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.510 
sitemap from your website and we do that
by<00:06:45.840> checking<00:06:46.020> passwords<00:06:46.650> and<00:06:46.949> of<00:06:47.040> course<00:06:47.310> you

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
by checking passwords and of course you

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.070 
by checking passwords and of course you
wanna<00:06:47.669> set<00:06:47.910> these<00:06:48.120> appropriately<00:06:48.720> to

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
wanna set these appropriately to

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.680 
wanna set these appropriately to
whatever<00:06:49.260> your<00:06:49.949> password<00:06:50.430> actually<00:06:51.210> is<00:06:51.360> and

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
whatever your password actually is and

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.050 
whatever your password actually is and
if<00:06:52.440> the<00:06:52.560> password<00:06:53.010> is<00:06:53.190> correct<00:06:53.430> we<00:06:53.760> go<00:06:53.910> ahead

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
if the password is correct we go ahead

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.670 
if the password is correct we go ahead
and<00:06:54.449> call<00:06:54.810> our<00:06:55.229> function<00:06:55.669> to<00:06:56.930> start<00:06:57.930> tracing

at the end of course we have to add this

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.640 
at the end of course we have to add this
tidbit<00:07:14.130> as<00:07:14.550> we<00:07:14.789> see<00:07:14.970> here<00:07:15.210> and<00:07:15.389> the<00:07:15.990> only<00:07:16.199> thing

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
tidbit as we see here and the only thing

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.409 
tidbit as we see here and the only thing
left<00:07:16.860> is<00:07:17.100> to<00:07:17.130> write<00:07:17.490> it<00:07:17.639> to<00:07:17.729> a<00:07:17.789> file<00:07:18.060> and<00:07:18.360> then

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 
left is to write it to a file and then

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.450 
left is to write it to a file and then
close<00:07:18.840> the<00:07:19.020> file<00:07:19.229> and<00:07:19.500> that's<00:07:19.680> all<00:07:20.070> there<00:07:20.430> is

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
close the file and that's all there is

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.060 
close the file and that's all there is
to<00:07:20.729> writing<00:07:20.940> a<00:07:21.300> sitemap<00:07:21.930> generator<00:07:22.530> from<00:07:22.889> this

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.070 
to writing a sitemap generator from this

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.590 
to writing a sitemap generator from this
point<00:07:23.280> what<00:07:23.460> you<00:07:23.550> can<00:07:23.669> do<00:07:23.820> with<00:07:24.000> the<00:07:24.150> sitemap
