and I think it was going to win this
fight<00:01:40.550> he's<00:01:41.180> got<00:01:41.480> to<00:01:41.660> use<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:41.930> he's<00:01:42.230> got<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.530> be

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
fight he's got to use it he's got to be

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.790

very quick with his punches land and get

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.560 
very quick with his punches land and get
out<00:01:46.010> I<00:01:46.220> think<00:01:46.490> if<00:01:46.550> he<00:01:46.640> stands<00:01:46.970> toe-to-toe<00:01:47.300> with

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
out I think if he stands toe-to-toe with

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.050 
out I think if he stands toe-to-toe with
Miguel<00:01:48.020> Cotto<00:01:48.230> it's<00:01:48.500> a<00:01:48.620> mistake<00:01:48.980> still<00:01:49.460> back
