00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
kind of gives a jet fighter look which

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.979 
kind of gives a jet fighter look which
looks<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.760> little<00:00:35.850> more<00:00:36.030> realistic<00:00:36.420> than<00:00:36.750> some

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
looks a little more realistic than some

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.770 
looks a little more realistic than some
core<00:00:37.170> fighters<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:42.059> give<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.390> core

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
core fighters and they give you a core

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.270 
core fighters and they give you a core
block<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.410> well<00:00:43.829> which<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.000> did<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:45.300> build<00:00:45.539> I

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
block as well which I did not build I

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
block as well which I did not build I
only<00:00:47.280> did<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> core<00:00:47.670> fighter<00:00:47.910> I'll<00:00:48.149> talk

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
only did the core fighter I'll talk

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.709 
only did the core fighter I'll talk
about<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.660> line<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> little<00:00:49.200> bit<00:00:50.420> you<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
about that line a little bit you have to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.970 
about that line a little bit you have to
separate<00:00:52.079> into<00:00:52.230> two<00:00:52.500> parts<00:00:52.800> when<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
separate into two parts when you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
separate into two parts when you
transform<00:00:53.460> me<00:00:53.640> take<00:00:53.879> out<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> back<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.600> move

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
transform me take out the back and move

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.500 
transform me take out the back and move
the<00:00:54.989> engines<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:57.000> bend<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> front

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the engines up and you bend the front

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.000 
the engines up and you bend the front
half<00:00:57.690> around<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.320> becomes<00:00:58.620> part<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
half around that becomes part of the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.389 
half around that becomes part of the
chest<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.500> transformation<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> back

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
chest and the transformation the back

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.660 
chest and the transformation the back
half<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:03.030> tricky<00:01:04.460> front<00:01:05.460> half

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670
