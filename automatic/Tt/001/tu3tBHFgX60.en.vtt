TV or have an overlap with games what if
I<00:00:22.600> haven't<00:00:22.900> seen<00:00:23.590> any<00:00:23.740> of<00:00:23.830> their<00:00:23.920> names<00:00:24.039> on<00:00:24.279> it

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.779 
I haven't seen any of their names on it
but<00:00:24.550> Carla<00:00:24.880> I<00:00:25.300> think<00:00:26.170> statistically<00:00:26.830> that's

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
but Carla I think statistically that's

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.320 
but Carla I think statistically that's
what<00:00:28.210> sticks<00:00:28.510> out<00:00:28.660> as<00:00:29.189> an<00:00:30.189> offense<00:00:30.550> they<00:00:30.760> you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
what sticks out as an offense they you

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.460 
what sticks out as an offense they you
know<00:00:31.359> they<00:00:31.480> got<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.810> number<00:00:32.019> one<00:00:32.199> scoring

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
know they got the number one scoring

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.830 
know they got the number one scoring
defense<00:00:32.710> on<00:00:33.129> number<00:00:33.910> one<00:00:34.030> in<00:00:34.120> 50<00:00:34.540> fights<00:00:34.660> in

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
defense on number one in 50 fights in

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.660 
defense on number one in 50 fights in
the<00:00:34.930> country<00:00:35.229> so<00:00:35.260> that's<00:00:35.620> that's<00:00:36.250> powerful

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
the country so that's that's powerful

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.299 
the country so that's that's powerful
stuff<00:00:36.820> and<00:00:37.809> they<00:00:37.900> have<00:00:38.080> that<00:00:38.260> those<00:00:39.010> under

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
stuff and they have that those under

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:40.979 
stuff and they have that those under
there<00:00:39.460> they<00:00:40.180> had<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:40.449> notch<00:00:40.629> on<00:00:40.839> their<00:00:40.930> belt

there they had that notch on their belt

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.439 
there they had that notch on their belt
because<00:00:41.920> of<00:00:42.250> you<00:00:42.489> know<00:00:42.580> what<00:00:43.000> they've<00:00:43.150> done<00:00:43.299> on

because of you know what they've done on
the<00:00:43.540> field<00:00:43.769> that<00:00:44.769> doesn't<00:00:45.129> lie<00:00:45.250> so<00:00:45.519> we're

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
the field that doesn't lie so we're

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:47.399 
the field that doesn't lie so we're
gonna<00:00:46.210> have<00:00:46.390> our<00:00:46.479> hands<00:00:46.629> feel<00:00:46.839> ready<00:00:47.080> keep<00:00:47.290> you

I coaches do a good job with you know
scheduling<00:00:53.920> practices<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:54.549> everything<00:00:54.790> that

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
scheduling practices and everything that

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.140 
scheduling practices and everything that
it's<00:00:55.269> a<00:00:55.360> gradual<00:00:55.750> build-up<00:00:56.110> be<00:00:56.290> number<00:00:56.500> no

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
it's a gradual build-up be number no

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.430 
it's a gradual build-up be number no
we're<00:00:58.150> not<00:00:58.239> practicing<00:00:58.629> as<00:00:58.989> much<00:00:59.170> right<00:00:59.379> now

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
we're not practicing as much right now

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.649 
we're not practicing as much right now
but<00:00:59.589> it's<00:00:59.890> good<00:01:00.070> was<00:01:00.190> usually<00:01:00.549> be<00:01:00.670> peaking<00:01:01.570> at

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
but it's good was usually be peaking at

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.100 
but it's good was usually be peaking at
the<00:01:01.690> right<00:01:01.809> time<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.879> Washington

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
the right time and Washington

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.610 
the right time and Washington
competing<00:01:05.860> accordingly<00:01:06.310> so<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:08.350> we<00:01:08.530> know

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
competing accordingly so what we know

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.310 
competing accordingly so what we know
it's<00:01:08.770> it's<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.220> gradual<00:01:09.580> build-up<00:01:09.910> and<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.480> don't

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
it's it's a gradual build-up and I don't

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.800 
it's it's a gradual build-up and I don't
think<00:01:11.500> there's<00:01:11.710> any<00:01:11.860> there<00:01:12.700> shouldn't<00:01:13.060> be<00:01:13.090> any

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
think there's any there shouldn't be any

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.310 
think there's any there shouldn't be any
extra<00:01:14.530> motivation<00:01:14.980> or<00:01:15.430> anything<00:01:16.060> talks<00:01:16.990> games

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
extra motivation or anything talks games

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.250 
extra motivation or anything talks games
I<00:01:17.470> mean<00:01:17.650> it's<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:19.600> should<00:01:19.810> speak<00:01:20.020> loudly

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
I mean it's that should speak loudly

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.219 
I mean it's that should speak loudly
enough<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:21.310> every<00:01:21.640> song<00:01:21.820> precious<00:01:22.240> time<00:01:22.510> how

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
enough to every song precious time how

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.520 
enough to every song precious time how
accurate<00:01:23.440> he<00:01:23.860> is<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.960> way<00:01:25.990> he<00:01:26.260> approached

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
accurate he is and the way he approached

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.160 
accurate he is and the way he approached
eclipse<00:01:26.920> is<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.340> place<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.580> go<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:29.140> I

back<00:01:32.260> in<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.500> country<00:01:32.680> because<00:01:33.520> we<00:01:33.760> all<00:01:33.880> look

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060
