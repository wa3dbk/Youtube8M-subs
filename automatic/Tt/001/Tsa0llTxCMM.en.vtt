00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
filmed us in the back in Vegas and then

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.190 
filmed us in the back in Vegas and then

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.660 
they're projecting that onto the screen
and<00:01:14.229> then<00:01:14.530> we're<00:01:14.710> going<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.340> be<00:01:15.490> live

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
and then we're going to be live

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.890 
and then we're going to be live
performers<00:01:16.180> with<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.899> projections

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.960 

they're<00:01:21.500> always<00:01:22.160> gonna<00:01:22.430> be<00:01:22.550> doing<00:01:22.730> the<00:01:22.790> same

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
they're always gonna be doing the same

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.010 
they're always gonna be doing the same
thing<00:01:23.150> because<00:01:23.210> it's<00:01:23.420> already<00:01:23.630> been<00:01:23.750> filmed

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
thing because it's already been filmed

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.230 
thing because it's already been filmed
so<00:01:24.620> it's<00:01:24.770> just<00:01:25.010> us<00:01:25.400> two<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:25.880> we<00:01:25.970> have<00:01:26.090> to

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
so it's just us two that we have to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.930 
so it's just us two that we have to
worry<00:01:27.110> about<00:01:27.170> and<00:01:27.590> concentrate<00:01:28.160> on<00:01:30.940> which

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
worry about and concentrate on which

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.400

attention on other challenges like the
performance<00:01:35.780> space<00:01:36.050> itself<00:01:36.680> it's<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.310> brick

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
performance space itself it's a brick

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
angle not straight up and down it took a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.370 
angle not straight up and down it took a
while<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.270> get<00:01:47.450> used<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:47.840> but<00:01:48.110> we've<00:01:48.260> been

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
while to get used to it but we've been

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.560 
while to get used to it but we've been
training<00:01:48.680> on<00:01:49.010> the<00:01:49.670> wall<00:01:49.880> at<00:01:50.030> home<00:01:50.060> on<00:01:50.540> a

vertical for the last almost six months

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.470 
vertical for the last almost six months
now<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:53.780> we<00:01:53.960> got<00:01:54.140> used<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:58.060> one<00:01:59.060> thing<00:01:59.300> they

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
now so we got used to it one thing they

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.320 
now so we got used to it one thing they
weren't<00:01:59.810> prepared<00:02:00.110> for<00:02:00.410> was<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.280> height<00:02:01.490> the
