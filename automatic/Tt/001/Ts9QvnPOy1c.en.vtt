00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
that great as you probably would have

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.940 
that great as you probably would have
expected<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.570> speaker<00:00:48.840> actually<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.469> right

here<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.570> actually<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.379> all

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
here and I'm actually not really all

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.170 
here and I'm actually not really all
that<00:00:52.980> fond<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.030> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
that fond of it because it's kind of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479 
that fond of it because it's kind of
easy<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> cover<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.930> as<00:00:55.920> far<00:00:56.160> as<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> speed

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
easy to cover up as far as the speed

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.610 
easy to cover up as far as the speed
goes<00:00:56.520> though<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.059> got<00:00:57.239> decent<00:00:57.570> volume<00:00:58.079> if

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
goes though it's got decent volume if

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.290 
goes though it's got decent volume if
