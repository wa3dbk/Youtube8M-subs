00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.100 
drink you lovely women out there you go
through<00:01:53.520> potassium<00:01:54.119> twice<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.509> fast<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.930> men

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
through potassium twice as fast as men

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.840 
through potassium twice as fast as men
do<00:01:55.320> that's<00:01:55.770> why<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> use<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> little

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
do that's why we like to use a little

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.999 
do that's why we like to use a little
bit<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.060> banana<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> banana<00:01:58.799> in

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
bit of banana so we put the banana in

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.499 
bit of banana so we put the banana in
there<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> give<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.820> your<00:02:00.000> source<00:02:00.270> of

there and give you your source of
potassium<00:02:01.250> now<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.969> point<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.659> were

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
potassium now at this point if I were

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.929 
potassium now at this point if I were
just<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.170> blend<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.860> whole<00:02:05.399> juice<00:02:05.700> it

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
just to blend this in whole juice it

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.910
