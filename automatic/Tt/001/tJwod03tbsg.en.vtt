00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
this case you still have the maybe

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
this case you still have the maybe
that's<00:04:26.820> because<00:04:26.940> that's<00:04:27.270> where<00:04:27.450> the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
that's because that's where the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.790 
that's because that's where the
microphone<00:04:28.110> is<00:04:28.140> and<00:04:28.650> see<00:04:30.080> hard<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.200> say<00:04:31.410> looks

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
microphone is and see hard to say looks

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.260 
microphone is and see hard to say looks
like<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:32.070> might<00:04:32.220> be<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.370> mic<00:04:32.700> hole<00:04:32.970> right

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
like that might be the mic hole right

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.000 
like that might be the mic hole right
there<00:04:33.510> but<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.840> can<00:04:33.990> still<00:04:34.230> see<00:04:34.410> some<00:04:34.440> of<00:04:34.919> the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
there but you can still see some of the

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.630

headphone jack has a stand on it let's

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.640 
headphone jack has a stand on it let's
check<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:24.010> out<00:05:28.050> that's<00:05:29.050> another<00:05:29.290> reason<00:05:29.470> I

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
check that out that's another reason I

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.590 
check that out that's another reason I
picked<00:05:29.860> this<00:05:29.980> does<00:05:30.280> this<00:05:30.730> case<00:05:30.940> design

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
picked this does this case design

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.300 
picked this does this case design
because<00:05:32.020> it<00:05:32.250> my<00:05:33.250> other<00:05:33.460> phone<00:05:34.920> had<00:05:35.920> the<00:05:36.070> same

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
because it my other phone had the same

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.950 
because it my other phone had the same
sort<00:05:36.850> of<00:05:36.910> stand<00:05:37.180> right<00:05:37.420> there

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
this one had a more wavy design this

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.240 
this one had a more wavy design this
case<00:05:45.790> is<00:05:46.000> nicer<00:05:46.420> for<00:05:47.260> me<00:05:47.380> anyways<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:48.070> has<00:05:48.220> a

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
has a nice stand I'm not a really big

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.780

fan<00:05:58.930> of<00:05:58.960> the<00:05:59.230> vertical<00:05:59.650> stands<00:06:02.430> never<00:06:03.430> I<00:06:03.730> mean

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
fan of the vertical stands never I mean

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.430 
fan of the vertical stands never I mean
but<00:06:04.060> it's<00:06:04.210> good<00:06:04.390> if<00:06:04.540> you<00:06:04.570> use<00:06:04.690> it<00:06:04.990> as<00:06:05.110> like<00:06:05.320> an

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
but it's good if you use it as like an

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.830 
but it's good if you use it as like an
alarm<00:06:05.680> clock<00:06:05.740> at<00:06:06.070> night<00:06:06.220> which<00:06:06.610> I<00:06:06.970> use<00:06:07.660> this

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
alarm clock at night which I use this

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.440 
alarm clock at night which I use this
one<00:06:07.990> as<00:06:08.310> these<00:06:09.310> stands<00:06:09.640> are<00:06:09.790> not<00:06:09.940> just<00:06:10.210> for

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
one as these stands are not just for

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.090 
one as these stands are not just for
Verta<00:06:10.720> mean<00:06:11.080> they<00:06:11.500> look<00:06:11.740> like<00:06:11.890> they're

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
Verta mean they look like they're

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.050 
Verta mean they look like they're
vertical<00:06:12.520> only<00:06:13.170> but<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:15.610> other<00:06:15.760> thing<00:06:15.970> you

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
vertical only but the other thing you

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.030 
vertical only but the other thing you
can<00:06:16.180> do<00:06:17.160> is<00:06:18.160> laying<00:06:19.090> like<00:06:19.240> this<00:06:19.270> and<00:06:20.040> that's

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
can do is laying like this and that's

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.820 
can do is laying like this and that's
how<00:06:21.190> you<00:06:21.280> can<00:06:21.580> use<00:06:21.610> it<00:06:21.940> as<00:06:22.120> a<00:06:22.980> alarm<00:06:23.980> clock

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
how you can use it as a alarm clock

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.080 
how you can use it as a alarm clock
let's<00:06:26.830> see<00:06:27.070> if<00:06:27.160> we<00:06:27.280> can<00:06:27.460> do<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.700> same<00:06:27.850> thing

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
let's see if we can do the same thing

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.070 
let's see if we can do the same thing
with<00:06:28.270> this<00:06:28.420> one<00:06:28.660> I'm<00:06:28.840> sure<00:06:29.080> you<00:06:29.230> can<00:06:30.840> this<00:06:31.840> is<00:06:32.050> a

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
with this one I'm sure you can this is a

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.000 
with this one I'm sure you can this is a
new<00:06:32.560> one<00:06:32.710> there<00:06:32.950> so<00:06:33.190> it's<00:06:33.310> harder<00:06:34.620> you<00:06:35.620> can<00:06:35.710> see

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
new one there so it's harder you can see

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.470 
new one there so it's harder you can see
you<00:06:36.160> can<00:06:36.370> stand<00:06:36.670> this<00:06:36.790> up<00:06:37.030> vert<00:06:37.300> or

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
you can stand this up vert or

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.620 
you can stand this up vert or
horizontally<00:06:38.380> as<00:06:38.500> well<00:06:38.530> horizontal

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
horizontally as well horizontal

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.580 
horizontally as well horizontal
horizontal<00:06:40.630> so<00:06:41.260> that<00:06:41.290> works<00:06:41.620> out<00:06:41.800> pretty<00:06:42.070> good

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
horizontal so that works out pretty good

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.990 
horizontal so that works out pretty good
still<00:06:44.590> have<00:06:44.710> clear<00:06:44.950> access<00:06:45.310> to<00:06:45.370> the<00:06:45.580> camera

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
still have clear access to the camera

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.080 
still have clear access to the camera
less<00:06:46.920> much<00:06:47.920> less<00:06:47.950> afraid<00:06:48.400> of<00:06:48.490> my<00:06:48.730> breaking

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
less much less afraid of my breaking

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.740 
less much less afraid of my breaking
this<00:06:49.240> thing<00:06:49.450> now<00:06:49.650> they're<00:06:50.650> in<00:06:50.830> set<00:06:51.420> so<00:06:52.420> if<00:06:52.630> you

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
this thing now they're in set so if you

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.320 
this thing now they're in set so if you
drop<00:06:53.110> it<00:06:53.320> facedown<00:06:53.640> you<00:06:54.640> got<00:06:54.790> to<00:06:54.910> have<00:06:55.030> a<00:06:55.060> rock
