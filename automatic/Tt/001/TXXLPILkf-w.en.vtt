00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.700
 bye 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.840
 to begin we will start to separate 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.210
 the hair of what I'm going to do is with a 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.040
 vanilla I'm going to do a hairstyle on the side 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.830
 on the side that you prefer skin that 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.840
 it is easier for them to specify 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.060
 first to separate it well and then I'll 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.130
 measure four fingers on the part of the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.830
 Pedrosa crown of the forehead towards 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.050
 back and I will also separate that part 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.150
 that comes to be like a diadem 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.510
 rest of the hair I'm going to take it in a 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.820
 pigtail and I'll start making a post 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.670
 a bow in the back picking up 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.530
 all the hair combing it and then what 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.680
 I'm going to roll it up and I'm going to take it 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.210
 one side to make a mummy you 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.760
 they can make a more elaborate bow 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.310
 less elaborate as you like mine 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.990
 is more or less disheveled because it makes 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.270
 little bit I cut my hair in some 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.979
 layers and well there are some crimes that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.959
 they are going out there but to me 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.209
 like it personally I like it to be 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.100
 see more disorganized this kind of 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.720
 hairstyles because I use it up to go 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.150
 to make market the truth 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.980
 I confess I'm going like this because I want 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.940
 see me a little more arranged with the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.580
 hair or this stylized and now we are going 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.520
 to start braiding and let's make a 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.620
 Tang braid in this part of the hair 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.500
 so let's first take a lock 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.570
 and that strand we are going to divide it into two and 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.570
 now from the outer corner we are going to 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.180
 pass over that same lock and 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.370
 then we will take it to join it with 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.540
 the other one is going to do the same thing 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.460
 from the other side 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.560
 we take from the external corner what we had 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.709
 above and then we went through 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.300
 under the other better and now after 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.570
 do this first now yes I'm going to 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.610
 start picking hair from the one that is left 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.650
 underneath not only the lock that 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.990
 we separate then I start to take the 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.270
 hair that is below the two 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.790
 million hair that is loose 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.459
 then cobos of the es of the corners and 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.320
 he passed it over first of the much that 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.990
 it is immediately next and then 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.450
 below and so I'm going to do it 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.410
 little by little I will go doing then 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.960
 the braid 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.600
 then take from the outer corner of 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.660
 of the tuft and he passed it over and 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.730
 then I pass it below on top and 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.950
 underneath they can go together with the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.830
 hairs with the hair they have in the 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.560
 immediate tuft and so little by little what 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.710
 they are doing as soon as the hair that 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.260
 it is loose then you can start 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:46.200
 to make a normal tang braid that is 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.020
 divided into the two million is taken from 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.540
 the corner of one of the locks is 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.330
 they pass over and then go through 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.170
 underneath and so they are doing all the braid 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.240
 until they already take all the hair they go 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.610
 doing they have to do it from almost everything 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.190
 the hair so that it turns them in the 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.640
 back of the pickup that we made 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.640
 before 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.129
 Y 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.590
 his already curly hairs can do it 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.169
 with straight hair and it will stay like that 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.900
 like me but they have it smooth like me 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.610
 I have it and they want more volume remember 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.650
 I know what waves can be made 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.630
 before and now what I'm doing is 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.669
 taking a tuft of hair and I'll 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.830
 talk up the rest of the hair 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.020
 this is going to make it give more volume 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.990
 then I start to pull the braid 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.389
 up giving it more volume 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.750
 this step is super easy and it is essential 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.639
 so that the braid looks more disheveled 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.729
 and it looks more bulky because it does not 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.110
 we want a hairstyle so polished on 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.910
 all this kind of hairstyles and the 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.039
 trend that there is now that is more 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.889
 disorganized and after doing this 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.470
 I will then pass it over the 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.750
 bow that we made before and I'm going to 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.150
 start fastening with bobby pins the 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.530
 beats are essential in the house of 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.020
 Any toy in my house are 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.849
 exaggerated by any place where one 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.889
 look there bowling because all the time 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.990
 I'm doing this kind of hairstyles 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.950
 then I will start to hold it 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.930
 around 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.990
 until I call that of all those 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.720
 crimes and everything well put in place 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.360
 until it remains happy and this is 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.700
 then our final hairstyle counts in 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.590
 less in the comments below if you 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.630

 bye
