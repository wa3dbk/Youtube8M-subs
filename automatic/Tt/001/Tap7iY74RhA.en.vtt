00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.020 
dungeons like Diablo of like they
they're<00:03:38.440> different<00:03:39.310> every<00:03:39.489> time<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.000> can

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
they're different every time so you can

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.300 
they're different every time so you can
play<00:03:40.299> something<00:03:40.810> over<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.500> over<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:42.099> you'll

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
play something over and over and you'll

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.710 
play something over and over and you'll
get<00:03:42.430> different<00:03:42.610> dungeon<00:03:43.060> layouts<00:03:43.180> every<00:03:43.569> time

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
get different dungeon layouts every time

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.930 
get different dungeon layouts every time
yeah<00:03:44.019> apparently<00:03:44.829> you<00:03:45.069> can<00:03:45.160> play<00:03:45.310> co-op<00:03:45.549> too

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.729 
yeah apparently you can play co-op too
if<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.360> look<00:03:46.510> at<00:03:46.599> the<00:03:46.630> trailer<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.560> play

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
if you look at the trailer you play

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.220 
if you look at the trailer you play
co-op<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.220> was<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.430> think<00:03:48.610> for<00:03:48.819> people<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:49.480> so

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
co-op it was I think for people so so

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.710 
co-op it was I think for people so so
yeah<00:03:50.349> it<00:03:50.620> looks<00:03:50.860> like<00:03:50.950> basically<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.730> closest

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.240 
yeah it looks like basically the closest
thing<00:03:52.780> I've<00:03:52.930> seen<00:03:53.140> so<00:03:53.319> far<00:03:53.349> if<00:03:53.709> you're<00:03:53.799> looking

think<00:04:17.180> about<00:04:17.239> this<00:04:17.419> game<00:04:17.630> Tyler<00:04:17.949> it<00:04:18.949> looks

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
think about this game Tyler it looks

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:23.409 
think about this game Tyler it looks
pretty<00:04:19.310> good<00:04:19.609> it's<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:21.009> 39<00:04:22.009> 99<00:04:22.340> yet<00:04:22.669> again<00:04:22.940> seems

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
pretty good it's a 39 99 yet again seems

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.540 
pretty good it's a 39 99 yet again seems
to<00:04:23.539> be<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.840> 3ds<00:04:24.259> pricing<00:04:24.949> so<00:04:25.160> it's<00:04:25.340> not<00:04:25.430> like

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
to be the 3ds pricing so it's not like

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.080 
to be the 3ds pricing so it's not like
it's<00:04:25.699> too<00:04:25.820> expensive<00:04:26.199> but<00:04:27.430> final<00:04:28.430> fantasy<00:04:28.910> has

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
it's too expensive but final fantasy has

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.180 
it's too expensive but final fantasy has
got<00:04:29.449> to<00:04:29.690> give<00:04:29.960> up<00:04:30.199> like<00:04:30.440> they<00:04:30.590> make<00:04:30.860> way<00:04:31.160> too

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
got to give up like they make way too

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.590 
got to give up like they make way too
many<00:04:31.460> games<00:04:31.699> now<00:04:32.120> they're<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.360> doing

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
many games now they're just doing

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.930

you do that yeah I don't know if that's
a<00:04:50.960> completely<00:04:51.289> original<00:04:51.470> concept<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.400> they

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
a completely original concept that they

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.820 
a completely original concept that they
came<00:04:52.669> up<00:04:52.699> with<00:04:52.870> if<00:04:53.870> they<00:04:54.050> may<00:04:54.080> be<00:04:54.199> boring<00:04:54.680> that

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
came up with if they may be boring that

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.279 
came up with if they may be boring that
from<00:04:55.009> rock<00:04:55.220> band<00:04:55.490> guitar<00:04:55.639> hero<00:04:56.060> but<00:04:56.300> uh<00:04:56.330> it's

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
from rock band guitar hero but uh it's

from rock band guitar hero but uh it's
kind<00:04:57.620> of<00:04:57.680> seems<00:04:57.919> just<00:04:58.250> like<00:04:58.520> an<00:04:59.030> unnecessary

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
kind of seems just like an unnecessary

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.290
