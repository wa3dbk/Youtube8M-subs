hey how you guys doing today would use

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.410 
hey how you guys doing today would use
about<00:00:05.979> to<00:00:06.069> dive<00:00:06.250> into<00:00:06.399> my<00:00:06.519> post-workout<00:00:06.819> snack

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420 
about to dive into my post-workout snack

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.580 
about to dive into my post-workout snack
and<00:00:07.599> I<00:00:07.660> thought<00:00:07.929> I'd<00:00:08.080> film<00:00:08.320> a<00:00:08.349> little

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
and I thought I'd film a little

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.800 
and I thought I'd film a little
impromptu<00:00:08.920> video<00:00:09.370> about<00:00:09.550> what<00:00:09.700> I<00:00:09.760> do<00:00:09.880> and<00:00:10.269> why

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:10.810 
impromptu video about what I do and why

impromptu video about what I do and why
I<00:00:10.840> do<00:00:11.019> it<00:00:11.170> so<00:00:11.910> let's<00:00:12.910> get<00:00:13.030> this<00:00:13.180> thing<00:00:13.240> rolling

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
I do it so let's get this thing rolling

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.320 
I do it so let's get this thing rolling
so<00:00:13.870> normally<00:00:14.590> after<00:00:14.740> workout<00:00:15.250> I<00:00:15.280> have<00:00:15.460> a<00:00:15.700> piece

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
so normally after workout I have a piece

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.350 
so normally after workout I have a piece
of<00:00:16.679> one<00:00:17.679> or<00:00:17.800> two<00:00:17.890> pieces<00:00:18.070> of<00:00:18.369> fruit<00:00:18.610> and<00:00:18.850> I

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
of one or two pieces of fruit and I

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.350 
of one or two pieces of fruit and I
prefer<00:00:19.660> this<00:00:19.869> to<00:00:20.170> my<00:00:20.770> big<00:00:21.039> grapefruits<00:00:22.029> here

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
prefer this to my big grapefruits here

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.359 
prefer this to my big grapefruits here
to<00:00:22.900> something<00:00:23.500> more<00:00:23.619> along<00:00:23.860> the<00:00:23.920> lines<00:00:24.220> of

to something more along the lines of

probably<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.350> biggest<00:00:29.529> reason<00:00:29.920> is<00:00:30.039> a

probably the biggest reason is a

immediately<00:01:07.329> after<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.899> workout<00:01:08.289> but<00:01:09.219> I

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.249 
immediately after the workout but I

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:11.340 
immediately after the workout but I
don't<00:01:09.429> want<00:01:09.609> a<00:01:09.639> big<00:01:09.880> huge<00:01:10.270> insulin<00:01:10.899> spike<00:01:11.139> in

don't want a big huge insulin spike in
rebound<00:01:11.709> hyperglycemia<00:01:12.670> especially<00:01:13.149> since<00:01:13.359> I

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
rebound hyperglycemia especially since I

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.449 
rebound hyperglycemia especially since I
trend<00:01:13.719> during<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:14.020> day<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.319> I<00:01:14.409> got<00:01:14.619> a<00:01:14.950> lot<00:01:15.429> of

trend during the day and I got a lot of

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:16.949 
trend during the day and I got a lot of
things<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.850> do<00:01:16.029> after<00:01:16.179> that<00:01:16.420> workout<00:01:16.719> so<00:01:16.899> I

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:16.959 
things to do after that workout so I

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.339 
things to do after that workout so I
look<00:01:17.170> for<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.619> fast<00:01:18.099> digesting<00:01:18.429> car<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:20.200> gives

look for a fast digesting car that gives
me<00:01:20.529> an<00:01:20.799> immediate<00:01:21.189> source<00:01:21.429> of<00:01:21.579> glucose<00:01:21.969> to

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:22.209 
me an immediate source of glucose to

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:26.129 
me an immediate source of glucose to

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
necessarily a three-hour window so it's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.580 
necessarily a three-hour window so it's
more<00:01:58.369> about<00:01:58.520> what<00:01:58.909> you<00:01:58.940> do<00:01:59.299> with<00:01:59.990> your<00:02:00.020> overall

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
diet to be anabolic so taking enough

ingredients I can't even pronounce and
there's<00:02:48.050> probably<00:02:48.230> like<00:02:48.560> 50<00:02:49.100> ingredients<00:02:49.280> in

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850

here<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:51.440> can<00:02:51.590> see<00:02:51.620> where<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.010> think<00:02:52.340> I

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
here so you can see where I think I

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.759 
here so you can see where I think I
think<00:02:52.820> fruit<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.690> great<00:02:53.959> post<00:02:54.500> workout

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769

think fruit is a great post workout
snack<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:56.060> get<00:02:56.209> right<00:02:56.540> back<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:56.750> your<00:02:57.140> plan

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
snack you get right back on your plan

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.949 
snack you get right back on your plan
and<00:02:58.190> then<00:02:58.340> as<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:58.910> know<00:02:59.030> my<00:02:59.180> diet<00:02:59.420> plans<00:02:59.750> I

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and then as you know my diet plans I

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.050 
and then as you know my diet plans I
recommend<00:03:00.440> eating<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.769> big<00:03:01.070> starch<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.850> carb

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
recommend eating the big starch of carb

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.699 
recommend eating the big starch of carb
loaded<00:03:02.390> meal<00:03:02.570> at<00:03:02.780> night<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.230> intermittent

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
loaded meal at night the intermittent

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.729 
loaded meal at night the intermittent
feast<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.160> that's<00:03:04.640> where<00:03:04.910> you're<00:03:05.060> getting<00:03:05.239> the

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
feast so that's where you're getting the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.250 
feast so that's where you're getting the
restocking<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:07.010> muscle<00:03:07.370> glycogen<00:03:07.519> reserves

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
restocking of muscle glycogen reserves

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.729 
restocking of muscle glycogen reserves
and<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.549> real<00:03:10.790> anabolic<00:03:11.480> meal<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.260> you're

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
and in the real anabolic meal so you're

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.930 
and in the real anabolic meal so you're
basically<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.280> trying<00:03:13.400> to<00:03:13.519> be<00:03:13.610> anti

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
basically just trying to be anti

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.479 
basically just trying to be anti
catabolic<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.500> post<00:03:15.769> workout<00:03:16.130> window

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
catabolic in that post workout window

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.900 
catabolic in that post workout window
and<00:03:16.700> then<00:03:17.350> anabolic<00:03:18.350> activity<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:19.489> saved<00:03:19.790> for

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
and then anabolic activity is saved for

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.110 
and then anabolic activity is saved for
that<00:03:20.030> big<00:03:20.470> meal<00:03:21.470> at<00:03:21.650> night<00:03:21.829> alright<00:03:22.340> hope<00:03:22.880> that

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
that big meal at night alright hope that

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.840 
that big meal at night alright hope that
made<00:03:23.299> sense

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.280 

look<00:03:26.850> at<00:03:26.940> these<00:03:27.030> grapefruits<00:03:27.540> man<00:03:27.720> they're

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
look at these grapefruits man they're

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.290 
look at these grapefruits man they're
they're<00:03:28.950> big<00:03:29.250> but<00:03:29.490> they're<00:03:29.550> slightly

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
they're big but they're slightly

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.620 
they're big but they're slightly
misshapen<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.730> in<00:03:32.730> kind<00:03:32.970> of<00:03:33.090> odd<00:03:33.270> looking

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
misshapen and in kind of odd looking

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.260 
misshapen and in kind of odd looking
which<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:34.020> kind<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.740> a<00:03:34.830> life-sized<00:03:35.370> replica<00:03:35.880> of

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
which is kind of a life-sized replica of

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.540 
which is kind of a life-sized replica of
what<00:03:36.480> I've<00:03:36.600> got<00:03:36.780> going<00:03:36.810> on<00:03:37.370> actually<00:03:38.370> that's

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
what I've got going on actually that's

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.030 
what I've got going on actually that's
not<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.820> truth<00:03:38.970> but<00:03:39.560> mine<00:03:40.560> are<00:03:40.680> kind<00:03:40.860> of<00:03:40.890> small

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
not the truth but mine are kind of small

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.550 
not the truth but mine are kind of small
but<00:03:41.430> they're<00:03:41.670> perfectly<00:03:42.090> symmetrical<00:03:43.020> so<00:03:43.320> I

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
but they're perfectly symmetrical so I

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.040 
but they're perfectly symmetrical so I
guess<00:03:44.520> you<00:03:44.670> just<00:03:44.850> roll<00:03:45.600> with<00:03:45.720> what<00:03:45.930> you've

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
guess you just roll with what you've

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.320 
guess you just roll with what you've
been<00:03:46.140> given
