00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello everyone as promised to make a video with 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.929
 real comparison of xenon and new 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.790
 protivotumanok led forgot yet 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.160
 one argument so interesting to sign 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.940
 that still xenon need time 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.830
 for ignition 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.510
 but the Cyrus LED is burned 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.460
 instantly shorter honda motorcycle. 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.820
 old switch from java 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.820
 very harmoniously fit the shortest of all 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.290
 all new well forgotten old not 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.420
 pay attention to gloss it 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.110
 the dirtiest enduro which in fools well into 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.090
 Generally very famously well, in general the comparison 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.980
 probably start with xenon 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.980
 I don't know how the video will work 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.629
 to convey all the charms but we will try 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.629
 I light a xenon lamp 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.770
 damn something sad of course you can see well 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.280
 quietly-quietly somehow she's there 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.280
 getting fat 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.570
 in general, that's how xenon works 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.969
 lamp center i.e. on a motorcycle 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.060
 The central headlight is xenon and 2 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:17.170
 anti tumanki 10 his cars LED 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.909
 Well, near and far switch 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.780
 near and far 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:25.729
 a little turned on the road can not see well 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.909
 turning off xenon checks for comparison 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.909
 show led fog lights 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:37.670
 Firstly instantly tear Sorry 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:42.229
 The phone does not take off the real range 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:46.819
 there is in fact visible with almost no 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:50.119
 exaggeration probably meters by 10 100 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.599
 meters dub it now these LED cinema ' 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.650
 I also want to tell you one thing that it is not 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.710
 focused 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.960
 LED fog light 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.690
 tumanki from Russia very much in all 40 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.330
 degrees, that is, itâ€™s not a point 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.700
 the main advantage of these LEDs and 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.350
 you can make a strobe that is here 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.990
 toggle toggle keys turned off here 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.140
 so here he is alive so now I will try 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.710
 show the difference well for fun 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:27.860
 The thing turned out in general, something like this 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:31.120
 Thank you all, I hope you rate the video is not 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.120
 scold loudly rented on the phone 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.560
