actually<00:04:42.680> good<00:04:42.950> this<00:04:43.100> time<00:04:43.280> whereas<00:04:43.640> before<00:04:44.090> I

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
actually good this time whereas before I

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
was his passing but he was a lot of fun

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.030 
was his passing but he was a lot of fun
right<00:04:50.750> I<00:04:50.960> didn't<00:04:51.290> enjoy<00:04:51.440> now<00:04:51.680> I'll<00:04:51.830> right<00:04:52.010> back

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.970 
right I didn't enjoy now I'll right back
I<00:04:52.580> actually<00:04:53.120> assisted<00:04:53.960> a<00:04:54.050> load<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.740> that's

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
I actually assisted a load and that's

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.790 
I actually assisted a load and that's
the<00:04:55.460> poach<00:04:55.670> there<00:04:56.000> and<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.270> Carol<00:04:56.780> from<00:04:57.410> corn

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
the poach there and the Carol from corn

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.920 
the poach there and the Carol from corn
as<00:04:57.980> well<00:04:58.220> you<00:04:58.910> are<00:04:59.060> absolutely<00:04:59.240> deadly

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
as well you are absolutely deadly

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.080 
as well you are absolutely deadly
because<00:05:00.350> every<00:05:00.800> single<00:05:01.220> play<00:05:01.460> in<00:05:01.700> your<00:05:01.820> team

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
because every single play in your team

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.600 
because every single play in your team
is<00:05:02.390> over<00:05:03.080> six<00:05:03.290> foot<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:03.740> pretty<00:05:04.340> much<00:05:04.430> anyone

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
is over six foot so pretty much anyone

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.660 
is over six foot so pretty much anyone
if<00:05:05.060> they<00:05:05.090> get<00:05:05.360> like<00:05:05.960> a<00:05:06.170> decent<00:05:06.500> position<00:05:06.860> can

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
if they get like a decent position can

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.340 
if they get like a decent position can
probably<00:05:08.090> score<00:05:08.420> a<00:05:08.450> goal<00:05:08.720> with<00:05:08.990> their<00:05:09.170> head

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
probably score a goal with their head

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.170 
probably score a goal with their head
and<00:05:09.380> it's<00:05:09.650> awesome<00:05:09.830> it's<00:05:10.400> a<00:05:10.520> bit<00:05:10.730> dirty<00:05:11.000> I
