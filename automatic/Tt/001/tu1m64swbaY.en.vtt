00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.110 
you get good at the push cut practice it
a<00:03:54.390> few<00:03:54.600> times<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:55.140> next<00:03:55.410> cut<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.940> I'm<00:03:56.940> gonna

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
a few times the next cut is I'm gonna

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.180 
a few times the next cut is I'm gonna
act<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:58.110> I'm<00:03:58.230> shaking<00:03:58.530> hands<00:03:58.739> with<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.010> wood

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
act like I'm shaking hands with the wood

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.220 
act like I'm shaking hands with the wood
here<00:03:59.459> I'm<00:03:59.970> gonna<00:04:00.150> flip<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.480> over<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.870> hold<00:04:01.019> it

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
here I'm gonna flip it over and hold it

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.380 
here I'm gonna flip it over and hold it
like<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:02.070> this<00:04:02.459> is<00:04:02.610> called<00:04:02.820> a<00:04:02.880> pull<00:04:03.090> cut

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
like this and this is called a pull cut

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.080 
like this and this is called a pull cut
so<00:04:03.930> I'm<00:04:04.049> gonna<00:04:04.290> basically<00:04:04.549> hold<00:04:05.549> a<00:04:05.670> knife<00:04:05.820> like

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
so I'm gonna basically hold a knife like

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.990 
so I'm gonna basically hold a knife like
this<00:04:06.120> turn<00:04:06.570> it<00:04:06.750> over<00:04:06.900> put<00:04:07.739> my<00:04:07.890> thumb<00:04:08.250> down

this turn it over put my thumb down
below<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:11.400> cutting<00:04:11.760> area

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
below the cutting area

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.539 
below the cutting area
now<00:04:13.139> they<00:04:13.260> do<00:04:13.320> make<00:04:13.650> thumb<00:04:13.950> guards<00:04:14.280> leather

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
now they do make thumb guards leather

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.210 
now they do make thumb guards leather
thumb

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
into but there's really good idea to

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.490 
into but there's really good idea to
learn<00:04:21.070> basic<00:04:21.370> techniques<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:22.720> put<00:04:23.110> my<00:04:23.230> thumb

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
learn basic techniques so put my thumb

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.290 
learn basic techniques so put my thumb
here<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:23.800> then<00:04:24.040> I'm<00:04:24.160> gonna<00:04:24.280> pull<00:04:24.610> here<00:04:24.940> so

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
here and then I'm gonna pull here so

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.810 
here and then I'm gonna pull here so
this<00:04:25.420> is<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.660> second<00:04:26.050> cut<00:04:26.230> pull<00:04:26.590> cut<00:04:26.920> so<00:04:27.760> I'm

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
this is the second cut pull cut so I'm

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.640 
this is the second cut pull cut so I'm
just<00:04:27.970> like<00:04:28.150> I'm<00:04:28.390> taking<00:04:28.930> a<00:04:29.230> peeling<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.590> potato

pull pull

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.450 
pull pull
so<00:04:36.100> we've<00:04:36.250> learned<00:04:36.460> push<00:04:37.360> cut<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:39.250> we've

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
so we've learned push cut and we've

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.660 
so we've learned push cut and we've
learned<00:04:39.670> pull<00:04:39.940> cut<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:41.380> third<00:04:41.650> cut<00:04:41.890> this<00:04:42.580> is

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670
