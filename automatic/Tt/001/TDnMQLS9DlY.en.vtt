00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.860 
installed so me and my dad tried to plug
it<00:03:59.890> in<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.280> when<00:04:00.730> we<00:04:00.850> finally<00:04:01.120> did<00:04:01.510> get<00:04:01.720> it

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
it in and when we finally did get it

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.680 
it in and when we finally did get it
working<00:04:02.320> because<00:04:02.500> what<00:04:03.220> they<00:04:03.430> did<00:04:03.700> they<00:04:04.450> put

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
working because what they did they put

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.540 
working because what they did they put
this<00:04:04.810> cooling<00:04:05.380> system<00:04:05.830> right<00:04:06.040> over<00:04:06.280> there

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
this cooling system right over there

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.530 
this cooling system right over there
they<00:04:07.240> put<00:04:07.540> that<00:04:07.570> in<00:04:08.170> front<00:04:08.890> of<00:04:08.980> where<00:04:09.190> the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
they put that in front of where the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.100 
they put that in front of where the
Wi-Fi<00:04:10.540> chip<00:04:10.570> is<00:04:11.140> supposed<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.650> go<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.970> we<00:04:13.930> had

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
Wi-Fi chip is supposed to go so we had

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.170 
Wi-Fi chip is supposed to go so we had
to<00:04:14.290> take<00:04:14.680> out<00:04:14.860> that<00:04:15.100> cooling<00:04:15.580> system<00:04:15.970> put<00:04:16.150> in

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
to take out that cooling system put in

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.000 
to take out that cooling system put in
the<00:04:16.360> Wi-Fi<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.230> didn't<00:04:17.560> even<00:04:17.620> end<00:04:17.920> up

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
the Wi-Fi and it didn't even end up

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.250 
the Wi-Fi and it didn't even end up
working<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:19.390> don't<00:04:19.840> know<00:04:19.900> what's<00:04:20.109> up<00:04:20.230> with

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
working so I don't know what's up with

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.600 
working so I don't know what's up with
that<00:04:20.410> um<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:22.060> have<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.810> call<00:04:23.110> we<00:04:23.290> might<00:04:23.740> have<00:04:23.890> did

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
that um I have to call we might have did

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.430 
that um I have to call we might have did
something<00:04:24.820> wrong<00:04:25.210> it's<00:04:25.510> very<00:04:25.660> possible<00:04:25.930> and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
something wrong it's very possible and

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440 
something wrong it's very possible and
we<00:04:26.560> didn't<00:04:26.800> have<00:04:26.950> an<00:04:27.130> internet<00:04:27.580> cord<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.330> we

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
we didn't have an internet cord so we

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.480 
we didn't have an internet cord so we
looked<00:04:28.960> all<00:04:29.140> around<00:04:29.200> we<00:04:29.710> finally<00:04:30.100> found<00:04:30.280> this

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
looked all around we finally found this

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.810 
looked all around we finally found this
red<00:04:31.000> one<00:04:31.030> which<00:04:31.510> looks<00:04:31.810> ugly<00:04:32.290> as<00:04:32.440> spa<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.550> when

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
red one which looks ugly as spa and when

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.930 
red one which looks ugly as spa and when
we<00:04:33.910> plug<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.300> in<00:04:34.450> there's<00:04:35.020> no<00:04:35.200> signal<00:04:35.770> from<00:04:36.310> the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
we plug it in there's no signal from the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.980 
we plug it in there's no signal from the
plug<00:04:37.870> behind<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.760> computer<00:04:39.760> back<00:04:40.120> back<00:04:40.630> over

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
plug behind the computer back back over

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.330 
plug behind the computer back back over
there<00:04:41.440> so<00:04:42.070> my<00:04:42.670> dad<00:04:42.880> had<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.480> go<00:04:43.630> and<00:04:43.960> uh<00:04:44.280> put<00:04:45.280> a

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
there so my dad had to go and uh put a

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.610 
there so my dad had to go and uh put a
signal<00:04:45.910> into<00:04:46.210> that<00:04:46.420> so<00:04:46.720> then<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.230> can<00:04:47.440> work

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
signal into that so then that can work

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.540 
signal into that so then that can work
and<00:04:47.920> finally<00:04:48.310> I<00:04:48.340> got<00:04:48.580> internet<00:04:49.120> um<00:04:50.400> that<00:04:51.400> was

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
and finally I got internet um that was

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.030 
and finally I got internet um that was
the<00:04:51.700> first<00:04:51.970> like<00:04:52.480> really<00:04:52.840> big<00:04:53.200> issue<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.919> then

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
the first like really big issue and then

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.880 
the first like really big issue and then
the<00:04:54.160> second<00:04:54.520> issue<00:04:54.640> was<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.620> monitor<00:04:56.620> the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
the second issue was the monitor the

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.500 
the second issue was the monitor the
monitor<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.490> I<00:04:57.520> have<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:57.850> couldn't<00:04:58.360> use

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
monitor that I have I couldn't use

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.320 
monitor that I have I couldn't use
because<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:58.930> uses<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.440> DVI<00:05:00.070> it's<00:05:00.850> not<00:05:01.060> like

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
because it uses the DVI it's not like

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.850 
because it uses the DVI it's not like
the<00:05:01.630> old<00:05:01.960> style<00:05:02.740> plug-ins<00:05:03.730> for<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.450> so<00:05:05.110> I<00:05:05.470> had

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
the old style plug-ins for that so I had

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.570 
the old style plug-ins for that so I had
to<00:05:05.919> run<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.270> source<00:05:07.600> and<00:05:07.840> buy<00:05:08.050> a<00:05:08.080> new

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
to run to to the source and buy a new

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.220 
to run to to the source and buy a new
monitor<00:05:09.580> which<00:05:10.180> I'm<00:05:10.390> probably<00:05:10.630> gonna<00:05:10.810> return

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
monitor which I'm probably gonna return

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.320 
monitor which I'm probably gonna return
soon<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:11.950> get<00:05:12.130> like<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.400> cheaper<00:05:12.880> one<00:05:13.030> because

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
soon and get like a cheaper one because

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
soon and get like a cheaper one because
this<00:05:13.510> one<00:05:13.690> was<00:05:13.870> kind<00:05:14.650> of<00:05:14.680> expensive<00:05:15.100> but<00:05:16.350> yeah

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
this one was kind of expensive but yeah

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.590 
this one was kind of expensive but yeah
