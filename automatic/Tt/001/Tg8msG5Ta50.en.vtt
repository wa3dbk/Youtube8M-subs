resort<00:00:49.590> all<00:00:49.829> Texas<00:00:50.730> definitely<00:00:51.239> there's

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
resort all Texas definitely there's

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.000 
resort all Texas definitely there's
maybe<00:00:51.629> many<00:00:52.020> other<00:00:52.170> areas<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.770> they're<00:00:52.860> very

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
maybe many other areas and they're very

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
maybe many other areas and they're very
resistant<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.629> really<00:00:54.870> need<00:00:55.020> very

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
resistant and they really need very

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.959 
resistant and they really need very
little<00:00:55.500> care<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> drought<00:00:56.280> resistant<00:00:56.820> as

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
little care the drought resistant as

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.750 
little care the drought resistant as
well<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.559> this<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.620> three<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.280> goji

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.440 
spot that's rare which we just put water
that<00:02:00.780> goes<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> mesh<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:03.060> seeds<00:02:03.329> are

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that goes up to a mesh and the seeds are

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.050 
that goes up to a mesh and the seeds are
just

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
just

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.910 
just
on<00:02:04.479> top<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:04.899> water<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.470> ability<00:02:05.860> of

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
on top of that water the ability of

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.760 
on top of that water the ability of
touch<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.220> water<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:07.119> what<00:02:07.630> that<00:02:07.780> gave<00:02:08.319> us<00:02:08.560> is

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
touch the water and what that gave us is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.620 
touch the water and what that gave us is
an<00:02:08.890> idea<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.310> how<00:02:09.489> fast<00:02:09.789> they<00:02:10.000> grow<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.509> all

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
an idea of how fast they grow and all

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.479 
an idea of how fast they grow and all
paths<00:02:10.899> they<00:02:11.050> terminate<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:11.739> so<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.190> could

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
paths they terminate so so you could

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.979 
paths they terminate so so you could
generate<00:02:12.670> in<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.209> way<00:02:13.360> or<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.569> could<00:02:13.810> just

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
generate in that way or you could just

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.320 
generate in that way or you could just
direct<00:02:14.140> solar<00:02:14.590> into<00:02:15.160> soil<00:02:15.370> which<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.670> certain

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
direct solar into soil which is certain

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.030 
direct solar into soil which is certain
we<00:02:16.390> did<00:02:16.569> that<00:02:16.750> with<00:02:16.900> some<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.590> these<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.890> well

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
we did that with some of these as well

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.729 
we did that with some of these as well
so<00:02:18.099> no<00:02:18.790> do<00:02:19.090> we<00:02:19.209> really<00:02:19.450> well<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.840> seems<00:02:20.110> yeah

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
so no do we really well it seems yeah

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.710 
so no do we really well it seems yeah
and<00:02:21.099> now<00:02:21.190> what's<00:02:21.430> really<00:02:21.660> important<00:02:22.660> about

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and now what's really important about

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.370 
and now what's really important about
this<00:02:23.019> is<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.530> looks<00:02:23.769> like<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:25.209> know<00:02:25.380> it's
