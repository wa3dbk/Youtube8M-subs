00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.690
 but no 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.740
 now very nice this time we are going to 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.660
 learn the song bittersweet symphony 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.690
 to see the song is relatively easy 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.220
 because the chords are sorted from the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.960
 way and do not change in the whole song what 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.190
 same with the radio so they should not 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.110
 have no problem 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.610
 after learning it and the plucking 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.160
 characteristic of the songs of the 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.470
 next way with the annular 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.530
 in the ninth space and the second with the 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.250
 index in the seventh in the first and it 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.250
 it's crazy then 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.820
 do not 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.960
 then we make two spaces 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.060
 maintains the posture 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.530
 but this time the fifth touch the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.530
 first second and first 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.980
 and then with the little finger on the tenth in 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.430
 the first and in the tenth space the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.240
 second 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.240
 yes i accept 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.490
 then it keeps everything out the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.490
 little finger 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.140
 says what is the middle in the ninth 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.140
 passion 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.240
 let's repeat the separation 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.360
 memory 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.580
 and well the chords that are used are the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.580
 next would be my biggest 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.610
 a minor yes but a minor seventh 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.190
 a greater re and the greater 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.840
 choose to use that work during the topic 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.960
 pursue the time to do a little more 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.680
 similar to the song instead of making a 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.680
 King Shaka in the middle of the middle finger 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.630
 where the king is, remember that the 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.840
 sect try not to touch it because it's not 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.560
 harmony does not match then you forget 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.560
 from the fifth he laughed 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.410
 and in the greatest also to make a 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.630
 ornament instead of doing so 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.260
 If you want, you can do it like pressing 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.150
 from the fourth to the first and 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.880
 we put the middle finger in the third 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.010
 space of the second and try to choose 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.010
 only from the fifth after second 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.299
 and do not overdo 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.299
 then she 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.080
 in that order 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.160
 and then it would be the next three 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.160
 down 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.819
 1 above 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.980
 interest below 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.080
 in essence it goes 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.080
 1 above I am interested below 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.650
 ah 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.670
 and 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.670
 i 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.919
 ah 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.919
 ah 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.570
 would be the form and order of the region 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.570
 in any moment 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:03.160
 and practice a little bit of the song 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.729
 to get out of any mess in 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.729
 no time 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.580
 ah 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.810
 ah 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.400
 no no 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.260
 no no 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:33.110
