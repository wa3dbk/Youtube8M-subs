00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
abilities to generate conflict but that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.100 
abilities to generate conflict but that
is<00:00:49.890> more<00:00:50.070> opinionated<00:00:50.610> i<00:00:50.789> believe<00:00:51.059> still<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
is more opinionated i believe still it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
is more opinionated i believe still it
was<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.260> factor<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> include<00:00:53.210> nexus<00:00:54.210> subtlety

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
was a factor to include nexus subtlety

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.170 
was a factor to include nexus subtlety
which<00:00:55.199> has<00:00:55.350> great<00:00:55.770> burst<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.430> Shadow<00:00:57.030> Dance

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
which has great burst as Shadow Dance

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.660 
which has great burst as Shadow Dance
which<00:00:57.420> allows<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.899> SAP<00:00:58.170> cheap<00:00:58.739> shot<00:00:58.980> ambush

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
which allows to SAP cheap shot ambush

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.340 
which allows to SAP cheap shot ambush
and<00:01:00.170> groped<00:01:01.460> without<00:01:02.460> coming<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.390> stem

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and groped without coming to be in stem

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.590 
and groped without coming to be in stem
so<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.489> run<00:01:05.670> around<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.180> shadow<00:01:06.390> dance

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
so you can run around in shadow dance

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
so you can run around in shadow dance
and<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.470> abilities<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.310> has<00:01:08.460> really

and do all this abilities but has really
low<00:01:08.909> sustained<00:01:09.299> damage<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.520> really

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
low sustained damage so that is really

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.250 
low sustained damage so that is really
