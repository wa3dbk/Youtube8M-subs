that you play through all the way to the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.870 
that you play through all the way to the
top<00:03:34.290> we're<00:03:35.130> making<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.549> more<00:03:35.700> dynamic

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
top we're making this a more dynamic

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.839 
top we're making this a more dynamic
system<00:03:36.569> so<00:03:36.959> it's<00:03:37.590> an<00:03:37.739> online<00:03:37.920> single-player

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
system so it's an online single-player

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.580 
system so it's an online single-player
mode<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.690> we're<00:03:40.049> able<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.380> update

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
mode that we're able to update

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.710 
mode that we're able to update
constantly<00:03:41.549> so<00:03:42.150> we<00:03:42.269> have<00:03:42.359> three<00:03:42.690> different

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
constantly so we have three different

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.259 
constantly so we have three different
levels<00:03:43.319> levels<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.859> towers<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:45.030> they're

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
levels levels of towers and they're

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.879 
levels levels of towers and they're
going<00:03:45.419> to<00:03:45.540> update<00:03:45.690> at<00:03:45.989> different<00:03:46.349> points<00:03:46.739> we

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
going to update at different points we

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.650 
going to update at different points we
have<00:03:46.919> one<00:03:47.340> that's<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.579> quick<00:03:47.790> tower<00:03:48.030> that's

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
have one that's a quick tower that's

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.120 
have one that's a quick tower that's
going<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.049> update<00:03:49.200> every<00:03:49.620> two<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.829> three<00:03:49.950> hours
