00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
reason the thing that really kind of got

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.230 
reason the thing that really kind of got
me<00:00:14.830> excited<00:00:15.129> was<00:00:15.490> looking<00:00:15.849> at<00:00:15.969> kind<00:00:16.150> of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
me excited was looking at kind of

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.270 
me excited was looking at kind of
slightly<00:00:16.720> obscure<00:00:17.410> ingredients

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
slightly obscure ingredients

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.400 
slightly obscure ingredients
maybe<00:00:18.610> it's<00:00:18.820> because<00:00:19.140> sometimes<00:00:20.140> they'd<00:00:20.289> have

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
maybe it's because sometimes they'd have

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.540 
maybe it's because sometimes they'd have
so<00:00:20.529> much<00:00:20.619> trouble<00:00:20.859> finding<00:00:21.340> them<00:00:21.430> when<00:00:21.519> I

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
so much trouble finding them when I

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.669 
so much trouble finding them when I
finally<00:00:21.849> did<00:00:22.210> it<00:00:22.390> was<00:00:22.480> so<00:00:22.630> exciting<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:23.619> I

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
finally did it was so exciting and I

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.589 
finally did it was so exciting and I
could<00:00:23.830> make<00:00:23.920> a<00:00:23.949> cocktail<00:00:24.369> with<00:00:24.460> it<00:00:24.609> finally<00:00:24.910> so

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
could make a cocktail with it finally so

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.749 
could make a cocktail with it finally so
when<00:00:26.410> I<00:00:26.439> make<00:00:26.769> cocktails<00:00:27.310> back<00:00:27.490> in<00:00:27.609> those<00:00:27.730> days

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
when I make cocktails back in those days

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.150 
when I make cocktails back in those days
I<00:00:28.000> started<00:00:28.390> focus<00:00:28.990> on<00:00:29.170> using<00:00:29.710> obscure

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
I started focus on using obscure

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.390 
I started focus on using obscure
ingredients<00:00:31.290> one<00:00:32.290> of<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.470> ingredients<00:00:32.560> I<00:00:33.160> ran

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
ingredients one of the ingredients I ran

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.100 
ingredients one of the ingredients I ran
across<00:00:33.550> all<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.180> time<00:00:34.360> but<00:00:34.600> never<00:00:34.720> could<00:00:34.900> find

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
across all the time but never could find

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.180 
across all the time but never could find
was<00:00:35.440> something<00:00:35.710> called<00:00:35.830> peach<00:00:36.730> bitters<00:00:37.420> now

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
was something called peach bitters now

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.490 
was something called peach bitters now
fees<00:00:39.190> company<00:00:39.580> on<00:00:39.640> Rochester<00:00:40.090> New<00:00:40.210> York

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
fees company on Rochester New York

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.460 
fees company on Rochester New York
finally<00:00:41.500> made<00:00:41.680> a<00:00:41.710> peach<00:00:42.010> bitters<00:00:42.400> and<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.440> I

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
finally made a peach bitters and so I

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.960 
finally made a peach bitters and so I
decided<00:00:44.920> to<00:00:45.100> take<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:45.490> try<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.730> make<00:00:45.940> a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
decided to take and try to make a

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.850 
decided to take and try to make a
cocktail<00:00:46.270> that<00:00:46.510> used<00:00:47.110> it<00:00:47.380> since<00:00:47.650> there

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
cocktail that used it since there

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.760 
cocktail that used it since there
weren't<00:00:48.070> that<00:00:48.340> many<00:00:48.400> cocktails<00:00:49.120> around<00:00:49.390> I<00:00:49.770> had

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
weren't that many cocktails around I had

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.140 
weren't that many cocktails around I had
already<00:00:50.920> started<00:00:51.220> making<00:00:51.700> a<00:00:51.760> drink<00:00:52.000> called

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
already started making a drink called

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.710 
already started making a drink called
the<00:00:52.270> Negroni<00:00:53.130> using<00:00:54.160> aquavit<00:00:54.730> instead<00:00:55.240> of<00:00:55.360> gin

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
the Negroni using aquavit instead of gin

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.210 
the Negroni using aquavit instead of gin
and<00:00:55.930> thought<00:00:56.110> that<00:00:56.320> was<00:00:56.500> really<00:00:56.650> good<00:00:56.950> so<00:00:57.160> I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
and thought that was really good so I

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.380 
and thought that was really good so I
said<00:00:57.400> let's<00:00:57.610> take<00:00:57.880> that<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.090> little<00:00:58.300> bit

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
said let's take that a little bit

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.900 
said let's take that a little bit
further<00:00:58.630> let's<00:00:58.960> take<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.410> Negroni<00:00:59.770> and<00:01:00.100> twist

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
further let's take the Negroni and twist

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.730 
further let's take the Negroni and twist
all<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.690> ingredients<00:01:02.320> kind<00:01:02.470> of<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.710> a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
all the ingredients kind of to a

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.210 
all the ingredients kind of to a
slightly<00:01:03.190> obscure<00:01:03.820> side<00:01:04.119> so<00:01:04.839> instead<00:01:05.619> of<00:01:05.680> gin

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
slightly obscure side so instead of gin

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.609 
slightly obscure side so instead of gin
let's<00:01:06.610> use<00:01:06.850> aquavit<00:01:07.810> which<00:01:08.170> is<00:01:08.320> kind<00:01:08.560> of

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
let's use aquavit which is kind of

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.529 
let's use aquavit which is kind of
similar<00:01:08.829> region<00:01:09.250> but<00:01:09.429> harder<00:01:10.179> to<00:01:10.299> find

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
similar region but harder to find

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.560 
similar region but harder to find
sometimes<00:01:11.189> instead<00:01:12.189> of<00:01:12.250> Campari<00:01:12.729> let's<00:01:13.420> use

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
sometimes instead of Campari let's use

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.289 
sometimes instead of Campari let's use
Chien<00:01:13.869> R<00:01:14.020> which<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.770> similar<00:01:15.399> to<00:01:15.670> Campari<00:01:16.090> but

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
Chien R which is similar to Campari but

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.690 
Chien R which is similar to Campari but
harder<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:16.869> find<00:01:17.109> and<00:01:17.679> instead<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.460> sweet

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
harder to find and instead of the sweet

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.419 
harder to find and instead of the sweet
vermouth<00:01:18.880> let's<00:01:19.630> use<00:01:19.869> sherry<00:01:20.469> which<00:01:20.890> while

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
vermouth let's use sherry which while

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.880 
vermouth let's use sherry which while
relatively<00:01:21.880> easy<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.420> find<00:01:22.450> often<00:01:23.380> is<00:01:23.740> it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
relatively easy to find often is it

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.469 
relatively easy to find often is it
found<00:01:24.100> behind<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.700> bar<00:01:24.969> for<00:01:25.240> making

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
found behind the bar for making

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.660 
found behind the bar for making
cocktails<00:01:25.749> with<00:01:26.229> so<00:01:26.829> we<00:01:26.920> have<00:01:27.100> now<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.310> drink

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
cocktails with so we have now a drink

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.929 
cocktails with so we have now a drink
that<00:01:27.850> is<00:01:27.969> a<00:01:28.020> variation<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.679> Negroni<00:01:29.979> called

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
that is a variation of a Negroni called

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.630 
that is a variation of a Negroni called
the<00:01:31.119> trident<00:01:31.570> which<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.740> slightly<00:01:33.159> obscure

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
the trident which is a slightly obscure

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.309 
the trident which is a slightly obscure
version<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:34.270> quite<00:01:34.689> frankly<00:01:35.020> it's<00:01:35.200> been

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:35.319 
version and quite frankly it's been

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.160 
version and quite frankly it's been
doing<00:01:35.590> quite<00:01:35.740> well<00:01:36.179> it's<00:01:37.179> very<00:01:37.420> easy<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.749> make

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
doing quite well it's very easy to make

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.590 
doing quite well it's very easy to make
basically<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:38.950> equal<00:01:39.219> parts<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:40.329> we're

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
basically it's equal parts so we're

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:49.379 
basically it's equal parts so we're
going<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:40.780> use<00:01:40.990> an<00:01:41.429> ounce<00:01:42.429> of<00:01:42.880> aquavit<00:01:48.389> an

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:49.389 
going to use an ounce of aquavit an

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:52.950 
going to use an ounce of aquavit an
ounce<00:01:50.289> of<00:01:50.710> Chien<00:01:51.189> R<00:01:51.689> now<00:01:52.689> if<00:01:52.780> you're<00:01:52.869> not

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
ounce of Chien R now if you're not

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.399 
ounce of Chien R now if you're not
familiar<00:01:53.020> with<00:01:53.560> Chien<00:01:53.920> R<00:01:54.389> and<00:01:55.389> the<00:01:55.960> flavor

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
familiar with Chien R and the flavor

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.209 
familiar with Chien R and the flavor
profile<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.609> similar<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.659> Campari<00:01:59.200> it's<00:01:59.979> just

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
profile is similar to Campari it's just

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.830 
profile is similar to Campari it's just
not<00:02:00.520> quite<00:02:01.030> as<00:02:01.590> intense<00:02:03.240> Campari<00:02:04.240> is<00:02:04.389> a<00:02:04.479> flavor

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
not quite as intense Campari is a flavor

Chien<00:02:07.780> are<00:02:07.929> probably<00:02:08.319> as<00:02:08.440> well<00:02:08.679> but<00:02:09.039> it's<00:02:09.280> I

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
Chien are probably as well but it's I

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.550 
Chien are probably as well but it's I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
think a little bit easier Chien are

actually<00:02:12.100> is<00:02:12.250> if<00:02:12.460> you<00:02:12.550> look<00:02:12.700> at<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.880> bottle

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
actually is if you look at the bottle

actually is if you look at the bottle
here<00:02:13.240> carefully<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:14.260> can<00:02:14.410> see<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:14.740> got<00:02:14.890> a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
here carefully you can see it's got a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.440 
here carefully you can see it's got a
picture<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.250> an<00:02:15.340> artichoke<00:02:15.610> on<00:02:16.000> it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
picture of an artichoke on it

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.210 
picture of an artichoke on it
because<00:02:16.840> artichokes<00:02:17.770> are<00:02:17.920> one<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.129> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
because artichokes are one of the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.070 
because artichokes are one of the
ingredients<00:02:18.310> in<00:02:18.819> Shinar<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.390> if<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.840> think

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
ingredients in Shinar and if you think

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.420 
ingredients in Shinar and if you think
about<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.410> while<00:02:20.560> you're<00:02:20.590> tasting<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.310> can

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
about it while you're tasting it you can

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.740 
about it while you're tasting it you can
actually<00:02:21.580> taste<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.390> artichokes<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
actually taste the artichokes in it and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.800 
actually taste the artichokes in it and
then<00:02:26.440> we're<00:02:26.530> going<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.680> use<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.830> dry<00:02:27.430> sherry<00:02:30.810> you

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
works very well and then we're going to

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.580 
works very well and then we're going to
add<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.630> couple<00:02:40.900> dashes<00:02:41.080> of<00:02:41.530> peach<00:02:41.739> bitters<00:02:46.590> and
