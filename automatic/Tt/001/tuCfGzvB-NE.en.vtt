00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
have a dresser I really recommend

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.540 
have a dresser I really recommend
folding<00:00:40.199> your<00:00:40.320> jeans<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.949> this<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.370> this

folding your jeans like this now this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.150 
folding your jeans like this now this
isn't<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> most<00:00:42.210> organized<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.500> found

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
isn't the most organized but I found

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.369 
isn't the most organized but I found
that<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> best<00:00:45.059> way<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.600> me<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.780> fold

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that this is the best way for me to fold

that this is the best way for me to fold
my<00:00:46.530> jeans<00:00:46.800> because<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.520> saves<00:00:47.789> me<00:00:47.969> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
my jeans because it just saves me so
