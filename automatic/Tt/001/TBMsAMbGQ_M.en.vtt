two perspectives from a scientific
standpoint<00:00:09.019> of<00:00:10.019> all<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.830> look<00:00:11.070> at<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
standpoint of all we look at the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.390 
standpoint of all we look at the
Newtonian<00:00:11.759> perspective<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.870> Santa<00:00:13.230> Claus<00:00:13.410> now

in the world they're approximately two

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.540 
in the world they're approximately two

these households are Christian which

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.630 
these households are Christian which
means<00:00:21.869> they're<00:00:22.020> 825<00:00:22.830> million<00:00:23.070> Christian

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that means there are three and thirty

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.200 
that means there are three and thirty

million homes at Santa must visit on
Christmas<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:37.290> will<00:00:37.410> assume<00:00:37.710> there<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.040> one

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
Christmas we will assume there is one

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.799 
Christmas we will assume there is one
good<00:00:38.430> child<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.850> each<00:00:38.940> which<00:00:39.300> might<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> bit

good child in each which might be a bit
of<00:00:39.899> us<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:42.000> how<00:00:42.450> long<00:00:42.600> does<00:00:42.690> Santa<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.050> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
of us so how long does Santa have to

of us so how long does Santa have to
work<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.620> well<00:00:44.309> we're<00:00:44.550> gonna<00:00:44.640> assuming

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
travels east to west we should give them

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.200 
travels east to west we should give them

a little bit extra time due to the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.209 
a little bit extra time due to the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
to that next home that means the sleigh

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.090 
to that next home that means the sleigh
must<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.310> amazingly<00:01:11.909> fast<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:13.320> let's<00:01:13.830> assume

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
must be amazingly fast so let's assume

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.260 
must be amazingly fast so let's assume
these<00:01:14.310> houses<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.760> evenly<00:01:15.090> distributed

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
these houses are evenly distributed

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.210 
these houses are evenly distributed
across<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> globe<00:01:16.350> even<00:01:16.890> though<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.100> know

across the globe even though we know
it's<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.520> true<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.030> good<00:01:18.180> approximation

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
it's not true it's a good approximation

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.020 
it's not true it's a good approximation
that<00:01:19.740> means<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.189> average<00:01:20.250> separation<00:01:20.610> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that means the average separation of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.810 
that means the average separation of
each<00:01:21.150> home<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.540> 0.78<00:01:22.320> miles<00:01:22.619> about<00:01:23.189> 3/4<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
each home is 0.78 miles about 3/4 of a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.969 
each home is 0.78 miles about 3/4 of a
mile<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.840> point<00:01:25.200> seven<00:01:25.439> eight<00:01:25.500> miles<00:01:25.799> per

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
mile so point seven eight miles per

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.590 
mile so point seven eight miles per
house<00:01:26.280> times<00:01:26.670> two<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:26.970> 30<00:01:27.119> million<00:01:27.330> houses

house times two and 30 million houses

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.440 
house times two and 30 million houses
means<00:01:28.140> he<00:01:28.290> must<00:01:28.470> travel<00:01:28.820> 258<00:01:29.820> million<00:01:30.090> miles

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
means he must travel 258 million miles

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.560 
means he must travel 258 million miles
in<00:01:30.780> those<00:01:31.470> 31<00:01:31.799> hours<00:01:32.220> doing<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.150> gives<00:01:33.420> an

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
in those 31 hours doing this gives an

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.990 
in those 31 hours doing this gives an
average<00:01:33.780> speed<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.250> 2,300<00:01:35.250> miles<00:01:35.369> per<00:01:35.610> second

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
average speed of 2,300 miles per second

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.109 
average speed of 2,300 miles per second
which<00:01:36.299> works<00:01:36.509> out<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.720> Mach<00:01:37.640> 11,000<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.909> his

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
which works out to Mach 11,000 for his

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.510 
which works out to Mach 11,000 for his
sleigh<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.829> normal<00:01:40.829> reindeer<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.369> run

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
sleigh a normal reindeer can run

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.399 
sleigh a normal reindeer can run
approximately<00:01:41.880> 15<00:01:42.570> miles

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
approximately 15 miles

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.850 
approximately 15 miles
that's<00:01:45.070> one<00:01:45.490> fast<00:01:46.030> sleigh<00:01:46.539> Santa<00:01:46.960> has<00:01:47.259> tricked

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.469 

so<00:01:51.860> how<00:01:51.979> much<00:01:52.130> does<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.369> layaway

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
so how much does this layaway

be at any given place therefore the

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
electron can be seen as being in two or

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.229 
electron can be seen as being in two or
more<00:03:55.269> places<00:03:55.959> at<00:03:56.440> once<00:03:56.680> as<00:03:57.010> long<00:03:57.340> as<00:03:57.610> no<00:03:57.849> one<00:03:57.880> is

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
more places at once as long as no one is

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.990 
more places at once as long as no one is
observing<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:59.190> when<00:04:00.190> electron<00:04:00.549> is<00:04:00.670> measured

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
observing it when electron is measured

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.759 
observing it when electron is measured
its<00:04:01.239> wavefunction<00:04:01.870> collapses<00:04:02.349> and<00:04:02.620> we

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
its wavefunction collapses and we

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.740 
its wavefunction collapses and we
observe<00:04:03.069> it<00:04:03.220> in<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.489> single<00:04:03.700> location<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
observe it in a single location the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.119 
observe it in a single location the
single<00:04:04.989> location<00:04:05.260> being<00:04:05.560> determined<00:04:05.860> by<00:04:06.069> its

so<00:04:08.980> what<00:04:09.160> if<00:04:09.310> santa<00:04:09.760> was<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.060> macroscopic

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
so what if santa was a macroscopic

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.369 
so what if santa was a macroscopic
quantum<00:04:12.099> object<00:04:12.640> well<00:04:13.329> Santa<00:04:13.720> would<00:04:14.019> behave

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
quantum object well Santa would behave

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.310 
quantum object well Santa would behave
like<00:04:14.650> this<00:04:15.069> electron<00:04:15.610> he<00:04:16.539> can<00:04:16.690> visit<00:04:16.930> everyone

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
like this electron he can visit everyone

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.710 
like this electron he can visit everyone

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
observes him this can beat the disk we

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.450 
observes him this can beat the disk we
have<00:04:23.169> evidence<00:04:23.440> for<00:04:23.740> this<00:04:23.830> in<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.190> fact<00:04:24.340> that

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
have evidence for this in the fact that

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.920 
have evidence for this in the fact that
children<00:04:24.700> are<00:04:24.970> told<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.300> go<00:04:25.419> to<00:04:25.479> bed<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:25.870> they

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
children are told to go to bed so they

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.110 
children are told to go to bed so they
don't<00:04:26.139> see<00:04:26.410> Santa<00:04:26.889> when<00:04:27.490> they<00:04:27.639> that<00:04:27.820> night

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120
