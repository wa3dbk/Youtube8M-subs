00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.930
 and you 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.310
 hello fans of heat and horchata today 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.550
 chosen this kanye west theme called 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.489
 workers because precisely that has a 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.850
 very fat guitar riff very nice 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.190
 very effective and very very cool because the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.720
 Uncle though do rap hip hop know 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.240
 surround yourself with very very good musicians 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.030
 then the grace of this topic and you 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.030
 I say is this river that we made and how 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.440
 let's study it you have the tabla tura 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.290
 down here you start on the fourth string 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.060
 a slide but from above as from 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.010
 above means that it is not like very 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.900
 Defined, you know how some frets are 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.650
 higher then around here pretty much 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.650
 to the world 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.140
 Y 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.969
 do not 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:35.500
 is a blessed and this 9 have second 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:37.469
 lap starts again and finished and I sold 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.469
 he came back 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.469
 6 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.469
 for the video learn from what 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.469
 and let's play it slowly 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.170
 Y 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.519
 what I touched at the beginning is a 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.450
 conjunction between the line below that 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.450
 does something like 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.440
 and the guitar rite that I just 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.380
 explain 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.000
 whereupon in those two things you have a 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.270
 counterpoint and we started putting a 2 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.780
 Minor sharp here 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.290
 and we're left with the fifth string the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.150
 third and the second of this chord with 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.510
 which is 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.510
 come pito with bass bound 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.360
 I'm going to join 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.890
 and 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.879
 melody strings here and bass by from 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:24.459
 here he does the same 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:24.459
 024 that's a vending 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.750
 Y 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:41.590
 second part 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:41.590
 again same principle and now 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.250
 that is to say you do the berlin and now you take 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.250
 the low storage rooms 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.290
 under other p4 fifth string and melody 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.230
 Y 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.750
 very good third part the same as the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.750
 first part 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:21.840
 and a quarter varies the tone a little 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:30.000
 now you start with a free rope 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:34.940
 the same and now the bass that varies a 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.940
 little bit and we do like that 6 fret 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.259
 all right 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.650
 I'm going to play the four parts slowly 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.650
 and the pylon 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.120
 12 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.120
 Y 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:22.280
 to you 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.530
 Well, I hope you have learned 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.080
 very much if you have any doubt we 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.760
 you say and nothing that you continue enjoying the 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.210
 summer we see in the following video 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.210
 bye
