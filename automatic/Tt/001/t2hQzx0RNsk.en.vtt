00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.450
 no hello to all you are with 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.370
 planet gt today i'm talking to you 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.760
 very quickly from the audi a3 cabriolet 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.500
 we actually have the tests of the s1 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.450
 but since we had an a3 cabriolet to 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.840
 provision it had to it we 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.730
 spoken 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.439
 so the first interesting point is 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.599
 that obviously cabriolet version so 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.300
 possibility to fold the canvas in 18 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.189
 seconds up to 50 km time and more 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.619
 the line of cash once the canvas 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.269
 fold back remains ultra flat and it's a 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.009
 we must know about audi in 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.749
 more of that we have a finish that is 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.100
 frankly appreciable version to 40000 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.390
 euros 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.539
 maybe a little more in reality we have 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.010
 also my 150 horsepower engine 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.590
 diesel and I confess it's 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.920
 relatively acceptable even very 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.350
 acceptable in reality since we have a 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.149
 comfort that is frankly very 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.320
 good quality 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.789
 what's interesting is that you 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.530
 have more modes of driving so 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.839
 if you put in comfort the car is going 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.179
 frankly be very comfortable 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.249
 logically and will allow you a little 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.679
 to walk around without putting too much 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.980
 questions relative to the asperities of 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.540
 the road 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.580
 then you have a deficient mode if 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.560
 you also have a dynamic mode where the 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.450
 driving will be closed a bit and you 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.670
 allows if you wish to drive a 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.310
 little more sportingly in quotation marks 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.790
 it's a car that I discover for 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.310
 the first time and that I like from the first 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.420
 first try I would like if I had 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.940
 the opportunity to talk to you more 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.650
 long and I must say that audi in 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.640
 giving this chance to let me do 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.740
 really happy 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.330
 I think that if we have the opportunity I 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.440
 you will talk about it for a longer time 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.560
 is on Corsican roads is 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.690
 frankly difficult not to be done 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.310
 fun with the car we have and the 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.659
 roads offered to us other 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.250
 what I can tell you about it is 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.560
 also that the car is equipped with no 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.710
 wrong of options especially the ma put this 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.830
 multimedia system that allows to have the 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.720
 gps a a jukebox for example and you 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.630
 also have a whole connect 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.369
 with for example gps which is a gps 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.310
 who accuses himself who updates his cards in 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.840
 real time you have google maps you 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.060
 have a lot of very interesting options 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.619
 and frankly when everyone in 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.789
 this audi one can understand very 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.420
 easily the attraction that people 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:13.060
 can have for an audi and I think 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.250
 that I really will have to take 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.630
 time to linger on this car 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.800
 which is really worth it 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.840
 here I presented you very 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.910
 quickly the a3 cabriolet I'm sorry 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.989
 I would have liked to do better 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.760
 do not hesitate to subscribe to the channel 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.760
 and for the rest I tell you no more
