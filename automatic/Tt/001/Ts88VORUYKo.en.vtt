savings has gone to the East the West

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.370 
savings has gone to the East the West
has<00:01:32.100> become<00:01:32.400> more<00:01:32.640> indebted<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:34.170> not

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
has become more indebted and it's not

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.890 
has become more indebted and it's not
just<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.860> United<00:01:35.189> States<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:36.270> Europe<00:01:36.659> as

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
just the United States it's Europe as

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.999 
just the United States it's Europe as
well<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.509> signals<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
well and I think this signals the the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.330 
well and I think this signals the the
time<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.850> gold<00:01:42.479> will<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.810> romana<00:01:43.770> tised<00:01:44.040> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
time when gold will be romana tised I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.249 
time when gold will be romana tised I
don't<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:44.850> never<00:01:45.060> been<00:01:45.329> d<00:01:45.659> monetized

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
don't think it's never been d monetized

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.109 
don't think it's never been d monetized
in<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> sense<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.979> think<00:01:47.009> gold<00:01:47.430> has<00:01:47.640> always

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
in the sense I think gold has always

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.510 
in the sense I think gold has always
been<00:01:48.360> money<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.290> pretended<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> wasn't

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
been money but they pretended it wasn't

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.819 
been money but they pretended it wasn't
money<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> 60s<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:52.200> wanted<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.649> d

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
money in the 60s they wanted to d

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.490 
money in the 60s they wanted to d
monetize<00:01:53.340> gold<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.909> by<00:01:54.329> 71<00:01:54.720> they<00:01:55.020> claim<00:01:55.320> they

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
monetize gold and by 71 they claim they

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.709 
monetize gold and by 71 they claim they
officially<00:01:55.829> did<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> even<00:01:57.270> throughout

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
officially did it and even throughout

ninety-eight<00:03:48.889> percent<00:03:49.480> devaluation<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:50.720> it's

ninety-eight percent devaluation so it's

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.180 
ninety-eight percent devaluation so it's
a<00:03:51.079> constant<00:03:51.519> devaluation<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:53.030> here<00:03:53.269> we<00:03:53.419> have<00:03:53.449> a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
a constant devaluation so here we have a

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.099 
a constant devaluation so here we have a
government's<00:03:55.190> official<00:03:55.669> policy<00:03:56.120> announced

you<00:04:45.419> can<00:04:45.599> do<00:04:45.719> that<00:04:45.870> just<00:04:46.199> so<00:04:46.319> long<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:47.159> can

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
you can do that just so long you can

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.999 
you can do that just so long you can
defy<00:04:47.610> economic<00:04:48.210> laws<00:04:48.389> for<00:04:48.719> a<00:04:48.749> while<00:04:49.080> but<00:04:49.740> just

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
defy economic laws for a while but just

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.519 
defy economic laws for a while but just
like<00:04:50.189> you<00:04:50.310> can<00:04:50.460> keep<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.849> gold<00:04:51.120> at

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:51.529 
like you can keep the gold at

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.050 
like you can keep the gold at
thirty-five<00:04:52.529> dollars<00:04:52.710> an<00:04:53.009> ounce<00:04:53.159> and<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:53.759> can

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
thirty-five dollars an ounce and you can

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.809 
thirty-five dollars an ounce and you can

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.939 
economic laws will rule and I think this
is<00:05:02.939> what<00:05:03.150> will<00:05:03.330> happen<00:05:03.719> is<00:05:03.870> we<00:05:04.349> will<00:05:04.500> continue

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
that but we also will have to understand

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.309 
that but we also will have to understand
the<00:06:10.710> issue<00:06:10.949> of<00:06:11.219> monetary<00:06:11.580> policy<00:06:12.210> we<00:06:12.509> need<00:06:13.110> to

that is why the success we've had with

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.499 
that is why the success we've had with

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.180 

that's<00:06:55.720> a<00:06:55.870> very<00:06:55.900> important<00:06:56.620> question<00:06:56.860> because

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
that's a very important question because

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.490 
that's a very important question because
it<00:06:57.970> has<00:06:58.090> a<00:06:58.120> great<00:06:58.360> deal<00:06:58.510> of<00:06:58.540> significance<00:06:58.840> if

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
it has a great deal of significance if

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.690 
it has a great deal of significance if
the<00:07:00.220> IMF<00:07:00.640> is<00:07:00.820> giving<00:07:01.150> up<00:07:01.360> the<00:07:01.540> gold<00:07:02.340> this<00:07:03.340> means

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
the IMF is giving up the gold this means

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.300 
the IMF is giving up the gold this means
that<00:07:03.880> they<00:07:04.270> are<00:07:04.300> weaken<00:07:04.990> they<00:07:05.410> will<00:07:05.680> have<00:07:05.980> less

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
that they are weaken they will have less

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.090 
that they are weaken they will have less
clout<00:07:06.670> in<00:07:06.700> saying<00:07:07.300> what<00:07:08.140> the<00:07:08.350> next<00:07:08.590> reserve

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
currency will be if they wanted to have

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.230 
currency will be if they wanted to have
an<00:07:11.440> international<00:07:11.950> reserve<00:07:12.160> currency<00:07:12.820> they
