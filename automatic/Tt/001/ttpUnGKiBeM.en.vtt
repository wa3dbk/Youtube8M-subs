00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.630 
would suggest not doing that they are
definitely<00:00:47.640> glued<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.610> i

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
wanted to show you real quickly was we

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.149 
wanted to show you real quickly was we
did<00:01:03.780> when<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.260> first<00:01:04.350> started<00:01:04.890> doing<00:01:04.949> our

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
did when we first started doing our

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.609 
did when we first started doing our
battles<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.610> had<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:06.110> assembled<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.380> gates

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
battles we had not assembled the gates

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.240 
battles we had not assembled the gates
yet<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.280> gates<00:01:08.549> simply<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.299> slide<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:10.250> real

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
yet the gates simply just slide in real

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.880 
yet the gates simply just slide in real
easy<00:01:11.520> there's<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.530> holes<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
easy there's these little holes on the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.830 
easy there's these little holes on the
side<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.760> take<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.180> gates<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
side and you just take your gates and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.749 
side and you just take your gates and
what<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> found<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.830> works<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.280> by<00:01:17.460> laying

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
what I found that works is by laying

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.440 
what I found that works is by laying
them<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.119> their<00:01:18.330> side<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:19.049> an<00:01:19.380> angle<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> then

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
them on their side at an angle and then

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.030 
them on their side at an angle and then
just<00:01:21.450> push<00:01:21.659> them<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.439> go<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> rather

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
just push them in and they go in rather

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.490 
just push them in and they go in rather
nicely<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:24.119> i<00:01:24.390> put<00:01:24.600> my<00:01:24.720> graphics<00:01:25.140> towards<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
nicely so i put my graphics towards the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.140 
nicely so i put my graphics towards the
inside<00:01:25.619> because<00:01:26.130> i<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.490> see<00:01:26.670> them<00:01:26.759> you'll

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
inside because i like to see them you'll

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.170 
inside because i like to see them you'll
notice<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> backside<00:01:28.460> if<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.640> put<00:01:30.090> them

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
notice on the backside if you put them

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.670 
notice on the backside if you put them
this<00:01:30.299> way<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.689> obviously<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> graphics<00:01:31.560> on

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
this way that obviously the graphics on

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.200 
this way that obviously the graphics on
the<00:01:31.770> inside<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.610> doesn't<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.060> look

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the inside and it doesn't have that look

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.219 
the inside and it doesn't have that look
on<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> outside<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:33.780> i<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.079> looks

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
on the outside but i think it looks

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.050 
on the outside but i think it looks
cooler<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> inside<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.369> i<00:01:35.400> put<00:01:35.640> mine<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
cooler on the inside so i put mine that

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.760 
cooler on the inside so i put mine that
way<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:37.020> whatever<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.409> on

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
way you can do whatever you like on

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.870 
way you can do whatever you like on
yours<00:01:38.900> but<00:01:39.920> anyway<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:40.979> again<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.670> trick<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
yours but anyway so again the trick to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.460 
yours but anyway so again the trick to
remember<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.390> when<00:01:42.540> you're<00:01:42.780> loading<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:43.439> your

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
remember is when you're loading up your

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.690 
remember is when you're loading up your
spinners<00:01:44.009> be<00:01:44.670> sure<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:46.829> grasp<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
spinners be sure that you grasp the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.789 
spinners be sure that you grasp the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
well on certain features but we really

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.100 
well on certain features but we really
think<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.320> guys<00:02:49.500> enjoy<00:02:50.340> us<00:02:51.000> unboxing<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.900> you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
think you guys enjoy us unboxing and you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.510 
think you guys enjoy us unboxing and you
know<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.470> through<00:02:52.620> all<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.010> cutting<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
know going through all the cutting and

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.800 
know going through all the cutting and
the<00:02:53.640> excitement<00:02:54.030> of<00:02:54.650> getting<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.920> out<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.490> I

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
the excitement of getting it out so I

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.970 
the excitement of getting it out so I
think<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.900> know<00:02:57.990> would<00:02:58.140> probably<00:02:58.590> contend

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
think you know would probably contend

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.980 
think you know would probably contend
that<00:02:59.070> way<00:02:59.220> continue<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.940> way<00:03:00.060> but<00:03:00.600> that's

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
that way continue that way but that's

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.510 
that way continue that way but that's
why<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.200> wanted<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.530> do<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> little<00:03:01.920> footer<00:03:02.220> video

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520
