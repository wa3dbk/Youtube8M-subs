weights<00:01:07.640> we<00:01:08.640> attached<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:11.930> wing<00:01:12.930> stay<00:01:15.860> made

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
weights we attached to a wing stay made

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.720 
weights we attached to a wing stay made
from<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:18.210> material<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> round<00:01:20.850> plastic<00:01:22.730> so

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
from this material so round plastic so

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:33.410 
from this material so round plastic so
yeah<00:01:28.190> yep<00:01:29.190> this<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.580> cool<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.800> needs<00:01:32.010> a<00:01:32.820> bit

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
yeah yep this is cool so it needs a bit

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.020 
yeah yep this is cool so it needs a bit
of<00:01:33.570> color<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:36.080> it's<00:01:37.080> certainly<00:01:37.800> going<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.910> do

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
of color and it's certainly going to do

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.220 
of color and it's certainly going to do
something<00:01:39.450> about<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.900> bumper<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:42.230> because

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
something about this bumper here because

00:01:43.230 --> 00:02:12.820 
something about this bumper here because
that<00:01:43.470> looks<00:01:45.110> ridiculous

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.750 

and<00:02:13.830> there<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.340> is

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.759 

tada<00:02:22.780> there's<00:02:23.780> not<00:02:24.080> just<00:02:24.110> an<00:02:24.650> echo<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.909> is

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
tada there's not just an echo that is

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.369 
tada there's not just an echo that is
the<00:02:27.769> best-looking<00:02:28.640> Neko<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.780> have<00:02:30.019> ever<00:02:30.470> seen

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379 
the best-looking Neko I have ever seen

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.089 
the best-looking Neko I have ever seen
so<00:02:33.379> what<00:02:33.739> have<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.920> done<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.340> it

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
so what have I done to it

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.229 
so what have I done to it
obviously<00:02:37.099> it's<00:02:37.910> been<00:02:38.500> painted<00:02:39.879> that<00:02:40.879> works

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
obviously it's been painted that works

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:49.770 
obviously it's been painted that works
really<00:02:41.930> well<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:45.170> rear<00:02:46.040> wing<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.849> painted<00:02:47.480> and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
really well the rear wing is painted and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.350 
really well the rear wing is painted and
integrates<00:02:50.780> nice<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:52.120> rest<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.239> the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
integrates nice with the rest of the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.300 
integrates nice with the rest of the
body<00:02:53.540> shell<00:02:54.280> got<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.579> rear<00:02:56.540> panel<00:02:56.959> painted<00:02:58.750> I

front bumper I'll show you that it's a

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.940 
front bumper I'll show you that it's a
bit<00:03:17.510> big<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:19.450> it's<00:03:20.450> not<00:03:20.750> as<00:03:20.900> hideous<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.680> big

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
bit big but it's not as hideous and big

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.909 
bit big but it's not as hideous and big
as<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.670> original<00:03:23.239> one<00:03:25.419> the<00:03:26.419> battery<00:03:26.720> holder

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:36.990 

there's<00:03:30.919> the<00:03:31.069> wing<00:03:31.280> support<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.950> rear<00:03:34.280> wing

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.289 

and<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:39.560> rest<00:03:39.769> of<00:03:39.919> the<00:03:40.010> chassis<00:03:40.250> is<00:03:43.120> nice<00:03:44.120> and

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299

buggy and yeah needs some more colors or
stickers<00:03:58.060> but<00:04:01.359> you<00:04:02.359> will<00:04:02.510> figure<00:04:02.780> that<00:04:02.900> out

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
stickers but you will figure that out

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.789 
stickers but you will figure that out
sometime<00:04:05.829> not<00:04:06.829> now<00:04:08.889> it's<00:04:09.889> just<00:04:10.160> a<00:04:10.370> few

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
sometime not now it's just a few

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.679 
sometime not now it's just a few
close-ups<00:04:12.799> of<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.459> paint<00:04:14.060> job

00:04:17.679 --> 00:04:17.689 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:21.080 

and<00:04:18.689> not<00:04:19.139> very<00:04:19.379> good<00:04:19.590> at<00:04:19.919> painting<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.669> in

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
and not very good at painting and in

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.260 
and not very good at painting and in
fact<00:04:21.389> I<00:04:21.569> don't<00:04:21.629> like<00:04:21.959> it<00:04:22.109> very<00:04:22.139> much<00:04:22.409> and<00:04:23.270> it

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
fact I don't like it very much and it

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.350 
fact I don't like it very much and it
has<00:04:24.449> some<00:04:24.720> flaws<00:04:25.050> in<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:25.470> but<00:04:25.650> this<00:04:25.830> is<00:04:26.069> really

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
has some flaws in it but this is really

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:39.850 
has some flaws in it but this is really
it's<00:04:27.360> turned<00:04:27.689> out<00:04:27.870> really<00:04:28.169> really<00:04:28.319> good

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.080 

remember<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:41.009> steering<00:04:41.430> knuckle<00:04:41.969> I

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
remember that steering knuckle I

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:51.909 
remember that steering knuckle I
repaired<00:04:44.599> were<00:04:45.599> you<00:04:45.810> as<00:04:45.990> concerned<00:04:46.379> as<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:46.830> was

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.180 

yep

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
yep

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:07.700 
yep
they<00:04:53.879> broke<00:04:54.120> off<00:04:56.090> so<00:04:57.289> I<00:05:02.449> made<00:05:03.449> this<00:05:06.199> and<00:05:07.199> that

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
they broke off so I made this and that

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.709 
they broke off so I made this and that
goes<00:05:08.430> around<00:05:08.639> the<00:05:08.909> steering<00:05:09.150> knuckle<00:05:10.819> and<00:05:11.819> it

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
goes around the steering knuckle and it

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:18.110 
goes around the steering knuckle and it
has<00:05:12.900> a<00:05:12.930> way<00:05:13.759> bigger<00:05:15.830> contact<00:05:16.830> surface<00:05:17.430> so<00:05:17.969> I'm

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
has a way bigger contact surface so I'm

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.540 
has a way bigger contact surface so I'm
gonna<00:05:18.330> glue<00:05:18.539> this<00:05:18.810> on<00:05:19.289> and<00:05:19.710> then<00:05:20.129> I'm<00:05:20.279> gonna

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
gonna glue this on and then I'm gonna

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.339 
gonna glue this on and then I'm gonna
drill<00:05:20.969> a<00:05:21.120> hole<00:05:21.469> and<00:05:23.449> tap<00:05:24.449> some<00:05:24.690> fired<00:05:24.990> in<00:05:25.139> it

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
drill a hole and tap some fired in it

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:31.939 
drill a hole and tap some fired in it
and<00:05:26.479> that<00:05:27.479> should<00:05:27.690> be<00:05:27.840> fine<00:05:30.319> and<00:05:31.319> as<00:05:31.740> you<00:05:31.830> can

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
and that should be fine and as you can

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:37.390 
and that should be fine and as you can
see<00:05:32.219> it's<00:05:32.340> not<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.699> prettiest<00:05:33.180> solution<00:05:34.310> but

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:46.369 

this<00:05:38.400> is<00:05:38.639> two-component<00:05:39.770> superglue<00:05:43.370> and<00:05:45.379> this

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
this is two-component superglue and this

00:05:46.379 --> 00:06:09.919 
this is two-component superglue and this
