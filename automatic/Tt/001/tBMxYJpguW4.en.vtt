00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.730
 f humanity how easy you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.790
 conduct 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.870
 how easy you people are on magic 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.210
 large numbers 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.390
 all these 16 20 24 megapixels these 5 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.550
 10x zoom and so beckon and the price of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.180
 them so attractive not these 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.480
 small numbers Zazie 35 May 6 for what 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.849
 who cares aperture 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.689
 the more the better right at the very 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.180
 on the contrary 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.840
 or here is the size of the matrix but then yes 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.540
 the more the better but confused on the net 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.539
 one to two integer notation 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.950
 tenth to understand something like this 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.260
 manufacturers enjoys and often 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.199
 save on the dimensions of the matrix and luminosity 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.039
 Lens let's say would come to the Crimea 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.559
 and wanted to shoot a tank at sunset 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.809
 in the distance and kind of and became flat and 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.329
 stabilization turned osinki anyway 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.519
 blurry and without a tripod and all 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.159
 because it is not enough luminosity 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.070
 do buy a system camera or and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.189
 SLR miss lenses or hire 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.799
 a slave so that he is always dragged behind you or 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.619
 ask a guy if you're a girl like 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.790
 it turned out not at all for is forgotten 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.030
 olympus whi 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.610
 one new ultrazoom high-end class with 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.799
 aperture 2 and 8 on everything in the segment 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.720
 focal length was once 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.759
 panasonic with the same constantly 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.520
 luminous but his matrix was 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.159
 the size of the points looks like new 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.189
 like a miniature film camera very 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.200
 similar to the younger mirrorless M10 and 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.149
 not only externally but also technological 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.250
 it is made in durable metal 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.590
 rough painted housing 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.780
 holding the stylus alone is not as convenient as 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.939
 some photic series trailer with 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.920
 massive grip well for compactness 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.689
 You can donate this to the last 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.240
 time olympus began to take care of 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.610
 bad memory users and instead 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.250
 conventional caps on the lens are installed 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.009
 curtains that do not need to be removed before 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.039
 filming by the way despite this 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.509
 additional 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.359
 the tic element turns on the camera 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.159
 quickly in less than a second 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:17.739
 corrugated ring objectively here is not for 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.439
 decorations it is quite legitimate and 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.450
 responsible for various shooting parameters in 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.700
 depending on the mode being essentially 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.379
 one of the discs by the way its very convenient 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.659
 use for manual focus 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.549
 there is a duplicate to the right of the lens 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.470
 zoom lever which is convenient 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.239
 use when videotaping 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.099
 the zoom speed is set to 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.650
 Separately above the lift button 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.209
 built-in flash the flash itself is pretty 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.370
 so low when 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.500
 macro shot shadows appear there are also 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.750
 hot shoe so you can connect 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.939
 and an external flash to the left of the lens 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.769
 programmable button switch 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.870
 to install quick access to 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.150
 various parameters above lamp 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.549
 autofocus backlight turns on the camera 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.739
 a small button on top is near 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.720
 read the same video button 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.760
 the main thing is not to confuse and in pursuit of 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.200
 the plot does not turn off sochi on camera like 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.970
 and m10 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.829
 this camera has a wonderful three 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.870
 inch screen with a higher resolution 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.599
 million points and wide viewing angles 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.599
 it is also equipped with an inclined mechanism 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.989
 also the stylus one inherited 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.299
 high quality electronic 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.109
 viewfinder with resolution almost one and a half 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.389
 million points 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.459
 it completely duplicates the functions of the main 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.680
 screen allows you to correctly evaluate 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.479
 plot when shooting in bright sunshine under 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.569
 there are two interfaces on the side 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:34.000
 branded usb port and microchip battery 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.819
 capacity of 1000 150 milliampere hours 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.159
 just enough for 230 shots pretty 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.129
 little though if you use more 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.840
 viewfinder that can be as catty 300 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.530
 anyway the spare battery is not 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.430
 interfere with the size of the matrix here is one to 1.7 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.709
 inches a resolution of only 12 megapixels 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.500
 but do not listen to those who say that they have 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.959
 The phone is better because it is 16 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.030
 years 20 megapixels watched in that 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.979
 bulk sensors soap dish 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.250
 smartphones has a significantly smaller 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:08.590
 area and be there at least 50 megapixels 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.689
 Such a detail as in the stylus one is not 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.599
 will be the main thing this skill is good 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:16.180
 process the photo and in this regard u 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:18.329
 Olympus thanks to the processors corpse 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.329
 corpse 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.639
 dead end in this case 6 generations all 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.850
 very good and there is also technology with 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.949
 name starts with the second and so on 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.320
 anyone will shoot better than others 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:35.120
 Now the essence of technology is 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.070
 first of all in high 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.620
 performance with insufficient 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.289
 standard superzoom coverage and give 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.259
 noisy picture already with iso 800 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.180
 and the stylus even has iso 1600 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.100
 working sensitivity is not worth it 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.440
 forget and about rock support with him you 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.210
 get a lot more opportunities when 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.370
 image processing home 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.250
 The feature of this camera of course became 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.830
 the lens is assembled from ultra thin glue 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.750
 low and dispersed lenses coated 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.759
 zero through which achieved 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.160
 impressive performance for pretty 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.500
 modest size hope good glue 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.860
 for example at the moment the focal length 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.990
 varies from 28 to 300 millimeters 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.000
 providing nearly 11 multiple approximations 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.070
 Of course craters on the moon consider 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.410
 difficult but less distant objects 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.389
 will be sharp even if you shoot them 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.520
 in the evening it is all thanks to a small 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.979
 extracts which will provide aperture of 2 and 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.260
 8 throughout the focal length segment 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.630
 sharpness is good at any focal and 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.080
 even with a fully open aperture but 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.820
 the ideal in this world is just me so there is 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.760
 slight flaw in optical 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.900
 systems decent amount 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.120
 chromatic aberrations yes such 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.400
 purple halos around small details 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.620
 for example branches that are not cleaned 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.750
 programmatically in the lens also have 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.270
 stabilization system which is not less 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.340
 important for image clarity usually with 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.050
 compact cameras are quite difficult 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.150
 achieve a blur background when shooting 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.370
 portraits as it requires large 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.190
 focal lengths or holy ones 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.349
 lenses but here stealth excelled in it 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.479
 just combining both that is why 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:11.120
 already on 100 millimeters it will turn out very 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.159
 a pleasant bokya is probably the only thing 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.169
 than this camera is inferior to most 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.190
 compacts so it is in possibilities 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.650
 macro photography 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.020
 she can focus starting at five 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.360
 centimeters from the object while 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.280
 other cameras almost closely 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.979
 taking pictures still in the lens 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.580
 very small but very proud detail 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.439
 not 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.419
 real light filter it allows 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:34.220
 increase exposure for different species 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.530
 artistic shooting and just 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.930
 taking pictures in a very bright sun 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.300
 fotik allows you to shoot up to 25 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.639
 images grew at 7 frames 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.979
 per second really come on legitimate din and 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.780
 each DSL is so able to focus 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.319
 also pretty fast and no complaints 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.939
 causes 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.009
 Wi fi here with standard 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:54.259
 video functionality writes something with 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:56.000
 Full hd resolution with standard 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.699
 30 frames per second 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.620
 picture quality is quite good lower 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.110
 resolution, you can shoot videos with 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.000
 up to 240 frames per second for 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.919
 slow motion sometimes 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.900
 It turns out very funny at olympus 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.719
 turned out excellent compact 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.940
 the camera is light and fast and versatile 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:15.349
 it will suit beginners thanks 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.539
 clear interface 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:19.550
 as well as her ability is enough for 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:22.580
 she has practically no professionals 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.419
 disadvantages for the exception, perhaps prices with 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.520
 the other side 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:27.469
 any of mirrorless ones with the same 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.590
 a set of optics will cost more 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:31.789
 by the way today is the eighth of March and you could 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.460
 I have to make you some small 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:36.800
 present for example if you are not 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.740
 subscribed to another channel then subscribe 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.240
 or like this video still could me 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.340
 leave some nice ones 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.520
 comments I would be very pleased a 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:51.819
 if you are a girl then congratulations to you and 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.819
 I wish you a good bright peaceful spring
