00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.950
 everything is good for everyone and gabriel 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.360
 forfend android put on the stand 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.160
 huawei with assene g6 4g 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.470
 it's a smartphone that's equipped with a 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.830
 4 inch screen with qhd resolution 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.980
 960 by 540 pixels 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.320
 we also have a 2000 battery or 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.390
 milliamps 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.910
 a photo sensor on the back 2 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.380
 8 megapixels 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.380
 that you see here with his flash led 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.430
 we also have a quad core processor 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.200
 from qualcomm clocked at 1.2 ghz 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.140
 so one of the particularities this phone 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.840
 except that it is 4g it's 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 interface so we are on an interface 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.619
 and motion 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.990
 ah and from huawei and you will see 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.350
 that's the customization is enough 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.659
 driven 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.890
 so when we are on the teeth everything is 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.030
 customizable ie from 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.810
 lockscreen going through the 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.810
 applications them 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.960
 the offices the widgets and so this is where 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.940
 it's a type of lockscreen that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.040
 now that jenny like that so in 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.130
 unlocks you of course have access 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.909
 different offices and at the level of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.530
 the customization you there we are sure to 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.090
 this theme you will see that you do not have 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.420
 a lot when I 'm at the app 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420
 of cream 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.440
 to choose 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.170
 different so the CG this one breaks 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.860
 default 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.040
 there you see when I change from 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.620
 m 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.000
 really on very very very interfaces 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.350
 different 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.350
 for example I applied this one 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.030
 there you go without a few seconds 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.780
 the shape of the icons changes the lockscreen 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.780
 also 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.959
 If you want 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.060
 modified for example this widget which 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.280
 precisely 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.630
 I will select it 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.130
 go on the different offices is 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.130
 true replica this one 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.840
 you want to change the order have deleted 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:29.970
 and widgets yes I can take it I 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.970
 can delete or change places 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.620
 it's done on four lines so it's 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.140
 very customizable you can put 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.850
 these mothers your photos and your your 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.810
 music player your contacts etc 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.580
 at the bottom we scroll 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.660
 different budget that one the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.660
 in the name here 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.770
 so the interface on that side and 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.600
 customizable on the other hand 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.190
 all applications are present 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.740
 directly on the desk ie 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.420
 we have no dap launchers and if ever 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.260
 you want to remove an icon 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.390
 visually 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.790
 in fact you prove past either you 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.270
 have the application on the desks and to 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.550
 install them 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.660
 either uninstall you directly 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.150
 the application for canes appear 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.380
 more than that it's a shame because 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.130
 here is an interface 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.030
 he is 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.900
 suddenly 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.730
 whose 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.159
 rather neat that we can really 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.290
 arranged to our taste against it is 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.370
 for applications that's not it 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.980
 can have an application that is 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.310
 installed and not displayed on the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.110
 office 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.110
 it's really a shame 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.660
 we can also find an interface 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.190
 very very simplified then for that 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.840
 I will go to the options 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.080
 so either you stay leaning on a 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.690
 empty place of the interface 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.930
 either you select the options button 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.830
 which is at the bottom right of the device 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.010
 why obviously selected these 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.120
 wallpapers these widgets 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.620
 edit it 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.870
 the home page like as I lÃ© 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.349
 have the effects of 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.349
 transition 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.930
 but what I wanted to show you 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.540
 it was the mode 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.880
 very simple interface so simply 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.830
 here 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.650
 we press them and access them 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.880
 big icons that totally simplifies 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.260
 interface so we really do not 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.959
 the feeling of being sure of 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.790
 android when we see that it's like 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.870
 we had we had a new launcher 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.870
 it gives me quick access 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.500
 your applications 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.510
 this is for example phone 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.889
 when you come back to home you have 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.210
 all forms of colorful icons 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.600
 want to switch to a more interface 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.590
 classical 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.590
 click on standard or 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.900
 There you go 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.490
 for the rest we have a bar of 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.009
 pretty classic notifications with the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.020
 shortcuts 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.580
 the options menu also picks up what 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.360
 does what does android does not have 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.770
 a lot of 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.770
 of customization on that side 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.639
 and now we have a phone that is 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.520
 located on the mid-range which is 4g 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.800
 at 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.169
 with a price then I do not have here but 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.060
 knowing huawei it must be a price 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.690
 interestingly enough we are on the report 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.729
 price quality 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.490
 and as you see at the level of 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.870
 finishes know it's not bad at all 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:23.240
 rest of the plastic but of good quality 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.430
 the finishes are pretty good I have the 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.960
 white version here but there is 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.750
 also in metallic version 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.180
 with slices as colorful and that's it 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.990
 pink slice for example if we are 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.990
 more about a color time 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.170
 so here it was a little catch in 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.430
 hand of wealth and justice 4g I hope 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.600
 that you liked it and we find ourselves very 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.600
 fast on frandroid hi to all
