00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.270
 description I will leave a link 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.640
 where they will be putting the games 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.080
 that are already available 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.230
 or you can check them on the official website 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.760
 of xbox in this case is the two that 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.550
 now you can play them 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.770
 whether you had them on your hard drive in 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:59.340
 arcade not from your xbox 360 or if you had them 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.800
 physically on your disk if it is the case 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.290
 that they have gas in physical 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.960
 NomÃ¡s you put the disc in your tray the 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.180
 xbox one and you can play it if you do not 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.130
 you have this you will have to download it as 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.080
 in my case I have the mass effect but 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.690
 I bought it by downloading in its 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.609
 digital version then I would have here 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.470
 have to download it and it says that 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.120
 we just have to install it and a 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.510
 once installed then 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:34.270
 we can play it in our xbox one 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:38.139
 gentlemen here will appear remember the weight 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.410
 of the games is a lot more are more 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:44.290
 small those of box 360 that those of one 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.930
 then maybe it will cover about 7 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.410
 8 gigas more or less each game of xbox 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:54.010
 360 for backward compatibility then 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.449
 Now I just showed you where they are 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.729
 because if they are hidden there is no 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.560
 let's say that a section that says ah 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.380
 look here you are going to download it 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.660
 you have to go and you have to look for this 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.030
 part sometimes comes out sometimes does not come out 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.460
 but as I already told you if I did not 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.070
 comes out double this double click to the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.490
 right so he talks to you open them 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.070
 sorry is this games tab and 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.020
 well this as you can see the mass 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.880
 effect is the only one that I have right now 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.400

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.470

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.860
 prior so they can do this and 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.960
