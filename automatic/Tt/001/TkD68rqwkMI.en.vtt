 we excuse again but good 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.160
 So here we go to 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.960
 tutorials that you go to 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.980

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.130
 coming in so you go on t4 are 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.270
 tasted loaded so and mick gp that I 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.580
 you would have minera description as 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.650
 usually then you go on so 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.080
 the tauren you doubleclick and that you 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:34.500
 send this officer from mvp mvp in format 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.510
 iso or done that must open with so 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.719
 I have diamond tools then the player bd 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.059
 rom will gonna open up once you 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.129
 will have to mount images will open up and 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.050
 so you hit run so 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.120
 like me in the video it will launch 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.850
 then the 2000 setup program 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.989
 gp which you install it you 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.000
 install it right here is once 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.120
 installed so it will ask you 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.670
 to install so a crosoft would say x and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.610
 all this will be to mark there will be 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.140
 three things to tick it seems to me 3 to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.280
 two I know more but stole lying in 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.909
 Anyway this is a time that at 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.240
 you're going to install your direct live 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.009
 x and all that and then so I do not know 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.619
 not if you're gonna do it but that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.119
 will mark repair or uninstall you 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.640
 have it repaired every two months 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.320
 shows me and twice actually prepared 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.460
 logically it should do it 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.119
 it looks like it should work so 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.500
 in these installs here is to finish then 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.520
 so we go to crack 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.399
 so you go on your drive 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.649
 that by your stuff workstations 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.590
 what and you will logically drive 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.570
 bd rom crack player comic g to click 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.260
 on top you will have file where it will be 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.080
 appointed 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.830
 who will be named so crack select 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.240
 both files and therefore both 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.610
 files had taken you off in the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.369
 program where was installed and mick gp 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.830
 so that's logically his records 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.580
 which his probable files and mick gp 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.700
 you still there and you enlist another 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.670
 you stick another one you collar and 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.690
 the two files another time in the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.420
 file in the installed folder 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:32.370
 the installer so you can so the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.520
 two crack files in don how 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.230
 tell the gp installation folder 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.070
 as I did and another in the 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.420
 folder installed so that's afterwards if 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.540
 you want when I go you can 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.980
 which you click on my that the little 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.930
 of mxgp application icons and it's okay 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.660
 start your game but if you want 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.480
 configure your your computer for 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.550
 to be able to exploit the maximum day so 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.690
 if you have amd fire right click on 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.970
 your workstation by with grafite 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.739
 communal graphic or when he types I 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.050
 know more too and so you go 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.090
 so look for mxgp the file 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.090
 applications and so you click on 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.080
 for on the on the file to make 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.550
 high performance 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.670
 finally how the video I hope that 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.510
