00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.340
 so people welcome back to let's play 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.860
 final fantasy 13 2 for the playstation 3 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.990
 in the last part we have some 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.460
 done deals regarding here 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.529
 academia and that's what I mean 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.410
 and now there is a very, very, very 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.300
 negative message for you you see 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.390
 already at the memory stand I already have 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.559
 160 of 160 fragments are so called 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.250
 played buffer game 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.180
 so off screen it has reasons why 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.339
 I did that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.829
 I became more or less 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:50.820
 forced I had no choice 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.250
 i had recordings of all videos from 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 this point to the perfect game have 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.280
 then started uploading the videos 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.160
 and then have a complaint of square 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.640
 get enix and that was called very 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.339
 dear mister pictures the same 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.800
 we are of the opinion that sigrid 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.009
 content and video sequences cgi 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.940
 Video sequences are not shown as such 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.820
 should be in higher resolution so in 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.300
 720p and so on that means I was 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.750
 said I should do so now especially 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.069
 like here video sequences should i 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.000
 Do not show and I should not win and 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.619
 could show 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 in the end I have already done so 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.429
 have shown many sigrid things 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.030
 Also no problem with this one has to 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.770
 say 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.080
 the problem is specifically to the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.539
 Paradox endings that was the only one 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.300
 what we still missed paradox n left 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.130
 and sigrid endings so then i have one 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.720
 a little bit of research there is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.160
 of course on the internet 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.780
 these sigrid endings and yes as I said 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.910
 there are people who somehow have it 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.039
 were somehow bypassed 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.360
 Nevertheless, the siko tellings show and 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.190
 I want you to do it well though 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.440
 yes, not withheld if I 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.479
 100 percent of us already played 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.020
 that's why in the video 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.989
 description are left to all eight 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.520
 paradox endings of other people 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.860
 English mostly because I think 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.870
 the German be hard to find and 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.310
 the secret endingen is everything in the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.180
 video description maybe linked 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.280
 a few other extras videos 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.980
 As I said, I can not help you 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.560
 I could show you now maybe 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.700
 just want to show a victory and boss fight 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.530
 I do not do it now because I already do 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000
 I'm a little bit upset that I am 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.590
 could not completely absorb there 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.849
 I was already able to show all that 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.510
 you have to adapt a bit 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.159
 say so by and large 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.450
 our perfect game reaches your seat 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.540
 a storage I'll show you too 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.099
 again here 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.019
 fragment categories we all have 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.189
 Fragments could look through 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:55.060
 pause if you are not sure 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:57.799
 then fragment skills we all have 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.510
 yes what maybe interesting is now 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.310
 to explain is the chrono dance there 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.139
 to upload your speed often high 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.120
 normal and speed 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.459
 set it slower so could quasi 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.139
 exploit an ingame speed button for 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.389
 drive and what my team something for everyone 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:18.639
 fighting is suitable if you are adone thus 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:21.889
 So here is that two then kÃ¼sschen 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:24.680
 the goblins crooked chain and the 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.829
 water cannons or groups of masters 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.659
 master in german so 99 level everything 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.829
 Highly learned everything maximizes perfect 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.040
 stadium guide is a video 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.900
 description as said play hours 166 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.519
 light predominantly because of that 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.400
 console also run overnight 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.030
 I did not ask why it is 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.599
 just like we said we have everything 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.939
 reached 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.269
 so now here comes also only times 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:52.639
 an achievement an achievement for me 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:57.519
 and not for square enix for final 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:57.519
 Fantasy 13-2 as a buffer game 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.780
 I 'd best do that now 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.459
 you can think of sql left express because 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.049
 I'm a bit pissed off but me 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.849
 can the good white bendix of course 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.349
 I also understand on one side 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.150
 must say it is a pity, of course 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.980
 you programmed so many into the game 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.930
 sigrid and then they make you short 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.669
 be revealed the same so no one 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.750
 company less people interested in that 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.070
 play by yourself 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.539
 i can understand for marketing reasons 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.100
 but nevertheless it has got it 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.470
 my personal opinion you can yes 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.639
 times in the video description or hd 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.509
 video description in the comments 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.820
 write 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.639
 what you think about what you think about it 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.270
 and short statement i will be on everyone 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.830
 because if they're eight nine and ten 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.110
 they have no problem playing there 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.970
 it's all about the new games too 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.620
 Kingdom Hearts 1 Finished playing kingdom 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.680
 I want to play hearts 2 too 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.780
 do not worry anything older than 13 2 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.849
 I will play 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.800
 anything new than 13 2 I'll get it from 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.030
 Do not play at the beginning because I do not 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.280
 another theater with square enix 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.409
 I would like to have people like that then 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.659
 We'll see each other in the next project 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.909
 13 2 is completed the next final 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.919
 fantasy what follows is final fantasy 8 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.020
 but that will be for a while 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.789
 wait for me there now others 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.360
 projects in the sense I would have 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:18.449
 say we meet people I'm up 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.449
 then
