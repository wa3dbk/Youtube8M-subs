you some of the reasons why I bought

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.809 
you some of the reasons why I bought
this<00:01:49.380> car<00:01:49.679> because<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.100> think<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.610> very

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
this car because I think it's a very

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.630 
this car because I think it's a very
good<00:01:51.319> restoration<00:01:52.319> candidate<00:01:53.069> some<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
good restoration candidate some of the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.149 
good restoration candidate some of the
paint<00:01:54.569> was<00:01:54.689> ground<00:01:54.990> off<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> beating<00:01:56.039> is

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
paint was ground off here the beating is

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
paint was ground off here the beating is
often<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.700> weak<00:01:57.149> spot<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> looks<00:01:58.229> like

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
often a weak spot and so it looks like

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.559 
often a weak spot and so it looks like
somebody<00:01:58.829> got<00:01:59.090> started<00:02:00.090> with<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.329> project

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
somebody got started with this project

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.389 
somebody got started with this project
with<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.110> bit<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.289> sanding<00:02:01.740> or<00:02:01.860> grinding

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
with a little bit of sanding or grinding

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.580 
with a little bit of sanding or grinding
and<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.179> about<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.539> far<00:02:03.569> as<00:02:03.899> they<00:02:04.080> got<00:02:04.259> but

this one's actually it might have had a
repair<00:02:51.180> right<00:02:51.450> here<00:02:52.850> but<00:02:53.989> it's<00:02:54.989> good<00:02:55.260> metal

Russ problem which you'll see on the
driver's<00:04:50.180> side<00:04:50.210> in<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.570> minute<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:51.020> there's

driver's side in a minute and there's

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.770 
driver's side in a minute and there's
the<00:04:51.950> inner<00:04:52.160> sill<00:04:52.550> where<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.420> rust<00:04:53.600> through

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
the inner sill where the rust through

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.320 
the inner sill where the rust through
has<00:04:53.960> occurred<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:55.310> can<00:04:55.460> see<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:55.790> whole

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
has occurred you can see that whole

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.820 
has occurred you can see that whole
front<00:04:56.630> portion<00:04:57.050> is<00:04:57.170> going<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:57.380> need<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.590> be

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
front portion is going to need to be

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.890 
front portion is going to need to be
replaced<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.730> I<00:04:58.880> think<00:04:59.120> what<00:04:59.270> I<00:04:59.300> would<00:04:59.390> do<00:04:59.720> is

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
replaced and I think what I would do is

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.880 
replaced and I think what I would do is
actually<00:05:00.400> cut<00:05:01.400> here<00:05:02.330> because<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.350> floor<00:05:03.590> pans

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
actually cut here because the floor pans

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.460 
actually cut here because the floor pans
fine<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.580> forward<00:05:05.090> outer<00:05:05.720> rocker<00:05:06.170> is

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
fine and the forward outer rocker is

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.160 
fine and the forward outer rocker is
fine<00:05:06.740> i<00:05:06.770> would<00:05:07.010> just<00:05:07.130> cut<00:05:07.340> this<00:05:07.490> out<00:05:07.700> and<00:05:08.170> patch

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
fine i would just cut this out and patch

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.920 
fine i would just cut this out and patch
it<00:05:09.200> there<00:05:09.920> is<00:05:10.040> this<00:05:10.220> one<00:05:10.520> hole<00:05:10.850> here<00:05:11.360> in<00:05:11.540> the

floor pan a small patch could be welded

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.240 
floor pan a small patch could be welded
in<00:05:14.330> there<00:05:14.540> too<00:05:14.810> that's<00:05:15.680> how<00:05:15.920> i<00:05:15.950> would<00:05:16.100> handle

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
in there too that's how i would handle

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.600 
in there too that's how i would handle
inside<00:05:17.030> here<00:05:17.510> on<00:05:17.800> this<00:05:18.800> particular<00:05:19.100> bug<00:05:19.460> i

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
with the car there is a new outer rocker

with the car there is a new outer rocker
panel<00:05:23.510> it's<00:05:23.630> got<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.930> little<00:05:24.080> surface<00:05:24.560> rust

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
panel it's got a little surface rust

panel it's got a little surface rust
from<00:05:24.980> sitting<00:05:25.310> around<00:05:25.400> but<00:05:25.880> that<00:05:26.060> app<00:05:26.660> section

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
from sitting around but that app section

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.620 
from sitting around but that app section
I<00:05:27.350> would<00:05:27.530> slice<00:05:27.830> off<00:05:28.100> and<00:05:28.490> then<00:05:29.060> I<00:05:29.090> would<00:05:29.390> weld

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
I would slice off and then I would weld

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.200 
I would slice off and then I would weld
it<00:05:29.810> right<00:05:29.990> onto<00:05:30.170> this<00:05:30.470> area<00:05:31.460> here<00:05:31.820> this<00:05:32.060> has

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
it right onto this area here this has

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.780 
it right onto this area here this has
been<00:05:32.810> ground<00:05:33.170> a<00:05:33.350> way<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.530> prepare<00:05:34.370> it<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:34.670> then

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
been ground a way to prepare it and then

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.130 
been ground a way to prepare it and then
there's<00:05:34.970> a<00:05:35.030> little<00:05:35.210> surface<00:05:35.570> rust<00:05:35.750> but<00:05:35.990> this

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
there's a little surface rust but this

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.170 
there's a little surface rust but this
half<00:05:36.680> portion<00:05:37.280> of<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.430> rocker<00:05:37.640> needs<00:05:37.970> to<00:05:38.090> be

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
half portion of the rocker needs to be

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.900 
half portion of the rocker needs to be
cut<00:05:38.390> off<00:05:38.540> and<00:05:38.900> repaired<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.160> then<00:05:40.580> the<00:05:40.760> rest

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
cut off and repaired and then the rest

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.330 
cut off and repaired and then the rest
of<00:05:41.030> the<00:05:41.150> rocker<00:05:41.330> is<00:05:41.540> not<00:05:41.720> too<00:05:41.960> bad<00:05:42.200> so<00:05:42.710> what<00:05:43.310> I

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
of the rocker is not too bad so what I

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.210 
of the rocker is not too bad so what I
would<00:05:43.460> probably<00:05:43.760> do<00:05:44.240> is<00:05:44.510> cut<00:05:45.380> this<00:05:45.560> forward

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
would probably do is cut this forward

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.880 
would probably do is cut this forward
portion<00:05:46.550> off<00:05:46.850> this<00:05:47.030> inner<00:05:47.300> cell<00:05:47.680> this<00:05:48.680> is<00:05:48.860> a

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
portion off this inner cell this is a

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.310 
portion off this inner cell this is a
whole<00:05:49.160> new<00:05:49.430> intersil<00:05:50.360> piece<00:05:50.570> the<00:05:50.780> full<00:05:51.020> length

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
whole new intersil piece the full length

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.140 
whole new intersil piece the full length
but<00:05:51.980> really<00:05:52.250> all<00:05:52.280> you<00:05:52.490> need<00:05:52.670> is<00:05:52.790> the<00:05:52.910> forward

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
but really all you need is the forward

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.210 
but really all you need is the forward
portion<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.840> would<00:05:53.990> cut<00:05:54.200> this<00:05:54.350> off<00:05:54.560> cut<00:05:54.919> out<00:05:55.040> on

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
portion I would cut this off cut out on

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.460 
portion I would cut this off cut out on
the<00:05:55.340> inside<00:05:55.730> and<00:05:55.970> weld<00:05:56.600> an<00:05:56.750> employee<00:05:57.140> I<00:05:57.260> just

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
the inside and weld an employee I just

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.450 
the inside and weld an employee I just
show<00:05:57.650> you<00:05:57.680> how<00:05:57.890> nice

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
show you how nice

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.670 
show you how nice
the<00:05:58.550> rear<00:05:59.030> section<00:05:59.750> of<00:05:59.870> this<00:05:59.960> car<00:06:00.229> looks<00:06:00.500> they

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
the rear section of this car looks they
