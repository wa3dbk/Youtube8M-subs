turbocharged petrol engine with 82

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.760 
turbocharged petrol engine with 82
horsepower<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:54.870> much<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.079> bit<00:00:55.379> puny

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
horsepower which is not much a bit puny

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.639 
horsepower which is not much a bit puny
but<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.399> does<00:00:56.670> weigh<00:00:56.940> under<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> thousand<00:00:58.289> kilos

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
but it does weigh under a thousand kilos

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.889 
but it does weigh under a thousand kilos
so<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> actual<00:00:59.340> actually<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> engine<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.270> is

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
so the actual actually the engine and is

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.380 
so the actual actually the engine and is
quite<00:01:01.109> well<00:01:01.289> matched<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> car<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:03.030> then

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
quite well matched with the car so then

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
quite well matched with the car so then
these<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.530> only<00:01:04.650> buttons<00:01:05.010> you've<00:01:05.100> got<00:01:05.250> in

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the whole car that's stereo volume then

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
the whole car that's stereo volume then
you've<00:01:07.229> got<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.549> DMS<00:01:08.549> buttons<00:01:08.939> turn<00:01:09.210> traction

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
you've got the DMS buttons turn traction

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.260 
you've got the DMS buttons turn traction
control<00:01:10.110> off<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:10.740> hazards<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.310> didn't

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270

really<00:01:12.420> need<00:01:12.630> trash<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.110> control<00:01:13.470> because

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
really need trash and control because

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.410 
really need trash and control because
there's<00:01:13.830> only<00:01:13.890> got<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.250> 82<00:01:14.760> horsepower<00:01:15.240> but

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
there's only got so 82 horsepower but

of those have been on the motorway and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.260 
of those have been on the motorway and
the<00:01:55.649> rest<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:56.009> been<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.399> very<00:01:56.729> short<00:01:56.969> trips

as tech goes very quick tour of the

as tech goes very quick tour of the
interior<00:03:45.209> we've<00:03:45.780> got<00:03:45.959> an<00:03:46.079> enormous<00:03:46.769> glovebox

really<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.840> very<00:03:49.049> big<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.350> reason<00:03:49.590> for<00:03:49.680> that

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
really is very big the reason for that

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.720 
really is very big the reason for that
is<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.280> airbag<00:03:50.579> is<00:03:51.329> in<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.600> roof<00:03:51.750> here<00:03:51.989> I

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
is that the airbag is in the roof here I

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.840 
is that the airbag is in the roof here I
do<00:03:53.730> like<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.090> design<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.370> Picasso<00:03:56.400> I'll

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
do like the design of the Picasso I'll

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.250 
do like the design of the Picasso I'll
show<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.120> outside<00:03:57.359> on<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.840> different<00:03:58.140> video

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
show you outside on a different video

this<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.600> obviously<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.959> save<00:04:04.230> way<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.829> door

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
this is obviously to save way the door
