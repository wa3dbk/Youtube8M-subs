00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.099
 and welcome to 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.259
 the canale weather I'm never games lp 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.150
 of course only for you today will be the 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.070
 see a little weapons guide 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.029
 also on my channel personally 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.160
 is continued 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.810
 today we skate it will be here 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.130
 first of all, that's how I run 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.869
 the story behind this weapon 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.939
 Tell us and then we come to the in 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.340
 game statistics as well as to the 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.259
 gameplay with this weapon which means 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.730
 Ever stars cars stands for special 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.739
 come of the soul doubt 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.870
 she is a so-called multi caliber 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.059
 the mission is the united special 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.600
 forces started with the development 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.780
 was in about 2003 final tests 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.110
 were executed in the middle of 2006 approximately in 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.539
 2008 started production 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.640
 In 2009, she was even already 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:56.449
 units assigned to the US Army 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.539
 there are a total of 2 model aden this kmk 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.489
 16 former name is khan as well as ours 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.480
 today's variant so this variant the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.210
 I introduce today 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.940
 the variant mk the same in k17 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.440
 Sorry the skate we are going now 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.130
 just a short time back in the 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.920
 past 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.480
 on 15 October 2003, it began to 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.440
 to think about a new one 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.210
 assault rifle 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.220
 the meaning behind it had been easy 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.840
 that one has the possibility on the 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.920
 battlefield various ammunition 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.900
 data to use 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.060
 it can really happen that time 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.680
 the ammunition goes out a little 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.900
 example would be just that in this one 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.230
 trap ammunition of an enemy 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.150
 can 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.430
 although ammo and weapon actually 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.050
 not compatible are usually the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.660
 skate 176 2 x 150 mm nato caliber the 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.690
 then with this method but on 76 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.670
 2 x 39 mm could have been converted 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.360
 The housing consists mostly of 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.710
 polymers as well as aluminum 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.090
 what I had forgotten to say 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.000
 it's just that these weapons are from 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.230
 Belgian company fabrique national 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.940
 At that time the office was made 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.340
 yes yes that is really pronounced 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.810
 according to google translator the system was what 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.760
 I have just introduced 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.380
 but not yet produced 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.179
 So far, it really only remains one 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.979
 vision if you want to call it that 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.780
 the two models differ 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.460
 in that different starting lengths 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.470
 The shoulder can be chosen 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.450
 Support is extendable as well as 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.180
 a body what the model in battlefield 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.970
 3 is therefore klos quarter the 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.740
 firing rate of ska comes with 625 shots 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.300
 in the minute so what actually 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.010
 really very low 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.440
 she has a twist lock and her 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.670
 loading music runs with gas pressure so me 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.290
 We think we'll come to it now 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.030
 the battlefield 3 live acts for me 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.250
 think everything was really said 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.420
 worth knowing is catching on my channel 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.390
 I always with the damage to seat 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.460
 Decide from 20 to 30 30 is the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.280
 you can unlock maximum value you 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.940
 with 14,000 pioneers spark theirs at first 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.630
 ammunition capacity of 115 +21 in 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.280
 magazine 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.530
 usually your magazine is 20 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.700
 cartridges big plus one of course then 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.650
 with in the course counted 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.740
 the maximum will lead with you 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.240
 can lies at 168 cartridges one sees 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.700
 really excellent after 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.040
 Charging speed this is 225 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.710
 seconds if it is cartridge magazine 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.900
 and 2 85 seconds when empty 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.860
 In the game, the fire rate is changing 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.290
 graduations in the minute 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.760
 which is really damn low 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.470
 but really does not matter because she 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.790
 has a lot of damage to the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.740
 reach I can not say that 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.300
 this is 630 meters 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.560
 I think we are at the point now 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.540
 arrived where I mean with you 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.400
 personal setup chat this 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.140
 Weapon is really only for short as well 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.060
 at medium distance suitable for 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.950
 longer distance really does not make it 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.420
 sense to play with this weapon two 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.340
 Things have to know here in any case 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.170
 are really very small then very small 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.240
 why you definitely the 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.920
 must learn to use this weapon 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.930
 second point is definitely up 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.340
 middle distance you really have to be very 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.410
 strongly countering the shots 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.910
 not too much up when 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.950
 I use this weapon for a short distance 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.900
 I use the normal red dot 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.760
 visor the handle and of course the 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.349
 laser pointer for sprayer on the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.000
 middle distance uses this 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.310
 weapon with the holographic visor 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.200
 reached in and the laser pointer when you 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.270
 of course wanted to attack 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.590
 at short distance to undetected too 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.630
 stay then we definitely used 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.099
 the silencer i think you will notice 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.900
 already it is really easy with 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.819
 to play this weapon she is one 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.260
 real allround weapon i 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.459
 leave me now from you me 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.150
 Hope you have this video really 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.919
 very well 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.419
