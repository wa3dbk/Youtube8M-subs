00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.790
 good dear friends of youtube in 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.580
 this opportunity I bring you a 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.029
 application is called binner and is a 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.279
 application that is for mac and what 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.029
 allows is to be able to shoot any type 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.310
 from films to farming 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.369
 with this application you need to do 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.739
 jailbreak to the need that in the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.120
 Apple TV and it's a great solution for 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.240
 all assets and three that do not exist 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.860
 This good 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.870
 the website is the first app medium 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.420
 puntocom after the description left 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.550
 down in the good video the application 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.920
 one can download it to test the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.600
 Trial application only allows 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.600
 play and 15 minutes of movie 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.880
 then it closes this the 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.470
 requirements are a mac of 2007 in 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.290
 forward or have of os x 10.6 in 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.000
 go ahead and it works so much for the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.720
 second generation appletv like 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.479
 third generation also allows 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.400
 using subtitles already makes you turn 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.830
 rt and good also plays the 5 for 1 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.020
 and also uses this ts system of 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.790
 audio one of the most important things 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.880
 of this application is that also 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.610
 the tv3 remote control works 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.160
 hello admitted this with the application not 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.380
 be that one can advance pause or 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.600
 move forward or stop the application 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.190
 but if one does stop the application 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.200
 obviously already lose control of the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.720
 movie that is this is how to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.290
 drag drop it and watch the movie 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.330
 move from your chair does not work as if 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.090
 was the flex that was the only solution 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.680
 that there was for the crop and 3 but the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.460
 play is the difference it has with this 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.640
 is that you have a gallery that has 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.000
 as a movie base in his in his 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.750
 mac and can not be frame can be 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.490
 I also started to have a gallery of 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.220
 movies and see all with their 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.110
 respective respective caps and all that 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.370
 and description of each film 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.350
 the difference of this is the practicality 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.240
 the speed that one can 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.160
 and give the application without having to be 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.140
 Touching or juggling 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.700
 to be able to watch a movie to 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.100
 people who are not very experienced 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.380
 in the good life we ​​go to the application 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.020
 head I want to clarify that the application 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.880
 has a value of 15 dollars 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.690
 if we go to 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.940
 Sun 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.210
 you have 15 dollars there is no this 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.990
 application in the appstore since 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.580
 you just have to buy them through 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.530
 of the page for some reason at full 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.830
 allowed to integrate it into your app 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.450
 store we shoot the binner here I have 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.730
 loaded a movie but I'm going to close 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.530
 the video to show them how it starts 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.810
 directly our program that 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.790
 starts very very very really fast 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.950
 it seems to be something that connects 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.500
 directly does not require large 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.990
 resources to operate dragged a 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.240
 film look I'll show that I 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.850
 to drag one I can but not of 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.020
 boot I will not drag the subtitle 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.820
 I only fit him directly 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.740
 takes the subtitle obviously from 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.420
 subtitle has to be called the same and if 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.300
 It could not be like that and drag the two 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.280
 together and automatically it will take 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.830
 even if the subtitle was called from another 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.860
 way but I'm going to just drag you 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.420
 It fits me fits you charge me that 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.490
 copyright reasons I can not them 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.340
 show the movie so it's only 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.170
 I'm going to make a blu-ray to the movie 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.260
 so that you 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.150
 can see that it plays but not 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.790
 but can not see the movie because if 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.110
 are not going to cancel the video the people in 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.850
 the binner panel has 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.650
 the normal services of 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.260
 any program to check the break 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.800
 of the same program to open the 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.960
 recent files and this one if a good 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.680

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.200
 pause stop the audio theme in this 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.880
 case is a Romanian red film and good 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.470
 the audio I take it auto maintain 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.530
 automatically as it is Romanian the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.299
 movie and already directly something charge 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.760
 only without me doing anything I charge in 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.500
 automatic already loaded the src directly 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.300

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:40.090
 I apologize for the quality of the 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.090
 recording that I'm recording the screen 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.780
 the only way to capture it I will throw

 I'm going to advance from the movie 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:07.100
 just as if it were the tree there 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.100
 directly 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.740

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:38.759

 I hope you liked it 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:46.280
 it really is very obviously that if I 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:49.850
 for example I stop the movie I'm going to 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.800
 health menu I already lose control of what 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.740
 which is the application is not only 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.960
 shooting it from the computer where 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.810
 from there with the remote control 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.760
 we can let the application good go down 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.230
 the test application you will like 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.180
 much 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.660
 it really works very well and only 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.610
 worth $ 15 for what is is 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.300
 very good, I hope you have them 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.610
