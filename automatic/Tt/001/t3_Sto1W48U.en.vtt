00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.040
 and it is already 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.610
 you have to see the whole circuit 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.410
 a battery xix 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.810
 we have a town or the clear ones and what is dust with a piece of alan p the 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.319
 copper 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.009
 each one of the pillars of the correct 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.999
 the negative or positive 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.729
 the negative with positive in this case something or make negative 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.189
 and very clear positive role 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.279
 we are increasing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 never 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.950
 9 and mons 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.140
 for let's try with my boy below the 2015 reading 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.280
 the goal seemed 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 let's discuss it with the last one himself 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.920
 so you can see the reading at the rally 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.810
 being almost eight votes the cancer 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.770
 serene 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.560
 seven points 96 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.640
 is to take over the position 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.760
 I was going to do it because for us 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 a led diode a luminous god 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.030
 the longest part 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.820
 in the negative 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.130
 the negative is the longest in the longest leg on the pivot 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 and the public work the other 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.310
 contact portal 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.230
 in her 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.370
 that moment not for love what a quantity of light lost 1 but low for 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.330
 those in the house 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.960
 upon arriving for the guardianship 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.720
 in the kitchen we will see how it is going to keep them excited 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.060
 or take out a little more the phone 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.710
 cancer l 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.710
 ap lausanne in the cte 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.830
 if you have to wait 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.230
 there is the splendid 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.390
 in the few with the lemons as a battery 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.940
 but with 8 volts 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.679
 that price is a little dot 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.069
 for example porfirio 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.069
 efe 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.289
 by the way is that he pointed 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.879
 in the power 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.959
 ballot parties with which seeks the battery of voters to verify 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.219
 the expert recalled that when you put them 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.779
 but I think they take out to present 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:42.249
 that is one of the sides is cut but competent to little holder 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.019
 state 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.019
 but it stands out 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:55.129
 that is our double dio that turns on a battery with eight votes 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.869
 natural 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:59.779
 the monex 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.900
 which has a remarkable high 8 volts but enough electric current that presides 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.599
 first the light 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.379
 the phone camera was even close to health 

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:17.409
 when reading 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.219
 you can see the luminosity 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.219
 the comet again in the musac the eighth 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.799
 You have to see that it went off again 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.239
 maybe next time 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.439
 you get to see intended changes of shutdown 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.439
 very close to the abel camera 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.239
 forever 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:40.359
 we'll see
