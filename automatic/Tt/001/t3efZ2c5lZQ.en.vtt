 I do not know what is the reason that takes so much success of these genres comedy 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.080
 grow naturally 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.160
 I think she 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.950
 the art of comedy is a very original format 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.900
 everything the comedian took to the stage he wanted everything out of his head since 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.310

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.909
 reacts we are accustomed as weight 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.859
 the agent imitations but like the generation of comedians who redo the 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.079
 original text 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.089

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.950
 after the vote of a lot of good people do not talk about doors for all 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.070
 russian sides 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.050
 it's nominating selection I'm more serious about the things you treat themes 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.190
 controversies such as ethanol and also the shows of discovery show that the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.619
 border between insult and a mori feature stretched 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.020
 do not think there would be division and there does not have to be a 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.400
 after common sense 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.270
 I give the audience comedian 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.490
 and that's when you find out 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.270
 both I think the comedian has to do what he thinks not that I go to 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.270
 hang out with my community 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.210
 I think the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.549
 the comedian many times he used the stage as a form also of scott 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.080
 to tell your stories stop to play with with absurdities that happen 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.710

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.509
 has a style 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.719
 we must understand that it absorbs that information in a more amusing way 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.899
 I think it's a comedy is a nice way to inform people touch people. 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.750
 In a simpler way, it is much calmer and calmer then 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.230
 compromise through the character goes without doubt I have there an exaggeration of 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.260
 some facets of my personality this for sure and you deny the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.010

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:15.179
 this fact may be an enemy of the government 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:18.249
 enemy of the united states 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.249
