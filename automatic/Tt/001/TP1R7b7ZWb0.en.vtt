00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:11.790
 most everything ok 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.309
 I came back with video for you guys to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.160
 show the types of francesinhas tÃ¡ 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.679
 can be used hope you like it 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.220
 So let's start and I'll go 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:26.669
 start with the traditional french tac 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.720
 everyone already knows what is one that 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:33.570
 grown covers the part of the nail with 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.230
 white is with ac white glaze I am 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.560
 using white petal and I'll do it here 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.640
 the Frenchwoman usually 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:47.070
 the traditional francesinha 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.149
 it does not fit right because of the position 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.220
 That I 'm crazy, but the idea is only 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.920
 show you the formats of 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.739
 good french then this is the one 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.440
 traditional cuisine that everyone already 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.769
 knows and the next format of 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.810
 francesinha is the french girl on the diagonal 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.259
 So let's do the little French in 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.259
 diagonal 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.840
 so who signs the game is not like that 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.659
 okay and close to francesinha format 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.740
 will be the Frenchwoman in seeing undo the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.740
 francesinha on v 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.950
 this is inter francesinha are considered 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.820
 because although for me to do with the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.030
 camera in front of me and this transition 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.000
 and the next francesinha is francesinha 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.360
 floral that does not do for you because 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.630
 which is nothing more than Francesinha 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.630
 traditional and aquino nail polish 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.619
 is made flower is between the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.100
 nail tip up fits here 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.009
 in the middle of this French line is 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.300
 done for zinha, this is the francesinha 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.950
 floral're 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.350
 I'll do it for you when 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.269
 to finish all of them I do the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.400
 with flowers that goes from there 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.150
 represent the traditional floral line 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.430
 together, and the next format does not 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.040
 I'll do it because she's the Frenchwoman with 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.010
 glitter then're like the name says 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.800
 simply the Frenchwoman with a risk 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.500
 of it on the line of the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.200
 Francesinha, you do not have to do it then. 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.690
 promotions also because it is a yes and now 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.540
 more difficult than the Frenchwoman 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.760
 And I'll try to do it for you. 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.760
 even in this position will be with you 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.900
 She is more or less like she was. 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.670
 a very stepladder 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.230
 I hope you 're succeeding. 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.890
 see right 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.810
 because today there is not too much sun and 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.900
 I'm using the natural suddenly 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.290
 It's a little dark, but then the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.180
 francesinha steve this one here now 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.440
 that everyone thinks that already 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.660
 know that two colors are used can be 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.200
 I use francesinha and I'll do that 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:34.299
 tone here and in white is you see how it is 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.299
 that stays then this is going to be the Spanish 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.569
 so it was more or less like that 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:52.260
 more is than two colors did not have 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.540
 diagonal right direction and is more or 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.909
 less so it could have left 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.359
 white half-nail and will not 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:03.650
 give preference to the client or your 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:07.829
 then a traditional costume strip 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.280
 diagonal not alone in seeing the 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:14.219
 french little spanish to spanish 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.500
 okay there also have floral francesinha 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:19.470
 which is additional procedure with flowers 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.650
 works with him that is also the 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.590
 Traditional French girl with glitter and okay 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.240
 we have inverted fingernails here 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.580
 in your hand and I will try to 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.990
 French girl reversed in the other hand but 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.419
 You're not going to smoke because I do not 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.000
 fight for my position here at 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.620
 camera also in front of this hand here I 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.789
 I'll do it and show you around. 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.039
 little 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.210
 so that's why I did francesinha 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:48.300
 inverted 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.639
 stay like this, it's better then the little French girl 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.860
 reversed is to use a strong color of 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.789
 French nail polish 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.280
 white 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.740
 then this inverted francesinha okay I 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.389
 I'll finish these lines and I'll be right back 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.570

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:07.260

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:12.630
 purity I finished she is and she is 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.699
 so you think that Francesinha floral 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.159
 that I told you the analysis is 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.780
 It was not 100% fast, but it's only for 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:20.789
 show you're 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.430
 Then this floral and the party 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.849

 flowers lines to have there are up there and 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:33.750
