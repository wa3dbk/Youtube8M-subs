I already died two times because it's

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.780 
I already died two times because it's
very<00:01:59.380> hard<00:01:59.680> to<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:02.350> way<00:02:03.010> more<00:02:03.040> harder

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
very hard to like it's way more harder

and a cool thing what I think is pretty
cool<00:02:11.980> oh<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.490> there's<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.390> slightly<00:02:13.810> slower

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
cool oh and there's a slightly slower

little one I don't have any skill points
invested<00:02:44.350> anywhere<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.690> they<00:02:46.690> are<00:02:47.019> not

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560

available<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.670> science<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:50.350> there<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.130> no

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
available in the science so there is no

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.869 
available in the science so there is no
alternate<00:02:52.660> as<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.080> can<00:02:53.260> see

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.789 

yeah<00:02:56.879> but<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.629> still<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:58.109> them<00:02:58.349> but<00:02:58.530> they

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
yeah but you still have them but they

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.119 
yeah but you still have them but they
are<00:02:58.829> all<00:02:58.950> ranked<00:02:59.370> too<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:01.650> not<00:03:01.739> that

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
are all ranked too so it's not that

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:08.630 
are all ranked too so it's not that
overpowered<00:03:04.730> bread<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.150> other<00:03:06.390> things<00:03:07.640> will

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
overpowered bread and other things will

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.050 
overpowered bread and other things will
have<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:11.239> higher<00:03:12.239> effect<00:03:12.840> duration<00:03:13.379> but<00:03:13.590> he'll

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
have a higher effect duration but he'll

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.360 
have a higher effect duration but he'll
less<00:03:15.060> as<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:16.349> can<00:03:16.560> see<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:19.040> all<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
less as you can see you have all the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.970 
less as you can see you have all the
alternate<00:03:20.849> signs<00:03:21.150> already<00:03:21.750> from<00:03:22.409> the<00:03:22.530> start

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
alternate signs already from the start

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.039 
alternate signs already from the start
what's<00:03:23.340> pretty<00:03:23.730> cool<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.180> think<00:03:26.629> I'll<00:03:27.629> show<00:03:27.959> you

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.970 

and<00:03:31.099> of<00:03:32.099> course<00:03:32.129> you<00:03:32.669> have<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:34.019> normal<00:03:34.530> ones

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
and of course you have the normal ones

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:48.240 
and of course you have the normal ones
too

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:58.910 

I<00:03:52.410> can<00:03:53.410> show<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:56.260> other<00:03:56.590> two<00:03:57.340> for<00:03:57.700> example

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
I can show you the other two for example

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:14.150 
I can show you the other two for example
this<00:03:59.920> one<00:04:04.080> yeah<00:04:11.820> all<00:04:12.820> right<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.210> you<00:04:13.300> have<00:04:13.390> the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
this one yeah all right so you have the

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.880 
this one yeah all right so you have the
Swart<00:04:15.160> technique<00:04:15.610> available<00:04:16.239> too<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:19.530> i<00:04:20.530> will

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
Swart technique available too and i will

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:29.060 
Swart technique available too and i will
show<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.340> world<00:04:21.549> too<00:04:26.250> without<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.460> single

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
show the world too without a single

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.800 
show the world too without a single
single<00:04:30.070> point<00:04:30.370> in<00:04:30.670> there<00:04:30.880> because<00:04:31.150> it's<00:04:31.390> even

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
single point in there because it's even

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:39.260 
single point in there because it's even
not<00:04:32.110> available<00:04:32.800> because<00:04:33.130> of<00:04:33.370> better<00:04:33.730> comment

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.980 

you're<00:04:40.270> able<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.919> parry<00:04:41.919> arrows<00:04:42.900> from<00:04:43.900> the

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
you're able to parry arrows from the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.940 
you're able to parry arrows from the
beginning<00:04:44.530> without<00:04:44.680> investing<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.580> slut<00:04:45.880> on<00:04:46.030> it

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
beginning without investing a slut on it

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.010 
beginning without investing a slut on it
but<00:04:47.950> it's<00:04:48.250> not<00:04:48.400> reflecting<00:04:49.270> arrows<00:04:49.630> at<00:04:49.870> the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
but it's not reflecting arrows at the

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.010 
but it's not reflecting arrows at the
attacker<00:04:51.000> there<00:04:52.000> are<00:04:52.350> some<00:04:54.150> skills<00:04:55.150> too<00:04:55.510> there

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
attacker there are some skills too there

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.590 
attacker there are some skills too there
were<00:04:56.830> too<00:04:57.100> strong<00:04:57.460> or<00:04:57.760> never<00:04:58.090> used

were too strong or never used

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.340 
were too strong or never used
they<00:04:58.990> got<00:04:59.200> trimmed<00:04:59.500> down<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:01.419> balance<00:05:02.169> of

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
they got trimmed down the balance of

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.520 
they got trimmed down the balance of

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
monsters of low level are more powerful

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.870 
monsters of low level are more powerful
