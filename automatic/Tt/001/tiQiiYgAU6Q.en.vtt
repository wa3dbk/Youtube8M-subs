00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
again we didn't check the systems

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.450 
again we didn't check the systems
there's<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.849> little<00:00:30.119> bit<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.449> paint<00:00:31.460> from

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.280 
there's a little bit of paint from
that's<00:00:32.910> probably<00:00:33.300> from<00:00:33.510> their<00:00:33.690> screen<00:00:34.050> room

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

jealousy<00:00:36.719> style<00:00:37.020> windows<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.190> tires<00:00:38.460> are

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
jealousy style windows the tires are

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.330 
jealousy style windows the tires are
probably<00:00:39.270> older<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.680> they<00:00:40.770> don't<00:00:40.950> look<00:00:41.129> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
probably older but they don't look you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.600 
probably older but they don't look you
dry<00:00:41.610> rotted<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:43.079> they<00:00:43.200> might<00:00:43.379> travel<00:00:43.829> okay<00:00:44.160> if

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
dry rotted so they might travel okay if

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.979 
dry rotted so they might travel okay if
you're<00:00:44.730> gonna<00:00:44.789> tow<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.270> long<00:00:45.420> distance<00:00:45.719> so

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you're gonna tow in a long distance so

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.080 
you're gonna tow in a long distance so
you<00:00:46.020> might<00:00:46.260> consider<00:00:46.379> new<00:00:46.860> tires<00:00:47.160> got<00:00:47.850> some

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
you might consider new tires got some

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
you might consider new tires got some
