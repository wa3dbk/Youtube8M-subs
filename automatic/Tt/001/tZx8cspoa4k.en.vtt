00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.210
 r i will be bankrupt tv for the continuation of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.519
 our paddock tour of the 2013 season 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.380
 forces in the presence 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.990
 after red bull racing alas paste the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.420
 scrap at mclaren mclaren's turn 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.960
 obviously it's one of the pillars of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.570
 championship 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.109
 it is one of the sure values ​​and yet 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.029
 this year we have a little doubt in the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.480
 extent where even luiz hamilton is 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.560
 sergio party perez the shore so this 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.020
 owl there is new 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.940
 there is new blood but we feel them a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.320
 little in doubt especially with the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.899
 new pirelli 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.579
 it did not go very well to the tests 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.860
 in Spain there are many doubts 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.930
 with mclaren themselves do not know 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.100
 really where he stands there is a 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.379
 problem is that hamilton 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.570
 he was doing wonders of the car 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.340
 we wonder this year who is going 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.829
 to qualify the car first league 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.230
 because good boat is not the same 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.149
 that perez qualifications must still 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.800
 to turn out to be there is hope 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.969
 no but we are not sure 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.629
 best in the race we qualify up to 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.670
 evidence to the contrary 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.140
 can we also and so we wonder 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.760
 because there is a problem because he 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.080
 it takes two days the forces involved 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.369
 are so tight that you have to 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.820
 qualify first or second him 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.680
 then you have to leave and so 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.240
 mclaren we do not know do not know no 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.340
 more but all hopes are allowed 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.369
 because perez seems to be 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.970
 comfortable with us and so that can be the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.250
 queen the hatching of a star and which one 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.009
 is capable of the best 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.840
 it was necessary since then as a thread 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.670
 is able he is able to dominate a 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.710
 great price outrageously and the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.960
 next day at the glass or two weeks later 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.270
 late it's all serious to do it a little 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.350
 web side and we talk about it and where buses 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.610
 have already when red bull 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.990
 he has a small side the master comes out 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.270
 shortly everything on a good day it is 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.229
 true that there ible 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.689
 is he able to multiply 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.100
 hello good he takes from the bottle of 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.409
 mature there is a real 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.110
 leadership responsibility at 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.250
 mclaren was at lewis hamilton he 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.119
 still successful his shot 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.860
 still well how would I say actually 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.340
 his nest in a team that was not 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.729
 hers 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.799
 hilton was calm the child of the house 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.480
 I think there was a real emulation 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.370
 between them but we have seen perhaps the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.700
 top scorer thanks to hamilton some 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 part is what button is able to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.489
 pull the team up and 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.349
 to wear that leader's costume 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.140
 it's one of the big unknowns of the 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.849
 championship he is capable it's true 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.000
 it is true that played very well his 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.140
 card at hardware with cohabitation 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.430
 with Hamilton because we do not 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.530
 was not waiting we were ready he was going to be 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.920
 destroyed and that's not it that's 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.780
 come 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.519
 I believe that a total of three years 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.799
 together they have more or less equal play 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.060
 to score more points about 1 to 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.860
 to read such was faster in qualifying 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.090
 but clearly genzyme is what 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.829
 I like what I like with jen 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.709
 knows that since his title 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.560
 they are there and they bring serenity to 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.410
 the team and he accepted the arrival of this 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.209
 young look and perez I think it can 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.819
 to walk it can work but there is the 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.470
 doubt who studied by equipping ourselves with our 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.609
 walks dining revised August with jen 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.160
 hsun that's what he is still 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:10.290
 really hungry we feel happy fulfilled 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.730
 rich and healthy and well 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.370
 accompanied well gorillas and 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.040
 does he still have so much 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.739
 this absolute determination this hunger 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.019
 of victories then we will see if this 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.639
 gprs the titillate a little eh it can be 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.400
 it can be fun to see how that 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.200
 is going to be honest I'm not 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.790
 convinced by the potential of perez 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.310
 it's not the first time we've 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.810
 speak I know a sergio well because 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.540
 that I saw them in gp2 balloon during 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.010
 two years he never really bluffed me 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.829
 it's a very good graphic driver very 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.599
 intelligent very young he may have 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.150
 still room for improvement 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.799
 mclaren take the risk with perez 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.450
 all the better I feel like they have 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.220
 do it a bit on a whim when 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.950
 even when they were destabilized by 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.120
 the departure of 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.910
 victhom is what perez will be able 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.950
 really justify this status of 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.989
 driver of a top team 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.610
 from the outset I have a little doubt 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.590
 it is true that there is as always 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.610
 question mark perez what are 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.080
 his real qualities 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.310
 you have to go to the evidence years 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.730
 past he still did three 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.890
 podiums 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.220
 he did wonderful shopping on the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.540
 Somair surprised us he did some 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.650
 less good races and one of the moments 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.380
 where they were dominated by kobayashi 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.880
 so that's true the may debates since 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.560
 his transplant the end of the season was 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.960
 catastrophic with doubt is allowed 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.530
 of which he is still a little immature for 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.200
 shows very young and then the tires 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.400
 pirelli since we know that pirelli has 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.820
 well played the game this year saying 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.530
 that we put a layer in the direction where 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.410
 we make the two new ones a little bit 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.729
 less enduring a little more so in 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.990
 the teams are looking again a little 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.530
 even if they know the mode better 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.570
 job 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.040
 after groping him last year 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.620
 for almost it's almost a half 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.360
 season for to understand the weeks 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.820
 temperature operation of the 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.080
 tires what we saw in Spain is 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.340
 not very significant because he 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.460
 was way too cold 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.650
 the weather was really cool 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.500
 so in australia and especially in malaysia 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.900
 we will see it is a little over 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.880
 7,9 pirelli at mclaren is the team 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.700
 who has nothing to be the most in trouble 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.680
 to find the right balance 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.850
 when the track is at 10 degrees maybe 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.539
 it works very well when the track is at 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.680
 33 40 degrees we know button and pierce his 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.060
 two drivers who have the reputation 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:30.080
 to be just fine strategists in 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.930
 the sense that they understand the tire there 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.830
 save the tire and get the best 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.050
 tire party 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.880
 so that's maybe their kind of me 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.740
 a point to take a little negative on 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.270
 your engine is that it's true 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.729
 draws the quintessence of tires 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.580
 winter this quality but this style to 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.810
 gamberger 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.150
 the impression that during this 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.470
 offseason he has several times he said 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.060
 I can not understand the 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.470
 behavior of the car I do not arrive 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.289
 not whether it is good or if 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.819
 she is really where does it go t he is a 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.199
 little in the blur is she too 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.259
 numerous and now perez on know 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.939
 not whether he will succeed in showing the 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.009
 direction him he spent an experiment 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:07.349
 he will make us follow what I like 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.419
 at perez knows who says to me I play the 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.009
 championship as early as this year I do not like 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.770
 not the titles they say where I 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.539
 played 6th place I'm going to play here 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.550
 he is in the caretaker sees the season 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.259
 learning transition season 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.650
 give him tell me I'm going for the 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.389
 victory 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.310
 I like this attitude 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.289
 he clearly displays his ambition he has 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.250
 reason he is at mclaren in a 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.590
 team like that we must not afford 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.169
 to say I'm going to learn my job there 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.169
 said there are already two seasons at saved 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:36.029
 in the belts interview he has him 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.669
 also must he must now demonstrate 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:40.800
 that he has the value to deserve this 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.129
 flying or two there actually from 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.180
 economic potential we know 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:46.830
 behind him in mexico 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.699
 that's it for mclaren it's really 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.740
 interesting because it's one of 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.960
 big unknowns of the season and in 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.789
 our 2013 guide in the fmi magazine and 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.319
 well we did not put a big odds 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:58.770
 so maybe we're wrong we'll see 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:07:00.839
 well in response already to melbourne 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.330
 and then see you tomorrow for the rest 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:06.589
 of this turn paddocks forces into 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.589
 presence of the 2013 season
