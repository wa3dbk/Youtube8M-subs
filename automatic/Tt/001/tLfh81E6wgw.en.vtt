00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
did quite a while back now and it's

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.139 
did quite a while back now and it's
quite<00:00:38.219> simple<00:00:38.550> what<00:00:38.640> you're<00:00:38.730> gonna<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
quite simple what you're gonna do is

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.229 
quite simple what you're gonna do is
going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.450> file<00:00:39.690> new<00:00:39.960> projects<00:00:41.030> empty<00:00:42.030> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
going to go file new projects empty and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.940 
going to go file new projects empty and
then<00:00:42.989> you're<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> save<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.800> folder

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
then you're going to save it in a folder

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.350 
then you're going to save it in a folder
and<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.750> need<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.530> create<00:00:47.489> obviously<00:00:48.180> an

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and then you need to create obviously an

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.049 
and then you need to create obviously an
audio<00:00:48.660> track<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:50.700> I'm<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.940> be

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
audio track the what I'm going to be

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.110 
audio track the what I'm going to be
using<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> mono<00:00:52.199> microphone<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.699> you

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
using is a mono microphone here as you

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
using is a mono microphone here as you
can<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.500> stereo<00:00:55.680> microphone

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
can see if you have a stereo microphone

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.939 
can see if you have a stereo microphone
you<00:00:56.219> cannot<00:00:56.520> use<00:00:56.699> both<00:00:56.940> ports<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.350> Alesi

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
you cannot use both ports of the Alesi

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:59.360 
you cannot use both ports of the Alesi
box

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
box

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.290 
box
io2<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.640> left<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.120> your<00:01:03.270> right

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
io2 and so you have left and your right

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
io2 and so you have left and your right
and<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.080> control<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> two<00:01:04.680> audio<00:01:04.949> ends

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and you can control the two audio ends

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
and you can control the two audio ends
that<00:01:05.580> way<00:01:05.729> before<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.689> start<00:01:06.960> Cubase<00:01:07.350> please

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that way before you start Cubase please

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
that way before you start Cubase please
make<00:01:07.770> sure<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.369> Alessi<00:01:09.270> box<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
make sure that your Alessi box is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.750 
make sure that your Alessi box is
actually<00:01:09.689> plugged<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.650> your<00:01:11.159> Mac<00:01:11.430> because

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
actually plugged in to your Mac because

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.359 
actually plugged in to your Mac because
otherwise<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.299> won't<00:01:12.450> pick<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.689> up<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> you

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
otherwise it won't pick it up and so you

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.530 
otherwise it won't pick it up and so you
create<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.670> new<00:01:14.700> track<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.540> um<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:17.540> then

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
create a new track like so um and then

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.310 
create a new track like so um and then
all<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.920> go<00:01:20.759> devices<00:01:21.659> device

all you have to do is go devices device

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.760 
all you have to do is go devices device
setup<00:01:23.180> VST<00:01:24.180> audio<00:01:24.390> system<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.259> make<00:01:25.530> sure

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
setup VST audio system and make sure

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.030

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
that this has been set to IO 2 because

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.899 
that this has been set to IO 2 because
otherwise<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:30.150> won't<00:01:30.360> work<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:32.009> ignore<00:01:32.759> your

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
to have to do is go back to devices and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.810 
to have to do is go back to devices and
go<00:01:40.380> VST<00:01:40.979> connections<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.899> make<00:01:43.170> sure<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.640> get

itself<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> use<00:01:58.380> headphones

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
itself so you can have to use headphones

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.859

with the Alessi box

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.069 
with the Alessi box
unlike<00:02:00.869> logic<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.469> cannot<00:02:01.950> use<00:02:03.079> your

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
unlike logic you cannot use your

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.719 
unlike logic you cannot use your
speakers<00:02:04.590> from<00:02:04.710> your<00:02:04.920> computer<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:06.619> you

speakers from your computer and you

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.300 
speakers from your computer and you
actually<00:02:08.729> need<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:10.500> go<00:02:10.739> through<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> LSC

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
actually need to you go through the LSC

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.400 
actually need to you go through the LSC
box<00:02:11.550> itself<00:02:11.910> which<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> pen

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
box itself which is a pen

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.730 
box itself which is a pen
I<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:14.820> Cubase<00:02:15.740> no

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
I know but it's it's it's Cubase no

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.560 
I know but it's it's it's Cubase no
preference<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.490> Cubase<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:18.030> actually<00:02:18.210> prefer

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
preference to Cubase I actually prefer

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.660 
preference to Cubase I actually prefer
logic<00:02:18.870> lot<00:02:19.020> better<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.800> anyway<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.520> go

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
logic lot better but anyway you go

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.240 
logic lot better but anyway you go
inputs<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:22.050> delete<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> stereo<00:02:23.040> in

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
inputs and you delete the stereo in

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.030 
inputs and you delete the stereo in
because<00:02:23.520> it's<00:02:23.640> not<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.820> stereo<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:25.470> make<00:02:25.710> you

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
because it's not a stereo you make you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.190 
because it's not a stereo you make you
actually<00:02:26.370> make<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.670> new<00:02:26.910> channel<00:02:27.300> make<00:02:28.170> sure

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
actually make a new channel make sure

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.190 
actually make a new channel make sure
that's<00:02:28.590> mono<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.510> make<00:02:30.690> sure<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.840> it's

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
that's mono and you make sure that it's

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.990 
that's mono and you make sure that it's
left<00:02:31.620> or<00:02:31.800> right<00:02:31.980> depending<00:02:32.100> which<00:02:32.490> one<00:02:32.880> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
left or right depending which one you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.160 
left or right depending which one you
might<00:02:33.120> finish<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.480> then<00:02:33.600> obviously<00:02:33.690> man<00:02:34.020> when

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
might finish but then obviously man when

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.430 
might finish but then obviously man when
spoken<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.500> left<00:02:34.770> so<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.160> going<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.550> be<00:02:35.670> left

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
spoken to left so it's going to be left

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.960 
spoken to left so it's going to be left
once<00:02:37.440> we've<00:02:37.620> done<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:38.430> click<00:02:38.700> on<00:02:38.820> the

go<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.340> bus<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.150> then<00:02:42.390> go<00:02:42.540> mono<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.850> go

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
go to bus and then go mono in and you go

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.680 
go to bus and then go mono in and you go
stereo<00:02:46.020> out<00:02:46.320> left<00:02:46.710> right<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:48.540> quite

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
stereo out left right and it's quite

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.240 
stereo out left right and it's quite
simple<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.410> we<00:02:49.500> go<00:02:49.650> if<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.980> do<00:02:50.100> that

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
simple here we go if you do that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.870 
simple here we go if you do that
monitoring<00:02:50.930> 1<00:02:51.930> 2<00:02:52.110> 3<00:02:52.350> hello<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.790> see

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
monitoring 1 2 3 hello and you can see

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.000 
monitoring 1 2 3 hello and you can see
your<00:02:54.030> levels<00:02:54.270> are<00:02:54.360> going<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.690> as<00:02:54.900> such<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.710> you

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
your levels are going in as such and you

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.460 
your levels are going in as such and you
can<00:02:56.160> record<00:02:56.400> anything<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:57.150> just<00:02:57.570> click

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
can record anything you like just click

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.700 
can record anything you like just click
record<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.880> just<00:03:00.030> start<00:03:00.150> recording

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
record and you can just start recording

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.810 
record and you can just start recording
straight<00:03:01.710> off<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.550> can<00:03:02.700> see

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
straight off like that and you can see

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.520 
straight off like that and you can see
that<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.150> information<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:04.020> going<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.350> quite

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that the information is going in quite

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.070 
that the information is going in quite
simply<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.610> works<00:03:05.850> seamlessly<00:03:06.330> basically

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
simply and it works seamlessly basically

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.200 
simply and it works seamlessly basically
so<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:07.740> can<00:03:08.070> use<00:03:08.430> less<00:03:08.640> e<00:03:09.570> io<00:03:09.990> to<00:03:10.670> with<00:03:11.670> qbasic

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
so you can use less e io to with qbasic

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.200 
so you can use less e io to with qbasic
for<00:03:12.360> mac<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.340> i'm<00:03:14.340> hoping<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.730> wasn't<00:03:14.970> sort
