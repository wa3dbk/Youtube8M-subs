 obviously these are his talents at h &amp; m 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.460
 I made a hall 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.870

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.570
 besides, I did just before 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.870
 then are shoes in fact I 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.670
 will you ask all the hall well the game 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.230

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.660
 I will let you see them in the world 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.640

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.079
 watch so this is this watch too that 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.879

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.890
 request from casio that my sister told me 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.539

 I put it all the time I do not like 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.560
 ours because I always had 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.880
 watches with a dial and know that 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.250

 to know if your shampoo and and other 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.550
 use too many times it's when he 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.569
 commits his fatherland to lather on your 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.520

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.590

 usually in info bar for the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.580
 then find out later I have a 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.050
 product 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.420
 I think I already wanted to introduce 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.380
 in my previous in my previous 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.420
 video so this is this browser from home 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.800
 clicquot who is the lounge brenders 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.960
 is called satin in bed so that's 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.550
 present like these is frozen 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.500
 a lot used then there it does not make 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.940
 the real thing that I finished my laguna 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.460
 denain twink in a thousand pieces so much 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.260
 I use them and in the end are 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.180
 small of the small indications on the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.210
 video that will come after those have 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.070
 after spa after 6.6 after these it's 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.890
 so this one that I used a lot 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.260
 the color is really perfect because 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.370
 that I am very clear right now and 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.330
 even though this I still have my glasses 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.500
 is good too it's true that on this 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.959
 video I 'm going to be even more than 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.330
 splinters because of the lighting that is 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.959
 really much too clear here I am 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.700
 then love them for the eyes I saw 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.000
 of products from which kim rusk be produced 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.610
 chief 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.770
 First we'll start with that one 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.480
 palette that I've discovered is the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.250
 butt wright and I think you do not 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.870
 do not even know that I had that you 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.430
 did not even know that I had that I 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.170
 owned her because I never 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.060
 used a tutorial I never gave in 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.410
 favorite so she is beautiful I 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.760
 I bought it because I had 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.890
 a crush on elsa's eyes 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.690
 but on me I could do nothing 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.090
 with because these are very colors 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.440
 cold for example because a beautiful you the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.880
 wanted you french speakers does that 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.769
 to spend cold gray colors and that 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.140
 did not suit me at all but I had been 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.230
 really attracted to color 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.120
 attaches it which fir satin shit that 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.170
 is really a kind of colors a 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.660
 little orgasm but for the eyes so 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.300
 I did not have the opportunity to 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.709
 many use it and then I come I 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.269
 I was more suspicious than now 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.580
 because I'm sick of it 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.900
 makeup at the moment it's boring the 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.980
 morning I have to get up ip return so 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.209
 vividly that I have since the button for 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.310
 more facts going back at least it will be 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.140
 done but 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.299
 I really take the colors the 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.120
 more basic so I wanted to say in 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.730
 general I think I take a look at 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.980
 10 pm cup and dance and it's a lot 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.000
 Here I have so loved is c 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.600
 a big favorite this damn liquid liner 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.510
 of savona ivory canvases by urban 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.450
 decay to stay at home so he is 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.810
 very well frankly it is brown 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.480
 so but it is very very hungry that 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.340
 you can obviously and pc and I 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.540
 really wear that much more what 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.110
 it's very much finer 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.410
 than a liner brush with a gel liner 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.210
 then much softer so that a liner 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.100
 black and I was not necessarily doing 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.900
 comma with a very slight history 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.260
 to stretch a little my mourning but 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.669
 frankly I really liked that 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.250
 redeems for the lips and to finish 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.750
 the objects two products so everything 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.860
 first a lip balm that is the one 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.880
 ci which is the big five label njang he 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.400
 so who can the yellow that is 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.760
 almost imperceptible but I like 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.669
 a lot 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.560
 the smell of lemon that has two teeth and 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.580
 his contented ways you have wanted to 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.039
 do a touch like that in my 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.120
 screen and it's good a frankly that's 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.390
 been a real favorite 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.160
 I like a lot so yeah they are 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.830
 once again available in France 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.690
 now for the price of 4 euros is 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.120
 its list so almost 2 euros more expensive 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.650
 and finally one last one is a last 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.620
 favorite so that's a red is there so 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.690
 it is this lipstick la de estÃ©e 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.820
 lauder which is broken besides so 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:55.539
 it's a bad lipstick but 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.550
 it's true that when this month of October 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.289
 I see myself already these months of September 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.080
 I was really in colors 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:05.229
 hot in see it was this season 11 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.490
 7 this month it's hot here cold and 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.750
 it's cold it's hot 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.180
 made hyper francs in the afternoon done 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.350
 perchaud so it seems may seem 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.880
 weird but when I get dressed and more 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.520
 light he wants to give a touch 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.620
 of heat on me so I had it 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.090
 here I have not put to school by 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.210
 against because it's a little bit 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.280
 too much 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.569
 but it's true that I really liked 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.940
 the master at the weekend I had 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.259
 practically that when I went out 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.639
 here I heard one more stuff 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.349
 natural there because it starts to 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.099
 to be cold so here I am wearing 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:33.590
 sweatshirts etc 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:35.630
 I find that the lips of more nude 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.349
 more dewy is more beautiful me I find 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:41.270
 but here is sodeer site 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.770
 do not forget who you are because you can 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.970
 I make you fat big kisses and 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.970
 soon in a life of stockings 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.240
 and
