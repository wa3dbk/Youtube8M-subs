readings<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.779> Neanderthal<00:00:31.790> ancestry<00:00:32.790> but

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
readings for Neanderthal ancestry but

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.639 
readings for Neanderthal ancestry but
just<00:00:33.860> interesting<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.250> then<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.200> extended<00:00:37.200> DNA

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
just interesting and then a extended DNA

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.910 
just interesting and then a extended DNA
family<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.370> shown<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> time<00:00:39.620> that<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> took

family is shown at the time that I took
these<00:00:41.129> screenshots<00:00:41.760> that's<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.930> many<00:00:43.110> family

23andme site now here are my breakdowns
and<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.850> course<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:04.220> have<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> very<00:01:05.580> very

and of course I have a very very

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.500 
and of course I have a very very
abnormally<00:01:06.780> high<00:01:07.430> amount<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.700> African

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
abnormally high amount of African

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.990 
abnormally high amount of African
ancestry<00:01:09.960> being<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.710> I'm<00:01:10.860> African<00:01:11.369> American

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
ancestry being that I'm African American

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.390 
ancestry being that I'm African American
but<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.990> course<00:01:13.020> through<00:01:13.530> slavery<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.159> other

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
but of course through slavery and other

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.120 
but of course through slavery and other
means<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.049> other<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.740> know<00:01:16.830> things

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
means there are other you know things

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.130 
means there are other you know things
that<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.549> mixed<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.000> there<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.840> course

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that get mixed in there but of course

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.370 
that get mixed in there but of course
they<00:01:19.860> show<00:01:20.159> also<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.670> percentage<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.930> Central

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
they show also a percentage of Central

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.160 
they show also a percentage of Central
and<00:01:22.500> South<00:01:22.560> African<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.610> well<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> rest

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and South African as well as the rest

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.380 
and South African as well as the rest
West<00:01:25.560> African<00:01:26.070> there's<00:01:26.430> some<00:01:26.759> European

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
West African there's some European

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.580 
West African there's some European
ancestry<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.470> well<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.250> East<00:01:29.750> Asian<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.960> some

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
ancestry as well as East Asian and some

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.219 
ancestry as well as East Asian and some
Native<00:01:32.009> American<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.850> those<00:01:33.659> results<00:01:34.110> were

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
Native American so those results were

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.929 
Native American so those results were
really<00:01:34.439> interesting<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.610> did<00:01:35.820> show<00:01:36.150> that

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
really interesting it did show that

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.399 
really interesting it did show that
there<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> little<00:01:39.390> bit<00:01:39.479> more<00:01:39.689> diversity<00:01:40.229> in

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
there was a little bit more diversity in

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.310 
there was a little bit more diversity in
there<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.920> said<00:01:41.250> earlier<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.930> course

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
there but like I said earlier of course

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.670 
there but like I said earlier of course
is<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.630> African<00:01:46.140> Americans<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
is you see other African Americans that

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.060 
is you see other African Americans that
have<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> less<00:01:48.200> percentage<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.470> African

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
have a less percentage of African

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.310 
have a less percentage of African
American<00:01:50.490> blood<00:01:50.759> being<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.360> they've<00:01:51.570> had<00:01:52.049> so

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
American blood being that they've had so

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.139 
American blood being that they've had so
much<00:01:52.470> mixture<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.610> their<00:01:53.759> history

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
much mixture going on in their history

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.569 
much mixture going on in their history
but<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.509> haven't<00:01:55.170> had<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:55.500> much<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
but I haven't had as much so that's a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.550 
but I haven't had as much so that's a
real<00:01:56.880> interesting<00:01:57.390> find<00:02:00.200> now<00:02:01.200> they're

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
real interesting find now they're

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.800 
real interesting find now they're
showing<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.219> here<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.090> ancestry

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
showing you here the ancestry

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.280 
showing you here the ancestry
composition<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.759> course<00:02:06.090> they<00:02:06.719> have<00:02:07.020> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
composition and of course they have a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.010 
composition and of course they have a
map<00:02:08.009> view<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.030> split<00:02:09.420> view<00:02:09.810> of

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
map view they have a split view of

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.170 
map view they have a split view of

have<00:02:16.150> speculative<00:02:16.930> standard<00:02:17.470> and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
have speculative standard and

you'll definitely look more into when
you<00:02:22.540> receive<00:02:23.110> your<00:02:23.140> results<00:02:23.890> here<00:02:24.819> is<00:02:25.090> a

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
you receive your results here is a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.289 
you receive your results here is a

screen showing my l2d maternal
haplogroup<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:29.440> because<00:02:29.769> I'm<00:02:29.950> female<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.640> was

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
haplogroup so because I'm female I was

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.220 
haplogroup so because I'm female I was
able<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.269> trace<00:02:32.129> mostly<00:02:33.129> my<00:02:33.579> mother<00:02:34.030> side<00:02:34.420> but

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230

able to trace mostly my mother side but
it<00:02:35.590> also<00:02:35.799> gives<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.400> some<00:02:36.430> results<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.299> your

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
it also gives you some results of your

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.559 
it also gives you some results of your
paternal<00:02:38.470> side<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.829> well<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:42.610> course<00:02:42.640> here<00:02:43.360> is

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
paternal side as well of course here is

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.920

about your maternal haplogroup or

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.009 
about your maternal haplogroup or
paternal<00:03:29.370> also<00:03:30.370> here<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.940> family<00:03:31.299> matches<00:03:31.750> I

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
paternal also here the family matches I

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.740 
paternal also here the family matches I
think<00:03:32.799> I<00:03:32.859> have<00:03:33.010> both<00:03:33.250> sides<00:03:33.549> marked<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.419> it

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
think I have both sides marked so it

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.640 
think I have both sides marked so it
shows<00:03:35.049> both<00:03:35.349> maternal<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.250> paternal<00:03:36.400> sides

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
shows both maternal and paternal sides

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.280 
shows both maternal and paternal sides
result<00:03:38.650> family<00:03:39.190> matches<00:03:39.639> so<00:03:40.540> all<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:40.989> all<00:03:41.079> I

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
result family matches so all in all I

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
are interested in taking the DNA test

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.000 
are interested in taking the DNA test
for<00:04:01.359> themselves<00:04:01.810> so<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.260> like<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.769> way<00:04:02.799> the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
for themselves so I like the way the

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.920 
for themselves so I like the way the
website<00:04:03.190> is<00:04:03.579> laid<00:04:03.819> out<00:04:03.849> all<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.660> cool

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
website is laid out all of the cool

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.530 
website is laid out all of the cool
additional<00:04:05.620> features<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:06.430> mean<00:04:06.970> it's<00:04:07.269> so<00:04:07.510> much

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
additional features I mean it's so much

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.569 
additional features I mean it's so much
that<00:04:08.109> I<00:04:08.139> can't<00:04:08.440> really<00:04:08.650> contain<00:04:09.069> it<00:04:09.220> in<00:04:09.310> one

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
that I can't really contain it in one

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.580 
that I can't really contain it in one
video<00:04:09.790> but<00:04:10.329> you<00:04:10.510> would<00:04:10.660> definitely<00:04:10.900> have<00:04:11.230> to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
video but you would definitely have to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.740 
video but you would definitely have to
start<00:04:11.859> your<00:04:12.040> own<00:04:12.069> journey<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.359> you<00:04:13.540> can
