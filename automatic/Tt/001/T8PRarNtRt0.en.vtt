00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
differences try taking what I've went

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.839 
differences try taking what I've went
over<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.530> use<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.919> on<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.129> J's<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.370> visit

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
over and use it on the J's that visit

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.520 
over and use it on the J's that visit
your<00:03:09.090> yard<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.510> see<00:03:09.659> if<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.900> can<00:03:10.079> begin<00:03:10.200> to

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
your yard to see if you can begin to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.770 
your yard to see if you can begin to
pick<00:03:10.680> up<00:03:10.709> those<00:03:11.010> differences<00:03:11.459> when<00:03:12.389> I<00:03:12.419> first

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
pick up those differences when I first

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.509 
pick up those differences when I first
began<00:03:13.079> it<00:03:13.260> took<00:03:13.439> me<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> few<00:03:13.739> months<00:03:14.069> before<00:03:14.340> I

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
began it took me a few months before I

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.809 
began it took me a few months before I
started<00:03:14.639> to<00:03:15.090> recognize<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.659> different<00:03:16.019> faces

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
started to recognize the different faces

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.250 
started to recognize the different faces
so<00:03:17.819> let's<00:03:17.849> run<00:03:18.209> through<00:03:18.449> it<00:03:18.569> one<00:03:18.780> last<00:03:18.989> time

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
so let's run through it one last time
