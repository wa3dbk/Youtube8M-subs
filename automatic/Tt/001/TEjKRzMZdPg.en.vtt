00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
be careful not to burn yourself then I'm

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.620 
be careful not to burn yourself then I'm
going<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.079> take<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:56.220> pipe<00:01:57.220> cleaner<00:01:57.549> you<00:01:58.420> get<00:01:58.600> a

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
going to take the pipe cleaner you get a

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.660 
going to take the pipe cleaner you get a
lot<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:58.960> strings<00:01:59.289> from<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.530> glue<00:01:59.829> don't<00:02:00.520> worry

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
lot of strings from the glue don't worry

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.279 
lot of strings from the glue don't worry
about<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:01.090> those<00:02:01.360> can<00:02:01.570> all<00:02:01.689> just<00:02:01.869> be<00:02:01.930> pulled

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
about that those can all just be pulled

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.160 
about that those can all just be pulled
right<00:02:02.350> off<00:02:02.909> I'm<00:02:03.909> going<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.090> put<00:02:04.330> just<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.689> drop

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
right off I'm going to put just a drop

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.620 
right off I'm going to put just a drop
of<00:02:05.200> glue<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:07.920> tip<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.899> pipe<00:02:10.899> cleaner<00:02:10.929> and

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
of glue on tip of the pipe cleaner and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.589 
of glue on tip of the pipe cleaner and
stick<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.660> in<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.650> back<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:16.030> Styrofoam

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
stick that in the back of the Styrofoam

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:26.610 
stick that in the back of the Styrofoam
ball<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:20.470> form<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.860> halo<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:26.170> I'm<00:02:26.350> just<00:02:26.470> going

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
ball to form the halo and I'm just going

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.880 
ball to form the halo and I'm just going
to<00:02:26.680> take<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.160> drop<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.880> glue<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.870> each<00:02:29.200> googly

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
to take a drop of glue on each googly

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.589 
to take a drop of glue on each googly
eye<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:34.450> doesn't<00:02:34.510> take<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.049> whole<00:02:35.260> lot<00:02:35.319> of<00:02:35.500> glue

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
eye it doesn't take a whole lot of glue

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.509 
eye it doesn't take a whole lot of glue
they're<00:02:37.599> very<00:02:37.870> light<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:39.040> put<00:02:39.220> them<00:02:39.370> in

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
they're very light just put them in

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.839 
they're very light just put them in
place<00:02:40.530> then<00:02:41.530> I'm<00:02:41.680> going<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> take<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:43.360> ribbons

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
place then I'm going to take the ribbons

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:59.660 
place then I'm going to take the ribbons
and<00:02:47.099> just<00:02:48.099> gather<00:02:48.280> them<00:02:48.640> together

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.000 

it's<00:03:00.030> probably<00:03:00.510> easier<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.990> curl<00:03:01.350> them<00:03:01.590> before

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
it's probably easier to curl them before

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.570 
it's probably easier to curl them before
you<00:03:02.220> attach<00:03:02.550> them<00:03:03.350> just<00:03:04.350> pull<00:03:04.590> them<00:03:04.770> along<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
you attach them just pull them along the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.370 
you attach them just pull them along the
inside<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.270> blade<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.780> scissors

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
inside of the blade of the scissors

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:15.380 
inside of the blade of the scissors
being<00:03:08.370> careful<00:03:08.730> not<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.000> cut<00:03:09.180> yourself<00:03:14.390> once
