the lower GI tract is so important with

the lower GI tract is so important with
that<00:03:17.440> that's<00:03:17.920> why<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:18.130> see<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.340> lot<00:03:18.459> of

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
that that's why you see a lot of

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.790 
that that's why you see a lot of

that really stubborn to break down the

fat but the things to think about are
the<00:03:44.049> concerns<00:03:44.410> with<00:03:44.620> conjugated<00:03:45.100> linoleic

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
the concerns with conjugated linoleic

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.970 
the concerns with conjugated linoleic
acid<00:03:45.910> is<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.690> liquefies<00:03:47.290> that<00:03:47.530> fat<00:03:47.739> and

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
acid is that it liquefies that fat and

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.770 
acid is that it liquefies that fat and
it<00:03:48.070> brings<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.459> into<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.700> bloodstream<00:03:48.880> if<00:03:49.360> you

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
it brings it into the bloodstream if you

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.870 
it brings it into the bloodstream if you
