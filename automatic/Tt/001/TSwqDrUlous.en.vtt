that has all these lights coming off the
side<00:01:15.370> of<00:01:15.490> it<00:01:15.610> or<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:17.020> wanted<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.440> you<00:01:17.620> could

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
side of it or if you wanted to you could

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.560 
side of it or if you wanted to you could
flip<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.160> around<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.550> other<00:01:18.640> way<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.510> just

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
flip it around the other way and just

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.360 
flip it around the other way and just
have<00:01:20.230> a<00:01:20.260> little<00:01:20.530> bit<00:01:20.770> of<00:01:20.890> light<00:01:21.070> going<00:01:21.250> through

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
have a little bit of light going through

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.480 
have a little bit of light going through
so<00:01:21.670> if<00:01:21.730> we<00:01:21.820> put<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:22.240> around<00:01:22.480> this<00:01:22.810> way<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.490> we

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
so if we put it around this way and we

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.150 
so if we put it around this way and we
go<00:01:24.610> back<00:01:24.760> inside<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.810> inside<00:01:26.410> should<00:01:26.710> be<00:01:26.770> lit

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
go back inside the inside should be lit

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.360 
go back inside the inside should be lit
up<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.370> little<00:01:27.550> bit<00:01:27.760> however<00:01:28.330> as<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.920> can<00:01:30.100> tell

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
up a little bit however as you can tell

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.330 
up a little bit however as you can tell
it<00:01:30.610> still<00:01:31.540> looks<00:01:32.170> like<00:01:32.320> it's<00:01:32.620> cobblestone<00:01:33.160> so

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
it still looks like it's cobblestone so

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.640 
it still looks like it's cobblestone so
looks<00:01:33.610> like<00:01:33.700> it's<00:01:33.820> cobblestone<00:01:34.510> but<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.320> still

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
looks like it's cobblestone but it still

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.380 
looks like it's cobblestone but it still
actually<00:01:35.920> lit<00:01:36.280> up<00:01:36.400> like<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:36.730> so<00:01:37.210> we're<00:01:37.330> gonna

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
actually lit up like that so we're gonna

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.090 
actually lit up like that so we're gonna
go<00:01:37.600> ahead<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.960> break<00:01:38.260> these<00:01:38.470> out<00:01:38.650> again<00:01:38.800> and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
go ahead and break these out again and

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.740 
go ahead and break these out again and
I'm<00:01:39.190> gonna<00:01:39.280> show<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.550> guys<00:01:39.790> one<00:01:40.240> other<00:01:40.360> thing

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
I'm gonna show you guys one other thing

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.840 
I'm gonna show you guys one other thing
and<00:01:40.960> then<00:01:41.050> that's<00:01:41.290> pretty<00:01:41.470> much<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:42.310> gist<00:01:42.670> of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
and then that's pretty much the gist of

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.060 
and then that's pretty much the gist of
it<00:01:42.970> it's<00:01:43.150> not<00:01:43.330> too<00:01:43.960> hard<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.410> understand<00:01:44.950> this

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
it it's not too hard to understand this

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.580 
it it's not too hard to understand this
is<00:01:45.310> basically<00:01:45.760> we<00:01:46.300> put<00:01:46.510> it<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.840> wall<00:01:47.320> where

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
is basically we put it on a wall where

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.050 
is basically we put it on a wall where
light<00:01:47.830> is<00:01:47.980> going<00:01:48.160> through<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.790> can<00:01:48.940> do

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
light is going through and you can do

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.820 
light is going through and you can do
some<00:01:49.240> cool<00:01:49.390> stuff<00:01:49.450> with<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.900> so<00:01:50.050> now<00:01:50.560> that<00:01:50.740> we

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
some cool stuff with it so now that we

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.890 
some cool stuff with it so now that we
got<00:01:50.980> that<00:01:51.280> out<00:01:51.340> of<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.700> way<00:01:51.850> here's<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.630> really

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
got that out of the way here's a really

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.540 
got that out of the way here's a really
cool<00:01:53.230> and<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.470> can<00:01:53.500> actually<00:01:53.740> break<00:01:54.220> through

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
cool and you can actually break through

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.760 
cool and you can actually break through
the<00:01:54.820> ceiling<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.480> then<00:01:55.870> basically<00:01:56.260> put<00:01:56.590> some

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
the ceiling and then basically put some

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.200 
the ceiling and then basically put some
slabs<00:01:57.100> underneath<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.730> so<00:01:57.820> let's<00:01:57.970> go<00:01:58.090> ahead

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
slabs underneath it so let's go ahead

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.760 
slabs underneath it so let's go ahead
and<00:01:58.330> break<00:01:58.510> that<00:01:58.720> and<00:01:58.900> then<00:01:59.350> we're<00:01:59.440> gonna<00:01:59.560> put

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
and break that and then we're gonna put

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.950 
and break that and then we're gonna put
this<00:02:00.070> here<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.580> as<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.240> can<00:02:01.360> tell<00:02:01.420> if<00:02:01.840> we

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
this here and as you can tell if we

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.590 
this here and as you can tell if we
actually<00:02:02.380> put<00:02:02.620> underneath<00:02:03.010> here<00:02:03.580> or<00:02:03.730> actually

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
actually put underneath here or actually

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.340 
actually put underneath here or actually
be

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350
