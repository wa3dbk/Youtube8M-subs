00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
can kind of tell to the figure but um

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.090 
can kind of tell to the figure but um
whatever<00:03:38.290> i'll<00:03:38.560> have<00:03:38.800> to<00:03:38.980> do<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.709> yeah<00:03:41.890> I'm

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
bother them a lot and then we compare

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.140 
bother them a lot and then we compare
them<00:03:47.739> to<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:49.230> original<00:03:50.230> trunks<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:51.610> there<00:03:51.970> he

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
them to the original trunks and there he

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.970 
them to the original trunks and there he
is<00:03:53.940> this<00:03:54.940> is<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.269> body<00:03:55.480> he<00:03:56.080> came<00:03:56.290> from<00:03:56.320> and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
is this is the body he came from and

here's the chapter made out of him and

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.410 
here's the chapter made out of him and
it's<00:04:02.200> funny<00:04:02.410> cuz<00:04:02.620> he's<00:04:02.709> taller<00:04:03.420> probably

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
it's funny cuz he's taller probably

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.400 
it's funny cuz he's taller probably
