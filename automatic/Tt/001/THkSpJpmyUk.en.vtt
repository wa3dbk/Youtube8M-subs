so<00:00:23.200> because<00:00:23.770> the<00:00:25.110> Revlon<00:00:26.110> one<00:00:26.260> was<00:00:26.380> a<00:00:26.410> tad<00:00:26.770> bit

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
so because the Revlon one was a tad bit

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.970 
so because the Revlon one was a tad bit
too<00:00:27.280> light<00:00:27.520> for<00:00:27.550> me<00:00:27.940> and<00:00:28.180> I<00:00:28.810> think<00:00:28.930> that<00:00:29.470> on

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
too light for me and I think that on

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.490 
too light for me and I think that on
camera<00:00:30.520> it<00:00:30.820> doesn't<00:00:30.970> look<00:00:31.210> that<00:00:31.810> obvious<00:00:32.259> and

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
camera it doesn't look that obvious and

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.080 
camera it doesn't look that obvious and
it<00:00:32.590> looks<00:00:32.710> pretty<00:00:33.010> good<00:00:33.219> actually<00:00:33.520> on<00:00:33.850> camera

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
it looks pretty good actually on camera

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.399

uh<00:03:10.859> yeah<00:03:11.859> I<00:03:11.890> think<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:12.670> um<00:03:13.209> it's<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.319> lot<00:03:14.530> it's

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
uh yeah I think so um it's a lot it's

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.849 
uh yeah I think so um it's a lot it's
more<00:03:15.100> slightly<00:03:15.459> more<00:03:15.700> pigmented<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:17.049> can

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
more slightly more pigmented so I can

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:23.099 
more slightly more pigmented so I can
get<00:03:18.400> product<00:03:18.940> up<00:03:19.950> easier<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.250> think<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:22.720> person

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
get product up easier I think in person

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
of an orange in the camera then I don't

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.050
