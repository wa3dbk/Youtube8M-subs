00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
possibly so to make Batman you have to

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.500 
possibly so to make Batman you have to
have<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> square<00:00:35.460> piece<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.700> paper<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.270> black

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
have a square piece of paper with black

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.650 
have a square piece of paper with black
on<00:00:36.690> one<00:00:36.870> side<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:38.460> Caucasian<00:00:39.180> or<00:00:39.360> white

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
on one side and the Caucasian or white

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.270 
on one side and the Caucasian or white
on<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> other<00:00:40.140> side<00:00:42.140> step<00:00:43.140> start<00:00:43.559> off<00:00:43.739> first

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
on the other side step start off first

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.279 
on the other side step start off first
you<00:00:44.670> make<00:00:44.940> an<00:00:45.059> excellent<00:00:45.239> paper<00:00:45.629> by<00:00:45.930> folding

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you make an excellent paper by folding

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.170 
you make an excellent paper by folding
the<00:00:46.350> paper<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.860> half<00:00:49.730> so<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.760> looks<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the paper in half so it looks like a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.520 
the paper in half so it looks like a
triangle<00:00:51.949> making<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> crease<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:55.110> doing<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
triangle making a crease and doing the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.810 
triangle making a crease and doing the
same<00:00:55.710> thing<00:00:56.629> officer

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.490 

so<00:01:03.989> looks<00:01:04.989> like<00:01:05.080> an<00:01:05.259> axe<00:01:05.530> in<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.920> paper<00:01:10.500> so

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
so looks like an axe in the paper so

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.170 
so looks like an axe in the paper so
after<00:01:11.770> you<00:01:12.040> have<00:01:12.159> an<00:01:12.280> X<00:01:12.490> in<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.700> paper<00:01:12.909> you're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
after you have an X in the paper you're

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.780 
after you have an X in the paper you're
going<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.509> fold<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.960> tip<00:01:14.140> down<00:01:14.700> until<00:01:15.700> it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
going to fold the tip down until it

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.080 
going to fold the tip down until it
touches<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.149> middle<00:01:16.570> line<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:17.820> make<00:01:18.820> a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
touches the middle line and make a

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.490 
touches the middle line and make a
crease<00:01:19.649> so<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:20.799> will<00:01:20.920> look<00:01:21.070> like<00:01:21.100> this<00:01:22.500> then

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
crease so it will look like this then

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.060 
crease so it will look like this then
you're<00:01:24.009> going<00:01:24.159> to<00:01:24.310> fold<00:01:24.700> this<00:01:25.030> tiff<00:01:25.600> over<00:01:26.070> so

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
you're going to fold this tiff over so

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.719 
you're going to fold this tiff over so
it's<00:01:27.399> a<00:01:27.610> third<00:01:27.939> away<00:01:28.090> from<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:28.780> triangle<00:01:29.350> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
it's a third away from this triangle a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.510 
it's a third away from this triangle a
tip<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.850> do<00:01:31.000> this<00:01:31.210> is<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.950> see<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.280> middle

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
tip to do this is if you see the middle

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.980 
tip to do this is if you see the middle
line<00:01:33.700> here<00:01:34.060> which<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.360> probably<00:01:34.569> can't<00:01:34.869> see

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
line here which you probably can't see

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.200 
line here which you probably can't see
with<00:01:35.380> this<00:01:35.500> camera<00:01:35.830> light<00:01:36.069> but<00:01:36.490> I'll<00:01:36.729> fold<00:01:37.060> it

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
with this camera light but I'll fold it

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.399 
with this camera light but I'll fold it
back<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.720> that<00:01:38.319> line<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:39.759> you<00:01:39.940> see<00:01:40.149> it<00:01:40.240> here<00:01:40.600> try

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
back on that line if you see it here try

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.070 
back on that line if you see it here try
to<00:01:41.470> make<00:01:41.679> it<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.130> these<00:01:43.060> two<00:01:43.720> triangles

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
to make it so that these two triangles

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.480 
to make it so that these two triangles
or<00:01:45.390> even<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.649> make<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:47.979> crease<00:01:48.959> make<00:01:49.959> sure<00:01:50.140> that

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
or even and make a crease make sure that

00:01:50.490 --> 00:02:00.059 
or even and make a crease make sure that
these<00:01:51.490> lines<00:01:51.940> here<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:53.590> even<00:01:53.830> two<00:01:58.890> should<00:01:59.890> feel

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
these lines here or even two should feel

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.309 
these lines here or even two should feel
the<00:02:00.159> same<00:02:00.399> thing<00:02:00.700> on<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:02.380> other<00:02:02.409> side<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:05.049> once

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
the same thing on the other side so once

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.480 
the same thing on the other side so once
it<00:02:05.469> looks<00:02:05.649> like<00:02:05.799> this<00:02:06.009> you're<00:02:06.219> going<00:02:06.369> to

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
it looks like this you're going to

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.120 
it looks like this you're going to
unfold<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:08.940> then<00:02:09.940> you're<00:02:10.179> going<00:02:10.359> to<00:02:11.130> fold

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
unfold and then you're going to fold

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.640 
unfold and then you're going to fold
this<00:02:12.519> side<00:02:14.430> up<00:02:15.930> until<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.880> see<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.299> it's

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
this side up until you see that it's

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.849 
this side up until you see that it's
one-third<00:02:20.650> away<00:02:21.390> from<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.570> edge<00:02:22.959> here<00:02:25.859> make

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
one-third away from this edge here make

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.569 
one-third away from this edge here make
a<00:02:26.890> crease<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:29.380> you're<00:02:29.769> going<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.100> do<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.370> same

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
a crease and you're going to do the same

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.850 
a crease and you're going to do the same
thing<00:02:30.880> with<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.120> other<00:02:31.239> side<00:02:33.540> looks

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
thing with the other side looks

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.990 
thing with the other side looks
like<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:39.490> now<00:02:40.490> as<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.850> can<00:02:40.940> see

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
like this and this now as you can see

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.060 
like this and this now as you can see
the<00:02:41.360> lines<00:02:41.570> that<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:41.900> created<00:02:42.260> earlier<00:02:42.590> are

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
the lines that we created earlier are

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.610 
the lines that we created earlier are
automatically<00:02:43.730> there<00:02:44.140> so<00:02:45.140> you're<00:02:45.260> going<00:02:45.440> to

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
automatically there so you're going to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:54.480 
automatically there so you're going to
fold<00:02:45.860> back<00:02:46.190> on<00:02:46.520> those<00:02:47.120> lines<00:02:48.100> make<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.130> crease

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.560 

and<00:02:55.490> then<00:02:55.550> you're<00:02:55.850> going<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:57.640> pull<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.880> ear<00:02:59.270> in

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
and then you're going to pull the ear in

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:08.350 
and then you're going to pull the ear in
a<00:03:00.730> little<00:03:01.730> bit<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:06.170> that's<00:03:06.290> tilted<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:08.300> once

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
a little bit so that's tilted and once

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.330 
a little bit so that's tilted and once
you<00:03:08.660> do<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:10.280> little<00:03:10.520> excess<00:03:10.940> space<00:03:11.240> here

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
you do that the little excess space here

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.920 
you do that the little excess space here
you're<00:03:13.340> going<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.790> fold<00:03:14.240> it<00:03:14.420> back<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:16.780> keep<00:03:17.780> it

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
you're going to fold it back to keep it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.070 
you're going to fold it back to keep it
in<00:03:18.080> place<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.910> same<00:03:20.240> thing<00:03:20.540> on<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.050> other

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
in place the same thing on the other

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:29.650 
in place the same thing on the other
side<00:03:27.760> now<00:03:28.760> make<00:03:28.970> sure<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.240> model<00:03:29.540> is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
side now make sure the model is

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.830 
side now make sure the model is
flattened<00:03:30.200> out<00:03:33.520> so<00:03:34.520> that<00:03:34.760> when<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.570> do<00:03:35.720> the

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
flattened out so that when you do the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.069 
flattened out so that when you do the
other<00:03:35.990> things<00:03:36.350> its<00:03:36.800> flattened<00:03:37.400> out

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.289 

so<00:03:43.079> now<00:03:43.230> you're<00:03:43.409> going<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.860> fold<00:03:44.129> these<00:03:45.000> little

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
so now you're going to fold these little

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:54.110 
so now you're going to fold these little
triangles<00:03:45.599> hear<00:03:46.079> back<00:03:46.819> until<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:52.879> looks<00:03:53.879> more

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
triangles hear back until it looks more

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.740 
triangles hear back until it looks more
like<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.360> jawline<00:03:54.659> and<00:03:55.879> do<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:57.030> same<00:03:57.209> thing<00:03:57.450> on

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
like a jawline and do the same thing on

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:08.390 
like a jawline and do the same thing on
the<00:03:57.930> other<00:03:57.959> side<00:04:06.200> and<00:04:07.200> lastly<00:04:07.620> you're<00:04:08.069> going

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the other side and lastly you're going

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.819 
the other side and lastly you're going
to<00:04:08.579> fold<00:04:09.150> this<00:04:09.299> little<00:04:09.840> edge<00:04:09.989> of<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.319> triangle

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
to fold this little edge of the triangle

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:17.629 
to fold this little edge of the triangle
up<00:04:13.549> to<00:04:14.549> create<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.299> little<00:04:16.130> one<00:04:17.130> chin<00:04:17.400> like

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
up to create a little one chin like

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.629 
up to create a little one chin like
structure<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.889> you<00:04:19.889> have<00:04:20.010> your<00:04:20.220> origami

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
structure and you have your origami

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.170 
structure and you have your origami
background<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:22.530> make<00:04:22.650> Batman's<00:04:23.039> eyes<00:04:23.250> you're

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
background to make Batman's eyes you're

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.360 
background to make Batman's eyes you're
going<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.360> take<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.539> pencil<00:04:24.840> I'm<00:04:25.800> going<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.130> draw

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
going to take a pencil I'm going to draw

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:37.710 
going to take a pencil I'm going to draw
out<00:04:26.610> where<00:04:27.419> you<00:04:27.630> want<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.930> eyes<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.080> be

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.330 

so<00:04:38.720> once<00:04:38.960> you've<00:04:39.080> done<00:04:39.229> that<00:04:39.289> probably<00:04:40.129> can't

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
so once you've done that probably can't

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.089 
so once you've done that probably can't
see<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.610> here<00:04:41.360> i'll<00:04:42.169> try<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.470> from<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.860> little

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
see it here i'll try that from a little

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.920 
see it here i'll try that from a little
bit<00:04:43.220> closer<00:04:44.500> and<00:04:45.500> see<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.830> great<00:04:46.780> once<00:04:47.780> you've

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
bit closer and see it great once you've

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.510 
bit closer and see it great once you've
done<00:04:48.050> that<00:04:48.110> you're<00:04:48.530> going<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.830> take<00:04:49.069> white<00:04:49.759> out

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
done that you're going to take white out

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.740 
done that you're going to take white out
you're<00:04:52.520> going<00:04:52.789> to<00:04:53.949> use<00:04:54.949> it<00:04:55.099> to<00:04:55.129> color<00:04:55.460> in<00:04:55.819> the

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
you're going to use it to color in the

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:09.850 
you're going to use it to color in the
eyes

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.120 

so<00:05:10.860> it'll<00:05:11.070> look<00:05:11.190> like<00:05:11.400> this<00:05:12.620> so<00:05:13.620> once<00:05:13.800> it's<00:05:13.980> all

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
so it'll look like this so once it's all

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.280 
so it'll look like this so once it's all
dried<00:05:14.520> you're<00:05:14.940> going<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.480> take<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:15.960> black

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
dried you're going to take a black

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.730 
dried you're going to take a black
pencil<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:17.220> you're<00:05:17.790> going<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.260> color<00:05:19.260> in<00:05:19.500> the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
pencil and you're going to color in the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:35.720 
pencil and you're going to color in the
rim<00:05:20.010> of<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.610> eyes<00:05:21.890> make<00:05:22.890> it<00:05:23.010> or<00:05:23.660> even

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730
