00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Unfortunately I have to cancel cocoon end up 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.020
 as a video I have to go all out 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.790
 end health reasons 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:19.439
 I'll tell you in the following video 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:22.609
 why hello my dear welcome 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.640
 back to the new video and cocoon s 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.380
 demolition why right off many of me 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 I know that I have a fructose 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.640
 and have compatibility and me too 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.899
 have problems and I have it yes 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.480
 actually already this week in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.160
 my blog said it would be a lie if 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.730
 I would say I have none 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.969
 problems 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.850
 there is such a thing in my life and i have it 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.969
 now again a phase where I like that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.890
 a lot of air in the stomach to the star wise even 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.160
 I have real colleagues yesterday 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.920
 been my liver master at home and 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:00.289
 I have a stomach ache so I just knew 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.289
 to go make it no longer has any purpose 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.129
 that was so character for me is to it 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.409
 really have to be careful 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.420
 so if only I could do so much easier 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.380
 have abdominal pain and so that is with 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.530
 not really bad for me now though 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.830
 Yesterday it was so real 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.290
 is going on and so you know 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.909
 that i am so i speak specifically now 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.850
 the budding fructose and 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.579
 you have compatibility I know that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.689
 I 'm absolutely him, so I know 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.850
 what you're talking about first because 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.270
 she is so theoretically portrayed 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.250
 there you have to look back at the things 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.200
 it is generally the case for everyone to get used to it 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.850
 Factors compatibility so you can 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.920
 also two steps must go back 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.509
 neither and so that's just me 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.710
 worth telling is definitely going to do so 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.330
 This is 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.810
 The next four days are extreme 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.110
 watch what I eat and just as well 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.090
 look how are you then after that 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.640
 the complaints then away because with the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.210
 rave sports make the going even 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 Not 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.180
 so i have on monday i was i 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.890
 during training and I have so 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.340
 stomach cramps would have come in the run 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.770
 I thought I turn now immediately 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.350
 comes hit the direct way home 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.190
 and then it pulled through so that 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.380
 I finished the track and 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.590
 to be true but that's just real 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.170
 not meaning and purpose of the thing and there 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.239
 I guess I just have already noticed thou 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.590
 have to do what goes away then had 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.450
 i have the rest of the week somehow 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.010
 not as strong as problems and 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.300
 The lawyer thursday is the first one 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:52.200
 stop so I stop 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.930
 bloated belly third even really 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.030
 on the stomach yesterday was that's right 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.690
 I can not really care about you 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.970
 say 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.799
 I would rather have spectators 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.850
 wondered if that's the case with me 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:10.200
 if I have the right problem 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.810
 So puke must be in the rarest 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.400
 but I think so too 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.880
 it is not and then I live that way 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.290
 are really calm then white 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.489
 now he has to fit again now 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.360
 we have to take a two steps 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.570
 return 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.430
 but it's just generally not going to 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.810
 Carefully with your fructose and 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.630
 Compatibility and it is one 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.200
 incompatibility it really is 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.609
 really uncomfortable and yesterday was times 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.109
 back in the bus we drove the yet 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.870
 I have not had that for ages 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.090
 more really bellyache so I have 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.190
 the last places over two 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.730
 doctors were talking but they were not 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.190
 so bad 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.680
 and now I have to look really that 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.420
 I definitely get more 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.910
 because I really can not do sport 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.470
 I really can not do it 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.330
 even my body moment not at all 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.070
 do to 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.630
 So from here the next four days 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.430
 Very fructose can be reduced 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.580
 at doctorsee and compatibility yes 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.810
 I do not say that less 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.280
 does not work that way 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.110
 because think twice when I speak 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.390
 now the healthy makes newer 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.820
 fridge and look where ever 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.150
 in the foods raw sugar that 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.210
 All foods that taste sweet 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.340
 there is simultaneously fructose off 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.010
 and you will find little food 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.810
 almost no or none at all 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.350
 fracture they do not exist namely 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:47.920
 four so I remember one more 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.920
 Waiting time was really bad leave time 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:56.780
 is the time to rupp dose in big 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.820
 you have to do without because you are 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.300
 then slowly approach the topic again 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.390
 want 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.190
 I had already told in my blog 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.110
 that if you are too careful with the 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.600
 matter goes around and tells itself first 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.420
 there is no forecast at all 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.530
 away because you can handle less and less 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.450
 fructose would make life difficult 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.900
 if you leave all the factors 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.460
 would 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.120
 That's what I want to do now 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.320
 slowly approached a topic for 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.020
 maybe I really like doing it 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.610
 one or the other video 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.290
 Fact is I can not do enough sports 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.960
 I can not do it right 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.640
 nourish and from that is coco takes 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.950
 really died 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.920
 So not in the regularity me 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.440
 have now considered just because 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.610
 to explain them so synonymous times 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.320
 or food 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.790
 stop there especially somehow videos too 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.510
 I think they do too 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.880
 very interesting and the workout will be 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.630
 I promise I'll show you mine 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.870
 workout 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.480
 but I have to do it now for the first time 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.350
 definitely better and better 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.750
 here 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:12.650
 I hope you understand me I know her 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.480
 can not understand and now it will 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.120
 Sundays, so to speak, to be free again for 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.160
 other videos in case you have any 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.950
 Wish you can synonymous mac video 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.690
 or I just explain something 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:29.270
 a Sunday somehow special 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:31.970
 concept time tense I believe there 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.400
 So the place is definitely not free 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:38.270
 stay because in between I have so many 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:43.540
 Ideas in the head and there will definitely be 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:45.590
 one or the other video gives re 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.670
 various topics me 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.160
 would actually also again 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.620
 somehow make an outfit on cd that 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.240
 I have not done it forever 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.560
 say and must stand out yesterday 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.740
 video that is actually quite good 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.390
 arrived and I just want to too 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.770
 in the direction a bit more 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.020
 make and I've pretty much 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.730
 hinted I had as well as in the back of my head 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.590
 you would like to pull through 

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.840
 but that will take a while 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.810
 because I still have video material 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.360
 Filming and I had to go in that too 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.220
 bit failing 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.190
 So I wish you what I slide 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.370
 on the page and link up 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.560
 my last food diary so the new one 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.200
 food diary of course that's about it 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.010
 how do I eat when I 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.600
 have problems 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.930
 I just do not know how I do it 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.910
 I'll give a link below 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.100
 I'll see you in my follow me round 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.440
 from yesterday if you have not seen 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:41.570
 have and I want to be in place 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.340
 give me a thumb again and again 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.390
 up when I like my video 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.650
 you know my abo it's free 

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:51.610
 It'll be good until the next video 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.610
 bye
