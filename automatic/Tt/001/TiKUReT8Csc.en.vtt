00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello very good people that such today we are going to 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.460
 make a video 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.040
 I'm going to listen to a pen that has passed 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.810
 I've heard some thief 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:23.510
 very well I repeat many times I do it for 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:26.720
 nor do they serve as guardians of the house 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:31.490
 good today's video steps from where 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.590
 put the cage or the aviaries or things 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.810
 little houses I do it by levels of the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.150
 nymph and the parakeets many people 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.890
 he says hey Romans where is the best place 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.650
 to put the cages of make me for 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.500
 nymph budgie clear because there are many 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.800
 people who think it's good to put it in 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.480
 the soil is never good to put a 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.550
 cage of a japan or a nymph a 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.350
 budgie on the ground because that what 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.290
 can reach is to make that trauma 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.570
 tife who gets bored although he is overwhelmed and 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.520
 that when we walk by the side 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.290
 from the cage they think we're going 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.570
 I walked to the churra and we pa 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.280
 frighten and always be in stress the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.900
 more good cages put them on the ground 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.880
 then there are many people who tell me 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.470
 romanorum is good to put the cage 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.780
 hung on the roof to the height by 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.659
 example of how high of the table this 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.390
 it is not advisable to hang 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.010
 the cage as they used to hang 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.060
 in the cage of the canaries of the 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.400
 goldfinches or those of the verderones or 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.190
 of the colors on high you understand me 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.990
 because because one does for a nymph 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.810
 a budgie that puts it in a 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.460
 lace on the wall all the way up 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.840
 as long as you leave him 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.700
 it's always going to feel like very 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.340
 dominant and as very dominant to 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.320
 you agree therefore can 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.600
 be that it's a bit aggressive that it's a 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.369
 little territorial dominant that is 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.950
 rebel and that always costs a lot 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.020
 train him to train him or even 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.970
 they got along with it, therefore, it is worth 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.979
 everyone who has so much 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.960
 trained as I do not know that you know that 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.630
 softens it is good to have it in height 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.200
 very big 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.939
 it because then if the soil nor 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.360
 can have very large heights which 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:14.080
 is the ideal place to have it 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.019
 as is logical on the top of a chair or 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.010
 on top of a piece of furniture or on top of 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:23.500
 a table is worth a stable site that does not 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.830
 move or make me almost shiver 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.380
 you understand as for example now you know 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.360
 that there is no earthquake and that it is a 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.299
 stable site and make it a place where 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.489
 also you can when you pass by 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.920
 one of them that does not scare 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.140
 apart also a place where there is no 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.390
 drafts a place where no 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.130
 there is a danger of a cat coming or 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.519
 some dog or some predator to 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.340
 eat it or hunt it and a site like it is 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.440
 logical where there are always people or 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.730
 Listen to TV or music or beech 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.099
 people or where it is worth for example to fix 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.650
 see where I have the pen cage 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.950
 OK 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.040
 and here I have the pen cage me in what 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.829
 high of the chair of a chair in a 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.849
 corner where as you can see there is no 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:16.829
 no window no air passage and 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.069
 there is no kind of window for 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.689
 between no predator or any 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.599
 germany or any cat or anything 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.129
 agreement then when you will pen 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.560
 inside his cage that right now is 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.120
 for the fiddling is worth it right now 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.150
 he's out there playing around like you see him 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.750
 it is out there quill pen greets 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.299
 the camera greets and you see it then 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.859
 when boom is in its cage as 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.900
 so what happens is that whenever 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.150
 let's go through the side of him he does not know 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.280
 it will scare you and therefore it will also see you 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.260
 that you are taller than him are more 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.680
 up therefore feathers always 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.840
 will maintain a pleasant loving attitude 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.209
 and docile and domestic to us from 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.340
 good agreement, as you have seen that 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.769
 is the way to expose the cages and what 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.019
 I have on top of that chair because I 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.449
 comes great is in a perfect corner 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.590
 and then it is the perfect place in 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.970
 my case 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.459
 in the case of all of you 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.500
 You will already know which one to choose, you know 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.090
 that you see three points of fact this 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.919
 video we title it as a video 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.329
 tutorial to know where to place the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.060
 cages of our capon and pnv and 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.790
 parakeets because because the first point 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.770
 is that the second one is not on the floor 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.780
 point of the tutorial is that it is not in the 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.720
 heights the third point of the tutorial is 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.310
 that is in a stable medium place like 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.130
 at the top of a table or chair 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.139
 a piece of furniture the fourth point would be that 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.570
 have drafts or many 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:41.070
 cold or many direct sun that does not 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.229
 hit the sun and one day die of 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.150
 heatstroke and the fifth point is that no 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.070
 have a window or have no door or 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.110
 that does not have somewhere where some 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.940
 cat some dog or even someone can 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.680
 come and I can not catch it I can not 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.110
 remove or can not steal or kill him 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.580
 you understand me then are the points to 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.030
 keep in mind about the issue of 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.570
 cage the theme of the aviaries or the theme 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.880
 of the jaulones is worth as well as 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.590
 call people or delas boladeras 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.360
 I do not have any here right now 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.830
 so I can teach it but yes it is 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.479
 true that I've seen a lot on video in 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.260
 documentaries in photos and in life of my 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.810
 subscribers 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.980
 then the best place to put them are 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.930
 in the gardens where there are the same 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.690
 things we've talked about the cage 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.360
 but in a jail or a flying or 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.490
 is not in a step site 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.960
 very large air that is not in one place 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.700
 where can you give the currents of 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.290
 very large air that is not in one place 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.420
 where the sun is starting every day 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.270
 all the day you have a place between 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.060
 sun and shadow that do not have any type 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.300
 of problems that may come some 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.820
 in some raptor or some cat or some 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.440
 dog someone to attack him and make it 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.390
 somewhere where you are safe and nobody 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.340
 can get to ree your aviary 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.070
 remove a japan and take it and so on 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.020
 then perfect place to put 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.460
 pass a ball of deras comes what 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.560
 same as the cages themselves 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.720
 techniques only that the balls relaxes and 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.370
 the cop the aviaries usually have 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.410
 two or three meters high by others 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.030
 two or three in width and in the background and 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.560
 then, as is logical, you will have 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.350
 have a fairly large plot of land and 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.940
 quite broad agree okay I hope 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.430
 that you liked the video a lot 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.080
 I shared it and you know I appreciate it 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.180
 always your likes 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.099
 and that you help this video 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.409
 tutorial on the subject of the cages of 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.439
 agreement and as is logical already in another 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:30.539
 video later we will make a video 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:32.909
 about the types of cages that exist 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.159
 flying aviaries where I in the video 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:36.270
 I will go saying pictures of 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:38.400
 each and every one of the cages 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.680
 different than there is so much for lovebirds 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.990
 as nymphs and parakeet that I 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.539
 I notice that for the three types they tend 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.939
 have different cages do it for me 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:50.460
 they have yours the nymphs his and the 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:52.650
 budgies of yours agree a good 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.940
 cordial greeting guys and girls and chau 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.940
 bye bye
