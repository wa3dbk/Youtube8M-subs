00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
and expression even if you're not making

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.580 
and expression even if you're not making
a<00:02:59.150> living<00:02:59.300> at<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.540> am<00:02:59.780> i<00:02:59.870> doing<00:03:00.140> that<00:03:00.290> every<00:03:00.560> day

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
it tested up with me when you were

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.060 
it tested up with me when you were
talking<00:05:08.490> about<00:05:08.870> being<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:10.050> writer<00:05:10.349> in<00:05:10.680> learning

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
your voice i think was also part of that

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.990 
your voice i think was also part of that

really<00:05:18.360> sure<00:05:18.720> about<00:05:19.409> that<00:05:19.800> and<00:05:19.949> i<00:05:19.979> was

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
really sure about that and i was

narrative nonfiction writers that I

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.990 
narrative nonfiction writers that I
enjoyed<00:05:49.630> so<00:05:49.990> when<00:05:50.110> I<00:05:50.139> started<00:05:50.590> writing<00:05:50.830> I<00:05:51.220> just

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.150 
enjoyed so when I started writing I just
did<00:05:52.240> my<00:05:52.270> best<00:05:52.720> to<00:05:53.080> emulate<00:05:53.590> them<00:05:53.860> and

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
did my best to emulate them and

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.629 
did my best to emulate them and
eventually<00:05:55.150> found<00:05:55.930> my<00:05:56.320> own<00:05:56.530> narrative<00:05:57.490> voice

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
eventually found my own narrative voice

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.600 
eventually found my own narrative voice
through<00:05:58.270> that<00:05:58.800> and<00:05:59.800> I<00:05:59.979> realized<00:06:00.310> that<00:06:00.430> I<00:06:00.490> was

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
through that and I realized that I was

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.670 
through that and I realized that I was
sort<00:06:00.759> of<00:06:00.820> sounding<00:06:01.240> more<00:06:01.509> like<00:06:01.539> me<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.350> less

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
sort of sounding more like me and less

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.270 
sort of sounding more like me and less
like<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:03.250> way<00:06:03.460> that<00:06:03.610> I<00:06:03.669> interpreted<00:06:04.210> it<00:06:04.240> then

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
like the way that I interpreted it then

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.249 
like the way that I interpreted it then
it's<00:06:06.280> been<00:06:06.490> an<00:06:06.580> extreme<00:06:07.210> challenge<00:06:07.600> for<00:06:08.110> me

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
it's been an extreme challenge for me

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.400 
it's been an extreme challenge for me
