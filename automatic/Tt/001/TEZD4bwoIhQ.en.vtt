to<00:00:31.740> do<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> custom<00:00:32.250> build<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.180> when<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> launch

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to do a custom build so when the launch

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.810 
to do a custom build so when the launch
came<00:00:33.870> around<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.410> asked<00:00:34.770> Kawasaki<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.550> showed

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
came around we asked Kawasaki I showed

came around we asked Kawasaki I showed
him<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.969> cell<00:00:36.270> phone<00:00:36.420> photo<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.050> rendering

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
him a cell phone photo of the rendering

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.500 
him a cell phone photo of the rendering
and<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.070> said<00:00:38.280> man<00:00:38.489> that's<00:00:38.640> killer<00:00:39.000> let's<00:00:39.270> do

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.100 
it
so<00:00:40.620> our<00:00:40.920> pitch<00:00:41.190> was<00:00:41.430> it's<00:00:41.670> an<00:00:41.790> SS<00:00:42.390> 4<00:00:42.899> 4

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so our pitch was it's an SS 4 4

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.810 
so our pitch was it's an SS 4 4
scrambler<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:44.070> we're<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> make<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> into

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
scrambler so we're going to make it into

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.130 
scrambler so we're going to make it into
a<00:00:44.850> little<00:00:44.910> bit<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> scramble<00:00:45.570> bike<00:00:45.840> we're

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
a little bit of a scramble bike we're

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.779 
a little bit of a scramble bike we're
going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> try<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.680> raise<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.430> ride<00:00:47.579> height

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
going to try to raise the ride height

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.970 
going to try to raise the ride height
just<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.149> little<00:00:48.329> bit<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> new<00:00:49.739> front

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
just a little bit do a new front

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.430 
just a little bit do a new front
suspension<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:52.140> make<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
suspension and then just make it a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.869 
suspension and then just make it a
little<00:00:52.500> bit<00:00:52.680> more<00:00:52.800> capable<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.699> some

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
little bit more capable we can do some

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.670 
little bit more capable we can do some
off-road<00:00:54.210> riding<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:55.230> really<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.620> able

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
off-road riding and just really be able

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.529 
off-road riding and just really be able
to<00:00:55.770> thrash<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> we've<00:00:56.760> never<00:00:57.059> done<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
to thrash on it we've never done like a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.139 
to thrash on it we've never done like a
full<00:00:57.960> build<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.489> we're<00:00:59.699> done<00:00:59.910> we're

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
full build so when we're done we're

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.369 
full build so when we're done we're
running<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> website<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> day<00:01:01.170> we're

fair amount of time into October I

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.229 
fair amount of time into October I
believe<00:02:16.530> our<00:02:17.160> biggest<00:02:17.400> challenge<00:02:17.880> will<00:02:18.090> be
