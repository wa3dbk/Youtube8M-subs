00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello everyone is good 777 welcome back 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.080
 in the series of economic players 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.360
 today we're going to see the nesta 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.849
 economic yes i know it is cheap e 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.429
 all these things here though considering 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.109
 even the place ranges now I think 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.480
 this is one of the last players 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.490
 cheap that I'm going to do because then 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.590
 the others will cost less than 20 thousand 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 credits so it's not worth it yes 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.699
 they can put away 20,000 but anyway 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.000
 the series will not end because as I had 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.340
 say 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.109
 I will start with economic legends but 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.730
 if, however, you would like to see 4 a 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.440
 some other player 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.840
 let me know past in the comments and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.700
 Then I'll see if I do it anyway 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.210
 remember to like this video 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.579
 and the economic graft is xavi then i 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.129
 comrades and the economic version of himself 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.260
 same is fine let's start right away from the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.649
 main statistics then we have 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 iniesta with 75 speed against 66 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.949
 of this there is therefore more 9 per iniesta Ã¨ 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.719
 quite a lot but in the end none of two 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.760
 points to speed as a statistic 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.070
 main certain to have a little more 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.570
 it would be better but anyway I wanted to say 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.390
 last thing is also one of the last 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.159
 because then it doesn't become so easy 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.900
 look for a cheap player of a 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.119
 player that does not already cost much ie 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 much simpler to find absurd 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.240
 an economic player of one more 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.670
 expensive 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.860
 oh well we go ahead and find a 91 of 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.409
 dribbling iniesta against the 85 of 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.700
 charlie also wins here in essence 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.060
 to say Spanish I hear some 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.880
 Spanish shooting and 72 for both the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 defense instead of compound 59 against 60 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.439
 therefore, the passage there is great at all 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.920
 and two 89 against 91 and finally the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.850
 happiness and 63 iniesta against 58 of 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.100
 xavi 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.899
 in the end the only statistic that is much 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 speed is different because of the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.030
 the rest are quite the same 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.729
 minimum price of charlie is between 700 and 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.680
 10,000 credits while that of iniesta 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.270
 and between 15 thousand and 25 thousand 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.280
 oh well then this at the time you find 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.619
 now the chance stars in the foot 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.990
 weak only 44 per iniesta while xavi a 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.300
 33 but you never know how to see the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.489
 statistics in the game first of all 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.010
 both have total statistics 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.769
 quite high because we have 2092's 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.019
 nesta against 2060 of xavi but now 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.209
 let's put aside for a moment 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.310
 now there are barcelona players 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.860
 we will see iniesta how many times 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.510
 I say their name every time I look 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.170
 always to find synonyms and marks 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.480
 I'll never find it 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.180
 oh well we have among the statistics 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.630
 better than xavi the 93 control 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.470
 very good ball really great 85 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.599
 of cross and the 90 of long passage 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.910
 all in this along with 95 of 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.430
 short pass I want to point out how 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.370
 all these statistics except the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.319
 ball control of one is lower 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.790
 are superior to those of many others 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.340
 they say that wine is good to me 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.739
 genuinely like it they don't suck like 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.910
 you think all this stuff is here 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.530
 statistics I told you now 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.959
 excellent are seasoned by the 94 division that 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.700
 makes it become I don't know I don't know what to say 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.590
 anyway something good 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.260
 those of nesta in the end do not 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.880
 they deviate so much from those of xavi 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.700
 however we must also consider that it is a 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.040
 89 so something better will have to though 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.750
 have it now you're seeing my pros 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.209
 my against my final vote on 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.519
 paper I still remind you to suggest me 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.230
 needed another player to do 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.940
 or suggest me directly 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.739
 legend to do with which to start the 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.650
 series because then after finishing the 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.989
 Leading legends can be teams 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.579
 of the season because time I come 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.590
 all the legends will already be ct dino of 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.870
 the season and then this series 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.329
 I will continue as much as possible I also believe 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.130
 quite a lot because because they are so many papers 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.049
 to do okay I see you like it 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.180
 however, I will try to carry it forward 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.829
 if the video is nice you like it 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.200
 written to my channel and comments and da 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.200
 boeing 777 all hello to everyone
