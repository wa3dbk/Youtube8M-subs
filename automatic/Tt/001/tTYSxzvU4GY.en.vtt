 from what we do the so-called 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.189

 in order for the yeast to be what 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.890
 eat a tablespoon of sugar 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.170
 mix and leave for 10-15 minutes 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.780
 in order to make prisoners 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.549
 hat so that we can understand 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.420
 that our yeast is quite ready 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.690
 cooperate with us further and our couple 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:45.570
 approached we can continue to do our 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:50.010
 yolk dough with remaining sugar 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:57.799

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:57.799
 melted add vanilla sugar 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.729
 shuffle after to make it more 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.729
 less uniform 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.070
 here we add our 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:42.120
 Well, of course now sifted flour 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.120
 mixed with salt 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.140
 here we add 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.700
 all our spices are you and zest 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.709
 nothing to get lost is the most delicious and 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.880
 knead the dough we have to 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.100
 knead to smoothness and uniformity 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:26.760
 thick dough we will not have it 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.620
 be gentle dough we have smooth but 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.270
 but the genre is of course still to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.390
 hands sticks because she is enough 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.810
 liquid as soon as it became smooth it 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:42.060
 we are quite satisfied to 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:48.239
 tighten the dough with foil and put it in a warm place 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:51.150
 place for proofing for an hour and a half she 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.330
 we should increase in volume at least 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.700
 twice and now our dough is completely 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.700
 come now we add 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.310
 table flour we remember that the dough is very 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.620
 It was 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:18.829
 so sticky without my flour 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:18.829
 hug can't transfer dough here 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:37.720
 we crush him so that all the air and someone 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:46.670
 left and roll out the dough approximately 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:53.090
 at 8 millimeters thick maybe a little 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:56.150
 less than 68 something like this 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.200
 Here we have the thickness we now 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.200
 glasses or a special mold 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:08.440
 cut the rings around 7 7 s 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:13.760

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.600
 from prepared rot we transfer to 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.730
 wax paper lay them on 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.450
 a short distance from each other to 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:29.420
 they had the opportunity to grow 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:32.060
 cover them with film and remove for download 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.360

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.490
 an hour later sugonyako simple Les not 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.210

 Oil near one side of the other 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:41.910
