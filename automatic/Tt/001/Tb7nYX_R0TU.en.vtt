00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.679
 Hello and welcome to the garden 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.769
 / blog we are back with the bees 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.839
 I mean there are tons of I live 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.160
 but at the same time I am still 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.020
 not sure and above all interested 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.840
 me if your feed particle at all 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.609
 Have accepted 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.080
 I still have something here I have 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.820
 even this valley belongs because there was 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.310
 warning for the bee boxes beekeepers 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.380
 that even the feed goes out because 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.660
 the weather is so bad to a 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.580
 Maybe I'll still have a spring 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.500
 just push in with certain 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.330
 soothe 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.630
 We'll take a look at it 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.860
 row after again 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.970
 Maybe we'll listen to it 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.720
 There is a lot going on here 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.690
 the two days, what does it look like? 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:54.910
 the advantage is gone I've got it 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.910
 thought that worked fine 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.510
 but we need now we need 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.160
 not my thing is that very easy 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.880
 I'll put it one more anyway 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:21.910
 charge feed pond on rather once 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:24.530
 more than once too little and lid too 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.390
 the swarm of the club we had 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.900
 have but I believe that any true 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.170
 we had given that down know 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.170
 he still 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:46.200
 also the food offense away just fine 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.929
 I thought so, I think many 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.149
 in my position would act the same way 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.740
 rather on number sure 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.119
 to be stupid afterward 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.799
 In a few years, that will work for me too 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:05.369
 not be so but at the moment is 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:09.539
 I definitely too risky that the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.150
 are not a big helping here 1.2 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.019
 kilo or something 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.260
 13 So what's going on here now 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:24.870
 I do not go without a veil to it 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:29.010
 So I have to say fair, like me 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.060
 look there you can see that there 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.540
 something else is in it and that is the goods 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.150
 full 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.880
 how was it full there is something else 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.470
 on it and that is full so that would have to 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.359
 rich as I am now doing nothing 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.769
 tuned 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:46.430
 i have no empty weight of nec's 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:52.380
 I can not figure it out exactly and 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:58.549
 to estimate by hand there is bad 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:03.359
 hard though he is still powerful heavy 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:08.239
 you can say bad then we throw 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:10.620
 a glance purely what is happening here so 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.989
 you can tell if something here 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.450
 There is no food left in the back 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.450
 Last corners I do not see a lining 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.280
 So I'll put something here too 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.519
 One the beehives side says though 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.420
 to feed liquid 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.750
 I suppose I have this now 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:36.120
 This day I'll try it that way 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.620
 whether he should be accepted 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.319
 well, it's not that far from being fit 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:44.639
 I also did that to the bees 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.750
 do the lattice from today should that 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.130
 well 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.130
 enough I had festgetackert 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.970
 then they have no problems 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.140
 to come in. I heard that when 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.230
 those through the grid then have to fall 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:11.670
 the partially the pollen down and also 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:12.810
 where he goes from now there is 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.320
 no more mice I have just now 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.630
 only one caught if the word helps me 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.709
 I do not know but I have them 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.190
 already a little last time 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.190
 water put down 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.200
 it's supposed to get drier now 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.970
 life is not much in it drowned the 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.410
 has worked 34 pieces maybe 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.910
 So, not the world, I hope so 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.460
 I have done my best for now 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.990
 the next few days but where we are 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.900
 I 'm about to become one 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.060
 look at how far we are still from 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.110
 The app bees explosion from the spring 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.550
 are really removed when the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.180
 fruit trees start to form because then 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.770
 is definitely over with worries then 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.780
 should actually go up the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.490
 apple trees look if I have any 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:05.700
 buds and which flowers find so 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:09.919
 Maybe there is nothing and there 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:13.260
 far up here, too 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.300
 Again, it does not look any better 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.280
 still takes 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:22.880
 What the physical do not say anything 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.910
 to find something with the pears 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.250
 will take days but last but 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.450
 Not least , I still have at 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.460
 planting was perhaps still found 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.930
 catch up 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.090
 so far a short update from the bees 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.490
 is about documenting and indeed 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.300
 every single step is necessary 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.980
 when you start beekeeping 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.720
 nothing new so he was then similar in the 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.530
 But last film is about it all 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.780
 to document 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.020
 if you want to know more recently in the garden 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.580
 de / blog youtube-channel haase any amount 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.120
 interesting when a family tries 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.860
 more interesting bees chickens to live 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.110
 Giant garden grain farming everything 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.580
 this includes interesting channel 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.580
 do not forget to subscribe there is the 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.470
 left and there are a few movies of me 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.790
 with other topics that are also interesting 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.790
 are as previously tschÃ¼ss
