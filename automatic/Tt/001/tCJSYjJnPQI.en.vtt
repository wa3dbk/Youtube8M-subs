shoot<00:01:49.079> at<00:01:49.530> by<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> glaciers<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.090> should<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
shoot at by the glaciers and should be a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.589 
shoot at by the glaciers and should be a
pretty<00:01:52.469> interesting<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.189> mean<00:01:53.399> never<00:01:54.000> been<00:01:54.450> in

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:54.599 
pretty interesting I mean never been in

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:55.969 
pretty interesting I mean never been in
this<00:01:54.719> kind<00:01:54.959> of<00:01:55.079> climate<00:01:55.289> before<00:01:55.829> it's

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
this kind of climate before it's

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.089 
this kind of climate before it's
freezing<00:01:56.700> cold<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.630> waters<00:01:57.959> has<00:01:58.289> ice<00:01:58.679> in<00:01:58.709> it

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
freezing cold the waters has ice in it

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.459 
freezing cold the waters has ice in it
so<00:01:59.340> I'm<00:01:59.429> pretty<00:01:59.719> interested<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.319> how<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
so I'm pretty interested to see how that

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.889 
so I'm pretty interested to see how that
goes<00:02:01.679> but<00:02:02.189> otherwise<00:02:02.849> so<00:02:03.450> blessed<00:02:03.780> so

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
goes but otherwise so blessed so

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.469 
goes but otherwise so blessed so
fortunate<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.560> be<00:02:04.679> here<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.250> can't<00:02:06.149> wait<00:02:06.299> for

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
fortunate to be here and can't wait for

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.210 
fortunate to be here and can't wait for
today's<00:02:06.689> race<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.319> can't<00:02:07.739> wait<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.099> what

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
today's race and can't wait to see what

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.490 
today's race and can't wait to see what
happens

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.620 

so<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.100> is<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.460> start<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.000> second<00:02:16.390> year

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
so this is the start of the second year

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.510 
so this is the start of the second year
for<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> standout<00:02:17.260> World<00:02:17.410> Series<00:02:17.620> whilst

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
for the standout World Series whilst

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.830 
for the standout World Series whilst
it's<00:02:18.730> probably<00:02:19.000> not<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.150> most<00:02:19.240> populated

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
it's probably not the most populated

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.240 
it's probably not the most populated
area<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.350> world<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.680> be<00:02:20.770> running<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.100> World

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
area in the world to be running a World

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.770 
area in the world to be running a World
Series<00:02:21.340> races<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.120> certainly<00:02:22.450> one<00:02:22.630> of<00:02:22.660> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
Series races is certainly one of the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.510 
Series races is certainly one of the
most<00:02:22.870> dramatic<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.530> what<00:02:23.950> we<00:02:24.040> wanted<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.310> do

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
most dramatic and what we wanted to do

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.770 
most dramatic and what we wanted to do
for<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.820> year<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.180> World<00:02:25.360> Series<00:02:25.510> would

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
for this year on the World Series would

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.390 
for this year on the World Series would
start<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.170> year<00:02:26.290> with<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.470> bang<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:27.280> is

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
start the year with a bang and this is

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.650 
start the year with a bang and this is
what<00:02:27.550> we<00:02:27.670> have<00:02:27.760> achieved<00:02:27.850> we<00:02:28.270> have<00:02:28.420> some<00:02:28.570> of

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
what we have achieved we have some of

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.450 
what we have achieved we have some of
