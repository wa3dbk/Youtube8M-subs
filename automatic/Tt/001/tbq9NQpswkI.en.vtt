with the idea of having a lock that
basically<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.940> smart<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.140> interacts<00:00:40.680> with

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
basically is smart and it interacts with

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.500 
basically is smart and it interacts with
our<00:00:40.890> smartphones<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.579> gives<00:00:42.059> us<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> ability

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
our smartphones and gives us the ability

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.779 
our smartphones and gives us the ability
to<00:00:42.719> control<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.770> entry<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.160> exit<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.489> people

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
to control the entry and exit of people

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.270 
to control the entry and exit of people
at<00:00:45.030> our<00:00:45.660> discretion<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.770> way<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
at our discretion and the way we do that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
at our discretion and the way we do that
is<00:00:47.340> using<00:00:47.670> Facebook<00:00:48.120> now<00:00:48.629> Facebook<00:00:49.079> has<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
is using Facebook now Facebook has a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.010 
is using Facebook now Facebook has a
platform<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> 1.3<00:00:51.030> billion<00:00:51.360> people<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
platform of 1.3 billion people and the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.779 
platform of 1.3 billion people and the
reason<00:00:52.199> for<00:00:52.289> selecting<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.730> of

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
reason for selecting that was because of

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.819 
reason for selecting that was because of
its<00:00:53.910> reach<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.390> also<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.649> have

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
its reach and also because we have

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.819 
its reach and also because we have
friends<00:00:56.190> Friends<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.000> Facebook<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
friends Friends of Facebook and so the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.560 
friends Friends of Facebook and so the
way<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> works<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.760> we<00:01:00.059> create<00:01:00.390> an

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
way that it works is that we create an

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.630 
way that it works is that we create an
event<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.899> Facebook<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.129> example<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.520> we

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
event on Facebook so for example if we

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.270 
event on Facebook so for example if we
create<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> flop<00:01:03.090> test<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:04.350> invite<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
create the flop test and we invite the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.320 
create the flop test and we invite the
number<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.549> people<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.939> want<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.150> invite

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
number of people that we want to invite

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.800 
number of people that we want to invite
to<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.630> event<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.350> case<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.830> two

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
to the event so in this case we have two

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.410 
to the event so in this case we have two
now<00:01:09.810> when<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.560> people<00:01:10.650> RSVP<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.549> confirms<00:01:12.090> on

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
now when the people RSVP it confirms on

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.410 
now when the people RSVP it confirms on
the<00:01:12.810> system<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> be

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
the system that they are going to be

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.990 
the system that they are going to be
coming<00:01:15.420> coming<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.640> what<00:01:17.640> happens<00:01:17.939> is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
coming coming and so what happens is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.780 
coming coming and so what happens is
that<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> smartphone<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:19.369> connects<00:01:20.369> with

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
that the smartphone then connects with

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.440 
that the smartphone then connects with
the<00:01:21.119> lock<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.869> Facebook<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.330> once<00:01:24.330> we

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.070
