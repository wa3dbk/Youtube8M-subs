00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.530 

learning<00:00:13.360> to<00:00:13.390> be<00:00:13.630> a<00:00:13.660> better<00:00:13.870> reviewer<00:00:14.440> is

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
learning to be a better reviewer is

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.800 
learning to be a better reviewer is
critical<00:00:16.540> because<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:18.400> helps<00:00:18.850> to<00:00:19.030> externalize

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
critical because it helps to externalize

critical because it helps to externalize
the<00:00:20.369> knowledge<00:00:21.369> that<00:00:21.400> you're<00:00:21.730> learning<00:00:21.970> as<00:00:22.360> a

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
the knowledge that you're learning as a

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.210 
the knowledge that you're learning as a
writer<00:00:22.720> yourself<00:00:23.290> when<00:00:23.590> you<00:00:23.680> have<00:00:23.830> to<00:00:23.980> give

writer yourself when you have to give

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.380 
writer yourself when you have to give
that<00:00:24.250> advice<00:00:24.580> to<00:00:25.090> someone<00:00:25.720> else<00:00:27.390> you're

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
that advice to someone else you're

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.290 
that advice to someone else you're
creating<00:00:28.930> a<00:00:29.020> kind<00:00:29.289> of<00:00:29.760> dialogue<00:00:30.760> in<00:00:30.820> your<00:00:31.180> own

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
creating a kind of dialogue in your own

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.439 
creating a kind of dialogue in your own
mind<00:00:31.570> about<00:00:32.129> what<00:00:33.129> is<00:00:33.370> valuable<00:00:33.940> in<00:00:34.000> writing

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
mind about what is valuable in writing

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.630 
mind about what is valuable in writing
and<00:00:34.570> so<00:00:34.989> this<00:00:35.530> may<00:00:35.830> or<00:00:35.949> may<00:00:36.070> not<00:00:36.100> be<00:00:36.430> something

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
and so this may or may not be something

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.070 
and so this may or may not be something
you<00:00:36.820> do<00:00:37.030> when<00:00:37.180> you're<00:00:37.390> revising<00:00:37.600> your<00:00:37.840> own

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.390 
you do when you're revising your own
work<00:00:38.290> but<00:00:38.530> when<00:00:38.739> you<00:00:38.800> have<00:00:38.860> to<00:00:39.040> frame<00:00:39.250> that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
work but when you have to frame that

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.820 
work but when you have to frame that
advice<00:00:39.670> for<00:00:39.970> another<00:00:40.629> person<00:00:41.170> it<00:00:41.559> becomes

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
advice for another person it becomes

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.329 
advice for another person it becomes
explicit<00:00:42.430> to<00:00:42.580> you<00:00:42.699> in<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:44.230> a<00:00:44.500> way<00:00:44.620> perhaps<00:00:44.830> that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
explicit to you in in a way perhaps that

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.880 
explicit to you in in a way perhaps that
it<00:00:45.460> doesn't<00:00:45.850> any<00:00:46.780> other<00:00:47.019> way<00:00:47.320> through<00:00:47.530> I<00:00:47.650> think

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
it doesn't any other way through I think

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.310 
it doesn't any other way through I think
that<00:00:47.949> doing<00:00:48.610> reviews<00:00:49.059> quite<00:00:49.659> simply<00:00:49.870> makes

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
that doing reviews quite simply makes

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.420 
that doing reviews quite simply makes
you<00:00:50.440> more<00:00:51.280> aware<00:00:51.460> of<00:00:52.650> the<00:00:53.650> revision<00:00:54.190> moves

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
you more aware of the revision moves

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.570 
you more aware of the revision moves
that<00:00:55.269> you<00:00:55.449> yourself<00:00:55.900> might<00:00:56.110> then<00:00:56.350> use<00:00:56.589> with

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
that you yourself might then use with

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.090 
that you yourself might then use with
your<00:00:57.760> own<00:00:57.879> writing

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.320 

review<00:01:04.000> itself<00:01:04.449> is<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:04.900> skill<00:01:05.439> that<00:01:06.330> people

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
review itself is a skill that people

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.080 
review itself is a skill that people
need<00:01:07.540> on<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.930> job<00:01:08.140> so<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.070> ability<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.759> look

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
need on the job so the ability to look

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.810 
need on the job so the ability to look
at<00:01:10.210> someone<00:01:10.540> else's<00:01:10.840> work<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.979> understand

at someone else's work to understand

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.109 
at someone else's work to understand
what<00:01:13.420> could<00:01:13.810> happen<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.440> make<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:14.740> better

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
what could happen to make it better

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.760 
what could happen to make it better
that's<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.360> critical<00:01:16.750> part<00:01:17.080> of<00:01:17.170> being<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.470> leader

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
that's a critical part of being a leader

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.600 
that's a critical part of being a leader

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.970 

what<00:02:12.760> we're<00:02:12.999> working<00:02:13.299> with<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.560> notion

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
what we're working with is the notion

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.809 
what we're working with is the notion
that<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:16.349> teaching<00:02:17.349> students<00:02:17.859> to<00:02:17.950> read<00:02:18.549> the

that in teaching students to read the
writing<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.209> others<00:02:19.569> student<00:02:20.170> writing<00:02:20.319> in

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:20.499 
writing of others student writing in

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.009 
writing of others student writing in
this<00:02:20.620> case<00:02:20.859> in<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:22.030> very<00:02:22.269> focused<00:02:22.629> and

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
this case in a very focused and

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.500 
this case in a very focused and
structured<00:02:23.499> way<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:24.489> we<00:02:24.639> can<00:02:24.819> help<00:02:25.030> students

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
structured way that we can help students

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.470 
structured way that we can help students
become<00:02:25.810> better<00:02:26.230> writers<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:27.909> their<00:02:28.150> own<00:02:28.269> right

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
become better writers in their own right

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.289 
become better writers in their own right
so<00:02:28.870> they<00:02:29.319> practice<00:02:29.859> very<00:02:30.099> structured<00:02:30.670> reading

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
so they practice very structured reading

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.879 
so they practice very structured reading
activities<00:02:31.870> as<00:02:32.049> a<00:02:32.290> part<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.739> review

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889 
activities as a part of the review

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.220 
activities as a part of the review
process<00:02:33.189> driven<00:02:34.090> by<00:02:34.359> particular<00:02:34.750> kinds<00:02:35.139> of

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
process driven by particular kinds of

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.720 
process driven by particular kinds of
criteria<00:02:35.909> and<00:02:36.909> then<00:02:37.269> in<00:02:37.599> reading<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:39.340> work<00:02:39.549> of

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
criteria and then in reading the work of

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.300 
criteria and then in reading the work of
others<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.389> way<00:02:40.629> it<00:02:41.379> gives<00:02:41.709> them<00:02:42.099> an

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
others in that way it gives them an

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.159 
others in that way it gives them an
experience<00:02:42.609> of<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.389> kind<00:02:43.599> of<00:02:43.659> writing<00:02:43.900> that

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:44.169 
experience of the kind of writing that

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.170 
experience of the kind of writing that
they<00:02:44.349> in<00:02:44.590> turn<00:02:44.919> are<00:02:45.159> expected<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.819> do<00:02:45.939> at<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
they in turn are expected to do at the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.080 
they in turn are expected to do at the
same<00:02:46.359> time<00:02:46.599> so<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.709> students<00:02:48.099> therefore<00:02:48.519> have

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
same time so the students therefore have

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.589 
same time so the students therefore have
the<00:02:49.510> experience<00:02:50.379> of<00:02:51.090> criteria<00:02:52.090> related<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.569> a

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
the experience of criteria related to a

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.839 
the experience of criteria related to a
writing<00:02:52.989> assignment<00:02:53.290> as<00:02:53.799> a<00:02:53.859> reader<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.579> as<00:02:54.819> a

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
assignment and the criteria that are

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.970 
assignment and the criteria that are

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
in their own writing then they turn

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.920 
in their own writing then they turn
around<00:03:05.560> his<00:03:05.919> readers<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.489> say<00:03:06.849> okay<00:03:07.239> how<00:03:07.719> do<00:03:07.780> I

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
see those same criteria and those same

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.089 
see those same criteria and those same
values<00:03:10.049> playing<00:03:11.049> out<00:03:11.230> in<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.439> writing<00:03:11.829> of<00:03:11.889> my

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
productive way to try and help them

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.089 
productive way to try and help them
become<00:03:16.299> better<00:03:16.329> writers<00:03:16.750> in<00:03:17.169> relationship<00:03:18.069> to

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
become better writers in relationship to

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:24.300 
become better writers in relationship to
those<00:03:18.370> criteria<00:03:18.939> and<00:03:19.060> those<00:03:19.180> values

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.600 

so<00:03:25.270> the<00:03:25.930> pedagogical<00:03:26.319> theory<00:03:27.040> here<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.430> that

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
so the pedagogical theory here is that

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.100 
so the pedagogical theory here is that
students<00:03:28.030> get<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.150> very<00:03:28.390> focused<00:03:28.930> very

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
students get a very focused very

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.140 
students get a very focused very
structured<00:03:29.920> reading<00:03:30.310> experience<00:03:30.849> alongside

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
structured reading experience alongside

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
a very focused and very structured

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.160 
a very focused and very structured
riding<00:03:33.940> experience<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:35.080> the

riding experience and that the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.979 
riding experience and that the
relationships<00:03:35.830> between<00:03:35.950> those<00:03:36.430> two<00:03:36.760> have<00:03:37.569> an

relationships between those two have an

relationships between those two have an

impact of a positive impact on the

impact of a positive impact on the
writing<00:03:40.360> improvement<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:41.170> we<00:03:41.290> see<00:03:41.470> in

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
writing improvement that we see in
