here at Air actually incorporate a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.469 
here at Air actually incorporate a
serious<00:02:01.890> running<00:02:02.250> game<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.640> understand<00:02:03.329> that

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
serious running game and understand that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.940 
serious running game and understand that
every<00:02:03.780> running<00:02:04.049> play<00:02:04.229> isn't<00:02:04.469> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
every running play isn't going to be a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.800 
every running play isn't going to be a
big<00:02:05.250> play<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.210> got<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> stay<00:02:06.600> consistent

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
big play but you got to stay consistent

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.090 
big play but you got to stay consistent
that's<00:02:07.380> how<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.590> get<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.979> big<00:02:08.220> gains<00:02:08.550> if<00:02:08.789> you

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
that's how you get the big gains if you

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.830 
that's how you get the big gains if you
stopped<00:02:09.340> on<00:02:09.550> first<00:02:09.820> don't<00:02:10.210> be<00:02:10.360> scared<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.720> run

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
stopped on first don't be scared to run

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.990 
stopped on first don't be scared to run
it<00:02:10.990> on<00:02:11.110> second<00:02:11.680> down<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.040> once<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.760> start

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
it on second down and once you start

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.460 
it on second down and once you start
running<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.510> really<00:02:13.690> get<00:02:13.900> your<00:02:14.050> opponent

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
running it you really get your opponent

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.980 
running it you really get your opponent
to<00:02:14.500> give<00:02:14.740> up<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.100> bag<00:02:15.430> d<00:02:15.730> mindset<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.540> they

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
to give up that bag d mindset and they

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.390 
to give up that bag d mindset and they
might<00:02:17.170> actually<00:02:17.320> start<00:02:17.680> committing<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.280> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
might actually start committing to the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.980 
might actually start committing to the
run<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.970> that's<00:02:19.360> when<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.570> can<00:02:19.690> catch<00:02:19.870> them

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
run and that's when you can catch them

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.050 
run and that's when you can catch them
over<00:02:20.320> top<00:02:20.530> with<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.070> play-action<00:02:21.430> pass<00:02:21.760> and

over top with the play-action pass and
hopefully<00:02:22.420> get<00:02:22.600> them<00:02:22.720> with<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> big<00:02:23.470> place

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770

run play but it's different mindset than
we're<00:02:31.870> actually<00:02:32.020> trying<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.440> run<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.310> ball

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
we're actually trying to run the ball

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.100 
we're actually trying to run the ball
and<00:02:33.700> get<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.820> running<00:02:34.090> game<00:02:34.390> going<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:34.990> come

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
and get a running game going we can come

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.320 
and get a running game going we can come
out<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.320> pass<00:02:35.560> formations<00:02:36.250> pass<00:02:36.790> for<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.120> while

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
out in pass formations pass for a while

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.270 
out in pass formations pass for a while
but<00:02:37.630> then<00:02:37.810> mix<00:02:38.050> them<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.290> draw<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:39.100> draw

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
but then mix them the draw and the draw

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.440 
but then mix them the draw and the draw
is<00:02:39.340> going<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.610> be<00:02:39.730> extremely<00:02:40.210> effective

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
is going to be extremely effective

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.690 
is going to be extremely effective
against<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.410> d<00:02:41.710> because<00:02:42.070> we're<00:02:42.280> faking<00:02:42.610> a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
against the d because we're faking a

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.910 
against the d because we're faking a
pass<00:02:42.940> at<00:02:43.210> first<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.930> all<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.440> defenders

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
pass at first so all of the defenders

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.560 
pass at first so all of the defenders
and<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.340> linemen<00:02:45.700> are<00:02:45.790> going<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.000> run<00:02:46.390> away

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
and the linemen are going to run away

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.540

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
quarterback to do this you can do it

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.030 
quarterback to do this you can do it
with<00:03:07.270> any<00:03:07.420> quarterback<00:03:07.780> but<00:03:08.320> make<00:03:08.560> sure<00:03:08.590> when

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
with any quarterback but make sure when

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.590 
with any quarterback but make sure when
you<00:03:09.100> take<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.340> angle<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.910> run<00:03:10.090> by<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.300> spy

spy<00:04:46.440> but<00:04:46.800> then<00:04:47.040> all<00:04:47.550> we<00:04:47.790> want<00:04:47.940> to<00:04:48.000> do<00:04:48.120> is<00:04:48.240> move

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
spy but then all we want to do is move

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.120 
spy but then all we want to do is move
our<00:04:48.570> quarterback<00:04:49.020> to<00:04:49.229> one<00:04:49.440> direction<00:04:49.590> since

the<00:04:50.280> spy<00:04:50.520> mirrors<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.060> quarterback<00:04:51.570> and

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
the spy mirrors the quarterback and

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.360 
the spy mirrors the quarterback and
that's<00:04:52.200> going<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.410> give<00:04:52.590> us<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.830> throwing<00:04:53.190> Lane
