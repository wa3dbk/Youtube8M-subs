 medium we are going to place three at each 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.220
 side of the big ones and then come the

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:28.179

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.179

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.350
 we take the big acrylic the one that is 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.960

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.410
