00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
and we've got a smaller bud sprouting

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.270 
and we've got a smaller bud sprouting
here<00:00:51.580> and<00:00:51.790> this<00:00:51.909> is<00:00:52.119> from<00:00:53.049> bottom<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.559> top<00:00:53.739> here

so you need to make sure when you do
cuttings<00:00:56.769> you<00:00:56.920> need<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.189> make<00:00:57.339> sure<00:00:57.369> that<00:00:57.670> it's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
cuttings you need to make sure that it's

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.119 
cuttings you need to make sure that it's
the<00:00:57.909> bottom<00:00:58.299> of<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.540> cutting<00:00:58.900> that<00:00:59.650> you<00:00:59.830> put

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
the bottom of the cutting that you put

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.219 
the bottom of the cutting that you put
into<00:01:00.549> the<00:01:01.210> soil<00:01:01.449> because<00:01:01.780> that's<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.080> way

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
into the soil because that's the way

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.929 
into the soil because that's the way
that<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.769> moisture<00:01:02.949> is<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.430> nutrients<00:01:03.879> is

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
that the moisture is and nutrients is

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.690 
that the moisture is and nutrients is
going<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.239> travel<00:01:04.449> up<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:04.809> stem<00:01:05.250> okay<00:01:06.250> now

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
going to travel up the stem okay now

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.030 
going to travel up the stem okay now
what<00:01:07.150> I<00:01:07.180> want<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.479> do<00:01:07.659> is<00:01:07.990> I<00:01:08.380> want<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.710> put<00:01:08.920> it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
what I want to do is I want to put it

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.849 
what I want to do is I want to put it
into<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.430> dirt<00:01:09.610> up<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.119> about<00:01:10.329> here<00:01:10.810> so<00:01:11.649> that

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859 
into the dirt up to about here so that

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:14.490 
into the dirt up to about here so that
this<00:01:12.009> sprout<00:01:12.549> is<00:01:12.820> under<00:01:13.600> underneath<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.320> soil

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
this sprout is under underneath the soil

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.800 
this sprout is under underneath the soil
because<00:01:14.859> that's<00:01:15.070> where<00:01:15.340> I'm<00:01:15.579> imagining<00:01:15.909> roots

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
because that's where I'm imagining roots

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.289 
because that's where I'm imagining roots
are<00:01:17.020> going<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.350> sprout<00:01:17.649> from<00:01:17.920> okay<00:01:18.909> when<00:01:19.090> roots

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
are going to sprout from okay when roots

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.029 
are going to sprout from okay when roots
grow<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:19.869> this<00:01:20.259> one<00:01:20.469> will<00:01:20.560> obviously<00:01:20.740> be

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
grow and this one will obviously be

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.319 
grow and this one will obviously be
above<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.429> dirt<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:21.880> it'll<00:01:22.840> grow<00:01:22.990> now<00:01:23.619> I've

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
above the dirt and it'll grow now I've

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.489 
above the dirt and it'll grow now I've
only<00:01:25.329> just<00:01:25.479> cut<00:01:25.869> this<00:01:26.020> it's<00:01:26.229> a<00:01:26.289> little<00:01:26.350> bit

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
only just cut this it's a little bit

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:29.190 
only just cut this it's a little bit
bruised<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:28.299> I've<00:01:28.390> only<00:01:28.539> just<00:01:28.630> cut<00:01:28.929> this<00:01:29.020> so

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
bruised but I've only just cut this so

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.319 
bruised but I've only just cut this so
it's<00:01:29.350> fresh<00:01:29.579> what<00:01:30.579> I'm<00:01:30.670> going<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.939> do<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.210> I'm

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
it's fresh what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:32.639 
it's fresh what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:31.359> to<00:01:31.630> dip<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.020> some<00:01:32.170> honey<00:01:32.380> now<00:01:32.499> this

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
going to dip it in some honey now this

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.520 
going to dip it in some honey now this
is<00:01:32.770> just<00:01:32.920> normal<00:01:33.070> honey<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.630> can<00:01:34.780> get<00:01:34.990> like

is just normal honey if you can get like
fresh<00:01:35.950> like<00:01:36.340> local<00:01:36.759> honey<00:01:36.939> that<00:01:37.179> hasn't<00:01:37.359> gone

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
fresh like local honey that hasn't gone

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.770 
fresh like local honey that hasn't gone
through<00:01:37.929> the<00:01:38.079> whole<00:01:39.060> commercial<00:01:40.060> process<00:01:40.569> net

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
through the whole commercial process net

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.149 
through the whole commercial process net
that's<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.049> bit<00:01:41.170> better<00:01:41.380> because<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:41.890> not<00:01:41.950> as

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
that's a bit better because it's not as

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.370 
that's a bit better because it's not as
process<00:01:42.759> not<00:01:42.999> as<00:01:43.119> cleaned<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.869> filtered<00:01:44.140> and

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
process not as cleaned and filtered and

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.149 
process not as cleaned and filtered and
all<00:01:44.439> that<00:01:44.530> sort<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:44.740> stuff

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
all that sort of stuff

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.599 
all that sort of stuff
but<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.090> will<00:01:46.240> do<00:01:46.390> for<00:01:46.630> today<00:01:46.719> so<00:01:47.460> let's<00:01:48.460> get

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
things to get too humid in here so it's

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.630 
things to get too humid in here so it's
just<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.560> hole<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> bit<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.280> excess<00:03:10.610> moisture

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
just a hole so a bit of excess moisture

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.630 
just a hole so a bit of excess moisture
can<00:03:11.269> escape<00:03:11.769> from<00:03:12.769> here<00:03:12.980> because<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.400> mean

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
can escape from here because it mean

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.979 
can escape from here because it mean
it's<00:03:13.880> going<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.090> trap<00:03:14.299> in<00:03:14.420> someone's<00:03:14.750> going<00:03:14.959> to

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
it's going to trap in someone's going to

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.170 
it's going to trap in someone's going to
give<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.200> some<00:03:15.320> extra<00:03:15.440> warmth<00:03:15.890> err<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.760> develop

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180

but<00:03:17.840> I'm<00:03:17.989> not<00:03:18.170> trapping<00:03:18.440> too<00:03:18.680> much<00:03:18.860> moisture

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
but I'm not trapping too much moisture

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.400 
but I'm not trapping too much moisture
and<00:03:19.400> encourage<00:03:19.790> fungus<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.989> we're<00:03:21.200> just<00:03:21.230> going

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.180 
and encourage fungus so we're just going
to<00:03:21.470> put<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.829> over<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.790> top<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.450> cutting

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
to put that over the top of the cutting

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.890
