is really really nice if you're reading
through<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.210> script<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:49.720> if<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:49.960> have<00:04:50.080> a

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
through a script and if you have a

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.080 
through a script and if you have a
really<00:04:50.320> long<00:04:50.500> script<00:04:50.950> you<00:04:51.340> can<00:04:51.460> see<00:04:51.700> this<00:04:51.850> so

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
really long script you can see this so

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.390 
really long script you can see this so
let<00:04:52.210> me<00:04:52.270> look<00:04:52.480> let's<00:04:52.750> show<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.310> little<00:04:54.310> bit

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
let me look let's show you a little bit

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.490 
let me look let's show you a little bit
more<00:04:54.580> complicated<00:04:55.300> script<00:04:55.870> and<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:56.110> was<00:04:56.350> a

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
more complicated script and this was a

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.469 
more complicated script and this was a
studio<00:04:56.950> lighting<00:04:57.130> DVD<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.790> I'm<00:04:58.000> working<00:04:58.210> on

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
studio lighting DVD that I'm working on

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.530 
studio lighting DVD that I'm working on
so<00:04:59.139> this<00:04:59.590> has<00:04:59.800> many<00:05:00.310> many<00:05:00.669> scenes<00:05:01.090> in<00:05:01.330> fact

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
so this has many many scenes in fact

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.290 
so this has many many scenes in fact
it's<00:05:01.750> got<00:05:01.930> right<00:05:02.139> now<00:05:02.260> 42<00:05:02.650> scenes<00:05:03.300> it'll

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
it's got right now 42 scenes it'll

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.520 
it's got right now 42 scenes it'll
probably<00:05:04.510> have<00:05:04.690> more<00:05:04.840> than<00:05:04.900> that<00:05:05.139> by<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.350> end

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
probably have more than that by the end

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.350 
probably have more than that by the end

location and I need to know well what is

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.520 
location and I need to know well what is
scene<00:05:09.729> 9<00:05:09.970> what<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.479> all<00:05:10.600> about<00:05:10.630> I<00:05:11.229> can

about how does that roll into 10 okay
got<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:17.889> now<00:05:18.250> let's<00:05:18.340> go<00:05:18.610> back<00:05:18.790> to<00:05:18.820> 5<00:05:19.090> so<00:05:19.479> this<00:05:19.600> is

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
got it now let's go back to 5 so this is

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.930 
got it now let's go back to 5 so this is
really<00:05:19.960> nice<00:05:20.110> because<00:05:20.169> most<00:05:20.860> of<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.100> time<00:05:21.340> you

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
really nice because most of the time you

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.510 
really nice because most of the time you
don't<00:05:22.120> shoot<00:05:22.600> in<00:05:22.870> sequence<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:23.770> so<00:05:23.979> to<00:05:24.400> get

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
don't shoot in sequence and so to get

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.159 
don't shoot in sequence and so to get
some<00:05:24.729> context<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.389> see<00:05:25.570> what's<00:05:25.750> going<00:05:26.020> on

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
some context to see what's going on

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.200 
some context to see what's going on
that's<00:05:26.710> there<00:05:27.040> so<00:05:27.250> it's<00:05:27.370> really<00:05:27.430> really<00:05:27.760> nice

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
that's there so it's really really nice

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.570 
that's there so it's really really nice
now<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.110> other<00:05:29.350> thing<00:05:29.620> is<00:05:29.740> I<00:05:29.919> have<00:05:29.950> this<00:05:30.250> test

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
now the other thing is I have this test

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.060 
now the other thing is I have this test
script<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.120> so<00:05:31.539> if<00:05:31.840> I<00:05:31.960> have<00:05:32.169> this<00:05:32.470> here<00:05:32.530> what<00:05:33.039> I

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
script and so if I have this here what I

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.000 
script and so if I have this here what I
can<00:05:33.340> do<00:05:33.580> is<00:05:33.900> let<00:05:34.900> me<00:05:34.960> show<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.229> how<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:35.470> import

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
can do is let me show you how you import

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.430 
can do is let me show you how you import
that<00:05:36.220> into<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.850> Celtx<00:05:37.240> on<00:05:37.419> your<00:05:37.600> desktop<00:05:38.110> now

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
that into the Celtx on your desktop now

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.930 
that into the Celtx on your desktop now
it's<00:05:38.590> just<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:38.890> opposite<00:05:39.340> of<00:05:39.460> what<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.729> did

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
it's just the opposite of what you did

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.570 
it's just the opposite of what you did
when<00:05:40.120> you<00:05:40.150> exported<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:40.900> you<00:05:41.050> just<00:05:41.229> go<00:05:41.440> to

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
when you exported it you just go to

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.810 
when you exported it you just go to
script<00:05:42.580> import<00:05:43.479> from<00:05:43.930> iPad<00:05:44.560> or<00:05:44.800> iPhone<00:05:45.310> and<00:05:45.789> we

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
script import from iPad or iPhone and we

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.480 
script import from iPad or iPhone and we
can<00:05:46.419> see<00:05:46.660> that<00:05:46.690> this<00:05:47.500> script<00:05:47.860> looks<00:05:48.010> just<00:05:48.310> like

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
can see that this script looks just like

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.670 
can see that this script looks just like
it<00:05:48.550> did<00:05:48.760> on<00:05:48.789> the<00:05:48.940> iPad<00:05:49.390> and<00:05:49.600> now<00:05:49.660> I<00:05:50.020> can<00:05:50.289> do<00:05:50.470> all

updates<00:06:46.740> their<00:06:47.040> application<00:06:47.820> because<00:06:48.120> those

are<00:06:48.450> really<00:06:48.480> really<00:06:48.810> valuable<00:06:49.170> tools<00:06:49.710> that<00:06:49.980> we

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
are really really valuable tools that we

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.150 
are really really valuable tools that we
use<00:06:50.370> a<00:06:50.400> lot<00:06:50.850> also<00:06:51.720> the<00:06:51.960> production<00:06:52.500> catalog

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 
use a lot also the production catalog

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.740 
use a lot also the production catalog

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
and scheduling that isn't available

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.100 
and scheduling that isn't available
either<00:06:55.410> this<00:06:55.650> only<00:06:55.950> works<00:06:56.400> for<00:06:56.820> your<00:06:57.210> scripts

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
well based on that I still think this is

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.020 
well based on that I still think this is
a<00:07:01.620> really<00:07:01.920> really<00:07:02.070> valuable<00:07:02.700> tool<00:07:03.000> for
