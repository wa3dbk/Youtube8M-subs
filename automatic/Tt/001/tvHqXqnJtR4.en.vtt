00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
it's great on now I didn't think he was

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.370 
it's great on now I didn't think he was
a<00:03:51.850> great<00:03:52.090> he<00:03:52.299> was<00:03:52.330> great<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.660> facilitate<00:03:53.230> and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
a great he was great to facilitate and

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.930 
a great he was great to facilitate and
he's<00:03:53.530> gotten<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:53.890> lot<00:03:54.070> better<00:03:54.250> this<00:03:54.459> year<00:03:54.519> I

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
he's gotten a lot better this year I

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.030 
he's gotten a lot better this year I
always<00:03:55.330> thought<00:03:55.450> he's<00:03:55.810> like<00:03:55.959> 611<00:03:56.680> or<00:03:56.769> whatever

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
always thought he's like 611 or whatever

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
always thought he's like 611 or whatever
i<00:03:57.100> don't<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:57.430> he<00:03:57.549> should<00:03:57.700> be<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.820> better

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
i don't so he should be a better

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.210 
i don't so he should be a better
rebounder<00:03:58.269> so<00:03:59.019> he's<00:03:59.230> doing<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.799> year<00:03:59.860> i

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
rebounder so he's doing that this year i

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.060 
rebounder so he's doing that this year i
really<00:04:00.790> don't<00:04:00.940> have<00:04:01.090> any<00:04:01.860> gripes<00:04:02.860> about

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
Durant's game this year I think he's

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.930 
Durant's game this year I think he's
playing<00:04:05.799> out<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.070> his<00:04:06.190> mind<00:04:06.489> he's<00:04:06.730> playing

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
playing out of his mind he's playing

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.190 
playing out of his mind he's playing
outstanding<00:04:07.180> basketball<00:04:07.600> he's<00:04:07.989> playing

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
outstanding basketball he's playing

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.600 
outstanding basketball he's playing
better<00:04:08.410> than<00:04:08.440> anybody<00:04:08.709> in<00:04:08.890> the<00:04:09.010> league<00:04:09.040> now

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
better than anybody in the league now

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.729 
better than anybody in the league now
LeBron<00:04:10.180> still<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.660> best<00:04:10.870> player<00:04:11.110> has<00:04:11.350> down<00:04:11.560> on

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
LeBron still the best player has down on

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.729 
LeBron still the best player has down on
earth<00:04:11.950> in<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.519> universe<00:04:12.880> right<00:04:13.090> now<00:04:13.150> but<00:04:13.739> as

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
earth in the universe right now but as

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.909 
earth in the universe right now but as
far<00:04:15.220> as<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:15.579> season<00:04:16.090> goes<00:04:16.350> um<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.440> think

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
far as this season goes um I think

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.969 
far as this season goes um I think
Durant<00:04:18.489> has<00:04:19.140> taken<00:04:20.140> a<00:04:20.200> stronghold<00:04:20.500> at<00:04:20.830> this

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
Durant has taken a stronghold at this

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.980 
Durant has taken a stronghold at this
season<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.430> don't<00:04:21.549> think<00:04:21.700> he<00:04:21.760> said<00:04:21.910> let<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.150> go

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
season I don't think he said let it go

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.300 
season I don't think he said let it go
that<00:04:23.470> he'd<00:04:23.620> haven't<00:04:23.889> been<00:04:23.979> looking<00:04:24.130> good

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
that he'd haven't been looking good

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.370 
that he'd haven't been looking good
approximate<00:04:24.910> looking<00:04:25.150> good<00:04:25.330> but<00:04:25.660> that<00:04:26.229> he

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
approximate looking good but that he

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.809 
approximate looking good but that he
hasn't<00:04:26.560> been<00:04:26.770> looking<00:04:27.039> good<00:04:27.069> they<00:04:27.430> are<00:04:27.550> saying

hasn't been looking good they are saying

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.909 
hasn't been looking good they are saying
that<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.120> was<00:04:28.240> about<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.750> consistency<00:04:29.530> of

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
that it was about the consistency of

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.770 
that it was about the consistency of
having<00:04:30.490> people<00:04:30.699> in<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:30.970> lineup<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.449> I've<00:04:31.539> line

of course I don't know if that's even
necessarily<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.099> case<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.460> think<00:04:36.490> they're

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
necessarily the case I think they're

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.490
