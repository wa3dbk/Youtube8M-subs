higher and people get people tend not to
get<00:01:14.760> Marines<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.299> much<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.840> reason<00:01:16.080> for

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
get Marines that much the reason for

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.020 
get Marines that much the reason for
that<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:16.500> most<00:01:16.979> people<00:01:17.280> try<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that is because most people try not to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.550 
that is because most people try not to
do<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> marine<00:01:18.420> rush<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.930> I'm<00:01:19.110> doing<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
do a marine rush like I'm doing and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
do a marine rush like I'm doing and
usually<00:01:20.400> people<00:01:20.759> only<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.479> or<00:01:21.600> two

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
usually people only get one or two

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.380 
usually people only get one or two
Marines<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.680> they<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.790> they<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.939> Tector

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
Marines so they can so they can Tector

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.899 
Marines so they can so they can Tector
they're<00:01:24.570> fast<00:01:24.780> factory<00:01:25.650> quicker<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
they're fast factory quicker and that

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.810 
they're fast factory quicker and that
will<00:01:27.030> enable<00:01:27.270> them<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.829> get<00:01:28.829> their<00:01:29.159> tank<00:01:29.579> sell

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
will enable them to get their tank sell

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.370 
will enable them to get their tank sell
quicker<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.360> expand<00:01:30.689> quicker<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
quicker and expand quicker and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.310 
quicker and expand quicker and
everything<00:01:31.920> quicker<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.720> such<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
everything quicker but if you do such a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.929 
everything quicker but if you do such a
marine<00:01:35.009> push<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.400> I'm<00:01:35.549> doing<00:01:35.759> right<00:01:35.820> here

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
all right this is going to be pretty gay

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.490 
all right this is going to be pretty gay
but<00:01:40.500> whatever<00:01:40.710> um<00:01:41.540> yeah<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.570> he<00:01:42.930> started<00:01:43.320> this

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
but whatever um yeah so he started this

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.880 
but whatever um yeah so he started this
I<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:44.070> no<00:01:44.100> freakin<00:01:44.880> idea<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.450> cuz<00:01:46.259> think

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
I have no freakin idea how cuz think

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.859 
I have no freakin idea how cuz think
about<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.250> his<00:01:47.399> SUV<00:01:47.729> could<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.090> possibly<00:01:48.299> go

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
about it his SUV could not possibly go

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.690 
about it his SUV could not possibly go
there<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.860> might<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.159> came<00:01:50.460> from

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
there I think it might have came from

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
there I think it might have came from
like<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> left<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.509> right<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.590> poor<00:01:52.890> he

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
like the left or the right the poor he

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.910 
like the left or the right the poor he
might've<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.549> came<00:01:53.790> directly<00:01:54.270> from<00:01:54.360> up<00:01:55.229> from

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
might've just came directly from up from

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.560 
might've just came directly from up from
12<00:01:56.159> o<00:01:56.219> clock<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.549> six<00:01:56.700> o'clock<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.540> really

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
12 o clock to six o'clock but I really

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.109 
12 o clock to six o'clock but I really
really<00:01:58.259> highly<00:01:58.560> doubt<00:01:58.770> he<00:01:58.920> did<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.280> but<00:02:00.060> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
really highly doubt he did that but I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.219 
really highly doubt he did that but I
don't<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.390> how<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> hell<00:02:00.719> he's<00:02:00.810> guarded<00:02:01.140> me

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
don't know how the hell he's guarded me

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.870 
don't know how the hell he's guarded me
like<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.560> but<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.250> doesn't<00:02:02.579> even<00:02:02.640> matter

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
like this but it doesn't even matter

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.700 
like this but it doesn't even matter
because<00:02:03.060> well<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> guess<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.960> matters<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
because well I guess it matters it's a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.039 
because well I guess it matters it's a
huge<00:02:05.189> deal<00:02:05.520> now<00:02:05.759> because<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.750> he's

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
huge deal now because now that he's

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.330 
huge deal now because now that he's
guarded<00:02:07.380> me<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.649> going<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.829> basically<00:02:08.099> have

guarded me I'm going to basically have

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.699 
guarded me I'm going to basically have
to<00:02:08.580> okay<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.450> he's<00:02:09.629> bringing<00:02:09.840> SUVs<00:02:10.200> out<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.500> kill

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
kill my marine with just three SUVs and

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.760 
kill my marine with just three SUVs and
I<00:02:49.120> have<00:02:49.300> like<00:02:49.510> more<00:02:49.690> Marines<00:02:50.020> coming<00:02:50.320> in<00:02:50.560> and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
I have like more Marines coming in and

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.380 
I have like more Marines coming in and
now<00:02:50.950> i'm<00:02:51.130> just<00:02:51.310> gonna<00:02:51.430> scout<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:51.850> because<00:02:52.150> i

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
now i'm just gonna scout in because i

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.760 
now i'm just gonna scout in because i
really<00:02:52.630> need<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.870> find<00:02:52.989> out<00:02:53.140> where<00:02:53.260> his<00:02:53.320> bases

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
really need to find out where his bases

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.650 
really need to find out where his bases
so<00:02:54.580> i<00:02:54.610> can<00:02:54.820> start<00:02:54.940> putting<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.330> pressure<00:02:55.480> on

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
so i can start putting the pressure on

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.020 
so i can start putting the pressure on
usually<00:02:56.470> i<00:02:56.500> would<00:02:56.620> wait<00:02:56.890> for<00:02:57.130> like<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.459> base<00:02:57.820> or

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
usually i would wait for like a base or

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.150 
usually i would wait for like a base or
two<00:02:58.180> sorry<00:02:58.810> i<00:02:58.989> would<00:02:59.140> wait<00:02:59.290> for<00:02:59.500> like<00:02:59.680> 10<00:03:00.010> or<00:03:00.130> 12

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
two sorry i would wait for like 10 or 12

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.310 
two sorry i would wait for like 10 or 12
