or anything like that and then as legs

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.020 
or anything like that and then as legs
can<00:03:36.320> really<00:03:36.680> only<00:03:36.860> kind<00:03:37.160> of<00:03:37.280> move<00:03:37.459> forwards

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
can really only kind of move forwards

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.300 
can really only kind of move forwards
and<00:03:38.209> backwards<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.900> little<00:03:38.930> bit<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:40.010> looks<00:03:40.040> like

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
and backwards a little bit it looks like

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.560 
and backwards a little bit it looks like
they're<00:03:40.459> on<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.579> same<00:03:40.850> type<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.090> hinge<00:03:41.329> joint

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
they're on the same type of hinge joint

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.910 
they're on the same type of hinge joint
so<00:03:41.660> we've<00:03:41.780> seen<00:03:41.930> with<00:03:42.049> the<00:03:42.140> other<00:03:42.260> figures<00:03:42.590> but

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
so we've seen with the other figures but

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.979 
so we've seen with the other figures but
the<00:03:43.489> robe<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:43.970> rigid<00:03:44.390> enough<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:44.870> it

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
the robe is rigid enough that it

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.630 
the robe is rigid enough that it
drastically<00:03:45.829> hinders<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.220> movement<00:03:46.519> of<00:03:46.579> the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
drastically hinders the movement of the

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.979 
drastically hinders the movement of the
legs<00:03:46.670> so<00:03:47.390> you're<00:03:47.480> really<00:03:47.630> not<00:03:47.690> going<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.900> get

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
legs so you're really not going to get

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.539 
legs so you're really not going to get
any<00:03:48.140> extra<00:03:48.350> poses<00:03:48.799> out<00:03:48.920> of<00:03:49.040> them<00:03:49.130> he's<00:03:49.280> pretty

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
any extra poses out of them he's pretty

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.580 
any extra poses out of them he's pretty
much<00:03:49.730> only<00:03:50.000> going<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.450> stand<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:50.989> one

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
much only going to stand in that one

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.250 
much only going to stand in that one
position<00:03:55.150> now<00:03:56.150> splinter<00:03:56.510> stands<00:03:56.840> right

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
position now splinter stands right

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.810

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.180 
around four and a half inches tall
making<00:03:59.180> him<00:03:59.630> the<00:04:00.110> shortest<00:04:00.739> of<00:04:00.859> all<00:04:00.980> the

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
lineup so you can see the turtles are

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.069 
lineup so you can see the turtles are
all<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.700> little<00:04:04.910> bit<00:04:05.120> taller<00:04:05.299> than<00:04:05.570> em<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.989> of

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
all a little bit taller than em and of

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.660 
all a little bit taller than em and of
course<00:04:06.320> April<00:04:06.530> stands<00:04:06.950> quite<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.250> bit<00:04:07.459> taller

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
course April stands quite a bit taller

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.120

than<00:04:07.820> him<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.239> shredder<00:04:08.900> towers<00:04:09.560> over<00:04:09.769> him

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
than him and shredder towers over him

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.979 
than him and shredder towers over him
but<00:04:10.579> I<00:04:10.609> really<00:04:10.880> like<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.180> size<00:04:11.480> I<00:04:11.690> think<00:04:11.900> it

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
but I really like that size I think it

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.199 
but I really like that size I think it
plays<00:04:12.109> in<00:04:12.440> very<00:04:12.859> well<00:04:13.190> with<00:04:13.430> this<00:04:13.579> particular

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
plays in very well with this particular

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.029 
plays in very well with this particular
character<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.870> just<00:04:14.930> because<00:04:15.650> he's<00:04:15.799> small

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
character and just because he's small

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.890 
character and just because he's small
doesn't<00:04:16.549> mean<00:04:16.700> he<00:04:16.940> can't<00:04:17.180> kick<00:04:17.419> all<00:04:17.600> of<00:04:17.750> their

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
doesn't mean he can't kick all of their

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.170 
doesn't mean he can't kick all of their
butts

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.820 

while<00:04:22.180> most<00:04:22.540> splinter<00:04:22.990> figures<00:04:23.320> typically

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
while most splinter figures typically

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.719 
while most splinter figures typically
come<00:04:24.040> with<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.190> cane

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729
