00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
lot of people get that confused with

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.000 
lot of people get that confused with
mobile<00:00:36.420> workers<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:37.649> talk<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.890> little

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
mobile workers so can we talk a little

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.560 
mobile workers so can we talk a little
bit<00:00:38.309> about<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.610> difference<00:00:38.879> between<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.360> two

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
bit about the difference between the two

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.080 
bit about the difference between the two
well<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.320> mobile<00:00:40.649> worker<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.160> always<00:00:41.670> mobile

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
well a mobile worker is always mobile

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.420 
well a mobile worker is always mobile
and<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.540> typically<00:00:43.290> means<00:00:43.590> they're<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and that typically means they're on the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.040 
and that typically means they're on the
go<00:00:44.579> they're<00:00:44.879> not<00:00:44.910> even<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.660> home<00:00:45.840> office

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
go they're not even in a home office

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.380 
go they're not even in a home office
like<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.590> looks<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.149> could<00:00:48.329> be

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
like it looks like you are it could be

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.479 
like it looks like you are it could be
an<00:00:48.570> inspector<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.620> could<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> social

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
an inspector it could be a social

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.490 
an inspector it could be a social
service<00:00:50.879> worker<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.539> could<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> policeman

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
service worker it could be a policeman

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.310 
service worker it could be a policeman
it<00:00:53.250> could<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.610> any<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.660> many<00:00:54.840> employees

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it could be any of the many employees

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.529 
it could be any of the many employees
that<00:00:55.530> serve<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.370> us

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
that serve all of us

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.869 
that serve all of us
so<00:00:57.660> traditionally<00:00:58.379> mobile<00:00:58.980> workers<00:00:59.430> have

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
so traditionally mobile workers have

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
so traditionally mobile workers have
been<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.660> field<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.379> they're

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
been out in the field and they're

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680 
been out in the field and they're
filling<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.609> paper<00:01:02.850> forms<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.480> same

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
filling out the paper forms the same

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.299 
filling out the paper forms the same
paper<00:01:03.899> forms<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.409> they<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> submit

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
paper forms that they have to submit

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.039 
paper forms that they have to submit
when<00:01:05.519> they<00:01:05.640> go<00:01:05.790> back<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.450> office<00:01:06.840> so

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
when they go back to the office so

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.130 
when they go back to the office so
what's<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.590> value<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.220> having<00:01:08.570> an<00:01:09.570> app<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
what's the value in having an app on a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020 
what's the value in having an app on a
mobile<00:01:10.409> device<00:01:10.560> where<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.369> can<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.580> do

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
mobile device where they can just do

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
mobile device where they can just do
that<00:01:12.240> work<00:01:12.420> from<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> field<00:01:13.170> having<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.920> phone

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that work from the field having a phone

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.890 
that work from the field having a phone
with<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.790> helps<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.420> ensure<00:01:15.780> that

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
with you really helps to one ensure that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.570 
with you really helps to one ensure that
we<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> hold<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:16.799> safety<00:01:17.430> so

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
we can get a hold of you for safety so

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
we can get a hold of you for safety so
I'd<00:01:17.700> say<00:01:17.820> safety<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.479> number<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:18.780> there's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
I'd say safety is the number one there's

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.230 
I'd say safety is the number one there's
also<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.680> lot<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.950> benefits<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.759> reducing

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
also a lot of benefits just to reducing

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.740 
also a lot of benefits just to reducing
the<00:01:21.500> time<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.670> eliminating<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> lot<00:01:24.600> of

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the time and just eliminating a lot of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.480 
the time and just eliminating a lot of
the<00:01:24.900> errors<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.409> happen<00:01:25.799> when<00:01:26.400> you're

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the errors that happen when you're

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
the errors that happen when you're
pushing<00:01:26.790> around<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.030> lot<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.240> paper<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.780> are

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
pushing around a lot of paper what are

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
pushing around a lot of paper what are
some<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> best<00:01:28.829> practices<00:01:29.520> some<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
some of the best practices some of the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.749 
some of the best practices some of the
advice<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.200> give<00:01:31.259> agencies<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.340> want<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
advice we can give agencies that want to

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.359 
advice we can give agencies that want to
have<00:01:32.939> mobile<00:01:33.570> workers<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> field<00:01:34.710> when<00:01:35.189> we

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
have mobile workers in the field when we

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.520 
have mobile workers in the field when we
think<00:01:35.549> about<00:01:35.700> best<00:01:36.090> practices<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:37.140> really

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
think about best practices we really

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.210 
think about best practices we really
encourage<00:01:37.680> organizations<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.570> about

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
encourage organizations to think about

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.030 
encourage organizations to think about
extending<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:42.540> value<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.229> each<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.860> their

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
extending the value that each of their

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.440 
extending the value that each of their
employees<00:01:44.460> are<00:01:44.610> doing<00:01:44.729> every<00:01:45.060> day<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
employees are doing every day in the
