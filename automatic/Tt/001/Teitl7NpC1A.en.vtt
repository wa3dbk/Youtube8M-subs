00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.609
 after planting a plant means moving a place 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.569
 can be for aesthetic reasons or for the health of the plant 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.500
 this task requires some care 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.750
 that the life of the plant take risks and it is necessary to take the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.759
 necessary precautions 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.759
 to prevent it from suffering irreparable damage 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.620
 As a first step it is necessary to avoid breaking the burial 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.680
 that is, the ball is earth that covers the roots 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.600
 so that the handling is easier was expected around the bush to 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600
 let loose the small

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.250
 guerrillas in it 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.220
 and if you take care with no hurry 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.320
 to prevent it from breaking 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.410
 the land which will be moved to the plant must be well prepared 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.010
 mixed with organic matter to give it the necessary nutrients 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.110
 as natural as possible avoiding using chemicals 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.080
 although you will not need much water in winter you should water it to maintain the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.170
 humidity
