 good 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.310
 to the extreme security that the country has 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.200
 american on its border and the 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.150
 dangerousness of the brave river are the 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.950
 major discouraging so that 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.779
 hundreds of Central Americans who come to 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.730
 new laredo tamaulipas exist from 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.250
 want to cross and decide to return to their 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.110
 home the recovery of the 31 bodies 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.970
 of the bravo river of which it is presumed 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.860
 who are migrants since they did not carry 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.900
 any identification is one of the 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.360
 things that puts to think to the aspirings 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.070
 to the American dream is something of fear was 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.920
 because one would like 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.960
 come back sometimes you do not have to take many 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.500
 risks and one sees that it is very complicated 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.140
 improvement and no more arriving and retaking also 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.020
 that then we can not touch it much 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.910
 is going to throw it has been admirable and is that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.769
 for these migrants to return to their 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.989
 homes with your family is worth more than 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.580
 risk a crossing so difficult to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.740
 try to help them 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.350
 better than losing everything because 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.659
 one comes out with the decision to want to take 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.310
 forward to your family and instead of 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.490
 pull it out rather it's going to sink 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.490
 do not 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.330
 but the desist to go after the dream 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.860
 American for these migrants is the 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.300
 better option since it gives them the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.720
 opportunity to see their children again 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.210
 families the most convenient because 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.910
 a healthy one returns to his country he will see 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.030
 your children your mom and your whole family 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.030
 here 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.619
 who left one 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.720
 and it does not take any risk to die lawyer 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.270
 no no it's the last attempt I make and if 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.860
 I do not do it anymore it does not go on fringe anymore 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.280
 and I'm left in depth with the environment 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.140
 also in recent years thousands of 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.030
 migrants risk crossing each year 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.980
 the American union illegally without 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.810
 However hundreds of them lose their lives 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.090
 in the waters of the wild river of all the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.670

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.390
