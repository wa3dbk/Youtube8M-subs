another part to also take into

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.949 
another part to also take into
consideration<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:42.030> when<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.420> bulb<00:03:42.660> goes

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
consideration is that when the bulb goes

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.839 
consideration is that when the bulb goes
out<00:03:43.170> sometimes<00:03:43.889> it'll<00:03:44.190> burn

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
out sometimes it'll burn

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.179 
out sometimes it'll burn
sometimes<00:03:45.599> it'll<00:03:45.780> explode<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:46.650> this

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:47.189 
sometimes it'll explode and this

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.699 
sometimes it'll explode and this
situation<00:03:47.629> you'll<00:03:48.629> notice<00:03:49.079> that<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.439> bulb

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
situation you'll notice that the bulb

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.479 
situation you'll notice that the bulb
actually<00:03:50.450> busted<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:52.379> can<00:03:52.560> hear<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.189> shards

actually busted you can hear the shards

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.830 
actually busted you can hear the shards
of<00:03:53.579> glass<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:53.969> you<00:03:54.030> can<00:03:54.060> see<00:03:54.359> the<00:03:54.480> shards<00:03:54.749> of

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.760 
as well you want to make sure that when
you<00:04:24.240> put<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.539> new<00:04:24.660> bulb<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:25.110> not<00:04:25.560> to

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
you put the new bulb in not to

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.680 
you put the new bulb in not to
prematurely<00:04:26.370> judge<00:04:26.789> that<00:04:27.060> it's<00:04:27.270> defective

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
prematurely judge that it's defective

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.159 
prematurely judge that it's defective
all<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.349> our<00:04:28.500> bulbs<00:04:28.860> come<00:04:29.130> pre<00:04:29.610> tested<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.330> so

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
all of our bulbs come pre tested and so

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.659 
all of our bulbs come pre tested and so
if<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.560> doesn't<00:04:31.860> work<00:04:32.039> when<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.280> put<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.550> new

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
if it doesn't work when you put the new

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.430 
if it doesn't work when you put the new
bulb<00:04:32.910> in<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.330> may<00:04:33.630> mean<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:33.960> there<00:04:34.349> is

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
bulb in it may mean that there is

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.969 
bulb in it may mean that there is
another<00:04:34.740> issue<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.639> needs<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.180> be<00:04:36.210> addressed

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
another issue that needs to be addressed

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.219 
another issue that needs to be addressed
we're<00:04:38.370> unwrapping<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.539> installing<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.199> new

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
we're unwrapping and installing the new

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.920 
we're unwrapping and installing the new
bulb<00:04:40.680> now<00:04:43.940> you<00:04:44.940> want<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.240> make<00:04:45.389> sure<00:04:45.419> you<00:04:45.660> line

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
bulb now you want to make sure you line

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.200 
bulb now you want to make sure you line
it<00:04:46.080> up<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.410> same<00:04:46.680> way<00:04:46.919> as<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.280> original<00:04:47.759> you

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
it up the same way as the original you

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.670 
it up the same way as the original you
also<00:04:48.419> want<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.780> keep<00:04:48.930> track<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.229> where<00:04:49.530> the

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
also want to keep track of where the

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.850 
also want to keep track of where the
wires<00:04:49.889> are<00:04:50.190> because<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.479> want<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.810> wires<00:04:51.990> you

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
wires are because you want the wires you

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.409 
wires are because you want the wires you
don't<00:04:53.009> want<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.220> wires<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.550> be<00:04:53.669> too<00:04:53.909> short<00:04:54.270> if

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
don't want the wires to be too short if

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.600 
don't want the wires to be too short if
you<00:04:54.630> angle<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.080> bulb<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:55.470> wrong<00:04:55.680> way<00:04:55.949> you

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
you angle the bulb the wrong way you

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.070 
you angle the bulb the wrong way you
want<00:04:56.789> to<00:04:56.880> make<00:04:56.970> sure<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.360> those<00:04:57.570> wires<00:04:57.870> are

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
want to make sure that those wires are

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.180 
want to make sure that those wires are
actually<00:04:58.349> going<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.530> get<00:04:58.710> to<00:04:58.889> where<00:04:59.009> they<00:04:59.159> need

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
actually going to get to where they need

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.300 
actually going to get to where they need
to<00:04:59.370> be<00:04:59.550> screwed<00:04:59.849> in<00:05:00.050> as<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.259> can<00:05:01.409> tell<00:05:01.590> we<00:05:01.919> we

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
to be screwed in as you can tell we we

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.879 
to be screwed in as you can tell we we
probably<00:05:02.699> need<00:05:02.970> to<00:05:03.000> reposition<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:03.840> bulb<00:05:04.080> so

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
probably need to reposition the bulb so

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.230 
probably need to reposition the bulb so
that<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:05.070> wires<00:05:05.190> are<00:05:05.520> actually<00:05:05.880> on<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.000> back

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
that the wires are actually on the back

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.570 
that the wires are actually on the back
side
