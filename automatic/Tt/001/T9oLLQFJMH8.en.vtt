00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.940
 Here we have the ingredients for this 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.590
 The main thing is the mojicones as well 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.450
 we say here in Colombia but I do not know 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.680
 how they will tell you in your countries or in your 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.690
 cities 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.289
 elsa this bread so redondito that has 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.400
 sugar up and has as filling 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.560
 we also need milk sugar 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.810
 we need raisins this is optional 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.230
 but definitely buy the remains 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.840
 very rich like that and butter too 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.909
 we need 3 eggs what are we going to 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.969
 to do is to soak the musicians in 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:43.249
 milk first we put 6 we lay down 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.850
 milk over and now let's put the 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:49.399
 rest and we bathe them with we are also going to 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.749
 add the raisins and we're going to 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:56.929
 put inside to hydrate 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:59.449
 then they should touch the milk should 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.720
 stay under the bottom 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.510
 where 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.630
 get stuck to the bottom of the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.630
 vessel 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.350
 So what we are going to do there is that 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.509
 raisins will be hydrated and for 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.110
 so much more with what we are doing 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:20.070
 it's like listening to the bread opening and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.369
 listening to him to get hydrated very very 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.409
 well and as you can see these are already going 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.600
 softening the idea is to soften 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.549
 completely the bread then since 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.490
 are all the soft mojicones 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.009
 We are pouring the sugar sugar 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.800
 more or less like us we take 5 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.100
 spoonfuls you have to see that 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.289
 tango that they love so sweet and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.780
 they stir again the three eggs 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.640
 we're going to give them back half an hour 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.050
 eggs then we are going to throw them in 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.690
 our mix 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.320
 if I know it does not look good it does not look very 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.170
 rich but seriously it is delicious and 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.000
 you keep stirring everything 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.880
 ingredients we hooked this let's 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.940
 turn on the oven to go 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.700
 preheat and we have butter already 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.130
 melted and let's put it slowly 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.130
 in our mix and we go back and stir 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.590
 enhancers to grease the mold where 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.260
 go make the cake you put a lot 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.480
 butter everywhere so you do not 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.780
 I'm going to hit you with a little bit of tutor and 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.800
 now to your mass to the refractory 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.540
 It does not look nice but it tastes delicious in 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.719
 serious 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.150
 you put everything there and take it to the oven 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:41.750
 which, as I said, is preheated to 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:46.280
 180 and now you have to leave some space 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:49.609
 between the cake and the dough that we have there 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.489
 and the refractory edge a good 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:54.590
 space as you see here because the cake goes 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.079
 to grow and if you leave it very 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.939
 edge overflows then they have to 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.139
 be careful now in such a stick with 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.139
 Reims cake 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.950
 and now if it resolves one hour then 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.530
 so we have our delicious cake 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.050
 let's disassemble is I want the 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.300
 see well 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.180
 and now I'm going to make a cut so that 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.150
 see how it looks inside and know 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.420
 when you do do yours if 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.890
 they are as rich as ours 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.260
 delight rather well of the desire that 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.850
 I have to eat a bit like that 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.180
 inside 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.820
 good so I hope they prepare it and 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.500
 Enjoy your bread cake very much 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.500
