00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.929
 it is said that Syrian was the most important star in the ancient world 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:22.759
 It was considered the brightest star in the sky and brightest 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:23.989
 that the sun 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.759
 the great pyramid was built in synchronization with candle in such a way 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.479
 that the light of the star shines in the queen's room 

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.510
 supposedly to use the light in an initiation ritual 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.980
 if it is considered as the canine star 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.580
 and the most malignant of the ancient Egyptian pantheon 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.220
 the reason is because the services were sold from the Nile River 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.820
 and during the period when Syrian was rising between the months of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.390
 July and August 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.350
 it was the time of drought 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.800
 It was the time when the ice was weak to be used for the irrigation of 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.190
 sow then the benefits thought it was a time of strong light 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.160
 drought and command 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.590
 so it is strange that candle is related to the foundation of 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.950
 U.S 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.290
 according to the masonic author of january ovation 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.180
 the declaration of independence was signed 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.550
 when the sun was in alignment with candle in July 1776 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.270
 but if it is appropriate to mention the relationship decided with the building and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.720
 with and Egyptian beds from the capital city the monument to washington 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.100
 obasohan wrote in 1848 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.560
 that when the cornerstone of the monument to Washington was placed on 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.130
 sun would have passed over Syrian 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.189
 and goes on to say that during the placement ceremony 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.130
 the Syrian star could be seen on the horizon 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.130
 rising over the capitol building 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.560
 to the east of the monument 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.949
 this monument was originally designed by the mason architect 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:13.749
 robert m 2 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.820
 media was trained by two masons we have already jovanna 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.259
 who designed the white house and see call macho who designed the capitol 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:27.759
 the original design of groupers contained all the components of the pantheon of 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.469
 Mysteries we pay 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.469
 an Egyptian-style obelisk surrounded by Roman pillars and statues 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.029
 Greco-Roman 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.040
 according to the original plan 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.120
 the monument was to be built directly south of the white house 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.189
 but as with many plans things changed 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.879
 when they went to build it 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.259
 and they calculated the weight of the monument 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.599
 they determined that the place where they were going to build it 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:04.950
 I would not bear the weight of the monument as a result 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.600
 the monument was slightly diverted towards the east and although it is not in 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.079
 perfect alignment with the white house 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.439
 finished in perfect alignment in a north-south direction with the house of the 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.120
 temple 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.010
 which is another building or that was built a few years later 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.359
 the construction of the monument to washington began on July 4, 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:31.109
 1848 with the placement of the cornerstone of the monument by the president 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.769
 Mason already in his time efe 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.590
 the project would take more than 48 years to be completed 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.269
 and during that time the money was very limited the civil war took place and 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.469
 many ideas about the monument were developed 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.439
 when the top part of the monument which is in fact aluminum was 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.269
 finally placed on December 6, 1884 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.409
 the result was a more simple and more Egyptian-style figure than what 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.220
 I had planned at the beginning 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.099
 the design change was the influence of younes 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.499
 but who left 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:12.799
 the man considered the father of the modern environmental movement in 1876 but 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.429
 he was the American minister for italy 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:16.950
 while I was there 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.880
 he devoted many years to the study of obelisks that had been brought 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.439
 from egypt 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:25.239
 it was he who realized that the height of an Egyptian obelisk 

00:04:25.239 --> 00:04:26.509
 traditional 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.710
 it was approximately 10 times greater than the base 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.280
 and it was the cause of which the plane of the washington monument has been reduced 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.229
 from 600 feet to 555 feet 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.840
 referring to the pillars and statues planned by media mars wrote 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.790
 get rid of all the unnecessary frills of media design 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.159
 and they built only the obelisk 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:55.309
 while a true obelisk is made of a single type of stone the 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:59.580
 monument to washington is built of many types of stone the intention 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.409
 of the society that built the monument because the structure could 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.729
 represent the idea 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.729
 of many 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:13.999
 on the other hand 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.819
 The upper medium is made of 13 levels 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.960
 such as the pyramid of the great seal of the dollar bill 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.900
 but the mysteries abound in reference to the monument 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.259
 and one of them 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.409
 is the presence of a 12-foot obelisk 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.719
 built inside a hole 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.719
 located near the monument to washington 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:40.020
 It would seem to be a miniature replica of the monument 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.099
 but nobody knows why he is there 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.289
 and such as the pyramid of the dollar bill 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.189
 the top of this little obelisk was absent 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.969
 the Masonic author unveiled asÃ³n 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.369
 he is convinced that the freemasons 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:06:00.619
 who signed the declaration of independence on July 4 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:05.219
 and those who laid the cornerstone of the monument to Washington on the same date 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.930
 they were familiar with the rising of the star walks Syrian 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.930
 since it is an important symbol of Freemasonry 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.800
 the interesting 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.120
 Freemasons that symbolism is very important to them 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.469
 there was no news of this draw is a beautiful place or because it looked 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:26.479
 all right 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.650
 Masons masters has put it to Diego that in that uprising his 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.479
 sweat 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.180
 that lifting of 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.180
 forget about the gains of your light 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.619
 as the Jeronimo doctor revealed himself before 

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:45.360
 for the Egyptians the true light that shines in the east was not our sun if 

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:50.389
 not the light of the star candina which some say represents a 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:55.379
 more sinister implication the star candina is also related to the 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:57.360
 ideas of magical ceremonies 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.869
 also a modern way 

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:05.059
 it was especially true for the mazon occultist of the 20th century to the east 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:10.339
 law lover who practiced magical ceremonies openly and was a member of 

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:15.459
 the secret society called the order of the silver star the star of 

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:18.339
 silver to which it was in reference to the Syrian star
