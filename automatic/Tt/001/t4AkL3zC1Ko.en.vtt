00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
rucksack anything like that all right so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.390 
rucksack anything like that all right so
it<00:01:05.630> doesn't<00:01:05.900> matter<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.590> size<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:07.159> the<00:01:07.250> acts

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
it doesn't matter the size of the acts

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.310 
it doesn't matter the size of the acts
that<00:01:07.549> you<00:01:07.700> use<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.950> axe<00:01:10.250> is<00:01:10.869> somewhere<00:01:11.869> I

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
that you use this axe is somewhere I

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.649 
that you use this axe is somewhere I
think<00:01:12.590> it's<00:01:12.710> about<00:01:12.799> 24<00:01:13.520> inch<00:01:13.670> acts<00:01:13.909> so

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
think it's about 24 inch acts so

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.920 
think it's about 24 inch acts so
basically<00:01:15.620> ask<00:01:16.130> andy<00:01:16.490> for<00:01:17.450> sacked<00:01:17.780> by<00:01:18.230> brooks

knife how you go around the sides to get
each<00:02:22.840> crown<00:02:23.200> because<00:02:23.560> every<00:02:23.860> time<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.070> cut

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
each crown because every time you cut

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.200 
each crown because every time you cut

you create a ridge I'm still you can see
still<00:02:31.720> going<00:02:31.990> down<00:02:32.020> them<00:02:34.590> still<00:02:35.590> creating

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
still going down them still creating
