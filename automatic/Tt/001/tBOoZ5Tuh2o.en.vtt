00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
with us as human eyes or not human but

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.320 
with us as human eyes or not human but
animal<00:04:59.170> eyes<00:04:59.290> that<00:05:00.190> you<00:05:00.370> know<00:05:00.400> we<00:05:00.610> move<00:05:01.030> around

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
animal eyes that you know we move around

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.640 
animal eyes that you know we move around
you<00:05:01.450> actually<00:05:01.540> get<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.900> see<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.080> whites<00:05:02.350> and

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
you actually get to see the whites and

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.290 
you actually get to see the whites and
see<00:05:03.040> there's<00:05:03.220> an<00:05:03.340> actually<00:05:03.610> organic<00:05:04.090> thing

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
see there's an actually organic thing

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.090 
see there's an actually organic thing
which<00:05:04.420> might<00:05:04.660> be<00:05:04.810> really<00:05:05.050> ugly<00:05:05.230> okay<00:05:05.770> with<00:05:06.010> the

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
which might be really ugly okay with the

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.710 
which might be really ugly okay with the
idea<00:05:06.370> of<00:05:06.400> General<00:05:06.700> Grievous<00:05:06.880> as<00:05:07.270> a<00:05:07.300> leader<00:05:07.570> of

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
idea of General Grievous as a leader of

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.030 
bit of an alien in a droid shell which
is<00:05:12.670> sort<00:05:13.240> of<00:05:13.270> an<00:05:13.450> echo<00:05:13.810> of<00:05:13.990> what<00:05:14.020> Anakin<00:05:14.920> is

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040
