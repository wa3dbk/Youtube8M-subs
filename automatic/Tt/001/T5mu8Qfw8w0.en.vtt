00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.810
 So I am the master of confectionery and me 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.800
 have michael's lottery opap 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.779
 sury concretely do everything that is plural 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.350
 but naturprodukte chocolates panels also 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.620
 quite a lot of wedding cakes and such 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.620
 continue 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.960
 that's my dream of me and konditor too 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.059
 learning is something that I am at 15 quite 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.500
 cocky to the friend said do the 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.850
 nature for the birthday and has it for me 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.559
 presented relatively easily and then 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.840
 all said do not even practice 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.199
 So how do you practice your goals 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.629
 and of course the first ones though 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.890
 I was so much fun and then 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.290
 really always so if so much 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.519
 was stress or if there was a lot going on 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.350
 I always baked pies at school 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.030
 At some point I had forbidden Hirtenberg 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.229
 I could not measure but I wanted to 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.670
 I always study sports 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.090
 I did a lot of sports and wanted to 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.800
 study and did not have that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.470
 found right then said oh 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.030
 No, then I really do mine mine 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.030
 dream job and weak knowledge 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.799
 So my parents were in the beginning times 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.799
 briefly irritated but then they have that 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.060
 fully supports everyone else 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.860
 actually found it somehow as a ball 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.299
 not only in the class 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.320
 the teachers have a hard time with that 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.229
 I do not know 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.869
 above average good student one 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.820
 good student and you say yes as under 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.040
 rather study or teach one walls 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.220
 At least do some 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.479
 insurance was an account free that was 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.799
 so it's not really up there 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.799
 positive resonance encountered 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.009
 so i stayed here in bad windsheim 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.630
 year 2000 my high school graduation did me 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.790
 opted for the confectioner's teaching 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.319
 I am named after Frankfurt am Main 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.239
 after that 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.599
 moritz has a five-star hotel three 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.459
 years worked until the end was htc 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.989
 In France, the practitioner 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.580
 made for the vases working 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.200
 So I was about nine years old 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.880
 typical of hiking like i am measuring 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.880
 the so imagines in Germany or in 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.590
 Switzerland or France I have the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.440
 masterclass in heidelberg and 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.730
 I'm also in the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.049
 national team of cooks slipped 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.220
 that is if the master exam if 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.110
 I have been asked if I do not like it 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.519
 would have to become a member there would be the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.220
 next match in chicago the 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.900
 World Cup and then later 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.720
 me still at the olympiad of the church in 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.799
 erfurt and have since the gold medal for 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.180
 The patisserie brought with the plan the 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.950
 It's like cooking when it's sports 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.660
 just not so well known but it 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.700
 are very very many countries because I believe 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.830
 it was the 50 different nations 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.480
 that was there and that was very 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.640
 impressive at the beginning there was then in 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.079
 the opening ceremony with the marching in 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.600
 nations so we are behind 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.110
 South Africa actually marched with the 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.210
 sign and all of 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.030
 in a team on trains or 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.910
 cooking jacket after that there was a big one 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.580
 Opening ceremony with music and dance and 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.810
 and talk that was impressive and to 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.880
 Finally , there was the inflammation of the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.340
 Olympic fire that all the time 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.500
 on the ground where the olympiad was 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:32.209
 outside the bowl burned with a torch 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:33.140
 has handed over so come back 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.670
 which is pretty hard 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.740
 so measures actually said I was for the 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.810
 In the valley above qualified you 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.840
 Hard to find what to do and also before 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.190
 Everything very difficult to find 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.690
 who also work so high quality 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.950
 i just want an olympic games 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.060
 high quality I worked after 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.430
 Swiss with high quality products 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.440
 worked and therefore a cost factor 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.570
 Of course, many around the forest 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.520
 do not record because they are afraid of it 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.860
 will not be paid 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.860
 and I have struggled and 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.739
 I said then okay if not 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.470
 want to do then I just tried 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.270
 Now here to build that by me 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.040
 as we are doing an extremely high one here 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.750
 level or it is also one of the 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.700
 highest in the world 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.780
 and then have to realize it myself 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.780
 then just myself live a life 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.180
 the most important thing is that if you like that 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.400
 wants to be successful or if you want 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.450
 also wants to achieve a lot that you only 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.310
 know exactly what is mine 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.900
 passion and aware of it 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.280
 decides and then you do that 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.530
 Interest and curiosity does not lose 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.390
 that you look at again and again and just 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.120
 wants to know how things work and then 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.560
 also want to try and if you are there 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.330
 Passion and lust have to do it 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.440
 and then not necessarily always up 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.060
 watch the clock I go home now 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.100
 but just want to try it 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.600
 and has your eyes open when it is in the 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.760
 Holiday is always somewhere at running and 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.750
 if you see that, then it can 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.750
 only from them 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:01.009
 beautiful confectioner or as a confectioner 

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:04.039
 I think that you are also independent 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.360
 Everyone has their area of ​​work 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.909
 it may be better the other better 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.659
 if there is usually allowed relatively 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.770
 Free work right now in the design 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.879
 also much freedom left 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.529
 At the same time you have the 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.389
 responsibility for being beautiful 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.279
 and it's just beautiful to see 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.809
 how to think and what to think 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.369
 is now turned over there already looks and 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:24.589
 there are customers who are happy 

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:26.439
 animal about it looks nice 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:27.649
 which then also tastes classic that is 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:30.949
 beautiful 

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:32.240
 unworked stop with hands what now 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.429
 not the whole day somewhere from 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.259
 Computer but you see what you do 

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:39.229
 Created and you see what you did 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.679
 has in the evening and can then very much 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:45.789
 satisfied at home 

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:45.789
 So I'm on all many craftsmen
