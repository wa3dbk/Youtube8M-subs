the<00:01:36.030> guys<00:01:36.420> actually<00:01:36.689> introduced<00:01:37.290> us<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.710> rugby

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920

and<00:01:38.250> invited<00:01:38.820> us<00:01:38.909> down<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> guess<00:01:39.840> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and invited us down here so I guess it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.149 
and invited us down here so I guess it
was<00:01:40.020> fitting<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.560> were<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> first<00:01:40.979> one

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
was fitting that they were the first one

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
was fitting that they were the first one
to<00:01:41.189> beat<00:01:41.430> us<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:42.000> all<00:01:42.119> throw<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> ball

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
to beat us you all throw the ball

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.480 
to beat us you all throw the ball
backwards<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.290> rugby<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.860> American<00:01:44.250> football

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
backwards in rugby the American football

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
backwards in rugby the American football
we<00:01:44.610> move<00:01:44.759> forwards<00:01:45.240> by<00:01:45.780> throwing<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> ball

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
we move forwards by throwing the ball

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
we move forwards by throwing the ball
forwards<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:47.759> difficult<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.270> my

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
forwards so it's very difficult for my

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.910 
forwards so it's very difficult for my
guys<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.990> understand<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.530> got<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> throw<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
guys to understand you got to throw the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.830 
guys to understand you got to throw the
ball<00:01:50.100> backwards<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.790> move<00:01:50.939> forwards<00:01:51.329> when

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
ball backwards to move forwards when

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.789 
ball backwards to move forwards when
they're<00:01:51.990> used<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> throwing<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.619> ball

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
they're used to throwing the ball

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.209 
they're used to throwing the ball
forwards<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.720> backwards

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
forwards so it's just it's backwards

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.530 
forwards so it's just it's backwards
needless<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.369> say<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> battle<00:01:57.360> the

needless to say this was a battle the
