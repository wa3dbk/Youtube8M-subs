00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
don't know what you would call it but

don't know what you would call it but
but<00:01:17.290> we<00:01:17.620> don't<00:01:17.830> know<00:01:18.130> what<00:01:18.400> we<00:01:18.520> can<00:01:18.550> discover

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
but we don't know what we can discover

science<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.320> best<00:01:23.560> questions<00:01:24.100> are<00:01:24.280> asked<00:01:24.670> the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
science the best questions are asked the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.370 
science the best questions are asked the
best<00:01:25.570> question<00:01:26.050> you<00:01:26.140> can<00:01:26.350> ask<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:28.050> what<00:01:29.050> could

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
best question you can ask is what could

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.840 
best question you can ask is what could
be<00:01:29.620> there<00:01:31.740> rather<00:01:32.740> than<00:01:33.070> limiting<00:01:33.370> yourself

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
be there rather than limiting yourself

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.270 
be there rather than limiting yourself
to<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.690> particular<00:01:35.110> thing<00:01:35.650> I'm<00:01:35.920> going<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.160> go

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
to a particular thing I'm going to go

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.450 
to a particular thing I'm going to go
find<00:01:36.310> DNA<00:01:36.760> or<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:38.560> interested<00:01:39.130> in<00:01:39.160> finding

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
find DNA or I'm interested in finding

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.930 
find DNA or I'm interested in finding
DNA<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.750> better<00:01:40.960> question<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.640> what<00:01:42.640> could

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
DNA the better question is what could

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.010 
DNA the better question is what could
possibly<00:01:43.540> be<00:01:43.660> there<00:01:44.970> every<00:01:45.970> paleontology<00:01:46.390> has

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
possibly be there every paleontology has

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.310 
possibly be there every paleontology has
a<00:01:47.050> patient<00:01:47.680> for<00:01:47.860> bones<00:01:48.190> but<00:01:49.000> yours<00:01:49.690> maybe<00:01:50.050> was

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
a patient for bones but yours maybe was

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.910 
a patient for bones but yours maybe was
a<00:01:50.350> little<00:01:50.470> bit<00:01:51.010> different

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
a little bit different

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.510 
a little bit different
didn't<00:01:52.340> mind<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.790> break<00:01:53.210> balls<00:01:54.189> it's<00:01:55.189> funny

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
didn't mind to break balls it's funny

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.649 
didn't mind to break balls it's funny
you<00:01:56.360> go<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.720> museum<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.500> people<00:01:58.040> treat

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
you go to a museum and people treat

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.749 
you go to a museum and people treat
dinosaur<00:01:59.659> bones<00:01:59.990> like<00:02:00.950> treasures<00:02:01.490> and

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
dinosaur bones like treasures and

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.630 
dinosaur bones like treasures and
they're<00:02:02.720> very<00:02:02.750> careful<00:02:03.530> with<00:02:03.740> them<00:02:03.890> it's<00:02:04.520> like

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
they're very careful with them it's like

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.399 
they're very careful with them it's like
dinosaur<00:02:05.240> eggs<00:02:05.509> are<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.899> same<00:02:06.110> thing

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
dinosaur eggs are the same thing

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.449 
dinosaur eggs are the same thing
dinosaur<00:02:07.310> eggs<00:02:08.470> when<00:02:09.470> people<00:02:09.830> have<00:02:10.009> them<00:02:10.250> are

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
dinosaur eggs when people have them are

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.390 
dinosaur eggs when people have them are
are<00:02:11.230> considered<00:02:12.230> very<00:02:12.500> precious<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.220> I

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
are considered very precious and I

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.910 
are considered very precious and I
always<00:02:13.850> say<00:02:14.060> let<00:02:14.810> me<00:02:14.959> break<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.319> open<00:02:15.560> and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
always say let me break it open and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.040 
always say let me break it open and
they're<00:02:16.430> like<00:02:16.610> no<00:02:16.640> no<00:02:17.090> no<00:02:17.390> don't<00:02:17.690> break<00:02:17.930> it

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
they're like no no no don't break it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.430 
they're like no no no don't break it
open<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:19.160> say<00:02:19.430> but<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.180> most<00:02:21.110> precious

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
open and I say but the most precious

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.920 
open and I say but the most precious
thing<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.950> could<00:02:22.130> possibly<00:02:22.160> have<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.269> an

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
thing you could possibly have is an

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.070 
thing you could possibly have is an
embryo<00:02:24.440> inside<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:26.569> same<00:02:26.810> thing<00:02:27.050> goes

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
embryo inside and the same thing goes

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.850 
embryo inside and the same thing goes
for<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.500> bone<00:02:28.870> there's<00:02:29.870> more<00:02:30.140> information

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
for a bone there's more information

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.490 
for a bone there's more information
about<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.370> bone<00:02:31.549> and<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.090> animal<00:02:32.480> inside<00:02:33.319> the

about the bone and the animal inside the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.979 
about the bone and the animal inside the
bone<00:02:33.680> then<00:02:33.920> there<00:02:34.069> is<00:02:34.190> outside<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.640> bone<00:02:34.989> so

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
bone then there is outside the bone so

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.809 
bone then there is outside the bone so
you're<00:02:36.620> better<00:02:36.769> off<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:37.160> break<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.459> open<00:02:37.580> and

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
you're better off to break it open and

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.750 
you're better off to break it open and
look<00:02:38.000> if<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.600> have<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.750> whole<00:02:38.989> bone<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:40.549> can

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
look if you have a whole bone you can

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.840 
look if you have a whole bone you can
compare<00:02:41.239> it<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.540> other<00:02:42.459> dinosaurs<00:02:43.459> or<00:02:43.670> other

compare it to other dinosaurs or other

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.360 
compare it to other dinosaurs or other
animals<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.690> see<00:02:44.930> what<00:02:45.200> they<00:02:45.680> may<00:02:45.950> have<00:02:45.980> been

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370

their<00:02:49.819> biomechanics<00:02:50.690> or<00:02:50.930> we<00:02:51.680> can<00:02:51.860> compare

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
them between different species to see

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.550 
them between different species to see
you<00:02:56.269> know<00:02:56.390> how<00:02:56.570> they're<00:02:56.780> different<00:02:56.959> or<00:02:57.410> how

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
you know how they're different or how

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.860 
you know how they're different or how
they're<00:02:57.769> similar<00:02:58.359> basic<00:02:59.359> Billy<00:02:59.600> its

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
they're similar basic Billy its

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.710 
they're similar basic Billy its
morphology<00:03:00.459> but<00:03:01.459> if<00:03:01.549> you<00:03:01.640> break<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:02.030> open<00:03:02.180> you

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
morphology but if you break it open you

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.250 
morphology but if you break it open you
get<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.079> histology<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.940> histology<00:03:05.299> is<00:03:05.840> a

cold-blooded your idea I've often been

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
attitude to think out of the box is

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.430 
attitude to think out of the box is
coming<00:03:22.910> from

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
coming from

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.110 
coming from
well<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.870> am<00:03:25.870> dyslexic<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.940> reading<00:03:27.940> is<00:03:28.090> the

well I am dyslexic I reading is the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.070 
well I am dyslexic I reading is the
hardest<00:03:28.660> thing<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:29.050> I<00:03:29.230> do<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:30.000> so

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
hardest thing that I do and so

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.410 
hardest thing that I do and so
fortunately<00:03:32.080> I<00:03:32.470> don't<00:03:33.100> have<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:33.760> lot<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.120> other

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
fortunately I don't have a lot of other

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.250 
fortunately I don't have a lot of other
people's<00:03:34.810> ideas<00:03:35.910> ideas<00:03:36.910> come<00:03:37.450> from<00:03:37.480> reading

people's ideas ideas come from reading

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.000 
people's ideas ideas come from reading
too<00:03:38.410> much<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.800> think<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.320> would<00:03:41.800> say

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
too much I think and so so I would say

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.050 
too much I think and so so I would say
that<00:03:42.040> my<00:03:43.350> thinking<00:03:44.350> out<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.680> box<00:03:45.060> comes

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
that my thinking out of the box comes

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.990 
that my thinking out of the box comes
from<00:03:46.330> never<00:03:46.600> being<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.260> box<00:03:47.550> my<00:03:48.550> notion

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
from never being in the box my notion

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.390 
from never being in the box my notion
always<00:03:49.330> has<00:03:49.570> been<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.190> best

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
always has been that this that the best

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.760 
always has been that this that the best

answer the best questions out there are

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.180 
answer the best questions out there are
the<00:03:54.190> simplest<00:03:54.730> questions<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:55.980> people<00:03:56.980> get

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
the simplest questions and people get

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.730 
the simplest questions and people get
drawn<00:03:57.880> up<00:03:58.150> into<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.630> details<00:03:59.140> of<00:03:59.470> everything

I don't know what the basics of science

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.000 
I don't know what the basics of science
are<00:04:10.570> so<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.230> have<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.470> start<00:04:11.740> from<00:04:11.770> the
