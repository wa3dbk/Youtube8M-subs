00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.659
 and this the month as they are 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.509
 I am place and today we 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:21.189
 we found in this review 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.890
 cinematographic of a text so that 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:28.479
 has liked too much it's called plastic 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.699
 pack and then we will review the 

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:33.700
 plastic bag was created by cuatro jota 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.500
 studies for minecraft xbox 360 and it was 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.230
 ported for pc by a user 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.660
 anyone like us this resource 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.520
 pack has simple textures and at the same time 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.700
 complex that make our game 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.010
 be quite beautiful and more fun 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.420
 well now I will review the blocks that 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.340
 we have here 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.260
 here we have the clause as you can see 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.600
 this texture I like more or less 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.550
 this is the redstone block and this is 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.800
 the block of lapis lazuli 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.800
 this is more gluttonous these are some 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.560
 envelopes the gold the iron the 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.130
 coal and the diamond for me are very 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.860
 simple 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.250
 this is the bitch like you can see stone 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.130
 base I hope it looks pretty cool 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.950
 this is the oak wood that 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.159
 we get normally out there 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.880
 this is the smooth stone this is the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.159
 seizure and this is the iron block 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.310
 this is the golden one these are some 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.670
 colorful wool are the block of 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.110
 lapis lazuli and the diamond block by 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.810
 here we have the pumpkin and the tnt here 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.289
 we have the pistons the sticky and the no 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.929
 sticky and here the repsol torches 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.810
 This is how the water and the sand look like 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.810
 as you see the earth looks pretty smooth 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.330
 for my taste the texture of the leaves 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.520
 they love it because they are pretty square and 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.619
 Simple as we all like it is 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.750
 minecraft more or less like that it would look 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.459
 forest if we play with this text without 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.979
 But there are some things that have not been 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.319
 covers for this texture pack as 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.780
 this flower we see on screen the 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.959
 armor looks pretty simple the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.850
 like that, the animation would look like 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:21.000
 to chop if we were in a mine 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.130
 the gravel I love how it looks though 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.810
 I think maybe there could be 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.200
 improved but that's fine 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.680
 The plastic bag is available only 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:38.120
 the 16 by 16 however it looks pretty 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.849
 well and it will give a lot of play now let's go to the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.069
 conclusion with blake in conclusion 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.560
 stormers this is a pretty pack 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.349
 recommended since it is quite simple and 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.330
 cool but as I mentioned there are some 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.730
 things that have not been covered yet 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.310
 like for example the double grass and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.680
 some flowers of the new ones or 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.410
 horses and chickens I think neither 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.900
 They have been ported but it is very good 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.090
 texture bag highly recommended 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.010
 links in the description and if you liked it 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.190
 this cinematographic review remembers that 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.239
 you can share it subscribe and everything 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.700
 the rest 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.000

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.630
