00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
question I get asked the most is why I

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.859

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
put backing on my reels and the main

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.450 
put backing on my reels and the main
reason<00:00:32.290> is<00:00:32.410> line<00:00:32.710> these<00:00:32.890> days<00:00:33.129> it's<00:00:33.370> so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
reason is line these days it's so

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.820 
reason is line these days it's so
expensive<00:00:33.730> here's<00:00:34.120> a<00:00:34.210> great<00:00:34.390> example<00:00:34.830> Seaguar

but<00:01:33.550> I<00:01:33.580> still<00:01:33.790> need<00:01:34.000> filler<00:01:34.300> below<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:34.870> line

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
but I still need filler below that line

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.770 
but I still need filler below that line
and<00:01:36.010> that's<00:01:36.340> your<00:01:36.490> backing<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:37.330> I<00:01:37.360> like<00:01:37.570> it

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
and that's your backing so I like it

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.910 
and that's your backing so I like it
like<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:38.110> said<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.440> know<00:01:38.500> I'm<00:01:38.560> going<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.710> put<00:01:38.830> on

like I said you know I'm going to put on

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.180 
like I said you know I'm going to put on
50<00:01:39.220> yards<00:01:39.580> so<00:01:40.240> I<00:01:40.270> need<00:01:40.630> backing<00:01:41.470> below<00:01:41.920> that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
50 yards so I need backing below that

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.730 
50 yards so I need backing below that
okay<00:01:42.820> yes<00:01:43.300> it's<00:01:43.479> expensive<00:01:43.690> but<00:01:44.200> if<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.440> used

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
okay yes it's expensive but if you used

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.460 
okay yes it's expensive but if you used
backing<00:01:45.220> you<00:01:45.400> get<00:01:45.610> more<00:01:45.880> real<00:01:46.180> spooled<00:01:46.630> up<00:01:46.780> you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
backing you get more real spooled up you

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.140 
backing you get more real spooled up you
know<00:01:47.590> with<00:01:47.800> one<00:01:47.979> filler<00:01:48.220> spool<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:48.909> instead<00:01:49.090> of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
know with one filler spool so instead of

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.870 
know with one filler spool so instead of
just<00:01:49.360> maybe<00:01:50.140> getting<00:01:50.409> one<00:01:50.650> or<00:01:50.680> two<00:01:50.830> reels<00:01:51.190> if

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
just maybe getting one or two reels if

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.000 
just maybe getting one or two reels if
I'm<00:01:51.970> going<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.330> put<00:01:52.390> on<00:01:52.479> 50<00:01:52.840> yards<00:01:53.290> just

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
I'm going to put on 50 yards just

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.200 
I'm going to put on 50 yards just
because<00:01:54.280> I'm<00:01:54.400> only<00:01:54.549> going<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:54.850> pigeon<00:01:55.060> flip

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
because I'm only going to pigeon flip

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.090 
because I'm only going to pigeon flip
with<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.690> can<00:01:56.080> spool<00:01:56.290> up<00:01:56.409> four<00:01:56.650> reels<00:01:56.890> with

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
with it I can spool up four reels with

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.010 
with it I can spool up four reels with
this<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:57.580> yeah<00:01:58.000> that's<00:01:58.120> expensive<00:01:58.659> but<00:01:58.900> if<00:01:58.960> you

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
this so yeah that's expensive but if you

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.190 
this so yeah that's expensive but if you
do<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.260> that<00:01:59.409> way<00:01:59.620> it<00:02:00.159> doesn't<00:02:00.340> seem<00:02:00.549> so<00:02:00.610> bad<00:02:01.200> so

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
do it that way it doesn't seem so bad so

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.450 
do it that way it doesn't seem so bad so
again<00:02:02.380> that's<00:02:02.500> my<00:02:02.680> plan<00:02:02.920> with<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.250> you<00:02:03.340> know

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
again that's my plan with it you know

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.740 
again that's my plan with it you know
and<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:03.940> changes<00:02:04.299> if<00:02:04.450> you're<00:02:04.570> going<00:02:04.659> too

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
and that changes if you're going too

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.969 
and that changes if you're going too
deep<00:02:04.900> crank<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:05.350> don't<00:02:05.500> want<00:02:05.620> a<00:02:05.650> lot<00:02:05.830> more

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
deep crank you don't want a lot more

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.590 
deep crank you don't want a lot more

you can just bomb out there of course

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.610 
you can just bomb out there of course
you<00:02:10.119> want<00:02:10.330> more<00:02:10.450> line<00:02:10.659> but<00:02:11.170> you're<00:02:11.319> just<00:02:11.470> going

twenty-five<00:03:48.040> yards<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.430> backing<00:03:48.790> ok<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:50.319> know

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
twenty-five yards of backing ok you know

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.339 
twenty-five yards of backing ok you know
this<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.799> would<00:03:51.069> rather<00:03:51.280> use<00:03:52.150> backing<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:52.840> get

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
this I would rather use backing and get

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.009 
this I would rather use backing and get
two<00:03:54.040> reels<00:03:54.310> out<00:03:54.639> of<00:03:54.940> one<00:03:55.060> spool<00:03:55.329> versus<00:03:55.840> just

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
two reels out of one spool versus just

two reels out of one spool versus just
the<00:03:56.139> one<00:03:56.639> so<00:03:57.639> of<00:03:57.730> course<00:03:57.940> I<00:03:58.239> always<00:03:58.840> back<00:03:59.200> my

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
the one so of course I always back my

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.000 
the one so of course I always back my
spinning<00:03:59.889> reels<00:04:01.019> alright<00:04:02.019> next<00:04:02.410> question<00:04:02.530> is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
spinning reels alright next question is

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.440 
spinning reels alright next question is
this<00:04:03.160> would<00:04:03.340> be<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.519> most<00:04:03.669> confusing<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.299> how

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
this would be the most confusing is how

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.780 
this would be the most confusing is how
do<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.569> figure<00:04:04.810> out<00:04:04.930> how<00:04:05.889> much<00:04:06.130> backing<00:04:06.459> and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
do I figure out how much backing and

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.699 
do I figure out how much backing and
putting<00:04:07.000> on<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.389> course<00:04:07.870> you<00:04:08.139> can<00:04:08.410> see<00:04:08.530> how

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
putting on of course you can see how

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.729 
putting on of course you can see how
many<00:04:08.950> inches<00:04:09.190> per<00:04:09.730> turn<00:04:09.970> your<00:04:10.299> reel<00:04:10.530> brings<00:04:11.530> in

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
many inches per turn your reel brings in

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.020 
many inches per turn your reel brings in
you<00:04:11.889> can<00:04:12.010> figure<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.280> out<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.430> way<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:12.910> will

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
you can figure it out that way that will

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.330 
you can figure it out that way that will
change<00:04:13.239> this<00:04:13.480> line<00:04:13.660> comes<00:04:13.870> on<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.139> spool<00:04:14.379> but

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
change this line comes on the spool but

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.120 
change this line comes on the spool but
you<00:04:15.430> can<00:04:15.639> do<00:04:15.790> it<00:04:15.879> that<00:04:16.030> way<00:04:16.060> what<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.389> do<00:04:16.510> is<00:04:17.130> any

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
you can do it that way what I do is any

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.129 
you can do it that way what I do is any
time<00:04:18.400> I<00:04:18.459> get<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:18.639> new<00:04:18.669> reel<00:04:18.970> i<00:04:19.209> spool<00:04:19.900> it<00:04:20.019> off

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.750 
I'll spool up one reel with 12 pound
test<00:04:46.180> know<00:04:46.420> my<00:04:46.540> yard<00:04:46.840> was<00:04:47.310> 150<00:04:48.310> foot<00:04:48.520> deep

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
test know my yard was 150 foot deep

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.090 
test know my yard was 150 foot deep
that's<00:04:49.030> 50<00:04:49.330> yards<00:04:49.600> so<00:04:50.170> I<00:04:50.230> fill<00:04:50.500> my<00:04:50.680> reel<00:04:50.890> all

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
that's 50 yards so I fill my reel all

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.010 
that's 50 yards so I fill my reel all
the<00:04:51.190> way<00:04:51.280> up<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.670> go<00:04:51.820> set<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.150> reel<00:04:52.330> at<00:04:52.600> the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
the way up and go set the reel at the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.300 
the way up and go set the reel at the
end<00:04:53.140> of<00:04:53.230> the<00:04:53.290> yard<00:04:53.470> they<00:04:53.650> grab<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.950> line<00:04:54.130> to

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
end of the yard they grab the line to

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.340 
end of the yard they grab the line to
walk<00:04:54.430> it<00:04:54.610> all<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.730> way<00:04:54.880> out<00:04:55.060> okay<00:04:55.570> that's<00:04:55.810> 50

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
walk it all the way out okay that's 50

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.260 
walk it all the way out okay that's 50
yards<00:04:56.650> I<00:04:56.800> go<00:04:57.250> back<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.670> reel<00:04:57.820> up<00:04:57.940> grab<00:04:58.180> the

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
yards I go back to the reel up grab the

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.100 
yards I go back to the reel up grab the
line<00:04:58.420> again<00:04:58.720> go<00:04:59.080> halfway<00:04:59.320> at<00:04:59.860> 75<00:05:00.340> yards<00:05:00.640> okay

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
line again go halfway at 75 yards okay

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.890 
line again go halfway at 75 yards okay
so<00:05:02.110> I've<00:05:02.230> pulled<00:05:02.470> out<00:05:02.590> 75<00:05:03.220> yards<00:05:03.520> of<00:05:03.580> line<00:05:03.900> if

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
so I've pulled out 75 yards of line if

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.810 
so I've pulled out 75 yards of line if
you<00:05:05.020> go<00:05:05.140> to<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.380> reel<00:05:05.590> okay<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.370> distance

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
you go to the reel okay the distance

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.160 
you go to the reel okay the distance
from<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.030> top<00:05:07.180> of<00:05:07.210> the<00:05:07.420> spool<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.020> line

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
from the top of the spool to the line

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.900 
from the top of the spool to the line
that's<00:05:08.320> left<00:05:08.530> on<00:05:08.710> there<00:05:08.980> that<00:05:09.340> distance

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
that's left on there that distance

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.720 
that's left on there that distance
represents<00:05:10.660> 75<00:05:11.140> yards<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:12.190> you<00:05:12.250> can<00:05:12.430> use<00:05:12.550> piece

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
represents 75 yards so you can use piece

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.490 
represents 75 yards so you can use piece
of<00:05:12.880> cardboard<00:05:13.330> you're<00:05:13.570> taking<00:05:13.870> measurement<00:05:14.320> I

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
of cardboard you're taking measurement I

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.650 
of cardboard you're taking measurement I
use<00:05:15.070> these<00:05:15.250> little<00:05:15.520> H<00:05:15.850> blocks<00:05:16.150> they<00:05:16.360> should<00:05:16.570> be

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
use these little H blocks they should be

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.150 
use these little H blocks they should be
really<00:05:16.900> into<00:05:17.200> it<00:05:17.380> we're<00:05:17.500> working<00:05:17.830> these<00:05:18.040> are

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
really into it we're working these are

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.770 
really into it we're working these are
just<00:05:18.310> little<00:05:18.430> gauge<00:05:18.640> blocks<00:05:18.940> or<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.150> router<00:05:19.360> and

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
just little gauge blocks or a router and

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
just little gauge blocks or a router and
this<00:05:20.560> one<00:05:20.770> here<00:05:22.110> work<00:05:23.110> for<00:05:23.140> most<00:05:23.470> of<00:05:23.530> my<00:05:23.590> reels

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
this one here work for most of my reels

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.100 
this one here work for most of my reels
this<00:05:23.950> one<00:05:24.100> is<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.310> quarter-inch<00:05:24.670> okay<00:05:25.180> so<00:05:25.720> if<00:05:25.930> I

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
this one is a quarter-inch okay so if I

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.510 
this one is a quarter-inch okay so if I
were<00:05:26.320> to<00:05:26.380> lay<00:05:27.340> this<00:05:28.590> gauge<00:05:29.590> block<00:05:29.890> on<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.340> line

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
were to lay this gauge block on the line

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.220 
were to lay this gauge block on the line
that's<00:05:30.730> left<00:05:30.910> on<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.090> reel<00:05:31.270> it<00:05:31.570> would<00:05:31.690> be<00:05:31.810> even

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
that's left on the reel it would be even

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.810 
that's left on the reel it would be even
with<00:05:32.530> top<00:05:32.740> of<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:32.950> spool<00:05:33.160> so<00:05:33.430> this<00:05:33.610> gauge

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
with top of the spool so this gauge

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.260 
with top of the spool so this gauge
block<00:05:34.000> represents<00:05:35.160> 75<00:05:36.160> yards<00:05:36.460> of<00:05:36.550> line<00:05:36.700> for

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
block represents 75 yards of line for

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.490 
block represents 75 yards of line for
that<00:05:37.420> diameter<00:05:37.720> okay<00:05:38.050> that's<00:05:38.320> going<00:05:38.440> to

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
that diameter okay that's going to

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.530 
that diameter okay that's going to
change<00:05:38.800> when<00:05:39.460> you<00:05:39.580> change<00:05:39.640> brands<00:05:40.240> and

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
change when you change brands and

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.120 
change when you change brands and
diameter<00:05:40.840> and<00:05:40.930> all<00:05:40.990> that<00:05:41.170> okay<00:05:41.380> so<00:05:41.440> keep<00:05:41.950> that

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
diameter and all that okay so keep that

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.560 
diameter and all that okay so keep that
in<00:05:42.220> mind

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
in mind

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.790 
in mind
but<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.660> 12<00:05:43.870> pound<00:05:44.080> test<00:05:44.320> is<00:05:44.470> what<00:05:44.590> I<00:05:44.620> would

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
but the 12 pound test is what I would

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.160 
but the 12 pound test is what I would
use<00:05:45.100> kind<00:05:45.730> of<00:05:45.790> like<00:05:45.910> a<00:05:45.940> gauge<00:05:46.240> you<00:05:46.900> know<00:05:46.990> when<00:05:47.110> I

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
use kind of like a gauge you know when I

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.630 
use kind of like a gauge you know when I
would<00:05:47.230> look<00:05:47.440> at<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.650> diameter<00:05:48.130> of<00:05:48.250> the<00:05:48.430> 12

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
would look at the diameter of the 12

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.460 
would look at the diameter of the 12
pound<00:05:48.850> test<00:05:49.090> I<00:05:49.390> would<00:05:49.720> just<00:05:49.840> compare<00:05:50.170> that<00:05:50.320> to

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
pound test I would just compare that to

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.570 
pound test I would just compare that to
different<00:05:50.710> brands<00:05:51.040> you<00:05:51.190> know<00:05:51.220> if<00:05:51.370> I'm<00:05:51.460> going

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
different brands you know if I'm going

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.030 
different brands you know if I'm going
to<00:05:51.640> compare<00:05:51.910> to<00:05:52.030> seagard<00:05:52.420> see<00:05:52.990> ours<00:05:53.230> diameters

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
to compare to seagard see ours diameters

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.770 
to compare to seagard see ours diameters
a<00:05:54.070> lot<00:05:54.220> smaller<00:05:54.550> so<00:05:54.820> if<00:05:55.210> I<00:05:55.300> wanted<00:05:55.510> to<00:05:55.630> use<00:05:55.750> that

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
a lot smaller so if I wanted to use that

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.380 
a lot smaller so if I wanted to use that
gauge<00:05:56.110> block<00:05:56.320> okay

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
gauge block okay

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.150 
gauge block okay
once<00:05:58.390> I'm<00:05:58.540> spooling<00:05:58.810> up<00:05:58.960> my<00:05:59.050> backing<00:05:59.470> and<00:06:00.070> I

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
once I'm spooling up my backing and I

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.160 
once I'm spooling up my backing and I
know<00:06:00.220> that<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.580> amber<00:06:00.850> this<00:06:00.970> is<00:06:01.030> smaller<00:06:01.480> once

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
know that the amber this is smaller once

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.570 
know that the amber this is smaller once
I<00:06:02.290> get<00:06:02.560> to<00:06:02.590> the<00:06:02.830> top<00:06:02.980> of<00:06:03.010> the<00:06:03.190> spool<00:06:03.370> of<00:06:03.490> my

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
I get to the top of the spool of my

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.040 
I get to the top of the spool of my
gauge<00:06:03.790> block<00:06:03.940> I'll<00:06:04.510> take<00:06:04.690> the<00:06:04.780> gauge<00:06:04.900> block

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
gauge block I'll take the gauge block

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.050 
gauge block I'll take the gauge block
off<00:06:05.380> I'll<00:06:06.100> screw<00:06:06.340> up<00:06:06.460> a<00:06:06.520> little<00:06:06.670> more<00:06:06.820> line

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
off I'll screw up a little more line

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.000 
off I'll screw up a little more line
just<00:06:07.330> to<00:06:07.390> make<00:06:07.600> up<00:06:07.780> for<00:06:08.440> the<00:06:08.560> smaller<00:06:08.800> diameter

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
just to make up for the smaller diameter

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.890 
just to make up for the smaller diameter
now<00:06:09.700> if<00:06:09.850> you're<00:06:09.940> going<00:06:10.030> to<00:06:10.120> use<00:06:10.240> 20<00:06:10.390> pound<00:06:10.690> test

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
now if you're going to use 20 pound test

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.750 
now if you're going to use 20 pound test
of<00:06:11.110> course<00:06:11.290> that's<00:06:11.470> a<00:06:11.530> bigger<00:06:11.770> diameter<00:06:11.980> than

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
of course that's a bigger diameter than

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.420 
of course that's a bigger diameter than
12<00:06:13.030> pound<00:06:13.240> on<00:06:13.420> oh<00:06:13.710> so<00:06:14.710> you<00:06:14.770> don't<00:06:14.860> want<00:06:14.980> to<00:06:15.130> go<00:06:15.250> a

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
12 pound on oh so you don't want to go a

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.190 
12 pound on oh so you don't want to go a
little<00:06:15.670> less<00:06:15.940> okay<00:06:16.780> you<00:06:16.870> want<00:06:17.020> to<00:06:17.080> use<00:06:17.170> a

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
little less okay you want to use a

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.420 
little less okay you want to use a
bigger<00:06:17.500> gauge<00:06:17.710> block<00:06:17.890> that<00:06:18.130> way<00:06:18.220> there's<00:06:18.400> more

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
bigger gauge block that way there's more

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.540 
bigger gauge block that way there's more
room<00:06:18.760> for<00:06:18.990> mainline<00:06:19.990> and<00:06:20.170> less<00:06:20.710> backing<00:06:21.130> it

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
room for mainline and less backing it

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.920 
room for mainline and less backing it
sounds<00:06:21.880> complicated<00:06:22.000> it's<00:06:22.420> really<00:06:22.660> not<00:06:22.780> if

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
sounds complicated it's really not if

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:23.910 
sounds complicated it's really not if
you<00:06:23.020> really<00:06:23.170> think<00:06:23.350> about<00:06:23.410> it<00:06:23.590> you<00:06:23.860> know

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:23.920 
you really think about it you know

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.500 
you really think about it you know
really<00:06:24.130> does<00:06:24.310> make<00:06:24.460> sense<00:06:24.670> it's<00:06:25.060> an<00:06:25.150> easy<00:06:25.300> way

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
really does make sense it's an easy way

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.030 
really does make sense it's an easy way
to<00:06:25.540> figure<00:06:25.810> it<00:06:25.960> out<00:06:26.080> and<00:06:26.500> what<00:06:26.620> you<00:06:26.740> figure<00:06:26.950> out

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
to figure it out and what you figure out

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.680 
to figure it out and what you figure out
one<00:06:27.220> like<00:06:27.400> that<00:06:27.430> it's<00:06:27.940> just<00:06:28.150> it's<00:06:28.390> just<00:06:28.540> really

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
one like that it's just it's just really

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.300 
one like that it's just it's just really
easy<00:06:28.810> to<00:06:28.900> do<00:06:29.020> them<00:06:29.140> all<00:06:29.290> and<00:06:29.860> like<00:06:30.010> I<00:06:30.040> said<00:06:30.160> when

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
easy to do them all and like I said when

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.500 
easy to do them all and like I said when
I'm<00:06:30.400> spooling<00:06:30.640> up<00:06:30.730> real<00:06:30.970> like<00:06:31.120> and<00:06:31.300> I<00:06:31.330> show

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
I'm spooling up real like and I show

I'm spooling up real like and I show
this<00:06:31.720> in<00:06:31.870> my<00:06:31.990> other<00:06:32.200> video<00:06:32.560> I'll<00:06:32.680> put<00:06:32.800> that
