00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.630 
to heal isn't changed typically we use
the<00:02:32.720> number<00:02:32.960> around<00:02:33.320> 12<00:02:33.680> weeks<00:02:33.770> when<00:02:34.520> the

patient's bones have really healed and
the<00:02:37.010> fusion<00:02:37.520> is<00:02:37.640> solid<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:39.080> for<00:02:39.260> many<00:02:39.380> of

we say is an excellent to good result
and<00:03:01.879> that<00:03:02.420> means<00:03:02.689> they're<00:03:02.989> able<00:03:03.139> to<00:03:03.290> return

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:04.219 
and that means they're able to return

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.520 
and that means they're able to return
back<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.670> an<00:03:04.909> active<00:03:05.030> lifestyle<00:03:05.689> they're

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
well certainly having appropriate

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.720 
well certainly having appropriate
training<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:19.300> important<00:03:20.580> experience<00:03:21.580> is

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
training is important experience is

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.620 
training is important experience is
important<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:23.230> would<00:03:23.500> say<00:03:23.770> that<00:03:24.630> they

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
important and I would say that they

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.820 
important and I would say that they
should<00:03:25.810> feel<00:03:25.989> comfortable<00:03:26.230> with<00:03:26.650> their

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
should feel comfortable with their

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.280 
should feel comfortable with their
surgeon<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.580> because<00:03:28.569> this<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.020> major

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
surgeon and because this is a major

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.809 
surgeon and because this is a major
operative<00:03:29.830> procedure<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.520> they<00:03:30.640> should

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
operative procedure and they should

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.130 
operative procedure and they should
obtain<00:03:31.230> more<00:03:32.230> than<00:03:32.380> one<00:03:32.560> opinion<00:03:34.140> regarding

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
obtain more than one opinion regarding

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.900 
obtain more than one opinion regarding
having<00:03:35.590> such<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> surgery

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
having such a surgery

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.370 
having such a surgery
as<00:03:37.209> this<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.640> patient<00:03:40.209> should<00:03:40.480> also<00:03:40.660> feel

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
as this and the patient should also feel

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.620 
as this and the patient should also feel
that<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.950> physician<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.760> interested<00:03:43.569> in

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
that the physician is interested in

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.210 
that the physician is interested in
giving<00:03:43.900> them<00:03:43.989> all<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.290> information<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:45.100> will

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
giving them all the information and will

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.490 
giving them all the information and will
supply<00:03:45.519> it's<00:03:45.880> been<00:03:46.060> adequate<00:03:46.840> time<00:03:47.110> with<00:03:47.319> them

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
supply it's been adequate time with them

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.290 
supply it's been adequate time with them
so<00:03:47.830> that<00:03:47.860> they<00:03:47.980> feel<00:03:48.310> comfortable<00:03:48.580> with<00:03:48.970> their

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
so that they feel comfortable with their

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.570 
so that they feel comfortable with their
decision<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:49.989> that<00:03:50.890> they<00:03:51.040> should<00:03:51.220> not<00:03:51.340> feel

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
decision and that they should not feel

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:58.210 
decision and that they should not feel
rushed<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:52.239> make<00:03:52.390> a<00:03:52.450> decision

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.070 

that<00:03:58.400> El<00:03:58.520> Camino<00:03:58.820> Hospital<00:03:58.990> she<00:03:59.990> had

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
that El Camino Hospital she had

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.440 
that El Camino Hospital she had
sustained<00:04:00.470> an<00:04:00.680> injury<00:04:00.890> at<00:04:01.250> work<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:02.060> as

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
sustained an injury at work and as

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.230 
sustained an injury at work and as
result<00:04:02.780> had<00:04:03.260> an<00:04:03.410> unstable<00:04:03.800> spine<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.610> while

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
result had an unstable spine and while

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.720 
result had an unstable spine and while
she<00:04:05.450> was<00:04:05.600> treated<00:04:05.990> for<00:04:06.170> about<00:04:06.380> a<00:04:06.410> year<00:04:07.160> with

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
she was treated for about a year with

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.360 
she was treated for about a year with
conservative<00:04:08.330> measures<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:08.840> became<00:04:09.110> obvious

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
conservative measures it became obvious

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.310 
conservative measures it became obvious
she<00:04:10.370> was<00:04:10.460> not<00:04:10.610> going<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:10.940> get<00:04:11.120> better<00:04:11.330> and<00:04:11.630> she

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
she was not going to get better and she

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.980 
she was not going to get better and she
ultimately<00:04:12.680> underwent<00:04:13.450> spinal<00:04:14.450> fusion

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
ultimately underwent spinal fusion

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.830 
ultimately underwent spinal fusion
surgery<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.680> has<00:04:16.280> now<00:04:16.459> returned<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.120> work<00:04:17.390> is

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
surgery and has now returned to work is

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.170 
surgery and has now returned to work is
essentially<00:04:18.350> off<00:04:18.470> all<00:04:18.650> medication<00:04:18.829> and<00:04:19.579> is

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
essentially off all medication and is

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.450 
essentially off all medication and is
back<00:04:20.359> in<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.660> gym<00:04:20.870> exercising<00:04:21.829> every<00:04:22.040> day<00:04:22.220> and

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
back in the gym exercising every day and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.770 
back in the gym exercising every day and
so<00:04:23.270> I<00:04:23.570> would<00:04:24.050> say<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.560> more<00:04:24.860> of<00:04:24.890> a<00:04:25.070> typical

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
so I would say that is more of a typical

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:35.640 
so I would say that is more of a typical
rather<00:04:26.780> than<00:04:27.020> an<00:04:27.110> atypical<00:04:27.500> story

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.710
