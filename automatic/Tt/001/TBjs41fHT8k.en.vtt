00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.350
 with you 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.870
 I was training, continue training 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.170
 but I would like you to tell the three 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.129
 hours that follow you so much here in Miami 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.800
 Facebook 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.900
 Instagram on all social networks 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.210
 tell them what you are doing to 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.979
 when what is the new news 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.979
 that has iron socarrás 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.899
 good jairo 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.899
 the straights 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.190
 learning every day what 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.660
 where you learn 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.440
 this is where the fight is won 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.440
 exactly 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.450
 waiting 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.700
 thinking big of course in 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.340
 relationship to that this you come with a 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.170
 career that impressive was opined with 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:58.100
 a chain of local continues with that 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.910
 train I would say in which some 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.570
 and people who stand to gracefully you 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.780
 claw 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.280
 the typical Cuban boxer who can 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.280
 say something good relations 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.590
 and style 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.810
 He's very young since I was 11 years old 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.060
 I was training 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.290
 I focused more on what is position 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.360
 professional 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.330
 my coach likes divers 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.260
 that are technical but aggressive and me 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.330
 I also like that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.720
 but nevertheless you also had a 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.720
 amateur career 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.250
 you will always be more professional than 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.530
 I maintain that it was not 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.900
 first it's dramatic now I understand that 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.750
 you also have the opportunity again of 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.430
 be training with the super champion 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.810
 of the world that means to you then 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.640
 be training with a man like 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.110
 guillermo -second that regardless of 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.660
 anything we have to recognize that 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.400
 he's one of the best boxers out there 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.400
 in this country and in the world 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.960
 great for me that every day 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.790
 or you learn 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.090
 you learn and watching you learn if 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.980
 Business 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.420
 there are things of what 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.330
 I'm running 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.230
 raise it in my style follow the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.520
 my style 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.370
 I like the style 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.320
 tomorrow morning for sure tomorrow Saturday 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.140
 we are going to leave a bit of the part 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.560
 personal because I understand that some 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.709
 I follow 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.170
 visitor to youtube to see fights not 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.910
 only current fights but you're going to 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.370
 see fights from much further back to me 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.170
 you have left surprised these days 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.690
 iron tomorrow fight in a landmark against p 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.430
 Czech 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.100
 what do you think might happen in this 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.440
 type of fight 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.440
 I do not know much 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.440
 but 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.720
 first four world negotiators 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.620
 I do not know the other speaker 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.850
 it is not even collected has 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.420
 I think it's going to be a good fight 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.740
 as long as it's good 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.750
 but 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.289
 the week above also to fight 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.169
 to see another important fight between sergio 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.400
 maravilla martínez and miguel cotto what 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.120
 think 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.120
 jairo socarrás 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.830
 in that fight is I think 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.740
 a lot in the pulseo but I think with 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.270
 everything is 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.350
 up to 147 90 54 is very small of 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.830
 sample 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.970
 physically 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.970
 it's stronger 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.050
 more stuck than photos and I think what 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.050
 I hope 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.250
 We've already become a commentator and 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.320
 come on let's continue with the fight if 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.780
 you want as one of the first 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.820
 important that approach your 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.380
 partner is here sparring and the 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:26.449
 mate the maestro guillermo round and 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.150
 the fight of course erislandy lara 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:31.250
 or the canelo álvarez in general lines 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.699
 what do you think iron socarrás on these two 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.699
 combats 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.730
 what 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.730
 very clear very clear 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.880
 with very smart question 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.860
 it's better than anyone that aspect 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.920
 he is not going to change his style much but 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.920
 I think that 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.750
 in your work 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.810
 and attract another victory here for 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.190
 link 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.190
 Lara beats her to believe 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.010
 he has to make the same plan he did 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.780
 so lara stands still the best he can 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.740
 that see 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.880
 problems the 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.820
 although the canelo pulls hard but you 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.849
 to 4 round 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.830
 from there to there 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.860
 I can not start moving it and working 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.370
 of the straights 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.300
 powerful 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.590
 I think that here we had one of the 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.610
 best commentators that you saw this 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.130
 week 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.100
 good jairo I want to take advantage I do not want 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.750
 leave without you having the opportunity 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.510
 through the lens to send you a 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.210
