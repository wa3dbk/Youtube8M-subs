 in the environment 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.490
 hello youtube euros 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.490
 Here I bring you the second part of Assassin's Creed Revelations 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.019
 in principle I want to tell you that we have a date for the game 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.640
 It is November 15 of this year 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.380
 this time I will talk about everything a bit but especially the multiplayer 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.120
 What does this new game offer us? 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.850
 here I leave a multiplayer trailer 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.200
 it is assumed that in assassin's creed the brotherhood in multiplayer mode we were 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.900
 Templars learning to be murderers 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.970
 because in reveles and ons the players will have more killer skills 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.500
 that of templars 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
 inside video 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:51.330
 low and golden all 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 b 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.259
 6 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.629
 country new types of murders and more weapons 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.599
 we can also choose more scenarios like it is monterrey union and and I think that 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.619
 There will also be the Alhambra de Granada 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.559
 let's move on with another topic 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:35.769
 I want to correct one thing from the other video which was told to me by someone who commented 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.229
 called but invalid 111 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:42.599
 xdd the thing is that I thought 'is not going to constantinople to seek the fruits 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.589
 of Eden 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:47.109
 but it is going to look for the things that its ancestor altair could have done 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.849
 on my channel you have the trailer in which you can see at the end of the video 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.599
 like a bald man who still do not know what his name is he puts a rope on 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.539
 choice 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.409
 If you have played you have enrolled 1 I will know that what you see is more me 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.049
 afp 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.679
 the truth I do not know much about geography 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:07.279
 so I do not know what constantinopla has to do with feki steve farmhouse 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.969
 I'll leave you clinic of the trailer in the description of the video 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.279
 As I told you in the previous video I thought you will have no problem to the 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:16.609
 time to fight 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.799
 with how old it is and do not see how the bastard xdd struggles 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.319
 what piss me off the assassin's is that the first one that is more shit is 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.839
 platinum and the 2 and the brotherhood that are lonely are not 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.739
 if you want give me some idea to make assassin's videos 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:36.939
 tell me something that interests you about this wonderful game and there will be 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.819
 I tell it 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.289
