now<00:00:58.050> back<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.440> forth<00:00:58.620> sort<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> whatever<00:00:59.670> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
now back and forth sort of whatever you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.520 
now back and forth sort of whatever you
want<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.180> guess<00:01:00.480> put<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.719> stuff<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> actually

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
want I guess put the stuff you actually

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.439 
want I guess put the stuff you actually
want<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> access<00:01:02.039> down<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.699> hindsight

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
want to access down here and hindsight

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.240 
want to access down here and hindsight
you<00:01:03.750> could<00:01:03.870> probably<00:01:04.110> put<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> chest<00:01:04.799> down<00:01:04.979> here

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you could probably put a chest down here

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.010 
you could probably put a chest down here
and<00:01:05.430> vil<00:01:05.850> appears<00:01:06.180> i<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.630> could<00:01:06.780> still

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and vil appears i think you could still

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.370 
and vil appears i think you could still
access<00:01:07.500> anvil<00:01:08.400> no<00:01:08.549> problem<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.600> yeah<00:01:10.170> that's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
access anvil no problem but yeah that's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.810 
access anvil no problem but yeah that's
