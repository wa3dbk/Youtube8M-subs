00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
I figured I would make a quick update

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.710 
I figured I would make a quick update
guys<00:00:03.750> I<00:00:04.200> got<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:05.009> almost<00:00:06.000> all<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.299> stuff<00:00:06.540> to

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
guys I got the almost all the stuff to

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.100 
guys I got the almost all the stuff to
do<00:00:06.930> my<00:00:07.109> Fairmont<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:09.120> 240<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.809> getting

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
do my Fairmont and the 240 is getting

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.320 
do my Fairmont and the 240 is getting
there<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.469> I'll<00:00:10.590> do<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> video<00:00:10.889> on<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.330> but

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
there so I'll do a video on that but

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.089 
there so I'll do a video on that but
I've<00:00:12.480> been<00:00:12.599> tuning<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.170> traveling<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.950> doing

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
I've been tuning and traveling and doing

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.450 
I've been tuning and traveling and doing
some<00:00:14.370> other<00:00:14.460> shit<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.540> little<00:00:16.170> bit<00:00:16.289> behind

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
some other shit so a little bit behind

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.620 
some other shit so a little bit behind
but<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> got<00:00:17.820> Moser<00:00:18.750> axles<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:20.600> bought<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
but I got Moser axles and I bought a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.019 
but I got Moser axles and I bought a
northern<00:00:22.320> race<00:00:22.529> cars<00:00:22.830> rear<00:00:23.100> disc<00:00:23.369> brake<00:00:23.699> kit

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
northern race cars rear disc brake kit

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.570 
northern race cars rear disc brake kit
because<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.590> don't<00:00:25.830> want<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.160> c-clip

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
because I don't want to do c-clip

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.599 
because I don't want to do c-clip
eliminator<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.570> break<00:00:27.810> an<00:00:27.960> axle<00:00:28.609> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
eliminator so if I break an axle the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.519 
eliminator so if I break an axle the
disc<00:00:30.000> brakes<00:00:30.300> will<00:00:30.510> stop<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.050> axle<00:00:31.410> from

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
disc brakes will stop the axle from

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.290 
disc brakes will stop the axle from
coming<00:00:31.859> out<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.430> double<00:00:32.850> win<00:00:33.000> it's

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
coming out so it's a double win it's

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.229 
coming out so it's a double win it's
better<00:00:33.540> brakes<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.469> c-clip<00:00:35.250> Eliminator<00:00:35.790> so

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
better brakes and a c-clip Eliminator so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.170 
better brakes and a c-clip Eliminator so
I<00:00:36.540> figured<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.530> hell<00:00:37.739> I'll<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.309> so

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
I figured what the hell I'll do that so

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.490 
I figured what the hell I'll do that so
I<00:00:39.210> got<00:00:39.950> 5<00:00:40.950> lug<00:00:41.190> Mosers<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:42.510> ready<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> go<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
I got 5 lug Mosers all ready to go and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440 
I got 5 lug Mosers all ready to go and
here's<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> only<00:00:44.370> time<00:00:44.579> I've<00:00:44.789> ever<00:00:44.820> had<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.300> do

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
here's the only time I've ever had to do

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.549 
here's the only time I've ever had to do
this<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.739> 5/16<00:00:47.700> pin<00:00:47.989> that<00:00:48.989> goes<00:00:49.020> into<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
this the 5/16 pin that goes into the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.990 
this the 5/16 pin that goes into the
side<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.010> diff<00:00:51.110> focus<00:00:52.219> let's<00:00:53.219> bust<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.820> off

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
side of the diff focus let's bust it off

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.939 
side of the diff focus let's bust it off
never<00:00:54.809> had<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.260> happen<00:00:55.590> before

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
never had this happen before

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.910 
never had this happen before

always feared it oh one cool thing is
these<00:00:59.039> are<00:00:59.100> 355<00:00:59.820> gears<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:00.510> say<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.960> on<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
these are 355 gears they say right on it

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.260 
these are 355 gears they say right on it
me<00:01:02.699> focus<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.420> guy<00:01:03.710> but<00:01:04.939> take<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> look<00:01:06.210> at

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
this to get the pin out oh look what I

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.179 
this to get the pin out oh look what I
had<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.210> pumpkin<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.750> shot<00:01:16.189> but

everything all I got to do is these are
31<00:01:25.229> splines<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> by<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.770> 31<00:01:28.770> spline

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
31 splines so I got a by a 31 spline

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.730 
31 splines so I got a by a 31 spline
Center<00:01:29.460> section<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:30.000> my<00:01:30.180> choice<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:30.810> I'm

got<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.280> an<00:01:50.369> explorer<00:01:50.840> 31<00:01:51.840> spline<00:01:52.079> dogs<00:01:52.530> or

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
got to get an explorer 31 spline dogs or

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.980 
got to get an explorer 31 spline dogs or
I<00:01:52.860> gotta<00:01:53.100> buy<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:54.060> even<00:01:54.659> consider

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
I gotta buy like a I even consider

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.440 
I gotta buy like a I even consider
buying<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.320> spool<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.649> save<00:01:56.070> weight<00:01:56.450> because

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
buying a spool to save weight because

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.389 
buying a spool to save weight because
the<00:01:57.540> spool<00:01:57.810> really<00:01:58.140> isn't<00:01:58.409> expensive<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:59.159> a

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the spool really isn't expensive but a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.429 
the spool really isn't expensive but a
spool<00:01:59.790> has<00:01:59.909> no<00:02:00.119> C<00:02:00.299> clips<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.049> therein
