so<00:00:05.650> here<00:00:05.920> in<00:00:06.160> that<00:00:06.340> means<00:00:06.550> I<00:00:06.760> have<00:00:06.880> an<00:00:07.000> empty

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 
so here in that means I have an empty

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.640 
so here in that means I have an empty
project<00:00:07.479> there<00:00:07.899> is<00:00:07.990> nothing<00:00:08.290> over<00:00:08.380> here

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
project there is nothing over here

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.230 
project there is nothing over here
there's<00:00:08.950> a<00:00:09.010> bufferedreader<00:00:09.460> statement<00:00:10.059> for

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
there's a bufferedreader statement for

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.520 
there's a bufferedreader statement for
taking<00:00:10.480> inter<00:00:10.660> from<00:00:10.780> the<00:00:10.870> user<00:00:11.350> there's

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
taking inter from the user there's

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.530 
taking inter from the user there's
assistant<00:00:11.830> or<00:00:12.190> println<00:00:12.550> which<00:00:12.880> says<00:00:13.120> enter

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:13.540 
assistant or println which says enter

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.419 
assistant or println which says enter
the<00:00:13.750> numbers<00:00:14.019> right<00:00:14.380> the<00:00:14.830> user<00:00:15.009> is<00:00:15.190> gonna

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
the numbers right the user is gonna

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:16.560 
the numbers right the user is gonna
enter<00:00:15.550> something<00:00:15.969> on<00:00:16.059> the<00:00:16.119> right<00:00:16.270> hand<00:00:16.509> side

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
enter something on the right hand side

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.630 
enter something on the right hand side
and<00:00:16.900> that<00:00:16.960> gets<00:00:17.560> stored<00:00:18.009> inside<00:00:18.490> this

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
and that gets stored inside this

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.819 
and that gets stored inside this
variable<00:00:19.029> int<00:00:19.210> a<00:00:19.390> and<00:00:19.689> however<00:00:20.259> here<00:00:20.439> inside

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:20.829 
variable int a and however here inside

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:22.440 
variable int a and however here inside
end<00:00:21.009> B<00:00:21.189> there<00:00:21.369> are<00:00:21.399> two<00:00:21.489> numbers<00:00:21.759> right<00:00:22.300> and

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
end B there are two numbers right and

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.960 
end B there are two numbers right and
now<00:00:23.020> there<00:00:23.619> are<00:00:23.739> no<00:00:23.860> I'm<00:00:24.220> not<00:00:24.279> I'm<00:00:24.640> not<00:00:24.820> using

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
now there are no I'm not I'm not using

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.609 
now there are no I'm not I'm not using
double<00:00:25.360> or<00:00:25.480> float<00:00:25.869> over<00:00:26.050> here<00:00:26.230> because<00:00:26.470> we're

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
double or float over here because we're

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.409 
double or float over here because we're
only<00:00:26.710> talking<00:00:26.919> about<00:00:27.099> integers<00:00:27.550> so<00:00:28.090> let's<00:00:28.270> go

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
only talking about integers so let's go

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.389 
only talking about integers so let's go
ahead<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:28.660> verify<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.989> first<00:00:29.259> condition<00:00:29.770> the

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
ahead and verify the first condition the

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.010 
ahead and verify the first condition the
first<00:00:30.610> thing<00:00:30.759> is<00:00:30.880> both<00:00:31.059> numbers<00:00:31.419> are<00:00:31.509> zero<00:00:31.809> in

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
first thing is both numbers are zero in

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.810 
first thing is both numbers are zero in
that<00:00:32.200> case<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.860> else<00:00:32.980> iam<00:00:33.220> becomes<00:00:33.460> zero

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
that case the else iam becomes zero

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.050 
that case the else iam becomes zero
right<00:00:34.030> so<00:00:34.480> I'm<00:00:34.540> gonna<00:00:34.719> say<00:00:34.870> if<00:00:35.020> a<00:00:36.330> is<00:00:37.330> zero<00:00:38.290> or<00:00:39.060> B

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
right so I'm gonna say if a is zero or B

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.130 
right so I'm gonna say if a is zero or B
is<00:00:40.360> zero<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:42.610> we<00:00:42.670> need<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:43.090> variable<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:43.960> store

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
is zero now we need a variable to store

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.020 
is zero now we need a variable to store
this<00:00:44.380> LCM<00:00:44.860> value<00:00:45.190> right<00:00:45.460> so<00:00:45.640> I'm<00:00:45.730> gonna<00:00:45.880> go

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
this LCM value right so I'm gonna go

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.630 
this LCM value right so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:46.090> and<00:00:46.330> say<00:00:46.750> int<00:00:46.930> LCM<00:00:47.560> equals<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.370> zero

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
ahead and say int LCM equals to zero

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.819 
ahead and say int LCM equals to zero
alright<00:00:49.270> so<00:00:49.750> here<00:00:49.900> I'm<00:00:50.020> gonna<00:00:50.140> say<00:00:50.320> LCM<00:00:50.710> is

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
alright so here I'm gonna say LCM is

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.890 
alright so here I'm gonna say LCM is
zero<00:00:51.040> in<00:00:51.160> that<00:00:51.220> case<00:00:51.310> if<00:00:51.610> both<00:00:51.640> are<00:00:51.910> zero<00:00:52.240> right

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
zero in that case if both are zero right

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.930 
zero in that case if both are zero right
that's<00:00:53.110> one<00:00:53.230> of<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.380> cases<00:00:53.680> this<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:54.730> another

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
that's one of the cases this is another

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.550 
that's one of the cases this is another
case<00:00:55.180> over<00:00:55.420> here<00:00:55.570> if<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.750> guys<00:00:55.870> remember<00:00:56.050> one

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
case over here if you guys remember one

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.110 
case over here if you guys remember one
of<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:57.310> thing<00:00:57.550> is<00:00:57.670> this<00:00:57.850> both<00:00:58.030> the

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
of the the thing is this both the

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.270 
of the the thing is this both the
numbers<00:00:58.360> are<00:00:58.510> saved<00:00:58.780> for<00:00:59.079> and<00:00:59.260> for<00:00:59.470> the<00:00:59.920> LCM

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
numbers are saved for and for the LCM

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.010 
numbers are saved for and for the LCM
equals<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.640> four<00:01:00.850> in<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.090> case<00:01:01.329> so<00:01:01.810> I'm<00:01:01.870> gonna

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
equals to four in that case so I'm gonna

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.610 
equals to four in that case so I'm gonna
say<00:01:02.200> if<00:01:02.380> a<00:01:03.089> equals<00:01:04.089> equals<00:01:04.390> B<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:07.509> LCM<00:01:07.930> is<00:01:08.079> a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
say if a equals equals B the LCM is a

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
say if a equals equals B the LCM is a
right<00:01:09.600> now<00:01:10.600> here's<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.020> weird<00:01:11.500> thing<00:01:11.650> if<00:01:12.460> you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
right now here's the weird thing if you

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.240 
right now here's the weird thing if you
guys<00:01:12.840> probably<00:01:13.840> noticed<00:01:14.200> this<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.010> pretty

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
guys probably noticed this is pretty

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.820 
guys probably noticed this is pretty
weird<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:15.850> this<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.150> actually<00:01:16.479> wrong<00:01:16.780> here<00:01:17.680> if

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
weird and this is actually wrong here if

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.340 
weird and this is actually wrong here if
a<00:01:18.280> is<00:01:18.580> zero<00:01:18.880> or<00:01:19.120> B<00:01:19.479> is<00:01:19.630> zero<00:01:19.900> we<00:01:20.020> are<00:01:20.049> saying<00:01:20.229> the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
a is zero or B is zero we are saying the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.050 
a is zero or B is zero we are saying the
LCM<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:20.770> zero<00:01:21.010> right<00:01:21.159> and<00:01:21.400> here<00:01:21.700> we<00:01:21.850> are<00:01:21.880> saying

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
LCM is zero right and here we are saying

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.820 
LCM is zero right and here we are saying
if<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.360> equals<00:01:22.720> equals<00:01:22.930> V<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.290> LCM<00:01:23.590> is<00:01:23.650> say

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
if a equals equals V the LCM is say

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.890 
if a equals equals V the LCM is say
actually<00:01:24.370> these<00:01:24.820> two<00:01:24.880> conditions<00:01:25.510> are<00:01:25.659> not

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
actually these two conditions are not

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.620 
actually these two conditions are not
distinct<00:01:26.620> think<00:01:27.490> about<00:01:27.760> this<00:01:27.970> zero<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.540> zero

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
distinct think about this zero and zero

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.840 
distinct think about this zero and zero
both<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.470> numbers<00:01:29.710> are<00:01:29.830> equal<00:01:30.040> right<00:01:30.370> so<00:01:30.729> it's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
both the numbers are equal right so it's

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.820 
both the numbers are equal right so it's
gonna<00:01:31.000> run<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.570> because<00:01:32.320> one<00:01:32.650> of<00:01:32.680> the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
gonna run this because one of the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.500 
gonna run this because one of the
numbers<00:01:33.070> is<00:01:33.190> zero<00:01:33.430> and<00:01:33.640> it's<00:01:33.880> also<00:01:34.150> going<00:01:34.450> to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
numbers is zero and it's also going to

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.750 
numbers is zero and it's also going to
run<00:01:34.690> this<00:01:34.900> because<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.830> equals<00:01:36.159> equals<00:01:36.369> B<00:01:36.580> right

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
run this because a equals equals B right

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.880 
run this because a equals equals B right
so<00:01:36.970> that<00:01:37.150> is<00:01:37.270> not<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.810> good<00:01:38.049> programming<00:01:38.500> style

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
so that is not a good programming style

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.859 
so that is not a good programming style
we<00:01:39.070> should<00:01:39.220> have<00:01:39.460> distinct<00:01:40.000> if-else

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
we should have distinct if-else

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.510 
we should have distinct if-else
conditions<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.740> ensure<00:01:41.830> that<00:01:42.010> we<00:01:42.220> don't<00:01:42.369> have

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
conditions to ensure that we don't have

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.430 
conditions to ensure that we don't have
bugs<00:01:42.820> in<00:01:42.970> our<00:01:43.030> program<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:43.840> what<00:01:43.930> I'm<00:01:44.049> gonna<00:01:44.200> do

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
bugs in our program so what I'm gonna do

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.630 
bugs in our program so what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:44.560> I'm<00:01:44.710> going<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:44.920> have<00:01:45.040> an<00:01:45.159> else<00:01:45.340> over<00:01:45.610> here

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
is I'm going to have an else over here

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.060 
is I'm going to have an else over here
instead<00:01:46.080> then<00:01:47.080> if<00:01:47.380> one<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.740> numbers<00:01:47.979> is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
instead then if one of the numbers is

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.500 
instead then if one of the numbers is
not<00:01:48.280> zero<00:01:48.670> then<00:01:48.820> only<00:01:48.909> I'm<00:01:49.150> going<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.360> go<00:01:49.450> ahead

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
not zero then only I'm going to go ahead

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.109 
not zero then only I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:49.720> test<00:01:49.869> for<00:01:50.080> this<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.770> now<00:01:53.920> if<00:01:54.220> both<00:01:54.549> numbers

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
and test for this so now if both numbers

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.300 
and test for this so now if both numbers
are<00:01:55.330> zero<00:01:55.840> so<00:01:56.049> it's<00:01:56.500> going<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.680> be<00:01:56.799> over<00:01:56.979> here<00:01:57.010> a

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
are zero so it's going to be over here a

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.670 
are zero so it's going to be over here a
0<00:01:57.760> or<00:01:57.790> B<00:01:57.909> 0<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.390> LCM<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.630> gonna<00:01:58.810> be<00:01:58.930> 0<00:01:59.170> if<00:01:59.380> both

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
0 or B 0 the LCM is gonna be 0 if both

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.469 
0 or B 0 the LCM is gonna be 0 if both
numbers<00:01:59.710> are<00:02:00.280> not<00:02:00.430> 0<00:02:00.729> then<00:02:00.939> it's<00:02:01.150> going<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.390> go

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
numbers are not 0 then it's going to go

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.030 
numbers are not 0 then it's going to go
ahead<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.750> test<00:02:01.869> for<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.110> equals<00:02:02.409> equals<00:02:02.680> B<00:02:02.890> all

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
ahead and test for a equals equals B all

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.859 
ahead and test for a equals equals B all
right<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:03.549> this<00:02:03.790> condition<00:02:04.030> entire<00:02:04.600> thing

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
right so this condition entire thing

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.810 
right so this condition entire thing
it's<00:02:05.560> gonna<00:02:05.770> come<00:02:06.009> inside<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.549> else

it's gonna come inside this else

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.889 
it's gonna come inside this else

there are three things are not possible
you<00:02:34.239> can<00:02:34.390> have<00:02:34.510> three<00:02:34.750> types<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.079> numbers

you can have three types of numbers

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.979 
you can have three types of numbers
right<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.620> can<00:02:35.739> have<00:02:35.829> four<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.190> five<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:37.840> can

right you can have four and five you can

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.360 
right you can have four and five you can

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
have five and four as the two numbers

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.130 
have five and four as the two numbers
you<00:02:40.030> can<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.299> five<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.629> five<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.049> two

you can have five and five as the two
numbers<00:02:41.440> right<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.159> case<00:02:42.400> five<00:02:43.090> and

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
numbers right so in this case five and

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.119 
numbers right so in this case five and
five<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:43.659> have<00:02:43.780> tested<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.290> equals<00:02:44.650> equals<00:02:44.890> B

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
five we have tested a equals equals B

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.770 
five we have tested a equals equals B
over<00:02:45.159> here<00:02:45.370> otherwise<00:02:46.120> there<00:02:46.390> are<00:02:46.480> other<00:02:46.599> two

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
over here otherwise there are other two

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.210 
over here otherwise there are other two
conditions<00:02:47.230> we<00:02:47.290> can<00:02:47.379> say<00:02:47.560> something<00:02:48.099> like

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
conditions we can say something like

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.880 
conditions we can say something like
this<00:02:48.430> else<00:02:48.790> if<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:52.209> see<00:02:52.450> four<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.989> five<00:02:53.560> that

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
this else if you see four and five that

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.800 
this else if you see four and five that
those<00:02:54.099> are<00:02:54.340> our<00:02:54.459> two<00:02:54.670> numbers<00:02:54.849> then<00:02:55.599> in<00:02:55.720> that

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
those are our two numbers then in that

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.569 
those are our two numbers then in that
case<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.590> less<00:02:56.769> than<00:02:56.829> B<00:02:57.129> right<00:02:57.310> there<00:02:57.489> are

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
case a is less than B right there are

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.699 
case a is less than B right there are
only<00:02:57.730> three<00:02:58.030> things<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.329> can<00:02:58.480> happen

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
only three things that can happen

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.630 
only three things that can happen
otherwise<00:02:59.730> it's<00:03:00.730> pretty<00:03:00.940> obvious<00:03:02.459> since<00:03:03.459> is

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
otherwise it's pretty obvious since is

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.390 
otherwise it's pretty obvious since is
neither<00:03:04.269> equals<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.900> B<00:03:05.079> it's<00:03:05.560> no<00:03:05.829> less<00:03:06.069> than<00:03:06.250> B

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
neither equals to B it's no less than B

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.979 
neither equals to B it's no less than B
that<00:03:06.579> means<00:03:06.760> it's<00:03:06.879> greater<00:03:07.359> than<00:03:07.569> B<00:03:07.720> right

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
that means it's greater than B right

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.539 
that means it's greater than B right
that's<00:03:08.319> going<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> be<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.799> last<00:03:08.950> else<00:03:09.280> over

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
that's going to be the last else over

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.559 
that's going to be the last else over
here<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:12.220> at<00:03:12.340> this<00:03:12.430> point<00:03:12.640> we<00:03:12.909> have<00:03:13.030> completely

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
here so at this point we have completely

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.940 
here so at this point we have completely
divided<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.019> program<00:03:14.319> into<00:03:14.560> our<00:03:14.590> set<00:03:14.829> of

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
divided the program into our set of

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.770 
divided the program into our set of
conditions<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:15.730> now<00:03:15.849> let's<00:03:16.090> go<00:03:16.269> ahead<00:03:16.299> put<00:03:16.750> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
conditions so now let's go ahead put the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.869 
conditions so now let's go ahead put the
LCM<00:03:17.170> for<00:03:17.200> each<00:03:17.470> case<00:03:17.709> now<00:03:18.040> here<00:03:18.250> if<00:03:18.489> a<00:03:18.670> less

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
LCM for each case now here if a less

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.369 
LCM for each case now here if a less
than<00:03:18.909> B<00:03:19.060> now<00:03:19.659> again<00:03:19.930> we<00:03:20.079> talked<00:03:20.260> about

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
than B now again we talked about

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.900 
than B now again we talked about
different<00:03:20.620> things<00:03:20.950> over<00:03:21.069> here<00:03:21.250> four<00:03:21.730> and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
different things over here four and

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.640 
different things over here four and
seven<00:03:22.120> can<00:03:22.389> be<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.630> two<00:03:22.720> numbers<00:03:23.049> four<00:03:23.620> and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
seven can be the two numbers four and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.140 
seven can be the two numbers four and
eight<00:03:23.950> can<00:03:24.190> be<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.400> two<00:03:24.489> numbers<00:03:24.790> right<00:03:24.970> but

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
eight can be the two numbers right but

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.409 
eight can be the two numbers right but
if<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:25.780> see<00:03:25.959> this<00:03:26.109> case<00:03:26.349> B<00:03:27.340> which<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.910> 8<00:03:28.090> a

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
if you see this case B which is 8 a

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.069 
if you see this case B which is 8 a
which<00:03:29.079> is<00:03:29.230> 4<00:03:29.470> right<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:30.340> 8<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.389> multiple<00:03:31.989> of

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
which is 4 right this 8 is a multiple of

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.039 
which is 4 right this 8 is a multiple of
4<00:03:32.139> right<00:03:32.859> so<00:03:33.129> what<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.400> do<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.669> first<00:03:33.970> we<00:03:34.120> take

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
4 right so what we do is first we take

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.710 
4 right so what we do is first we take
the<00:03:35.230> bigger<00:03:35.440> number<00:03:35.799> B<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.579> we<00:03:37.150> test<00:03:37.359> for<00:03:37.450> this

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
the bigger number B and we test for this

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.569 
the bigger number B and we test for this
condition<00:03:38.049> whether<00:03:38.769> there<00:03:38.980> are<00:03:39.010> multiples<00:03:39.459> of

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
condition whether there are multiples of

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.729 
condition whether there are multiples of
each<00:03:39.819> other<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.299> I'm<00:03:40.569> going<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:40.810> take<00:03:40.930> B<00:03:41.169> that

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
each other so I'm going to take B that

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.170 
each other so I'm going to take B that
is<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.919> bigger<00:03:42.099> number<00:03:42.160> divide<00:03:42.849> that<00:03:42.970> by<00:03:43.150> the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
is the bigger number divide that by the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.819 
is the bigger number divide that by the
smaller<00:03:43.510> number<00:03:43.780> take<00:03:44.019> the<00:03:44.139> remainder<00:03:44.500> if

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
smaller number take the remainder if

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.189 
smaller number take the remainder if
it's<00:03:45.220> perfectly<00:03:45.699> divisible<00:03:46.030> 8<00:03:46.510> by<00:03:46.780> 4<00:03:47.049> the

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
it's perfectly divisible 8 by 4 the

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.990 
it's perfectly divisible 8 by 4 the
remainder<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.620> gonna<00:03:47.769> be<00:03:47.889> 0<00:03:48.190> so<00:03:48.579> in<00:03:48.699> that<00:03:48.819> case

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
remainder is gonna be 0 so in that case

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.339 
remainder is gonna be 0 so in that case
I'm<00:03:49.120> going<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.329> put<00:03:49.449> the<00:03:49.540> remainder<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:49.870> 0<00:03:50.230> and

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
I'm going to put the remainder of 0 and

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.569 
I'm going to put the remainder of 0 and
check<00:03:50.650> if<00:03:50.859> that<00:03:51.099> is<00:03:51.220> going<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.430> happen

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
check if that is going to happen

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.500 
check if that is going to happen
otherwise<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:54.459> now<00:03:54.609> if<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.060> take<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.299> numbers

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
otherwise so now if you take the numbers

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.119 
otherwise so now if you take the numbers
4<00:03:55.780> &amp;<00:03:55.930> 8<00:03:56.109> they<00:03:56.440> are<00:03:56.530> going<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.739> fall<00:03:56.889> in<00:03:57.010> this

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
4 &amp; 8 they are going to fall in this

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.009 
4 &amp; 8 they are going to fall in this
category<00:03:57.190> if<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:57.819> take<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.060> numbers<00:03:58.299> 4<00:03:58.629> &amp;<00:03:58.780> 7

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
category if you take the numbers 4 &amp; 7

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.270 
category if you take the numbers 4 &amp; 7
they're<00:03:59.650> gonna<00:03:59.769> fall<00:03:59.980> in<00:04:00.099> this<00:04:00.220> category

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
they're gonna fall in this category

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.750 
they're gonna fall in this category
because<00:04:01.169> 7<00:04:02.169> is<00:04:02.319> not<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.620> multiple<00:04:02.919> of<00:04:03.129> 4<00:04:03.370> right

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
because 7 is not a multiple of 4 right

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.369 
because 7 is not a multiple of 4 right
so<00:04:03.910> here<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.449> LCM<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:04.989> going<00:04:05.169> to<00:04:05.230> be<00:04:05.290> the

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
so here the LCM is going to be the

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.650 
so here the LCM is going to be the
bigger<00:04:05.590> number<00:04:05.980> which<00:04:06.250> is<00:04:06.370> B<00:04:06.579> simply<00:04:07.239> write<00:04:07.480> in

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
bigger number which is B simply write in

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.750 
bigger number which is B simply write in
this<00:04:08.079> else<00:04:08.319> part<00:04:08.410> what<00:04:09.220> we<00:04:09.340> are<00:04:09.430> going<00:04:09.549> to<00:04:09.639> do

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
this else part what we are going to do

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.039 
this else part what we are going to do
is<00:04:09.970> something<00:04:10.209> I'm<00:04:10.449> going<00:04:10.569> to<00:04:10.629> do<00:04:10.720> in<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.840> next

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
is something I'm going to do in the next

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.990 
is something I'm going to do in the next
vid<00:04:11.199> not<00:04:11.500> knock<00:04:11.680> so<00:04:12.220> here<00:04:12.430> let<00:04:12.669> me<00:04:12.699> go<00:04:12.970> ahead

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
vid not knock so here let me go ahead

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.839 
vid not knock so here let me go ahead
again<00:04:13.750> in<00:04:13.900> the<00:04:13.989> else<00:04:14.139> part<00:04:14.410> here<00:04:14.769> this<00:04:15.519> bigger

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
again in the else part here this bigger

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.810 
again in the else part here this bigger
else<00:04:16.199> so<00:04:17.199> remember<00:04:17.560> if<00:04:17.739> they<00:04:18.099> equals<00:04:18.400> equals<00:04:18.609> B

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
else so remember if they equals equals B

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.789 
else so remember if they equals equals B
is<00:04:18.880> one<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.120> them<00:04:19.299> if<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.900> is<00:04:20.049> less<00:04:20.229> than<00:04:20.410> B<00:04:20.739> is

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
is one of them if a is less than B is

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.279 
is one of them if a is less than B is
the<00:04:20.949> other<00:04:21.070> one<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.630> greater<00:04:22.630> than<00:04:22.720> B<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:23.110> the

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
the other one a greater than B is the

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.320 
the other one a greater than B is the
third<00:04:23.500> one<00:04:23.710> right<00:04:23.860> so<00:04:24.310> here<00:04:24.580> in<00:04:24.849> this<00:04:25.120> case

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
third one right so here in this case

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.000 
third one right so here in this case
what<00:04:25.539> is<00:04:25.659> happening<00:04:25.690> is<00:04:26.349> you<00:04:26.590> have<00:04:26.620> numbers

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
what is happening is you have numbers

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.480 
what is happening is you have numbers
like<00:04:27.039> 8<00:04:27.310> 4<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:29.169> have<00:04:29.260> numbers<00:04:29.560> like<00:04:29.620> 8<00:04:29.919> 5

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
like 8 4 you have numbers like 8 5

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.040 
like 8 4 you have numbers like 8 5
something<00:04:30.699> like<00:04:30.819> this<00:04:30.940> if<00:04:31.330> you<00:04:31.630> see<00:04:31.750> this<00:04:31.900> one

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
something like this if you see this one

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.839 
something like this if you see this one
a<00:04:32.199> is<00:04:32.229> always<00:04:32.500> bigger<00:04:32.860> than<00:04:33.009> B<00:04:33.160> in<00:04:33.280> this<00:04:33.430> else

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
a is always bigger than B in this else

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.150 
a is always bigger than B in this else
condition<00:04:34.210> all<00:04:34.660> right<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.319> if<00:04:35.410> you<00:04:35.440> take<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.800> as

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
condition all right so if you take a as

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.059 
condition all right so if you take a as
8<00:04:36.490> B<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.180> 4<00:04:37.389> here<00:04:37.569> if<00:04:37.720> you<00:04:37.810> observe<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.949> an

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
8 B is 4 here if you observe a is an

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.370 
8 B is 4 here if you observe a is an
exact<00:04:39.550> multiple<00:04:39.849> of<00:04:40.270> B<00:04:40.449> right<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:41.050> again<00:04:41.289> you

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
exact multiple of B right so again you

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.870 
exact multiple of B right so again you
have<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.560> check<00:04:41.590> for<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.039> same<00:04:42.430> condition

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
have to check for the same condition

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.550 
have to check for the same condition
over<00:04:43.060> here<00:04:43.240> by<00:04:43.479> putting<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:43.900> if<00:04:44.139> else<00:04:44.349> over

over here by putting this if else over
here<00:04:44.590> right<00:04:44.919> however<00:04:45.729> if<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:46.000> take<00:04:46.150> the

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
here right however if you take the

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.460 
here right however if you take the
bigger<00:04:46.479> number<00:04:46.780> which<00:04:46.930> is<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.229> over<00:04:47.380> here

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
bigger number which is a over here

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.830 
bigger number which is a over here
smaller<00:04:48.280> number<00:04:48.580> is<00:04:48.729> B<00:04:48.970> over<00:04:49.180> here<00:04:49.360> which<00:04:49.810> is

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
smaller number is B over here which is

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.800 
smaller number is B over here which is
your<00:04:50.289> numbers<00:04:50.590> 8<00:04:50.800> your<00:04:51.460> number<00:04:51.699> 4<00:04:51.970> take<00:04:52.599> them

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
your numbers 8 your number 4 take them

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.900 
your numbers 8 your number 4 take them
divide<00:04:53.710> them<00:04:53.919> find<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.280> remainder<00:04:54.520> if<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:54.789> is

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
divide them find a remainder if that is

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.670 
divide them find a remainder if that is
equal<00:04:55.060> to<00:04:55.270> 0<00:04:55.569> then<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:55.900> or<00:04:55.960> LCM<00:04:56.289> is<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.470> bigger

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
equal to 0 then a or LCM is the bigger

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.860 
equal to 0 then a or LCM is the bigger
number<00:04:56.770> which<00:04:57.220> is<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.550> right<00:04:57.910> otherwise<00:04:58.599> if<00:04:58.810> you

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
number which is a right otherwise if you

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.390 
number which is a right otherwise if you
are<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.020> numbers<00:04:59.229> like<00:04:59.349> 8<00:04:59.500> &amp;<00:04:59.710> 5<00:04:59.860> which<00:05:00.190> are<00:05:00.310> not

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
are the numbers like 8 &amp; 5 which are not

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.860 
are the numbers like 8 &amp; 5 which are not
multiples<00:05:00.910> of<00:05:01.000> each<00:05:01.120> other<00:05:01.300> we<00:05:01.449> go<00:05:01.599> inside

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
multiples of each other we go inside

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.960 
multiples of each other we go inside
this<00:05:01.960> else<00:05:02.229> part<00:05:02.349> right<00:05:02.770> so<00:05:03.370> this<00:05:03.639> else<00:05:03.880> part

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
this else part right so this else part

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.059 
this else part right so this else part
we<00:05:04.210> have<00:05:04.300> an<00:05:04.360> IC<00:05:04.539> in<00:05:04.599> the<00:05:04.659> next<00:05:04.900> vid<00:05:05.139> so<00:05:05.800> let<00:05:05.949> me

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
we have an IC in the next vid so let me

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.379 
we have an IC in the next vid so let me
go<00:05:06.220> ahead<00:05:06.370> first<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:06.729> test<00:05:07.000> this<00:05:07.150> for<00:05:07.300> the

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
go ahead first and test this for the

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.029 
go ahead first and test this for the
basic<00:05:07.720> conditions<00:05:08.169> which<00:05:08.319> we<00:05:08.500> have<00:05:08.710> derived

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
basic conditions which we have derived

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.040 
basic conditions which we have derived
so<00:05:09.159> far<00:05:09.490> and<00:05:09.699> see<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.330> LCM<00:05:10.630> is<00:05:10.659> working

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
so far and see the LCM is working

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.020 
so far and see the LCM is working
perfectly<00:05:11.500> it's<00:05:12.039> a<00:05:12.159> complex<00:05:12.460> program<00:05:12.849> I<00:05:12.970> know

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
perfectly it's a complex program I know

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.700 
perfectly it's a complex program I know
that<00:05:13.330> but<00:05:13.630> if<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.810> guys<00:05:13.960> see<00:05:14.199> the<00:05:14.319> complete

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
that but if you guys see the complete

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.960 
that but if you guys see the complete
video<00:05:15.009> or<00:05:15.159> you<00:05:15.250> can<00:05:15.400> watch<00:05:15.520> this<00:05:15.699> over<00:05:15.849> and
