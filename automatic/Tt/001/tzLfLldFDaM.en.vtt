data<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.159> electrical<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.600> 12<00:01:51.780> o'clock

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
data for electrical on your 12 o'clock

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.960 
data for electrical on your 12 o'clock
wall<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:53.040> specific<00:01:53.490> enough<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
wall that's not specific enough for the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.280 
wall that's not specific enough for the
contractor<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> electrician's<00:01:55.049> going<00:01:55.229> to

contractor the electrician's going to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.209 
contractor the electrician's going to
come<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.680> they're<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> find

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
come out and they're just going to find

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.030 
come out and they're just going to find
somewhere<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:57.270> put<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> cab<00:01:58.170> or<00:01:58.439> sorry<00:01:58.950> to

somewhere to put in the cab or sorry to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.620 
somewhere to put in the cab or sorry to
put<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.280> those<00:01:59.430> outlets<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.119> these<00:02:00.240> cabinets

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
put in those outlets and these cabinets

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.690 
put in those outlets and these cabinets
aren't<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:00.960> first<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.860> so

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
aren't here first so they don't know so

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.160 
aren't here first so they don't know so
something<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.540> learned<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.020> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
something we learned on this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.560 
something we learned on this
installation<00:02:04.759> was<00:02:05.759> if<00:02:05.909> you're<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.360> put

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
installation was if you're going to put

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.470 
installation was if you're going to put
in<00:02:06.719> cabinets

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
in cabinets

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.360 
in cabinets
want<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.840> have<00:02:08.020> their<00:02:08.200> your<00:02:08.440> wires<00:02:08.650> down<00:02:09.040> low

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.370 
want to have their your wires down low

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.100 
want to have their your wires down low
you<00:02:09.760> have<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.360> tell<00:02:10.540> electrician

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
you have to tell electrician

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.690 
you have to tell electrician
specifically<00:02:11.800> where<00:02:12.040> this<00:02:12.190> is<00:02:12.340> going<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.580> go

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
specifically where this is going to go

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.660 
specifically where this is going to go
so<00:02:12.940> if<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.090> know<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.300> cabinet<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:14.430> about<00:02:15.430> six

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
so if you know this cabinet is about six

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.910 
so if you know this cabinet is about six
foot<00:02:15.850> so<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.270> about<00:02:16.450> six<00:02:16.840> foot<00:02:17.020> or<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.320> you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
foot so this is about six foot or so you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.470 
foot so this is about six foot or so you
have<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.160> tell<00:02:18.340> him<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.550> want<00:02:18.790> those<00:02:18.940> those

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
have to tell him you want those those

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.600 
have to tell him you want those those
outlets<00:02:19.780> coming<00:02:20.200> in<00:02:20.320> at<00:02:20.470> about<00:02:20.560> six<00:02:21.220> foot<00:02:21.430> five

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
outlets coming in at about six foot five

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.280 
outlets coming in at about six foot five
inches<00:02:21.970> or<00:02:22.180> somewhere<00:02:22.570> in<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.690> wall<00:02:22.930> partner

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
inches or somewhere in that wall partner

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.020 
inches or somewhere in that wall partner
so<00:02:23.860> at<00:02:23.920> least<00:02:24.010> everything<00:02:24.340> matches<00:02:24.820> up<00:02:24.910> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
so at least everything matches up the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.520 
so at least everything matches up the
more<00:02:25.210> specific<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.840> are<00:02:25.900> in<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.140> front<00:02:26.380> end

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
more specific you are in the front end

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.810 
more specific you are in the front end
the<00:02:26.680> left's<00:02:26.980> you're<00:02:27.130> gonna<00:02:27.220> have<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.520> try<00:02:27.790> to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
the left's you're gonna have to try to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.120 
the left's you're gonna have to try to
correct<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.360> main<00:02:28.510> long<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:30.400> also<00:02:30.550> went<00:02:30.880> with

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
correct the main long we also went with

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.190 
correct the main long we also went with
in<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.250> second<00:02:33.580> space<00:02:33.760> we<00:02:34.660> got<00:02:34.780> rid<00:02:34.960> of<00:02:35.020> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
in the second space we got rid of the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.170 
in the second space we got rid of the
two<00:02:35.350> drawers<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.950> were<00:02:36.040> right<00:02:36.190> here<00:02:36.520> we<00:02:37.060> used

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
two drawers that were right here we used

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.270 
two drawers that were right here we used
to<00:02:37.240> have<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:37.390> flip<00:02:37.630> out<00:02:37.780> thing<00:02:38.140> which<00:02:38.290> would

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
to have this flip out thing which would

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.710 
to have this flip out thing which would
make<00:02:39.430> room<00:02:39.610> for<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.850> sliding<00:02:40.090> cabinet<00:02:40.600> for

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
make room for the sliding cabinet for

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.570 
make room for the sliding cabinet for
the<00:02:40.810> hygienist<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.650> put<00:02:41.830> their<00:02:42.010> cabinet<00:02:42.400> or

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
the hygienist to put their cabinet or

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.790 
the hygienist to put their cabinet or
unit<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.690> we<00:02:43.840> decided<00:02:44.110> just<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.470> do<00:02:44.620> away

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
unit on but we decided just a do away

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.990 
unit on but we decided just a do away
with<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.980> cabinet<00:02:45.370> door<00:02:45.550> because<00:02:45.730> we<00:02:45.850> would

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
with the cabinet door because we would

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.580 
with the cabinet door because we would
slide<00:02:46.270> down<00:02:46.300> that<00:02:46.720> cabinet<00:02:47.110> door<00:02:47.320> it's<00:02:47.560> a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
slide down that cabinet door it's a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.890 
slide down that cabinet door it's a
little<00:02:47.800> flip<00:02:47.980> down<00:02:48.300> then<00:02:49.300> we<00:02:49.360> have<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.540> extra

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
little flip down then we have that extra

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.540 
little flip down then we have that extra
space<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.290> really<00:02:50.470> wasn't<00:02:50.620> shelf<00:02:50.950> space<00:02:51.130> and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
space it really wasn't shelf space and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.770 
space it really wasn't shelf space and
you<00:02:51.640> know<00:02:51.730> everyone<00:02:52.090> would<00:02:52.210> hit<00:02:52.390> their<00:02:52.540> leg

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
you know everyone would hit their leg

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.750 
you know everyone would hit their leg
against<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:53.740> so<00:02:53.890> we<00:02:53.980> just<00:02:54.010> left<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.460> open

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
against this so we just left it open

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.610 
against this so we just left it open
course<00:02:55.690> there's<00:02:55.810> not<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.930> cabin<00:02:56.290> on<00:02:56.410> there

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
course there's not a cabin on there

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.620 
course there's not a cabin on there
right<00:02:56.770> now<00:02:56.980> but<00:02:57.370> when<00:02:57.850> we<00:02:57.880> do<00:02:58.060> have<00:02:58.240> one<00:02:58.420> it'll

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
right now but when we do have one it'll

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.370 
right now but when we do have one it'll
just<00:02:58.750> be<00:02:58.840> easier<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.290> access<00:02:59.500> and<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:01.380> easier

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
just be easier to access and just easier

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.150 
just be easier to access and just easier
for<00:03:02.470> everyone<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.740> use

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
for everyone to use

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.580 
for everyone to use
he<00:03:04.000> also<00:03:04.120> knows<00:03:04.360> were<00:03:04.540> trying<00:03:05.230> out<00:03:05.350> these

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
he also knows were trying out these

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.970 
he also knows were trying out these
things<00:03:05.800> these<00:03:06.100> backless<00:03:06.670> chairs<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.980> the

things these backless chairs the the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.950 
things these backless chairs the the
hygienists<00:03:09.520> trying<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.210> not<00:03:10.360> they<00:03:10.510> liked<00:03:10.750> them

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
hygienists trying to not they liked them

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.100 
hygienists trying to not they liked them
I'm<00:03:11.560> kind<00:03:11.770> of<00:03:11.830> still<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.910> could<00:03:13.660> take<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:13.930> or

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
I'm kind of still I could take it or

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.390 
I'm kind of still I could take it or
leave<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.260> either<00:03:14.440> way<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.860> jury's<00:03:15.130> still<00:03:15.160> out

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
leave it either way the jury's still out

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.800 
leave it either way the jury's still out
on<00:03:15.459> whether<00:03:15.580> or<00:03:15.820> not<00:03:15.910> we<00:03:16.060> like<00:03:16.240> it<00:03:16.390> long<00:03:16.570> term

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
on whether or not we like it long term

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.860 
on whether or not we like it long term
but<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.740> smaller<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.480> does<00:03:19.630> kind<00:03:19.810> of

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
but it is smaller and it does kind of

square kind of overlapping rectangles

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.190 
square kind of overlapping rectangles
and<00:04:22.030> what's<00:04:22.240> nice<00:04:22.390> is<00:04:22.570> when<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.780> patient<00:04:22.960> is

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200

monitor fountain on that track with this

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.790 
monitor fountain on that track with this
particular<00:04:48.790> system<00:04:49.030> we<00:04:49.360> found<00:04:49.750> out<00:04:49.960> that<00:04:50.230> it

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
particular system we found out that it

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.130 
particular system we found out that it
can't<00:04:51.070> have<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.669> large<00:04:52.000> amount<00:04:52.210> or<00:04:52.930> they<00:04:53.050> don't

can't have a large amount or they don't

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.320 
can't have a large amount or they don't
make<00:04:53.350> one<00:04:53.380> for<00:04:53.770> this<00:04:53.950> track<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:54.490> instead<00:04:54.760> we're

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
make one for this track so instead we're

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.820 
make one for this track so instead we're
having<00:04:55.600> one<00:04:55.810> foot<00:04:56.020> in<00:04:56.080> it's<00:04:56.380> not<00:04:56.470> install

having one foot in it's not install

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.020 
having one foot in it's not install
again<00:04:57.040> we're<00:04:57.370> just<00:04:57.490> gonna<00:04:57.580> have<00:04:57.730> a<00:04:57.760> straight

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.440 
again we're just gonna have a straight
pull<00:04:58.360> coming<00:04:58.900> down<00:04:59.050> off<00:04:59.230> of<00:04:59.260> that<00:04:59.620> beam<00:04:59.860> oh

that in if you look at the other
operatories<00:05:10.780> it's<00:05:11.050> just<00:05:11.350> that<00:05:11.650> trying<00:05:11.919> to

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
operatories it's just that trying to

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.620 
operatories it's just that trying to
just<00:05:12.160> flat<00:05:12.370> up<00:05:12.550> against<00:05:12.850> that<00:05:12.970> ceiling<00:05:13.390> tile

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
just flat up against that ceiling tile

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.140 
just flat up against that ceiling tile
so<00:05:14.500> we<00:05:14.650> went<00:05:14.830> with<00:05:14.860> that<00:05:14.979> to<00:05:15.400> makes<00:05:15.850> it<00:05:15.970> look<00:05:16.120> a

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
so we went with that to makes it look a

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.000 
so we went with that to makes it look a
little<00:05:16.210> bit<00:05:16.360> nicer<00:05:16.510> how<00:05:16.840> pops<00:05:17.140> the<00:05:17.440> ceiling

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
little bit nicer how pops the ceiling

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.810 
little bit nicer how pops the ceiling
down<00:05:18.160> increasing<00:05:18.760> a<00:05:18.820> little<00:05:18.910> space<00:05:19.270> oh<00:05:20.820> and

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
down increasing a little space oh and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.550 
down increasing a little space oh and
one<00:05:22.000> last<00:05:22.150> thing<00:05:22.360> when<00:05:23.140> you're<00:05:23.260> putting<00:05:23.440> in

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
one last thing when you're putting in

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.100 
one last thing when you're putting in
these<00:05:23.650> pass-through<00:05:24.130> cabinets<00:05:24.780> we<00:05:25.780> ran<00:05:25.960> into

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
these pass-through cabinets we ran into

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.530 
these pass-through cabinets we ran into
an<00:05:26.290> issue<00:05:26.440> with<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.700> installation<00:05:28.390> guide

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
an issue with the installation guide

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.530 
an issue with the installation guide
equipment<00:05:29.500> got<00:05:29.590> cleaning<00:05:29.919> this<00:05:30.070> again<00:05:30.550> too

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
equipment got cleaning this again too

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.130 
equipment got cleaning this again too
far<00:05:32.940> too<00:05:33.940> far<00:05:34.120> down<00:05:34.270> you<00:05:34.690> should<00:05:34.840> put<00:05:35.050> it

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
far too far down you should put it

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.790 
far too far down you should put it
somewhat<00:05:35.440> up<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.310> room<00:05:36.640> for<00:05:37.410> the<00:05:38.410> hips

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
somewhat up to the room for the hips

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.520 
somewhat up to the room for the hips
notice<00:05:39.100> this<00:05:39.310> hinge<00:05:39.580> is<00:05:39.990> smaller<00:05:40.990> than<00:05:41.350> that

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
notice this hinge is smaller than that

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.380 
notice this hinge is smaller than that
answer<00:05:41.979> that<00:05:42.130> we<00:05:42.520> want<00:05:42.760> him<00:05:42.850> to<00:05:42.970> have<00:05:43.120> three

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
answer that we want him to have three

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.779 
answer that we want him to have three
big<00:05:43.630> ones<00:05:43.680> but<00:05:44.680> we've<00:05:44.770> got<00:05:44.890> two<00:05:45.039> big<00:05:45.220> ones<00:05:45.370> and

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
big ones but we've got two big ones and

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.490 
big ones but we've got two big ones and
a<00:05:46.000> smaller<00:05:46.330> one<00:05:46.630> now<00:05:46.840> let<00:05:46.990> me<00:05:47.020> assure<00:05:47.169> me<00:05:47.470> that

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
a smaller one now let me assure me that

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.140 
a smaller one now let me assure me that
this<00:05:47.800> will<00:05:48.010> be<00:05:48.160> strong<00:05:48.460> enough<00:05:48.580> to<00:05:48.700> hold<00:05:48.940> this

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
this will be strong enough to hold this

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.750 
this will be strong enough to hold this
up<00:05:49.419> but<00:05:50.260> I<00:05:50.289> would<00:05:50.710> have<00:05:51.010> liked<00:05:51.220> to<00:05:51.250> have<00:05:51.580> this

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
up but I would have liked to have this

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.940 
up but I would have liked to have this
thing<00:05:52.000> up<00:05:52.180> but<00:05:52.539> after<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.169> fact<00:05:53.380> they<00:05:53.650> can't

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
thing up but after the fact they can't

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.500 
thing up but after the fact they can't
come<00:05:54.130> back<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:54.310> move<00:05:54.940> it<00:05:55.060> because<00:05:55.210> of<00:05:55.450> the

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
come back and move it because of the

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.840 
come back and move it because of the
back<00:05:55.690> units<00:05:56.080> that's<00:05:56.890> behind<00:05:57.160> here<00:05:57.490> at<00:05:57.700> least

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
back units that's behind here at least

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:58.980 
back units that's behind here at least
that's<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.270> reason

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
that's the reason

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.860 
that's the reason
so<00:05:59.620> again<00:06:00.310> have<00:06:00.639> to<00:06:00.789> be<00:06:00.880> specific<00:06:01.539> you'd<00:06:01.690> think

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
so again have to be specific you'd think

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.090 
so again have to be specific you'd think
with<00:06:02.139> putting<00:06:02.440> in<00:06:02.530> all<00:06:02.650> these<00:06:02.740> installations

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
with putting in all these installations

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.129 
with putting in all these installations
they<00:06:03.520> wouldn't<00:06:03.789> know<00:06:03.880> but<00:06:04.300> when<00:06:04.930> you're<00:06:05.080> in

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
they wouldn't know but when you're in

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:06.779 
they wouldn't know but when you're in
the<00:06:05.199> middle<00:06:05.410> of<00:06:05.440> this<00:06:05.560> you<00:06:05.800> have<00:06:05.889> to<00:06:05.949> be

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
the middle of this you have to be

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.029 
the middle of this you have to be
specific<00:06:06.910> with<00:06:07.360> them<00:06:07.740> well<00:06:08.740> look<00:06:08.830> at<00:06:08.919> some

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
specific with them well look at some

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.120 
specific with them well look at some
other<00:06:09.190> items<00:06:09.430> here<00:06:09.550> in<00:06:09.610> just<00:06:09.699> a<00:06:09.819> second
