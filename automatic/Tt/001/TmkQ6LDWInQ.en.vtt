00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.250
 today we are going to talk about the legend of a 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.580
 carnivorous plant capable of eating a being 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.379
 human and we talk about the snake tree 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.930
 from a tree that had some roots 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.540
 able to catch any living thing 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.510
 and today we're going to talk specifically about 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.570
 this plant is called ya I see you like this is 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.059
 as she was nicknamed by the people who saw her in 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.850
 central america south america and the 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.190
 coasts of the Indian Ocean 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.710
 we find references for example in 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.460
 a bagwell book of the end of the century 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.640
 19 in which the fauna is shown 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.850
 and flora of that of certain places 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.979
 not so in this description in this 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.909
 book we found some data 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.670
 interesting to start and to start 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.920
 this plant would be of a 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.259
 of a diameter quite enough 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.260
 quite large would have a very trunk 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.550
 thick and some branches 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.620
 in the form of tendrils or branches 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.950
 able to fold and move to 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.770
 catch any living being that's how 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.420
 define the yacht I see a kind of 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.200
 Legend that has arrived to our days 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.520
 about the existence of a plant with 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.590
 interesting trunk would not be a kind 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.300
 of plant with a trunk extremely 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.730
 short that is with features 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.109
 similar to a tree but being 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:59.469
 considered as if it were a plant 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:02.180
 It really is something many doubters and 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.770
 I also doubt it 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.479
 delia I see you there is no real evidence 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.810
 surely it is an exaggeration of the 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.250
 natives of the old time because good 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.070
 nowadays it has been shown that there 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.740
 species in those in those same habitats 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.830
 of Central America and South America that 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.440
 they reach 35 centimeters and even 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.270
 in some cases half a meter and can 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.940
 get to ingest even small 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.430
 mammals like they can be birds so 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.670
 so much the safest thing is that it was a 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.670
 exaggeration 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.470
 in the end there has not been any 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.510
 death in modern times there has not been 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.580
 no corpse that has been found in 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.340
 the tree of this type in a plant 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.030
 this guy does not until there's no evidence 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.180
 conclusive I leave this video here 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.069
 so good if you discover any 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.620
 new information if you have something that 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.010
 contribute anything you already know what 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.910
 you can do here in the section of 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.910
