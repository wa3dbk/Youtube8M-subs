all<00:04:23.270> right<00:04:23.419> so<00:04:23.540> she<00:04:23.600> obviously<00:04:23.720> won't<00:04:24.110> start

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
all right so she obviously won't start

I'll<00:04:25.820> tear<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.120> carb<00:04:26.360> up<00:04:26.510> apart<00:04:28.210> get<00:04:29.210> a

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
I'll tear that carb up apart get a

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.530 
I'll tear that carb up apart get a
battery<00:04:29.540> charge<00:04:29.780> around<00:04:29.900> here<00:04:30.970> so<00:04:31.970> this<00:04:32.360> is

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
battery charge around here so this is

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.530 
battery charge around here so this is
the<00:04:32.630> newest<00:04:32.870> edition<00:04:33.290> guys<00:04:33.790> so<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:35.060> think<00:04:35.270> we'll

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
this isn't the original engine it's at

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.920 
this isn't the original engine it's at
94<00:04:49.610> oh<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:54.110> would<00:04:54.260> like<00:04:54.380> focus<00:04:54.770> on<00:04:54.889> it

no spark no spark I mean she turns over
and<00:05:12.500> everything<00:05:15.910> just<00:05:16.910> no<00:05:17.060> spark<00:05:17.389> and<00:05:21.010> um<00:05:22.010> so<00:05:22.700> I

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
and everything just no spark and um so I

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.330 
and everything just no spark and um so I
have<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.030> diagnose<00:05:23.450> that<00:05:23.720> tomorrow<00:05:24.340> hopefully

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340
