hello and welcome to feed be situations

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.030 
hello and welcome to feed be situations
where<00:00:06.960> i<00:00:07.109> show<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.410> all<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.710> wonderful

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
where i show you all the wonderful

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.100 
where i show you all the wonderful
things<00:00:08.130> i've<00:00:08.370> made<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.700> feed<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.030> beast<00:00:09.240> today

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
things i've made in feed the beast today

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.270 
things i've made in feed the beast today
we're<00:00:10.349> going<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.590> be<00:00:10.800> looking<00:00:10.920> at<00:00:11.130> something

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
we're going to be looking at something

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.160 
we're going to be looking at something
of<00:00:11.429> her<00:00:11.550> plants<00:00:11.910> inception<00:00:12.300> born<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.780> that's

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
of her plants inception born and that's

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.340 
of her plants inception born and that's
a<00:00:13.259> large<00:00:13.469> feeding<00:00:14.130> system<00:00:14.780> so<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.020> idea<00:00:16.109> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
a large feeding system so the idea of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.470 
a large feeding system so the idea of
centrifuging<00:00:17.100> lava<00:00:17.310> into<00:00:17.699> copper<00:00:18.119> tin

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
centrifuging lava into copper tin

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.200 
centrifuging lava into copper tin
electrum<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.289> tungsten<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.859> not<00:00:20.640> really<00:00:20.970> new

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
electrum and tungsten is not really new

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.570 
electrum and tungsten is not really new
concepts<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.960> feed<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> beast<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:22.890> I've<00:00:23.220> been

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
concepts in feed the beast but I've been

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.300 
concepts in feed the beast but I've been
waiting<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.090> long<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.170> episode<00:00:26.010> I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
waiting so long to do this the episode I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.509 
waiting so long to do this the episode I
just<00:00:26.550> decided<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.810> get<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.260> over<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.590> okay

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
just decided do it get it over with okay

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.919 
just decided do it get it over with okay
then<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.880> looking<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.330> actual<00:00:30.480> design

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
then on to looking at the actual design

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.930 
then on to looking at the actual design
I<00:00:31.170> wanted<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> make<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> modular<00:00:32.520> layout<00:00:32.759> for

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
I wanted to make a modular layout for

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.459 
I wanted to make a modular layout for
the<00:00:33.000> system<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.780> be<00:00:33.899> scaled<00:00:34.110> up<00:00:34.260> or

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
the system so it can be scaled up or

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.720 
the system so it can be scaled up or
down<00:00:34.649> depending<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:35.250> how<00:00:35.340> much<00:00:35.430> power<00:00:35.670> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
down depending on how much power you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.030 
down depending on how much power you
have<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.030> put<00:00:36.180> into<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> system<00:00:36.770> this<00:00:37.770> setup

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
have to put into the system this setup

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.940 
have to put into the system this setup
requires<00:00:38.809> 4006<00:00:39.809> run<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.350> that's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.680> fairly

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
requires 4006 run and that's a fairly

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.950 
requires 4006 run and that's a fairly
reasonable<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:41.940> slightly<00:00:42.149> over<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> top

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
reasonable if not slightly over the top

a single lava fabricator and centrifuge

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.250 
a single lava fabricator and centrifuge
pair<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> will<00:00:57.660> build<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
pair this is what you will build up to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.439 
pair this is what you will build up to
make<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.859> system<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.210> lava

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
make this system here the lava

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.270 
make this system here the lava
fabricator<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.260> manufacturing<00:01:01.800> reload<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
fabricator from manufacturing reload it

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.549 
fabricator from manufacturing reload it
is<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.579> generates<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.000> lava<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:04.290> better

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
is what generates the lava it's better

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.160 
is what generates the lava it's better
than<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.769> magma<00:01:05.100> crucible<00:01:05.750> because<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.020> only

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
than a magma crucible because it's only

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.170 
than a magma crucible because it's only
requires<00:01:07.650> energy<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.130> run<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.790> also<00:01:08.939> take

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
requires energy to run and can also take

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.200 
requires energy to run and can also take
EU<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.229> MJ<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.939> energy

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
EU not just MJ and the energy

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.969 
EU not just MJ and the energy
requirements<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.930> very<00:01:13.080> similar<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.650> both

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
requirements are very similar for both

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
requirements are very similar for both
of<00:01:14.250> them<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.509> more<00:01:15.659> energy<00:01:15.840> into

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
of them but if you put more energy into

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.160 
of them but if you put more energy into
a<00:01:16.740> lava<00:01:17.009> fabricator<00:01:17.549> up<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> maximum<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
a lava fabricator up to a maximum of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.340 
a lava fabricator up to a maximum of
1080<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.159> tick<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.909> output<00:01:21.299> more<00:01:21.810> lava

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
1080 you tick it can output more lava

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.460 
1080 you tick it can output more lava
overall<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:24.180> idea<00:01:24.450> then<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.200> pull

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
overall the idea then is that you pull

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.260 
overall the idea then is that you pull
the<00:01:25.560> lava<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.520> side<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.030> lava

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the lava out of the side of the lava

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.719 
the lava out of the side of the lava
fabricator<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.250> into<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> top<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.640> an

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
fabricator and into the top of an

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.399 
fabricator and into the top of an
industrial<00:01:29.939> centrifuge<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.930> lava<00:01:31.170> then

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
industrial centrifuge the lava then

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.560 
industrial centrifuge the lava then
builds<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.009> slot<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.729> then<00:01:33.360> one

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
builds up in this slot here and then one

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.149 
builds up in this slot here and then one
of<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> 16<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.680> will<00:01:34.920> start

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
of the 16 of it it will start

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.880 
of the 16 of it it will start
centrifuging<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.180> takes<00:01:36.420> around<00:01:36.960> eight

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
centrifuging and it takes around eight

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.039 
centrifuging and it takes around eight
minutes<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.369> 20<00:01:38.700> seconds<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.270> produce<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
minutes and 20 seconds to produce the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.889 
minutes and 20 seconds to produce the
metals<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.939> I've<00:01:41.939> also<00:01:42.210> decided<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.720> use

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
metals for you I've also decided to use

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.990 
metals for you I've also decided to use
applied<00:01:43.560> energistic<00:01:43.920> through<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> setup<00:01:44.640> and

this thing here the import boss is

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.460 
this thing here the import boss is
simply<00:01:48.119> pulling<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.659> items<00:01:48.930> out<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
simply pulling the items out of the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.300 
simply pulling the items out of the
centrifuge<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.759> into<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.240> chest<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:52.310> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
centrifuge and into this chest here the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.100 
centrifuge and into this chest here the
power<00:01:53.549> given<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.090> system<00:01:54.450> also<00:01:54.659> needs<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
power given to the system also needs to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.600 
power given to the system also needs to
be<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.320> low<00:01:55.500> voltage<00:01:55.920> otherwise<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
be in low voltage otherwise the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.330 
be in low voltage otherwise the
centrifuges<00:01:57.210> will<00:01:57.390> explode<00:01:58.009> it<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.130> possible

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
centrifuges will explode it is possible

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.069 
centrifuges will explode it is possible
now<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.700> add<00:01:59.939> transform<00:02:00.420> upgrades<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
now to add transform upgrades to the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.499 
now to add transform upgrades to the
centrifuges<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.040> along<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:02.790> overclockers

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
centrifuges and along with overclockers

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.840 
centrifuges and along with overclockers
so<00:02:04.259> feel<00:02:04.500> free<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.890> add<00:02:04.979> these<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.820> want

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
so feel free to add these in if you want

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.880 
so feel free to add these in if you want
to<00:02:06.240> do<00:02:06.600> something<00:02:06.810> else<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.229> them<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.740> you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
to do something else with them what you

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.160 
to do something else with them what you
make<00:02:08.099> but<00:02:09.030> be<00:02:09.149> warned<00:02:09.569> overclocked

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
make but be warned overclocked

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.470 
make but be warned overclocked
centrifuges<00:02:10.860> will<00:02:11.250> require<00:02:11.670> an<00:02:11.940> awful<00:02:12.390> lot

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
centrifuges will require an awful lot

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.960 
centrifuges will require an awful lot
more<00:02:12.690> power<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.110> run

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970
