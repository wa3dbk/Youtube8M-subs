00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
were using my zoom h1 which I finally

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.830 
were using my zoom h1 which I finally
found<00:01:40.619> my<00:01:41.630> micro<00:01:42.630> SD<00:01:43.020> card<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.619> I'm<00:01:43.680> all<00:01:43.829> set<00:01:43.860> up

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
found my micro SD card so I'm all set up

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.870 
the reason that I sound like that right
now<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.930> mic<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.380> facing<00:01:49.880> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
now is because the mic is facing the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.820 

all<00:02:49.660> right<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.050> think<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.620> there's

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
all right so I think that there's

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.440 
all right so I think that there's
something<00:02:51.070> wrong<00:02:51.370> with<00:02:51.520> my<00:02:51.700> audio<00:02:51.940> file<00:02:52.270> I

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
something wrong with my audio file I

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.090 
something wrong with my audio file I

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
don't think it sounded that loud as

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.060 
don't think it sounded that loud as
another<00:02:54.370> track<00:02:54.790> that<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.060> played<00:02:55.390> earlier<00:02:56.070> from

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
another track that I played earlier from

another track that I played earlier from

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.870 
Spotify but the Bluetooth speaker is
pretty<00:02:59.080> loud<00:02:59.290> it's<00:03:00.190> not<00:03:00.340> gonna<00:03:00.520> blow<00:03:00.760> your

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
pretty loud it's not gonna blow your

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.850 
pretty loud it's not gonna blow your
socks<00:03:00.940> off<00:03:01.450> or<00:03:01.660> anything<00:03:01.840> like<00:03:01.990> that<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.800> can

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
socks off or anything like that you can

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.320 
socks off or anything like that you can
also<00:03:03.100> hear<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.490> a<00:03:03.580> little<00:03:03.820> bit<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.060> bass

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
and I think that for a small little

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.530 
and I think that for a small little
family<00:03:06.400> got<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:06.880> salary

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
music to go along with it

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.130
