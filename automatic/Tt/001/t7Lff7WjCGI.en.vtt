00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
for the shots arms my weight will

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.959 
for the shots arms my weight will
slightly<00:00:36.120> shift<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.630> my<00:00:36.750> back<00:00:36.960> foot<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.969> and

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
slightly shift in my back foot and and

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.850 
slightly shift in my back foot and and
that's<00:00:39.180> quite<00:00:39.510> normal<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:39.930> me<00:00:40.200> everybody's<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
that's quite normal for me everybody's a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.220 
that's quite normal for me everybody's a
little<00:00:41.040> different<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.850> me<00:00:42.000> that's<00:00:42.899> quite

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
little different but for me that's quite

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.799 
little different but for me that's quite
normal<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.730> got<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.690> do

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
normal and I think it's got a bit to do

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.060 
normal and I think it's got a bit to do
with<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.050> fact<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.350> bow<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.800> fairly
