00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.450
 polo side jia no doubt a very subject 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.479
 interesting 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.690
 but unfortunately according to more and 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.450
 the more technology advances, the 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.660
 disinterest of the people 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.789
 and I do not blame them nowadays since the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.060
 comfort of your room and with a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.419
 budget practically nil maybe 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.520
 only comparable to the proportional cost of 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.689
 the rent of your internet service by 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.820
 a day or even for a couple of hours 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.390
 you can create the best evidence or 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.239
 allows you to upload it to the internet and wait 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.370
 Sitting while enjoying your drink 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.010
 favorite or the video game of your 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.219
 predilection 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.339
 After a few hours hundreds and thousands 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.789
 of people around the world will give 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.280
 for real a home project while you 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.190
 laugh out loud from the comfort of 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.489
 your armchair 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.090
 it's true ufology is losing 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.059
 credibility 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.370
 and these fed by charlatans who 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.690
 come in the modified corpse of a child 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.690
 to an extraterrestrial being 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.820
 videos with animations made with cg and 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:19.789
 flood the internet and the cases of 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.610
 jia forum of yore little by little go 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.190
 being displaced 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.370
 I love the old school of 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.920
 biology and when I found out about the case that 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.610
 Today I come to present you I knew that 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.760
 such an exciting subject is still in force 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.860
 it happens that a few days ago a 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.950
 French conspiracy magazine 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.800
 published an article quite nourished and 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.350
 detailed of what would come to be one of 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.010
 the most important and best cases 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.360
 Documented from the field of ecology 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:59.300
 such well and maybe that a little bit of 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.680
 exaggerated but I can compare this case 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.860
 with others like the one of roswell the battle 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.240
 of the angels or even the most famous 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.240
 Â½ bill case 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.790
 It was a sunny day in the month of March 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.239
 1971 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.730
 the ss climb an attack submarine of 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.519
 Sturgeon class was traveling 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.709
 the seas very close to iceland and the 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.120
 island of mayenne belonging to norway 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.849
 in the Atlantic Ocean 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.000
 this during a military mission and 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.580
 scientific lotina and whose admiral 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.840
 on board at that time he responded to 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.260
 name of the kingdom 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.920
 what seemed to be a routine day and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.010
 even boring became something that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.040
 this crew never forget it 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.099
 while the officer and I chemistry 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.410
 preparing to comb the area saw what 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.069
 through the periscope it would stay 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.769
 recorded for life and very much despite 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.620
 he was in a panic he decided 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.200
 not only inform your superior but that 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.420
 he could calm down enough to 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.799
 take a camera and register so 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.370
 graphic what before his eyes seemed like a 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.370
 lie 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.580
 what you are seeing on the screen are the 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.590
 original photographs that were 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.590
 scanned and sent anonymously 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.170
 the aforementioned magazine 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.480
 The quality of the photographs is 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.910
 done pretty good taking in 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.760
 considering the age of the same and 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.430
 go that in ufology is very common to see 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.620
 blurred photos or focused manu 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.140
 but do not forget the fact that the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.450
 military technology will always be more 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.750
 advanced compared to the one you have 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.750
 at home 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.630
 the ss at 674 is the number of 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.740
 official classification that was given to 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.320
 uss that trap and official records 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.840
 seem to endorse this case because in a 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.930
 report mentioned that said submarine 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.820
 with Admiral ibrahim he boarded us 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.229
 done if it was in the area 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.229
 described on the same dates 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.510
 and if all this were not enough, some 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.610
 ufologists speculate that in fact what 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.530
 witnessed the uss crew that 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.470
 climb on that day was a battle 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.540
 colossal between alien spaceships I know 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.480
 that this argument sounds very exaggerated 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.330
 but they do not defend when doing 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.970
 emphasis on details that maybe some 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.090
 you have already noticed and that for the eye 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.550
 trained did not go unnoticed the 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.730
 immense amount of smoke that envelops 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.830
 the unidentified flying objects 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:05.130
 maybe product of generated explosions 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.950
 when receiving opposite fire and since 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.650
 we talk about fire in fact is reached to 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.080
 appreciate what seem to be flames 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.700
 coming out of the fuselage of one of these 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.700
 ships of electric forms 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.560
 another hypothesis that would help the 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.680
 argument of a possible war between 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.069
 UFOs is the fact that in the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.650
 photographs appear various ships what 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.479
 that would indicate that it was not just a UFO what 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:41.780
 who saw that day the admiral of 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.780
 kingdoms and overpopulation of ivss trepan 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:48.479
 with certain if you believe that a battle 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:52.110
 between UFOs is indicated is a 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:54.430
 pretty crazy panorama yet 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.390
 inside the eye 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:01.180
 what would you think if I told you that in fact 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:04.660
 there is an antecedent of this case and that 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:08.310
 happened just over 400 years ago in the 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.310
 skies of nuremberg germany 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.560
 I hope this video was of your 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:19.950
 Total pleasure if it was like that let me know 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:23.400

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:32.860
 do you think they might be interested 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:35.460
 for today has been everything we will see in the 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.460
 next video
