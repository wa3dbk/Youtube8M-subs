ahead and open this right here where
should<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.239> believe<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.959> up<00:03:22.319> one<00:03:22.530> side

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.290 

and<00:03:33.390> this<00:03:34.390> time<00:03:34.629> I<00:03:34.690> got<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.080> white<00:03:35.319> one<00:03:35.560> I

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
and this time I got the white one I

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.820 
and this time I got the white one I
wanted<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:37.480> make<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:37.930> little<00:03:38.080> bit<00:03:38.290> different

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
wanted to make it a little bit different

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.780 
wanted to make it a little bit different
and<00:03:39.239> well<00:03:40.239> for<00:03:40.510> my<00:03:40.629> glance<00:03:40.900> this<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:42.069> this<00:03:42.610> is

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
and well for my glance this I this is

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.420 
and well for my glance this I this is
actually<00:03:43.209> heavier<00:03:43.599> than<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.930> first<00:03:44.230> one<00:03:44.500> even

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
actually heavier than the first one even

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.610 
actually heavier than the first one even
though<00:03:45.640> it's<00:03:46.390> been<00:03:46.569> claimed<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.379> has<00:03:47.590> the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
though it's been claimed that it has the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.979 
though it's been claimed that it has the
same<00:03:48.569> hardware<00:03:49.569> as<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:51.180> first<00:03:52.180> cool<00:03:52.540> Apple

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
same hardware as the first cool Apple

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.620 
same hardware as the first cool Apple
that<00:03:53.739> I<00:03:53.830> well<00:03:54.459> not<00:03:54.640> not<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.030> first<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.480> coup

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
that I well not not the first the coup

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.890 
that I well not not the first the coup
Apple<00:03:55.959> v5<00:03:56.410> without<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.160> 3g<00:03:57.640> but<00:03:58.480> this<00:03:58.660> one

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
Apple v5 without the 3g but this one

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.720 
Apple v5 without the 3g but this one
feels<00:03:59.519> much<00:04:00.750> heavier<00:04:01.750> okay<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.580> i<00:04:05.190> think<00:04:06.190> this

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
feels much heavier okay so i think this

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.940 
feels much heavier okay so i think this
one<00:04:06.940> already<00:04:07.150> comes<00:04:07.569> with<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:08.110> Apple<00:04:08.680> back

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
one already comes with the Apple back

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.160 
one already comes with the Apple back
