 Anton Ponomareva 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.080
 Zinetula Bilyaletdinov already under the gun 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
 and here the head coach of the team 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 Russia is much more complicated than the usual 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.380
 the side today he is carefully picking up 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.599
 words explained to reporters why 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 left for less than a year ago overseas 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.989
 Valery Nishushkin his included in the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.120
 olympic team 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.989
 better performing in the same place you found 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.790
 alexander semina 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.690
 which is this time to the main team 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.930
 I did not get the country I understand that this is a player 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.879
 difficult but not played as we wanted 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.160
 would you and i think that what i saw in 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.870
 what I watched on TV video 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.960
 watched 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.350
 well i saw the corrector drag i saw well i 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.170
 I think that Paris is such an energy so 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.390
 wish i think i need 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.250
 discussion of this decision was almost 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.560
 overshadowed the issue of 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.210
 captain and but the choice of this nominee as 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.520
 once it was easy in one voice all 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.860
 Basically it said there is no crockery 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.140
 only we players even expressed themselves 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.740
 this daddy what he should be 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.680
 captain wipe his opinions matched 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.770
 I know that he basically him usually 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.259
 position no longer want me and such 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.330
 positions you don't want to hear 15 players from 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.229
 national hockey league 10 out 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.360
 continental 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.009
 it is the strongest at the moment composition 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.140
 confident coach on goalkeeper position 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.740
 varlamov's seeds will be insured by sergey 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.110
 bobrovsky 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.240
 And Alexander Eremenko He according to Belle 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.759
 single turned out to be better than others 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.069
 contenders Koshechkin and Barulin not 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.319
 entered into the composition and Denis not Kalinin not 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.690
 potter will not invite all better 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.240
 KHL scorers Sergey Mozyakin Danis 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.069
 Venus zaripov staged but in Sochi they 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.860
 also will not play tactical 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.560
 I can't take players for reasons 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.810
 which is an attacking plan but it is just 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.289
 impossible because he was still there 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.090
 play in the minority and even 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.580
 count there we have three pairs only those 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.050
 who will play the dream is not Tarasenko 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.470
 not 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.770
 nihushkina they do not play dreams and no one 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.959
 plays no ovechkin there is no either malkin 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.300
 hit the so-called master list 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.040
 the coach did not hide his emotions to Victor 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.170
 Tikhonov 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.239
 I wanted to scream from happiness Nikolay 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.030
 the tuber said it was ready to play any 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.349
 positions Evgeny Malkin promised to go on 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.930
 peak form for the Olympiad 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.049
 Ovechkin is going to go to Sochi only 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.700
 beyond the gold zone of special attention 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.620
 possible standard bearer of the Russian team 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.230
 at the opening ceremony of the games Ilya Kovalchuk 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.689
 the coaching staff have already announced the player 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.480
 will be able to speak to this position too 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:55.269
 you release ilya kovalchuk to the opening 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.680
 and the floor is in this serious load 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:07.540
 physical lowered combat clone and what 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:09.879
 which one starts not letting go I'm two 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.040
 90 times really mean u seriously 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.739
 emotional floor yes because to us 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.470
 come in advance and so on but the game is with us 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.359
 13 to the remark that the Russian team 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.400
 do not consider favorite and Georgia Tula 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.079
 Bilyaletdinov answered then better 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.480
 let this extra motivate 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.250
 hockey players questions about any other 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.919
 a result that does not imply 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.079
 rewarding and podium remained unanswered 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.329
 now everything is configured only on 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.430
 maximum result and the one by sea 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.430
 caterpillars or overseas first channel
