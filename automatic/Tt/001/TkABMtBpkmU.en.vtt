00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.599 

so<00:00:05.290> now<00:00:05.439> we're<00:00:05.620> on<00:00:05.680> the<00:00:05.799> verse<00:00:05.950> section<00:00:06.399> which

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:06.609 
so now we're on the verse section which

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.580 
so now we're on the verse section which
is<00:00:06.759> actually<00:00:06.970> not<00:00:07.720> that<00:00:07.779> difficult<00:00:07.990> if

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
is actually not that difficult if

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.410 
is actually not that difficult if
remember<00:00:09.070> the<00:00:09.160> Maxwell<00:00:09.610> tutorial<00:00:10.059> that<00:00:10.180> I<00:00:10.209> did

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
remember the Maxwell tutorial that I did

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.699 
remember the Maxwell tutorial that I did
a<00:00:10.450> few<00:00:10.599> months<00:00:10.750> ago<00:00:10.930> it's<00:00:11.289> pretty<00:00:11.530> much<00:00:11.650> the

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:11.709 
a few months ago it's pretty much the

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.919 
a few months ago it's pretty much the
same<00:00:11.950> thing<00:00:12.010> where<00:00:12.490> the<00:00:13.210> scale<00:00:13.540> is<00:00:13.719> going<00:00:13.750> to

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929 
same thing where the scale is going to

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.540 
same thing where the scale is going to
all<00:00:14.110> be<00:00:14.139> in<00:00:14.559> the<00:00:15.059> black<00:00:16.059> keys<00:00:16.419> or<00:00:16.689> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
all be in the black keys or the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.570 
all be in the black keys or the
accidentals<00:00:18.550> so<00:00:19.240> it's<00:00:19.660> not<00:00:19.750> too<00:00:19.960> difficult<00:00:20.580> so

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
accidentals so it's not too difficult so

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.839 
accidentals so it's not too difficult so
basically<00:00:22.539> in<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:23.830> left<00:00:24.340> hand<00:00:24.609> you're<00:00:24.820> going

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
basically in the left hand you're going

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.179 
basically in the left hand you're going
to<00:00:25.000> have<00:00:25.090> two<00:00:25.359> primary<00:00:26.109> chords<00:00:26.769> how<00:00:27.039> you're

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
to have two primary chords how you're

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.400 
to have two primary chords how you're
going<00:00:27.310> to<00:00:27.429> use<00:00:27.460> it's<00:00:28.420> going<00:00:28.570> to<00:00:28.630> be<00:00:28.720> T<00:00:28.929> sharp<00:00:29.230> in

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
going to use it's going to be T sharp in

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.520 
going to use it's going to be T sharp in
a<00:00:29.560> sharp<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.920> then<00:00:32.920> d<00:00:33.339> sharp<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:33.790> G<00:00:33.910> sharp

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
a sharp and then d sharp and G sharp

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.600 
a sharp and then d sharp and G sharp
that's<00:00:35.530> all<00:00:35.710> you're<00:00:35.860> really<00:00:35.890> got<00:00:36.190> doing<00:00:36.549> the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
that's all you're really got doing the

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:55.150 
that's all you're really got doing the
left<00:00:36.790> hand<00:00:37.089> for<00:00:37.839> the<00:00:37.960> uverse<00:00:38.199> section

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.529 

so<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.609> know<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.969> play<00:00:57.179> with<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> rhythm

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
so you know you can play with the rhythm

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.540 
so you know you can play with the rhythm
look<00:00:57.839> a<00:00:58.050> little<00:00:58.350> bit<00:00:58.589> in<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:58.859> left<00:00:59.039> hand<00:00:59.250> for

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
look a little bit in the left hand for

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.240 
look a little bit in the left hand for
this<00:00:59.670> section<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.859> did<00:01:01.859> because<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:05.070> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
this section I did because you can you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:16.930 
this section I did because you can you
have<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> option<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.850> its<00:01:06.659> own<00:01:07.320> keyboard<00:01:08.119> so

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:27.030 

so<00:01:17.940> I<00:01:17.970> played<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.390> real<00:01:18.690> slow<00:01:18.899> for<00:01:19.229> you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.620 

you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.690 

so<00:01:34.630> really<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.740> best<00:01:35.890> way<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.130> go<00:01:36.280> about<00:01:36.310> this

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
so really the best way to go about this

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.380 
so really the best way to go about this
is<00:01:36.910> just<00:01:37.120> know<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.420> words<00:01:37.630> or<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:39.220> know<00:01:39.390> play

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
is just know the words or you know play

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.790 
is just know the words or you know play
along<00:01:40.510> this<00:01:40.840> song<00:01:43.170> because<00:01:44.170> that's<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.620> best

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
along this song because that's the best

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.270 
along this song because that's the best
way<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:44.980> go<00:01:45.100> about<00:01:45.130> these<00:01:45.430> lyrics

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.910 

you

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.050 

so<00:02:00.229> with<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.680> mind<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:02.640> think<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.909> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so with that in mind just think of it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.600 
so with that in mind just think of it
everything<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.470> downward<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.130> this

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
everything is going downward in this

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.620 
everything is going downward in this
case<00:02:07.190> it's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.340> real<00:02:08.520> smooth<00:02:08.819> song<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.420> just

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
case it's a real smooth song so just

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.520 
case it's a real smooth song so just
think<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:09.840> Joe<00:02:10.170> Joe's<00:02:10.560> voice<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.580> keys

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:38.090 

you

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.350 

so<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.250> was<00:02:39.370> basically<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.760> entire<00:02:39.910> first

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
so that was basically the entire first

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.930 
so that was basically the entire first
section<00:02:40.780> not<00:02:40.900> just<00:02:41.110> played<00:02:41.290> for<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.650> well<00:02:42.610> not

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
section not just played for you well not

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.440 
section not just played for you well not
the<00:02:43.090> entire<00:02:43.120> verse<00:02:43.720> section<00:02:45.240> but<00:02:46.240> that's

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
the entire verse section but that's

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.450 
the entire verse section but that's
pretty<00:02:46.690> much<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:46.960> for<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.830> first<00:02:48.070> verse<00:02:48.250> at

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
pretty much it for the first verse at

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.190 
pretty much it for the first verse at
least<00:02:48.610> when<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.150> second<00:02:49.780> verse<00:02:49.870> sounds

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
least when the second verse sounds

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.020 
least when the second verse sounds
pretty<00:02:50.380> much<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.620> same<00:02:50.770> too<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.760> when<00:02:51.940> we<00:02:52.000> put

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
pretty much the same too so when we put

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:21.050 
pretty much the same too so when we put
both<00:02:52.360> hands<00:02:52.540> together

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.170 

so<00:03:22.290> when<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.380> go<00:03:23.560> as<00:03:24.340> soon<00:03:24.490> as<00:03:24.610> you<00:03:24.730> hit<00:03:24.849> this<00:03:24.970> d

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
so when you go as soon as you hit this d

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.780 
so when you go as soon as you hit this d
sharp<00:03:25.420> right<00:03:25.660> here<00:03:26.489> you're<00:03:27.489> going<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.700> hit

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
sharp right here you're going to hit

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.300 
sharp right here you're going to hit
this

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.470 

d<00:03:30.880> sharp<00:03:31.209> G<00:03:31.510> sharp<00:03:31.540> right<00:03:31.989> here<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.970> once<00:03:34.360> again

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
d sharp G sharp right here so once again

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
d sharp G sharp right here so once again
for<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.870> top

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.790 

once<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.620> do<00:03:43.770> this<00:03:44.010> d<00:03:44.640> sharp<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.090> F<00:03:45.180> sharp

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
once you do this d sharp and F sharp

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.860 
once you do this d sharp and F sharp
rotation<00:03:46.800> right<00:03:46.950> here<00:03:47.190> that's<00:03:48.060> when<00:03:48.270> this<00:03:48.390> dng

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
rotation right here that's when this dng

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.260 
rotation right here that's when this dng
sharp<00:03:49.140> in<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.349> left<00:03:49.530> comes<00:03:49.920> into<00:03:50.130> play

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:11.910 

you

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.640 

so<00:04:12.790> with<00:04:13.240> this<00:04:13.360> base<00:04:13.599> hand<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:14.319> can<00:04:14.470> add

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
so with this base hand you can add

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.150 
so with this base hand you can add
different<00:04:15.450> variations<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:17.160> it's

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
different variations to it it's

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.300 
different variations to it it's
limitless<00:04:18.579> basically<00:04:19.239> so<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:20.190> was<00:04:21.190> just

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
limitless basically so I was just

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.909 
limitless basically so I was just
showing<00:04:21.519> how<00:04:21.790> you<00:04:21.820> can<00:04:21.970> vary<00:04:22.660> that<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.680> base
