product in the background to this video
there<00:00:24.360> is<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.690> to<00:00:24.780> be<00:00:24.810> some<00:00:25.020> gameplay<00:00:25.470> of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
there is going to be some gameplay of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.680 
there is going to be some gameplay of
the<00:00:25.890> capture<00:00:26.250> card<00:00:26.280> and<00:00:26.640> i<00:00:27.030> will<00:00:27.210> be<00:00:27.240> able<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
the capture card and i will be able to

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.660 
the capture card and i will be able to
compare<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.350> to<00:00:28.440> the<00:00:28.530> roxio<00:00:28.949> game<00:00:29.039> capture<00:00:29.280> HD

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
compare it to the roxio game capture HD

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.029 
compare it to the roxio game capture HD
pro<00:00:30.270> which<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> very<00:00:31.110> similar<00:00:31.440> capture<00:00:31.860> card

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039 
pro which is a very similar capture card

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.290 
pro which is a very similar capture card
so<00:00:32.399> you'll<00:00:32.520> be<00:00:32.640> able<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> quality

so you'll be able to see the quality

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.540 
so you'll be able to see the quality
difference<00:00:33.649> also<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:35.069> people<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.519> don't

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
difference also for people that don't

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.340 
difference also for people that don't
know<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.359> the<00:00:36.480> product<00:00:36.719> i<00:00:36.809> currently<00:00:37.289> use

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
know this is the product i currently use

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.040 
know this is the product i currently use
to<00:00:37.649> record<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.100> xbox<00:00:38.569> the<00:00:39.569> first<00:00:39.809> positive

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
to record the xbox the first positive

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.049 
to record the xbox the first positive
point<00:00:40.499> i<00:00:40.620> believe<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.159> hop<00:00:41.399> hug<00:00:41.609> is<00:00:41.909> it

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
point i believe for the hop hug is it

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.239 
point i believe for the hop hug is it
does<00:00:42.239> actually<00:00:42.390> contain<00:00:42.899> over<00:00:43.140> cables<00:00:43.800> so

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249 
does actually contain over cables so

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:45.380 
does actually contain over cables so
will<00:00:44.429> mean<00:00:44.609> you<00:00:44.640> won't<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> go<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
will mean you won't have to go out and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.809 
will mean you won't have to go out and
buy<00:00:45.569> extra<00:00:46.019> cables<00:00:46.409> as<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.979> done<00:00:47.129> does<00:00:47.550> come

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:47.819 
buy extra cables as it done does come

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:51.110 
buy extra cables as it done does come

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
cables needed to connect the ps3 up as

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.700 
cables needed to connect the ps3 up as
well<00:00:53.359> although<00:00:54.359> one<00:00:54.780> disadvantage<00:00:55.139> the

the most important factor for me

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.929 
the most important factor for me
personally<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.369> produces

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
personally is that I produces

card<00:01:50.060> unfortunately<00:01:51.060> i<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.420> actually<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
card unfortunately i can actually get a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.109 
card unfortunately i can actually get a
comparison<00:01:52.829> between<00:01:52.859> the<00:01:53.159> hop<00:01:53.429> ugh<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
comparison between the hop ugh and the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.120 
comparison between the hop ugh and the
elgato<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:55.109> from<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.380> i<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.649> seen<00:01:55.710> they

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
elgato but from what i have seen they

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.980 
elgato but from what i have seen they
are<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.490> similar<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.880> quality<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:57.810> well

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
are very similar in quality but well

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.809 
are very similar in quality but well
without<00:01:58.469> color<00:01:58.770> correction<00:01:59.249> I<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.460> believe

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
without color correction I do believe

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.399 
without color correction I do believe
the<00:02:00.090> whole<00:02:00.299> park<00:02:00.569> has<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> very<00:02:01.140> slight

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the whole park has a very slight

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.560 
the whole park has a very slight
advantage<00:02:01.950> over<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.700> el<00:02:02.880> gato

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
advantage over the el gato

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.710 
advantage over the el gato
