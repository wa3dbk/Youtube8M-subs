00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
gotten hot before and all of this was

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.300 
gotten hot before and all of this was
curled<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:05.610> far<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:05.939> safety<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:08.159> want

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
curled up so as far as safety you want

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.770 
curled up so as far as safety you want
to<00:01:08.369> keep<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.580> bucket<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.970> water<00:01:09.150> around<00:01:09.420> you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
to keep a bucket of water around you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.230 
to keep a bucket of water around you
also<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.470> case<00:01:10.619> there's<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> fire<00:01:11.240> it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
also this in case there's a fire it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.120 
also this in case there's a fire it
starts<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.020> know<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.500> may<00:01:13.619> not<00:01:13.650> notice<00:01:13.920> it

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
starts you know you may not notice it

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.710 
starts you know you may not notice it
right<00:01:14.159> away<00:01:14.310> even<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> fire<00:01:15.570> extinguisher

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
right away even a fire extinguisher

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.109 
right away even a fire extinguisher
would<00:01:16.229> help<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.979> keep<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.280> bucket<00:01:17.460> around<00:01:17.700> so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
would help but I keep a bucket around so

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.690 
would help but I keep a bucket around so
I<00:01:18.150> can<00:01:18.270> cool<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.689> piece<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.930> metal<00:01:19.200> off<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
I can cool a piece of metal off if you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
I can cool a piece of metal off if you
know<00:01:20.820> if<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.240> need<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.840> throw<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.110> down<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> don't

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
know if I need to throw it down I don't

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.289 
know if I need to throw it down I don't
throw<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.130> something<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.670> food<00:01:23.909> listo

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
throw it on something like a food listo

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.789

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
it in the bucket and you know next

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.160 
it in the bucket and you know next
extinguish<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:30.090> heat<00:01:30.270> gets<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> rug<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
extinguish the heat gets on the rug so

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.450 
extinguish the heat gets on the rug so
that<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.409> doesn't<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.770> something<00:01:32.100> else<00:01:32.310> on

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.219 
that it doesn't get something else on
fire<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.329> always<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:33.930> plenty

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
fire but it's always good to have plenty
