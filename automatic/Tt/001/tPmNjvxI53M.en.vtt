00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.240
 hello everyone welcome to my kitchen today 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.270
 let's prepare a dish in steamer 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.650
 electric 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.320
 I'm going to make chicken with potatoes 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.560
 first step what needs to be done 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.890
 and let's take the well that I do 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.920
 previously marinated chicken breast 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.920
 with 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.470
 the first thing I'm going to do so that 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:59.210
 I will stick to the container later 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:03.230
 to paint it with a little oil 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.230
 common sunflower oil 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:12.580
 this will be our first floor in the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.580
 steamer or first the bag 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.270
 you can see 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.810
 and then I'm going to cut the potatoes 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.730
 ace 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.470
 and I will also put it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.520
 the container for 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.520
 steamer will be my second floor 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:04.700
 first floor support 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:07.630
 second bonnet covers 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.580
 press with water 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.580
 the street container below 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.590
 up to the maximum level 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.530
 and I'm going to program the steamer at 40 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.770
 minutes 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.980
 30 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.140
 40 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.700
 good in 40 minutes 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.700
 let's see what happens 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.790
 one minute is missing so that the 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:52.180
 40 minutes of the time that 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.109
 that we program for cooking and now 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.109
 let's check 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.590
 and pay we will carefully lift the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.590
 stage 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.420
 I'm going to poke the potato with a knife 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.040
 to know if the potato is ready 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:25.370
 perfect 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.370
 the tender potatoes are ready 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.350
 Cut the well to see if it's ready 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.860
 be white and it is perfect 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.230
 so from our particular plate I'm going 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.540
 to add olive oil 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.190
 you can add butter if you 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.820
 they want 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.360
 I hope you like it good and 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.360
 until next time
