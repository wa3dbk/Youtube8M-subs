00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 the people my name is julian pulls 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.270
 by Bodo with shepherd and you've 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.769
 asked why is money something good poverty 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.509
 is also a virtue a lot of fun ok 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.009
 I have bodo shepherd here and he has 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.260
 asked me yes what about with 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.359
 this whole money theme in the end 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.010
 poverty is a virtue and too much 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.170
 money is there not so cool there 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.310
 but much more important things than 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.890
 money and if I decide 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.439
 For example, there would have to be a lot of money 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.400
 earn or have a nice life or 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.900
 or be happy 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.949
 why do i have to go then money or how 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.899
 Anyway, these are all these 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.140
 ask the questions where you say what do you say 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.640
 to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.370
 but who says you decide 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.960
 must think of the lack of mine 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.329
 always has to decide between that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.789
 who thinks he has plenty 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.710
 Rich thinks he says I can do both 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.989
 and the people I really have 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.899
 admire those are happy and rich 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.030
 We did both, I think 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.920
 there is such an inner game and there is 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.899
 an external game outward then 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.480
 do you need money clearly 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.129
 inner game you need luck if 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.320
 both come together inside and outside 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.130
 plays then it is good I was broke 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.390
 at 26 and then I wondered 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.619
 After talking with my coach in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.740
 that was what is very important to me 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.830
 asked me where you are if you are so why 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.280
 If you are broke I did not find that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.650
 Well 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.270
 I wanted to be cool and have for myself 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.770
 a cool somehow the topic of money 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.540
 I do not master others on the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.030
 bag that can help others i have 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 when my parents get old 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.610
 I want to help that I want to mean 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.009
 help children 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.070
 For that you need money too, you need 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.840
 never started no question but with 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.500
 love can not pay to a cashier 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.810
 So you need you too 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.310
 That's just money and that's it 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.860
 I have been asking people since then 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.909
 Whenever you are like that, why show up 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.399
 that not on the account so my 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.680
 Story has always been that I tried 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.520
 a lack of money with coolness too 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.290
 outplay 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.509
 that was a bit macho again 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.460
 also alina yes it has always been so 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.770
 a bit over others too 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.810
 this direct yes there I was on everyone 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.479
 case of selfish narcissistic 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.520
 everything also and and I want to say 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.140
 in a bad mood 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.210
 as an employee you know people like that 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.610
 I made a big man back then 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.160
 I am 26 years old coach said you 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.070
 I'm arrogant as arrogant as he said 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.390
 but if you're fine then 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.480
 you do not need to show that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.980
 full piggy bank does not strum me 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.140
 had such a stress can thus 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.180
 I had to have to make because you show 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.040
 my self-confidence was too low 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.600
 and why was it so low when I was 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.010
 on the account could have looked at it 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.450
 not be strong and then I have 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.160
 somehow tries that too 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.030
 Compensate what you call that 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.680
 does not work permanently 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.510
 we just need a healthy one 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.130
 self-confidence and sent healthy 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.210
 self-confidence have people the 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.160
 also have some money 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.160
 yes, I would at least say that 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.710
 you still steal hard for you 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.140
 It's easy to say that the money is that 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.760
 cool it is that is really then 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.950
 Maybe you should really go too 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.230
 the sentence think the shepherd because just 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.490
 just said that with that 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.440
 to offer his parents then what 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.060
 or other what we offer or how 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.340
 However this was not always to all 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.980
 No, yes, and it works 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.850
 not necessarily the biggest 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.620
 ever to become multi-billionaire though 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.959
 First of all, to respect the people 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.910
 somewhere and secondly for yourself 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.410
 easy to know okay if i like this and 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.610
 Maybe that's the way it reacts 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.380
 because of my own dissatisfaction 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.060
 because I do not own that is yes 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.709
 quite natural that he is human yes 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.870
 but to grasp it is difficult 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.060
 because as I always say on facebook 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.520
 all the whole horny picture noise yes 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.720
 here in the ferrari because the hottest clock and 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.730
 Anything else, but it's all from 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.260
 other people if they own it 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.330
 if it really is the inner one 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.580
 wish it is but it makes it easy 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.100
 yes then there is gas then try it 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.140
 but the money does not speak small 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.750
 because then you are the moment to be small but 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.890
 either you want to be great 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.390
 help others 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.250
 you need help from others in between 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.920
 is not much and I find it easy 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.500
 nice if i can help others a lot 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.650
 Okay, that was okay 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.240
 why money is something good and poverty 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.100
 not necessarily a virtuous Bodo shepherd 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.930
