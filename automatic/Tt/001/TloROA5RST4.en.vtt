00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.180
 Well then , I think that I would like to do a problem exercise with a second grade boiler engineer this time 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:12.700
 Yes this 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:18.780
 Before symbol table Issue of 2012 What is it 24 years Let's do from here. 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:23.600
 First Which is what is wrong with the above-mentioned priming here to heat 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:28.300
 If the saturation temperature increases as the pressure increases 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:34.940
 Dry how the above he is in the above-mentioned Those who brightness of the city 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:42.190
 The above is the value obtained by adding 2000 heat of sensible heat of water. 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.190
 Both the water and saturated steam forehead become smaller as the pressure increases 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:51.130
 The heat of evaporation decreases as the pressure increases and reaches zero when the critical pressure is reached 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:55.140
 Yes what about the wrong thing in this 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.140
 Please stop thinking the video 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.480
 How is it 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:06.549
 December before you say the answer 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.210
 Saturation temperature It is first of all it becomes higher as the pressure is high this is say what it 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:13.299
 Well it is 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:17.870
 In the case of the short boiling it that so water please I think the temperature of say a square movement atmospheric pressure 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:23.270
 Is because I have been boils at 100 degrees when the 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.680
 In this case, for example , if the pressure is higher than the atmospheric pressure, then it will be 100 degrees 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.860
 Not at 120 degrees 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.010
 It's not like you're boiling and the pressure is lower 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.180
 Yes, the temperature will be lower with Fujiyamanokami 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.860
 This would be somehow I'm Keneso Tsu was true 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.980
 Do you understand what the fore temperature is understood? 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.370
 the next one 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:47.740
 How to dry is the above he is the track is above the city 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.240
 Well this area may be a bit lost if I don't understand Kawaki's regular schedule 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:55.420
 Well then 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.320
 If the enthalpy above the day of the person that is a value in the plus sidelined in key column of water day 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.570
 Enthalpy 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.030
 It will be the enthalpy of day 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:07.770
 Large Aso call it becomes smaller as the even pressure What is the Nihon stone of the above-mentioned increases 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:14.099
 I like a Remember me I 9 Gakuseki to the forehead seat 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.080
 Well that's the nature of it, so this time it's a critical pressure and this is where various definitions of words 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.420
 I 'm listening to 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.640
 If you do not understand a little difficult 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:30.530
 It may be difficult to answer, but it's just a boiler's knowledge of this structure 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.160
 Roughly about one question has come out about even in one sentence because it comes out of the story and this water vapor Toka 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.060
 I will 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:39.920
 So I hope this is right , but I would like 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.410
 If because there is also a 10 in a crisis here I am Matada I just say be postponed 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.990
 like this 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:48.030
 Even if it is not in the spot head, for example, the first sound of a moment or this is 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.990
 Because you go to say would 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.800
 Then why are supposed to be I 23 c 5 may be selected any suspicious guy 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.080
 is not it 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:03.000
 I 'm talking about that kind of thing, but I will talk about it 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.780
 It's the best if you 're putting it because you're in your head, but if you don't, it's fine 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.590
 Whether it is to say let's make an effort to reach the correct answer 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.910
 So package and answered Let's Well take a look at this Well then I better answer is that this it is here 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.069
 It is wrong 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:23.950
 4 is good in specific volume of water and saturated steam 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:28.689
 The difference is that either the higher the pressure or the smaller the pressure . 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:34.299
 The fore above becomes smaller as the pressure gets higher, but the ruins that people mentioned above 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:38.090
 If you do not like water this day enthalpy or non-a non-large stone this day 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:42.290
 The guy named Chakra is somehow per unit 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:46.340
 And the enthalpy of turn relentlessly for example per kilogram you were, for example, specific enthalpy 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.280
 It is the volume per kilogram for the value seat 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.190
 That's why evacuees are 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:04:00.220
 In it is to say and say it whether such nature as'm not a super-so 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:02.670
 And the point of the problem exercise is that this is opposite to say that this is a different cat and others 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.569
 I because others are there all 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:12.060
 Bill temperature of I mean he is pretentious to the pressure is high The high 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.260
 So dry way is who he is brightness of the city because above Tteyuu I specific enthalpy of the above 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.930
 Is 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:24.000
 This is also an option for the correct answer if censorship is added to Yukoshi 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.570
 If you don't know it's a bit suspicious , remember it with words if it's all too late 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.570
 Please 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.410
 Well then how about everyone who was the first here
