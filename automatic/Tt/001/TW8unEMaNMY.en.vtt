basically like a salt rifle only thing

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.819

is<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.729> damage<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.240> kind<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.600> low<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.650> that's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
is the damage is kind of low so that's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.920
