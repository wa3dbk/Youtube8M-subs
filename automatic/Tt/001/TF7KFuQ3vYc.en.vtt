00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
looked at what went wrong for the second

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.160 
looked at what went wrong for the second
half<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:11.180> was<00:01:11.299> all<00:01:11.420> easily<00:01:11.780> correctable

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
half and it was all easily correctable

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.230 
half and it was all easily correctable
stuff<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:12.799> long<00:01:13.700> as<00:01:13.790> we<00:01:13.850> stick<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.150> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
stuff so long as we stick to the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.780 
stuff so long as we stick to the
fundamentals<00:01:14.390> we<00:01:15.350> wrap<00:01:15.590> up<00:01:15.619> our<00:01:16.070> tackling<00:01:16.610> we

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
fundamentals we wrap up our tackling we

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.760 
fundamentals we wrap up our tackling we
take<00:01:16.970> good<00:01:17.119> angles<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:18.320> we<00:01:18.439> play<00:01:18.619> together

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
take good angles and we play together

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.770 
take good angles and we play together
then<00:01:19.189> we<00:01:20.119> shouldn't<00:01:20.299> have<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:20.540> problem

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
then we shouldn't have that problem

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.750 
then we shouldn't have that problem
