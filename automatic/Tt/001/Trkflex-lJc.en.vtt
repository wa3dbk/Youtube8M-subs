00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.289 
that here as that's the on/off button
then<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.560> need<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> wired<00:03:14.099> value<00:03:14.760> constant

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
then you need a wired value constant

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.370 
then you need a wired value constant
value<00:03:15.840> with<00:03:16.079> one<00:03:16.349> value<00:03:17.090> at<00:03:18.090> 16<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.170> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
value with one value at 16 to the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.860 
value with one value at 16 to the
lifetime<00:03:19.920> for<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.220> meter<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:20.880> place<00:03:21.120> that

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.660 

now<00:03:24.870> we<00:03:24.930> need<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.349> go<00:03:25.500> over<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.069> expression

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
now we need to go over to the expression

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.880 
now we need to go over to the expression
gate<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.590> i've<00:03:28.739> already<00:03:29.010> got<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.280> loaded<00:03:29.430> here

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
gate and i've already got it loaded here

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.670 
gate and i've already got it loaded here
that<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.040> expression<00:03:32.780> has<00:03:33.780> two<00:03:34.140> inputs<00:03:34.170> of

in front of the emitter relevant

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.699 
in front of the emitter relevant
distance<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.430> your<00:03:44.549> distant<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.780> amount

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
distance is your distant and the amount

mrs.<00:03:53.010> Lee<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.400> should<00:03:53.700> be<00:03:53.909> 10<00:03:54.650> okay<00:03:55.650> why<00:03:55.980> is

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
mrs. Lee that should be 10 okay why is

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.960 
mrs. Lee that should be 10 okay why is
the<00:03:57.420> cosine<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:58.140> your<00:03:58.379> angle<00:03:58.950> times<00:03:59.610> your

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
the cosine of your angle times your

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.750 
the cosine of your angle times your
relative<00:04:00.359> distance<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.200> z<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.489> sine<00:04:02.730> of

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
relative distance and z is the sine of

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.599 
relative distance and z is the sine of
the<00:04:03.060> angle<00:04:03.090> times<00:04:03.599> relative<00:04:03.810> distance<00:04:04.519> so<00:04:05.519> you

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
the angle times relative distance so you

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.569 
the angle times relative distance so you
should<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:05.879> to<00:04:06.030> just<00:04:06.180> use<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:07.650> place

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
should be to just use that and place

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.670 
should be to just use that and place
that<00:04:08.910> on<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.510> board<00:04:11.480> okay<00:04:12.480> okay<00:04:13.290> we're<00:04:13.560> going
