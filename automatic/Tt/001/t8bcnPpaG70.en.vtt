00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
reserves and the Academy and so

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.070 
reserves and the Academy and so
basically<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.250> try<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.880> help<00:02:02.450> with<00:02:02.630> pre<00:02:02.840> match

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
basically I try and help with pre match

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.500 
basically I try and help with pre match
and<00:02:03.290> post<00:02:03.470> match<00:02:03.680> documents<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.940> looking<00:02:05.420> at

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
and post match documents and looking at

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.790 
and post match documents and looking at
recruitment<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.080> players<00:02:06.290> and<00:02:06.410> stuff<00:02:06.620> and

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
recruitment of players and stuff and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.369 
recruitment of players and stuff and
getting<00:02:06.920> videos<00:02:07.280> ready<00:02:07.520> for<00:02:07.790> coaches<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.379> the

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
getting videos ready for coaches and the

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.290 
getting videos ready for coaches and the
manager<00:02:09.739> cause<00:02:10.100> I'm<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.280> big<00:02:10.460> live<00:02:10.850> Pro<00:02:11.030> found

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
manager cause I'm a big live Pro found

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.960 
manager cause I'm a big live Pro found
myself<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:12.370> it's<00:02:13.370> great<00:02:13.580> just<00:02:13.730> being<00:02:13.850> around

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
myself I it's great just being around

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.970 
myself I it's great just being around
the<00:02:14.180> environments<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.870> Football<00:02:15.260> Club

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the environments of the Football Club

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.190 
the environments of the Football Club
just<00:02:16.370> just<00:02:16.849> to<00:02:17.000> like<00:02:17.150> interact<00:02:17.450> with<00:02:17.690> coaches

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
just just to like interact with coaches

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.920 
just just to like interact with coaches
and<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.920> players<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.940> feel<00:02:20.299> like<00:02:20.450> I'm<00:02:20.569> there

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
and and players I feel like I'm there

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.850 
and and players I feel like I'm there
every<00:02:21.349> day

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
every day

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.280 
every day
so<00:02:22.580> our<00:02:22.760> research<00:02:22.970> area<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.780> skill

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
so our research area is skill

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.520 
so our research area is skill
acquisition<00:02:24.409> expert<00:02:25.370> performance<00:02:25.549> and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
acquisition expert performance and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.350 
acquisition expert performance and
learning<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.620> complex<00:02:28.069> tasks<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.120> tasks

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
learning of complex tasks so the tasks

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.229 
learning of complex tasks so the tasks
that<00:02:29.690> we<00:02:29.900> had<00:02:30.080> our<00:02:30.950> student<00:02:31.400> doing<00:02:31.549> today<00:02:31.760> was

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
that we had our student doing today was

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.630 
that we had our student doing today was
a<00:02:32.269> decision-making<00:02:32.900> task<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.470> football<00:02:33.799> so<00:02:34.610> he

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
a decision-making task in football so he

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.759 
a decision-making task in football so he
was<00:02:34.910> required<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.629> interact<00:02:36.200> with<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
was required to interact with the

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.800 
was required to interact with the
footage<00:02:36.980> as<00:02:37.250> few<00:02:37.489> as<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.640> player<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.299> make

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
footage as few as a player and make

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.509 
footage as few as a player and make
decisions<00:02:39.319> about<00:02:39.470> what<00:02:39.830> he<00:02:40.010> would<00:02:40.160> do<00:02:40.310> in

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
decisions about what he would do in

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.039 
decisions about what he would do in
response<00:02:40.849> to<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.269> play<00:02:41.420> in<00:02:41.629> front<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.900> him

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
response to the play in front of him

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.750 
response to the play in front of him
well<00:02:42.440> there's<00:02:42.620> probably<00:02:42.709> two<00:02:43.099> strands<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.730> the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
well there's probably two strands to the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.460 
well there's probably two strands to the
research<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.390> we<00:02:44.510> do<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.049> one<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.379> the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
research that we do and one of the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.869 
research that we do and one of the
strands<00:02:45.739> is<00:02:45.920> trying<00:02:46.159> to<00:02:46.310> uncover<00:02:46.459> the

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
strands is trying to uncover the

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.759 
strands is trying to uncover the
molecular<00:02:47.569> mechanisms<00:02:48.140> by<00:02:48.230> which<00:02:48.260> muscle

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
molecular mechanisms by which muscle

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.130 
molecular mechanisms by which muscle
adapts<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.129> exercise<00:02:49.640> training<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.810> we<00:02:50.900> spend

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
adapts to exercise training so we spend

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.690 
adapts to exercise training so we spend
a<00:02:51.200> lot<00:02:51.319> of<00:02:51.349> time<00:02:51.590> taking<00:02:51.769> muscle<00:02:52.220> biopsies<00:02:52.670> and

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
a lot of time taking muscle biopsies and

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.789 
a lot of time taking muscle biopsies and
trying<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.209> understand<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:54.260> biochemical

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
trying to understand the biochemical

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.250 
trying to understand the biochemical
adaptations<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:55.519> skeletal<00:02:55.940> muscle<00:02:56.170> but<00:02:57.170> at

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
adaptations of skeletal muscle but at

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.110 
adaptations of skeletal muscle but at
the<00:02:57.319> same<00:02:57.500> time<00:02:57.769> once<00:02:58.040> we<00:02:58.160> get<00:02:58.549> this<00:02:58.730> basic

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
the same time once we get this basic

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.000 
the same time once we get this basic
information<00:02:59.269> we<00:03:00.170> then<00:03:00.319> try<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.620> translate

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
information we then try and translate

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.430 
information we then try and translate
this<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.579> the<00:03:01.700> elite<00:03:01.910> sport<00:03:02.269> environment<00:03:02.599> so

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
this in the elite sport environment so

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.900 
this in the elite sport environment so
what<00:03:03.620> we<00:03:03.739> learn<00:03:03.890> in<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.099> laboratory<00:03:04.579> we<00:03:04.730> want

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
what we learn in the laboratory we want

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.640 
what we learn in the laboratory we want
to<00:03:05.000> translate<00:03:05.359> to<00:03:05.629> improve<00:03:05.959> performance<00:03:06.140> from

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
to translate to improve performance from

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.830 
to translate to improve performance from
the<00:03:06.739> pits<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.209> yeah<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.239> guess<00:03:08.510> over<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.720> last

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the pits I yeah I guess over the last

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.930 
the pits I yeah I guess over the last
few<00:03:09.019> years<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.500> area<00:03:09.799> of<00:03:09.890> recoveries<00:03:10.700> become

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
few years the area of recoveries become

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.819 
few years the area of recoveries become
increasingly<00:03:11.450> important<00:03:12.019> in<00:03:12.170> elite<00:03:12.470> sport

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
increasingly important in elite sport

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.800 
increasingly important in elite sport
and<00:03:13.730> certainly<00:03:14.209> different<00:03:14.569> recovery

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
and certainly different recovery

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.470 
and certainly different recovery
interventions<00:03:15.590> have<00:03:15.769> been<00:03:15.920> widely<00:03:16.310> used<00:03:16.730> one

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
interventions have been widely used one

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.720 
interventions have been widely used one
of<00:03:17.569> them<00:03:17.720> being<00:03:17.900> cold<00:03:18.200> water<00:03:18.410> immersion<00:03:18.799> what

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
of them being cold water immersion what

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.250 
of them being cold water immersion what
we<00:03:19.819> probably<00:03:20.000> don't<00:03:20.239> really<00:03:20.569> know<00:03:20.810> it's<00:03:21.049> too

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
we probably don't really know it's too

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.559 
we probably don't really know it's too
much<00:03:21.440> it's<00:03:21.650> about<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:22.160> mechanisms<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:23.120> how<00:03:23.419> it

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
much it's about the mechanisms of how it

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.039 
much it's about the mechanisms of how it
works

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
works

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.559 
works
so<00:03:24.859> really<00:03:25.340> my<00:03:25.609> work<00:03:25.849> is<00:03:26.060> concerned<00:03:26.450> with

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
so really my work is concerned with

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.539 
so really my work is concerned with
trying<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:26.930> unpick<00:03:27.380> some<00:03:27.859> of<00:03:27.919> the<00:03:28.010> mechanisms

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
trying to unpick some of the mechanisms

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.490 
trying to unpick some of the mechanisms
of<00:03:28.880> how<00:03:29.060> effective<00:03:29.569> it<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:29.750> it's<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:30.319> very

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
of how effective it is it's a very

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.920 
of how effective it is it's a very

real exciting thing is I think is a

real exciting thing is I think is a

sports psychology I think students would

be<00:04:18.199> interested<00:04:18.620> in<00:04:18.709> doing<00:04:18.859> our<00:04:19.039> science<00:04:19.459> in

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
be interested in doing our science in

be interested in doing our science in
football<00:04:19.880> degree<00:04:20.239> because<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:22.310> program<00:04:22.729> that

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
football degree because the program that

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.610 
football degree because the program that
we've<00:04:23.030> developed<00:04:23.570> over<00:04:23.720> numerous<00:04:24.140> years

in<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.900> industry<00:04:35.410> yeah<00:04:35.770> well<00:04:36.040> I've<00:04:36.310> said

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
in the industry yeah well I've said

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.090 
in the industry yeah well I've said
before<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:37.570> think<00:04:37.900> in<00:04:38.290> terms<00:04:38.470> of<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.680> ethos<00:04:38.950> of

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
before I think in terms of the ethos of

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.970 
before I think in terms of the ethos of
John<00:04:39.550> Moores<00:04:39.760> University<00:04:39.910> I<00:04:40.480> mean<00:04:40.690> the

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
John Moores University I mean the

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.320 
John Moores University I mean the
philosophies<00:04:43.080> dream<00:04:44.190> plan<00:04:45.190> achieve<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.850> you

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
philosophies dream plan achieve and you

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.550 
philosophies dream plan achieve and you
know<00:04:46.690> when<00:04:46.810> I'm<00:04:46.900> driving<00:04:47.110> around<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.380> city

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
know when I'm driving around the city

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.320 
know when I'm driving around the city
and<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.770> see<00:04:47.950> that<00:04:48.100> on<00:04:48.430> billboards<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.030> I<00:04:49.150> just

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
and I see that on billboards and I just

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.140 
and I see that on billboards and I just
makes<00:04:49.480> me<00:04:49.630> smile<00:04:49.930> because<00:04:50.530> where<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.340> was<00:04:51.430> five

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
makes me smile because where I was five

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.850 
makes me smile because where I was five
years<00:04:52.420> ago<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.690> where<00:04:52.870> I<00:04:52.900> am<00:04:53.110> now<00:04:53.290> you<00:04:53.740> know

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
years ago to where I am now you know

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.400 
years ago to where I am now you know
it's<00:04:54.040> as<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:55.060> said<00:04:55.210> before<00:04:55.330> it<00:04:55.960> wasn't<00:04:56.110> even<00:04:56.260> a

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
it's as I said before it wasn't even a

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.930 
it's as I said before it wasn't even a
dream<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.770> work<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:56.920> little<00:04:57.100> football<00:04:57.580> club<00:04:57.760> but

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
dream to work a little football club but

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.970 
dream to work a little football club but
but<00:04:58.210> I<00:04:58.240> achieved<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:58.990> you<00:04:59.500> know<00:04:59.620> so<00:04:59.650> it's

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
but I achieved it and you know so it's

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.910 
but I achieved it and you know so it's
it's<00:05:00.660> called<00:05:01.660> kind<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:01.960> our<00:05:02.050> ironic<00:05:02.470> so<00:05:02.770> that

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
it's called kind of our ironic so that

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.880 
it's called kind of our ironic so that
is<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.040> I<00:05:03.340> think<00:05:03.640> that's<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:03.880> good<00:05:04.030> philosophy

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
is a I think that's a good philosophy

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.170 
is a I think that's a good philosophy
for<00:05:05.890> students<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.310> use<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:06.940> overall

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
for students to use and the overall

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.550 
for students to use and the overall
atmosphere<00:05:07.360> as<00:05:07.810> well<00:05:07.960> just<00:05:08.140> offend<00:05:08.440> the

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
atmosphere as well just offend the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.110 
atmosphere as well just offend the
atmosphere<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.280> you<00:05:09.430> don't<00:05:09.610> feel<00:05:09.760> sometimes
