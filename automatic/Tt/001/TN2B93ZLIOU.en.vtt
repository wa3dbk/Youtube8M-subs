00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:29.720
 As we understood good point from here by measurement earlier, place where we put this sticky note 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.630
 1 of these 9 people 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.020
 Says 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.470
 Then from now on 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:43.080
 The 7g think of here 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.080
 If you attach it to today's or unknown 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.990
 There is still a little difference, so this 7g doesn't match yet 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.400
 I will try to put the thought of Shirag 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:18.310
 Because it will still go up with this 5g 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:21.230
 Now just midway between 7g and 5g 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.129
 To 6g out the 1 Gran 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.129
 10 Masu Idei 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.280
 Now that the balance has stopped 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.770
 If you put a weight of 6 grams here 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.770
 I understood that I could get a balance 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.610
 I added a 6-gram weight to the place just before this 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:26.290
 Hmm 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.290
 Home company now will continue to have in the direction of the same as the 9 o'clock and earlier 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.150
 Even if I let go of my hand 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.150
 Does not move 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.260
 Be purchased below to 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.819
 Does not move 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.819
 Even in take them towards the top course 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.410
 Does not move 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.410
 It means that this is balanced
