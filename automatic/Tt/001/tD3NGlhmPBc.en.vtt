00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.639
 coach against westerlo 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.260
 it was not good at the start of the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.509
 first half not good at the start of the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.690
 second half but fell in between the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.850
 well more i thought i think we are 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.100
 one of us better balanced 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.310
 played matches of out of 4 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.410
 so the were rather difficult moments 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.449
 that match and think none 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.710
 team can tell the belgium that he is 90 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.330
 minutes the game is completely on 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.270
 hand can determine but I mainly saw 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.520
 further further further over a longer period 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.410
 period that we are the opponent well 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.120
 have been able to dominate and in the first 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.450
 phase of the competition maybe 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.950
 not really many chances but money with 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.469
 we quickly take advantage of the opportunities that we create 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.820
 then we fell back a little bit me 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.230
 think we have picked up well again 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.730
 one had enough chances do not 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.300
 competition for a normal winning 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.399
 Close 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.110
 you also said in advance I want the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.600
 continue to rise and that is 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.969
 succeeded yes and then this match becomes 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.530
 then against wessel was important think 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.799
 me for the trust 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.240
 the rest 7 out of 12 are a good basis for this 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.100
 another match that adhere to this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.930
 and that is in the morning 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.490
 Sint-Truiden and are with that and that is possible 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.619
 basically everything happening 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.090
 yes you say it in derby what do you expect 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.780
 what do you hope for such a match 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.909
 is becoming 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.520
 I hope it will be a cup match 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.520
 is a lot of struggle and that we have more 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.549
 fully participate in the fight and that we 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.619
 weeping results can play and if 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.119
 you can then play that result and what 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.270
 is who should think too far ahead that she 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.560
 difficult enough and on syntra want 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 PhD student is always very dangerous and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.909
 very enthusiastic and anyone who wants players 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.840
 own invented percent proof and 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.579
 then I got shalom and home 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.890
 then I think we are the first six 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.899
 matches of the season if we then 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.490
 another virus asshole I think 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.990
 be perfect gender 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.319
 yes I can imagine that you are not 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.060
 really the pressure on the screw set played 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:56.679
 mate is done by the fans we are 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.950
 have seen the banner so now one 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.600
 game you must win I think we 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.280
 today that we have worked here 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.109
 trying to put a certain pressure on it 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.920
 to create 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.049
 the I always said on the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.549
 types of training that same pressure 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:11.230
 getting their matches then 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.239
 always have to pack more and then 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.280
 put extra pressure on this one 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.750
 group in think is important that you have them 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.220
 trust is allowed whole 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.200
 realistic 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.549
 that objective to Sint Truiden from 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.880
 who had been a minute he very well could 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.260
 she's two and you know he's in it 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.660
 All aspects should be good to 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.299
 match all result all of you 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.579
 also on your own artificial turf 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.110
 trained that surface goes that one 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.459
 play a decisive role 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.769
 that is playing football so it is different 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.890
 ball has to go more from foot to foot 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.440
 but now ball speed is higher and is one 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.819
 different way of playing so but me 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.880
 I already think my own may be for 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.470
 us before our hearts so we pass 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.180
 sit with that given to need engines 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.739
 have to make the best of it 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.510
 is this with a problem igor de 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.700
 camargo is out 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.299
 yes that hurt and my little one 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.389
 muscle injury take on no risk 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:06.220
 but that happens so it's a different one 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.530
 boys not one for me too 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.359
 look at the world in our selection of how 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.959
 that the boys fill it in 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.459
 let us hope we will miss now 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.160
 what are possible alternatives 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.130
 actually yes we have we have in eson 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.169
 all those of his little minute what now 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.310
 Add anyway let's see that 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.590
 harder can balls 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.959
 we currently have alexander together 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.669
 something between those here to mentally corner 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.730
 this moment on the back due to a to 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:36.099
 the good road in the neighborhoods is then 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.599
 We have a choice tomorrow 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.239
 supporters naturally expect that 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.349
 you almost always go to win in 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.669
 Sint Truiden 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.889
 yes the supporters bothered us 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.090
 expect us to stink our best 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.349
 then we do when I lay on the floor 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.950
 and then i know 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.960
 quality 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.970
 and then of course as can happen 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.860
 but I expect one selection we 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.190
 then one hundred percent go for their 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.660
 form result a football is still 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.000
 unpredictable 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.220
 and we hope that we as soon as you 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.050
 perfect sturgeon from our athletes 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.060
