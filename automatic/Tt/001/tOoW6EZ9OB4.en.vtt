coming are all the new one and what's
really<00:01:53.220> really<00:01:53.369> fast<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
really really fast and if you get a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.700 
really really fast and if you get a
audio<00:01:55.079> track<00:01:55.530> um<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.340> thing<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.850> go<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.210> them

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
audio track um this thing can go on them

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.410 
audio track um this thing can go on them
but<00:01:58.710> don't<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.250> jumps<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.270> stuff

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
but don't do like jumps and stuff

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.620 
but don't do like jumps and stuff
because<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.229> could<00:02:01.560> actually<00:02:01.770> hurt<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.189> car

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
because that could actually hurt the car

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.980 
because that could actually hurt the car
and<00:02:03.680> um<00:02:04.680> take<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.369> bag<00:02:05.759> loop-de-loop<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.810> out

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and um take the bag loop-de-loop it out

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.040 
and um take the bag loop-de-loop it out
too<00:02:07.170> big<00:02:07.439> i<00:02:07.469> loop-de-loops<00:02:08.099> plate<00:02:08.459> dozens<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
too big i loop-de-loops plate dozens and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.779 
too big i loop-de-loops plate dozens and
there

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
there

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.520 
there
reason<00:02:11.030> why<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:13.640> has<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:14.540> wheels<00:02:14.750> popping<00:02:15.409> out

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
reason why it has the wheels popping out

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.259 
reason why it has the wheels popping out
is<00:02:15.739> because<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.129> didn't<00:02:16.370> have<00:02:16.549> that<00:02:16.579> they

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
is because it didn't have that they

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.099 
is because it didn't have that they
won't<00:02:17.450> have<00:02:17.569> enough<00:02:17.599> room<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.109> all<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
won't have enough room for all the

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.610 
won't have enough room for all the
mechanical<00:02:21.109> stuff<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.680> well<00:02:23.349> here's<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.500> on

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
mechanical stuff and well here's the on

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.649 
mechanical stuff and well here's the on
and<00:02:24.859> off<00:02:24.920> button<00:02:25.849> right<00:02:26.030> here<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.269> this<00:02:26.450> is

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
and off button right here and this is

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.750
