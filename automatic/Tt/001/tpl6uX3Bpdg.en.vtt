00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.390
 although it costs me pudding the death 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.260
 we are going to incorporate 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.560
 the carrot for this stew 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.810
 the meat stew 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.709
 we all cover again but before we 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.709
 we take trouble not 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.990
 and not 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.920
 beautiful 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.920

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.200
 if we had meat meat thick taco 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.900
 meat 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.090
 we could here 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.660
 but once the bed is made 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.660
 taste the salt 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.550
 obviously it's missing because I have not thrown 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.990
 and we are going to incorporate 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.290
 that we had previously sealed 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.470
 sealed so they do not shrink 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:29.130
 and we are going to accommodate it 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.200
 and we cover again and go back with the 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.670
 potatoes cooked here and see how it goes 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.240
 releasing the tomato 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.880

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.650
