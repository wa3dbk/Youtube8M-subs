about<00:02:40.070> this<00:02:40.310> case<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.150> first<00:02:41.330> one<00:02:41.510> is<00:02:41.720> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
about this case the first one is the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.770 
about this case the first one is the
fact<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.410> once<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.910> have<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.450> for<00:02:44.750> a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
fact that once you have it on for a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.900 
fact that once you have it on for a
while<00:02:44.959> when<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.410> took<00:02:45.500> it<00:02:45.800> off<00:02:45.950> after<00:02:46.700> about<00:02:46.730> a

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
while when I took it off after about a

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.640 
while when I took it off after about a
month<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.330> half<00:02:47.360> or<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.780> did<00:02:47.930> notice<00:02:48.260> that

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
month and a half or so I did notice that

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.580 
month and a half or so I did notice that
it<00:02:49.250> had<00:02:49.400> high<00:02:49.610> slightly<00:02:50.360> dis<00:02:51.050> formed<00:02:51.470> or

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
it had high slightly dis formed or

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.710 
it had high slightly dis formed or
disfigured<00:02:52.070> slightly<00:02:52.459> but<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:53.330> didn't<00:02:53.570> affect

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
disfigured slightly but it didn't affect

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.510 
disfigured slightly but it didn't affect
it<00:02:54.080> once<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.500> was<00:02:54.650> on<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.890> case<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.340> think

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
it once it was on the case and I think

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.650 
it once it was on the case and I think
this<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.760> down<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.120> fact<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.480> it's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
this is down to the fact that it's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.050 
this is down to the fact that it's
really<00:02:56.900> thin<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.739> begin<00:02:58.010> with<00:02:58.190> nothing<00:02:58.730> major

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
really thin to begin with nothing major

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.750 
really thin to begin with nothing major
but<00:02:59.570> it's<00:02:59.690> something<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.560> be<00:03:00.860> aware<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.250> and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
but it's something to be aware of and

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.850 
but it's something to be aware of and
the<00:03:01.850> final<00:03:02.150> thing<00:03:02.270> is<00:03:02.330> that<00:03:02.540> with<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.410> matte

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
the final thing is that with the matte

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.240 
the final thing is that with the matte
ish<00:03:04.100> feel<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.820> this<00:03:04.940> case<00:03:05.239> if<00:03:06.080> you<00:03:06.230> do<00:03:06.739> scuff<00:03:07.220> it

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
ish feel to this case if you do scuff it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.710 
ish feel to this case if you do scuff it
and<00:03:07.580> scratch<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:07.880> it's<00:03:08.150> something<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.600> you

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720
