shorter<00:01:26.520> skis<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> benefits<00:01:28.430> what

shorter skis have all the benefits what

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
shorter skis have all the benefits what
are<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> negatives<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> shorter<00:01:30.720> ski<00:01:31.130> well

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
are the negatives to a shorter ski well

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219 
are the negatives to a shorter ski well
one<00:01:32.729> thing<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.180> give<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> longer<00:01:33.630> ski<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
one thing is to give a longer ski it is

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.410 
one thing is to give a longer ski it is
more<00:01:34.470> stable<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:34.979> high<00:01:35.100> speeds<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.240> high

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
more stable at high speeds so for high

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.630 
more stable at high speeds so for high
speed<00:01:37.049> skiers<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.920> would<00:01:38.070> probably<00:01:38.310> go

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
speed skiers they would probably go

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.370 
speed skiers they would probably go
something<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.720> around<00:01:39.869> nose<00:01:40.110> height

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
something you know around nose height

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.100 
something you know around nose height
which<00:01:41.340> for<00:01:41.549> me<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.110> 177

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
which for me would be like 177

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.969 
which for me would be like 177
centimetres<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.970> also<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.659> powder<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.710> want

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
centimetres and also for powder you want

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.670 
centimetres and also for powder you want
more<00:01:47.189> surface<00:01:47.640> area<00:01:47.970> which<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.810> can<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
more surface area which you can get in a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.980 
more surface area which you can get in a
longer<00:01:50.040> ski<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.210> also<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.509> get<00:01:51.869> in

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
longer ski but you can also just get in

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.590 
longer ski but you can also just get in
a<00:01:52.079> fatter<00:01:52.380> ski<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.670> people<00:01:54.119> skiing<00:01:54.360> powder

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
a fatter ski so people skiing powder

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.740 
a fatter ski so people skiing powder
will<00:01:55.320> often<00:01:55.649> you'll<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.159> fatter<00:01:56.460> ski<00:01:56.850> so

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
will often you'll see in a fatter ski so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.810 
will often you'll see in a fatter ski so
they<00:01:58.020> don't<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.380> need<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.460> go<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.790> a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
they don't really need to go with a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.770 
they don't really need to go with a
really<00:02:00.060> long<00:02:00.420> ski<00:02:00.810> although<00:02:01.770> often<00:02:02.520> times<00:02:02.909> in

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
really long ski although often times in

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
really long ski although often times in
the<00:02:03.930> power<00:02:04.140> you'll<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.590> both<00:02:04.829> you'll<00:02:05.250> get<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the power you'll do both you'll get a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.449 
the power you'll do both you'll get a
really<00:02:05.670> fat<00:02:05.969> ski<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.570> really<00:02:06.869> long<00:02:07.079> ski

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
really fat ski and a really long ski

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.580 
really fat ski and a really long ski
because<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.789> lot<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.270> surface<00:02:09.660> area<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.379> can't

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
because a lot of surface area just can't

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.809 
because a lot of surface area just can't
be<00:02:10.679> beat<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.400> that's

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
be beat but and that's

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.929 
be beat but and that's
about<00:02:12.090> powder<00:02:12.359> skis<00:02:12.810> because<00:02:13.579> not<00:02:14.579> that<00:02:14.760> many

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
about powder skis because not that many

in recommending short skis we are people
I<00:02:29.099> don't<00:02:29.519> know<00:02:29.760> why<00:02:29.969> people<00:02:30.329> like<00:02:30.870> really<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
I don't know why people like really to

I don't know why people like really to
recommend<00:02:32.069> really<00:02:32.189> long<00:02:32.459> skis<00:02:32.930> but<00:02:33.930> it's<00:02:34.200> not

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
recommend really long skis but it's not

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.649 
recommend really long skis but it's not
really<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.219> good<00:02:35.430> idea<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:36.239> almost<00:02:36.420> any

camera<00:02:39.650> I'll<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:41.359> grab<00:02:43.159> because<00:02:44.159> you<00:02:45.060> know

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
camera I'll just grab because you know

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.270 
camera I'll just grab because you know
the<00:02:45.659> firs<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.139> being<00:02:46.620> able<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.859> handle<00:02:47.159> it

really long ski this ski is probably a

really long ski this ski is probably a
little<00:02:52.560> short<00:02:52.919> for<00:02:53.069> me<00:02:53.129> but<00:02:53.909> you<00:02:54.299> can<00:02:54.419> go<00:02:54.510> with

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
little short for me but you can go with

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.509 
little short for me but you can go with
a<00:02:54.719> stiffer<00:02:55.109> ski<00:02:55.500> if<00:02:55.889> you're<00:02:56.040> worried<00:02:56.400> about

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
a stiffer ski if you're worried about

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.539 
a stiffer ski if you're worried about
being<00:02:56.969> stable<00:02:57.750> at<00:02:57.870> higher<00:02:58.019> speeds<00:02:58.549> generally

being stable at higher speeds generally

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.619 
being stable at higher speeds generally
you<00:02:59.639> want<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.819> just<00:03:00.000> worry<00:03:00.239> about<00:03:00.329> the

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
you want to just worry about the

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.330 
you want to just worry about the
stiffness<00:03:01.139> of<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.290> ski<00:03:01.620> more<00:03:01.829> than<00:03:02.040> getting<00:03:02.280> a

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
stiffness of the ski more than getting a

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.699 
stiffness of the ski more than getting a
longer<00:03:02.549> ski<00:03:02.969> if<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.139> got<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.349> beginner

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
longer ski if I got a beginner

longer ski if I got a beginner
intermediate<00:03:04.949> ski<00:03:05.549> like<00:03:05.730> this<00:03:05.760> 520<00:03:06.980> even<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.099> a

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
intermediate ski like this 520 even in a

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.599 
intermediate ski like this 520 even in a
180<00:03:08.579> centimeters<00:03:09.389> which<00:03:10.349> they<00:03:10.530> don't<00:03:10.709> make<00:03:10.859> it

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
180 centimeters which they don't make it

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.959 
180 centimeters which they don't make it
still<00:03:12.030> would<00:03:12.180> not<00:03:12.209> be<00:03:12.510> stable<00:03:12.959> at<00:03:13.049> high<00:03:13.199> speeds

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:13.969 
still would not be stable at high speeds

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.780 
still would not be stable at high speeds
because<00:03:14.969> it's<00:03:15.329> very<00:03:15.780> soft<00:03:16.620> which<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.400> good<00:03:17.609> for

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
because it's very soft which is good for

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.189 
because it's very soft which is good for
beginners<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.359> intermediates<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:19.019> turns

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
beginners and intermediates it turns

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.939 
beginners and intermediates it turns
easy<00:03:19.669> but<00:03:20.669> if<00:03:20.759> I<00:03:20.909> ski<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.449> this<00:03:21.479> is<00:03:21.780> 1100<00:03:22.530> in

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
easy but if I ski like this is 1100 in

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.030 
easy but if I ski like this is 1100 in
like<00:03:23.209> 163<00:03:24.209> centimeters<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.650> shorter

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
like 163 centimeters this is shorter

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.429 
like 163 centimeters this is shorter
than<00:03:26.159> that<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.609> would<00:03:27.419> still<00:03:27.689> be<00:03:27.780> stable<00:03:28.019> at<00:03:28.290> any

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 
than that I would still be stable at any

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.640 
than that I would still be stable at any
speeds<00:03:28.859> because<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.939> ski<00:03:30.180> itself<00:03:30.509> is<00:03:31.259> stiff

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
speeds because the ski itself is stiff

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.129 
speeds because the ski itself is stiff
so<00:03:31.949> it<00:03:32.069> can<00:03:32.220> support<00:03:32.549> speeds<00:03:32.909> but<00:03:33.150> that's<00:03:33.959> a

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
so it can support speeds but that's a

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.159 
so it can support speeds but that's a
different<00:03:34.650> video<00:03:34.889> Johan<00:03:35.819> has<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.239> video<00:03:36.629> and

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
different video Johan has that video and

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:38.659 
different video Johan has that video and
the<00:03:37.530> most<00:03:37.709> important<00:03:38.099> thing<00:03:38.189> about<00:03:38.340> ski

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
the most important thing about ski

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:44.149 
the most important thing about ski
sizing<00:03:39.150> 11:9<00:03:39.509> sports<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:42.169> it's<00:03:43.169> like<00:03:43.439> right

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
sizing 11:9 sports is it's like right

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.780 
sizing 11:9 sports is it's like right
above<00:03:44.459> my<00:03:44.849> head<00:03:44.879> like<00:03:45.780> half<00:03:46.259> of<00:03:46.439> the<00:03:46.590> page<00:03:46.829> is

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
above my head like half of the page is

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.610 
above my head like half of the page is
way<00:03:48.090> better<00:03:48.299> advice<00:03:48.720> than<00:03:48.750> anything<00:03:49.349> I'm

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
way better advice than anything I'm

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.319 
way better advice than anything I'm
telling<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:50.099> just<00:03:50.370> punching<00:03:50.909> the<00:03:51.000> numbers

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
telling you just punching the numbers

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.080 
telling you just punching the numbers
there<00:03:51.709> see<00:03:52.709> what<00:03:52.919> results<00:03:53.310> come<00:03:53.519> up<00:03:53.639> see<00:03:54.060> if

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
there see what results come up see if

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.809 
there see what results come up see if
the<00:03:54.299> top<00:03:54.569> two<00:03:54.810> skis<00:03:55.199> you<00:03:55.229> like<00:03:55.639> they're<00:03:56.639> gonna

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
the top two skis you like they're gonna

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.550 
the top two skis you like they're gonna
probably<00:03:57.150> be<00:03:57.449> pretty<00:03:57.629> good<00:03:57.780> if<00:03:58.199> you<00:03:58.349> still
