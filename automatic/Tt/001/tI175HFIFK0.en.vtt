00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.210
 Talk to me, everyone. 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.300
 I'm a pessi renan I'm here with my 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.580
 My friend Felipe is all well and tonight. 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.870
 people will bleed the brakes of the 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.070
 My car world 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.009
 some time ago I had changed 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.240
 rear brake cylinder and how to 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.859
 I was alone I could not make a 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.449
 Bleeding work so good, huh? 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.550
 although there are some kits that 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.550
 lets you do the work yourself 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.470
 it's ideal to do the work in two people 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.899
 so what will happen is that it will 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.899
 stay here in the driver's seat 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.090
 I'm going down there on the brake bleeder. 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.280
 sometimes with April I'll tell you it's okay 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.960
 stepping on the brake will step on until the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.210
 Last 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.340
 about three four times so it was talk 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.649
 to separate teams until the end and to 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.109
 and then I'll close the 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.570
 bleeding and ready is a job well 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.789
 simple but you will see how I go 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.449
 do I'm going to take this wheel for 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.609
 improve viewing and good c'mon 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.929
 begin 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.220
 Good guys, the first step here. 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.920
 in front of the car 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.229
 we will do what will open here the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.240
 the brake fluid cap with 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.650
 careful not to let anything fall in 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.470
 not here to mess 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.140
 then we will complete with a 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.110
 bit of brake fluid that 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.000
 maybe I already have mine I was 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.630
 using 1.3 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.799
 this is the fluid in the wave, so the 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.960
 people will complete just a little bit 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.950
 Because we're going to spend a little bit 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.020
 at the time of bleeding 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.740
 I will not download one is put a bit of 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.899
 Bread goes down a lot and people cover it 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.520
 all field edinho the cover and the 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.729
 fluid you can cry leave 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.659
 Up and there we go and make sangria now. 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.600
 So 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.380
 So I've already retired the wheel and if we 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.750
 see behind the brake caliper 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.850
 this little screw that we have 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.409
 here a tip up on your 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.939
 bleeding head frei 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.469
 so we 'll do what with a 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.500
 key number 8 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:11.540
 this side here will be very easy 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.480
 central freire where you only have to leave 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.659
 it rains 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.340
 here and there like 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.080
 fluid will leak through here we can 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.239
 put a little flag 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.849
 I'm wearing that hose that is 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:30.209
 I used it for the other video, people. 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:34.610
 You also need a bowl here to 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.840
 To connect the south was to leave, I'm going 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.819
 place the camera on the tripod 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.260
 easy enough for us 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.420
 well then here already connect a hose 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.430
 for us to be able to pick up the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.840
 Brake I'll try to pick up this container. 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.459
 down here 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.220
 and then I'm going to open here not consecrating 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.220
 need to open a lot is only half a turn that 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.500
 It is already good and will fit just right 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.390
 hose 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:06.840
 good, then the felipe can push or 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:13.079
 squeezing may have tried the team until 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:16.620
 the end and we close down here and 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.780
 holy freitas is well and very easy 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.519
 What happened while I was 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.870
 tightening fluid was coming here 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.510
 by the mangueirinha as you can see 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.430
 there dripping there only while you're there 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.840
 in the air we can not close the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.599
 bleeding people have to wait all 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.889
 This one is going to have a lot of bubbles and there 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.109
 at a time when bubbles for this 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:37.590
 That's when we just close the bleeder. 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.200
 up here and is ready bled a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.940
 of the car brakes so now I go 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.799
 lift the rear wheel and show where 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.720
 is the savior of the rear wheel for the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.849
 people do the same service there 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.630
 Good guys, I got the wheel 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.040
 rear 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.880
 I removed it and here behind the cylinder 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.099
 of the rose 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.269
 We can see it up here. 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.940
 already at home filled the tub this here is the 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.329
 Bleeder down here is the brake pipe 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.180
 even here it comes forward and one back 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.949
 in the player and a difference not 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.739
 I know if it is particular of this second that I 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:17.849
 had installed is the size of the screw 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:23.909
 here is a size 9 a key 9 then in the 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:25.650
 front I used a key a key 8 and 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:29.370
 which brings using a key 9 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.970
 I myself the same thing I will open left 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.169
 position the camera here in our 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:40.370
 Pot I think you'll see. 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.370
 best solvency of the beam 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.139
 I think I'll try to position 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.699
 better here I'll be good so I guess 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.710
 so will give to see better than 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.840
 canister with the bandeirinha 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.620
 so the first thing I'm going to do is not 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:05:00.810
 I'll open the bleeder here only half a turn 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:05.479
 here and now you can step on and felipe 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:13.039
 She's being bubbled, she's going to step on it. 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:13.039
 can step on more but it was worse 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:29.130
 She's going very little, she's going to get it. 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:35.479
 the pillar further to the end and to the 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:38.970
 bleeder and is also ready to bleed 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.340
 of the rear brake 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.919
 So that's it, I did the sangria. 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.800
 more to demonstrate how it is done because 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.360
 How could you have seen it difficult to film? 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.650
 while you're doing a job 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.330
 from sandrinha, right? 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.800
 It's over I need two people. 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.860
 to do this job 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.870
 good I still did some things wrong for 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.060
 example on the back wheel 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.750
 I do not think you can bleed 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.639
 rear brake with the hand brake pulled 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.060
 this is kind of obvious right because the brake already 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.860
 It's tight so I went over to the 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.500
 demonstration issue is why 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:17.220
 it left little fluid there in that last part 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.229
 It's good whenever you bleed. 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.210
 pay attention to the fluid level of 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.909
 brake in the box can not lower much 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.440
 because otherwise you start to enter again and 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.159
 there will be much more work to 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.320
 to withdraw this is that he came 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:34.229
 bleator output also uses a 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.320
 Mangueirinha because it will prevent 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:41.500
 between the back 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:44.740
 in the system until you close the secret is 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.280
 much easier as mango and good 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.320
 if the system of fruir of the system of 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.150
 brake was drained completely by 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.180
 example you have to change a part change 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.730
 the master cylinder that is in the world 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.490
 bled brakes again we have to 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.500
 start from the back right side that is 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.990
 which is further from the master cylinder 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.970
 and been training with the back to 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.850
 front of the right and side teacher 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.810
 left making sangria that this 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.570
 scheme 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.000
 and then the car turns green again I go 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.200
 to do more quiet tomorrow, I think 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.090
 Another day and I hope the video has 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.710
 has been of some importance has 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.470
 taught you at least some 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.810
 little thing you may not know the 

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.850
 less a place and the bleeder such that 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:34.840
 People do not have to let it go . 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:37.300
 just my back here in my case I do not know 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:40.690
 if it's going to be a case of any car right? 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.420
 here in front oo the front bleeder 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.650
 a key number 8 and the back one I 

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:50.350
 had bought a new key number 9 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:52.150
 So it 's just to be aware of this and I 

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.590
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.940
 If you liked shows, I liked it and did not. 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.490
 I liked leaving, I did not like a problem 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.320
 if you want to leave any more 

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.690
 information or have any questions you 

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.520
 can leave in comments 

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.350
 and of course do not forget to share 

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.800
 Straight spoke 

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.800
 thanks
