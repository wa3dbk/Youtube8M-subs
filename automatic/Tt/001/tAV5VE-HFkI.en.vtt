00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.079

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.920
 biggest one that has marked you in the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.079
 music without a doubt having played with 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.210

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.940
 February this year for those who always 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.100
 they are asking me where can I 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.840

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.229

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.789
 How would Matthew be if he were a hipster because 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.460
 do not try to put on this hat and 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:21.070
 these glasses you would see best friend 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.140
 and you would be interested in studying music at a 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.240
 professional level or prefer the lyric 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.940
 and you do not prefer to study spelling to 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.860
 a professional level the truth is that yes 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.020
 I studied music I studied with some 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.330
 private teachers and in two schools 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.190
 here in mexico federal district for 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.830
 that are from Mexico you will know what 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.680
 schools I mean how do you like 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.869
 girls I do not have like some kind of girl 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.450
 specifically but I must admit that something 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.460
 that drives me crazy in women is their 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.250
 smile because you got easier in 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.090
 Mario's time for you did not call me anymore to 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.500
 those who do not know my name is Mariano and I think 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.509
 that I have already explained this in some 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.490
 videos but I'll explain it again 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.470
 the graph is the union of my name with 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.970
 my last names that would be Marian 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.710
 acosta garcÃ­a figueroa 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.479
 that's my full name I said it for 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.160
 first time in the flows you knew that 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.410
 they have followers in nicaragua and that you 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.420
 they support a lot as a curious fact my best 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.670
 friend is from Nicaragua I like metal 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.680
 and also justin bieber is sin this 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.870
 the truth is that not in tastes are broken 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.790
 genres and be that you like metal and 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.010
 justin bieber good for you though 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.930
 where do a fucking fucking poster 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.939
 because the guitar caught your attention 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.859
 electric I have a cousin who plays the 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.780
 pretty and pretty electric guitar 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.819
 well and when I was very small I would 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.859
 I'm going to play some solos on the guitar 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.870
 which caught my attention like that 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.209
 that what started as a curiosity and 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.370
 a hobby ended as a profession how many 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.379
 not enough you take a month for those who 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.909
 continue a long time ago they will know that 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.980
 I was before I was a fan of these drinks 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.900
 energy monsters but since 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.939
 November I have not taken absolutely 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.650
 none the main reason for letting 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.239
 this energy drink was for the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.609
 obscenely rude amount of 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.010
 calories that this brought in addition that this 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.780
 drink that is quite expensive although to 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.819
 times and it seems to me when you will organize 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.250
 something similar like what fine arts 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.590
 about a year ago I organized a 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.629
 coexistence of fans in fine arts here 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.939
 in Mexico federal district next to 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.889
 Indian be this year I plan to do something 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.079
 similar but with more bloggers so that 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:19.090
 this is really worthwhile is something that 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.040
 I've been planning these days where 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.109
 and when will the next meeting of 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.239
 I want to record a video with you but 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.610
 I am a minor, it could be because it is 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.770
 a porn video 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.060
 how old are you? 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.360

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.830
 purpose of the new millennium 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.680
 I've been playing the guitar for 14 years 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.050
 lucasfilm that is neophyte to true 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.720
 because you do not explain what you are 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.390
 good i mean you mean 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.970
 and especially because there are no blogs so 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.740
 followed the blogs leave every Friday and 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.780
 If sometimes I do not have time, they leave in 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.040
 Saturday or Sunday but pretty much 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.930
 you have told me that you want more 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.910

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.670
 Question they want more videos per week 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.170

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.990
 greetings akrach for to be you 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.850
 same as they are constant with your channel 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.739
 do not expect a million subscribers and 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.049
 a million views with just one 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.700
 or two videos everything is proof maybe 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.980
 later I'll make a video giving 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.260
 tips for new youtubers good 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.330
 If you have what was your first love, 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.400
 first love or my first novelty was the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.770
 keyboardist of my first hand and this what 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.750
 I tell a little more detail in the subway 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.060
 my life in case you like to go see it 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.220
 to leave the link here, so 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.200
 It happened with rotten fried chips 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.150
 rotten was a virtual band that had 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.520
 here on youtube this band will come back to 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.080
 this channel but with another name the reason 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.460
 why I gave the videos of low of 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.530
 youtube was because I was never comfortable 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.540
 with the editing quality of these 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.230
 videos but as I told you this project 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.020
 will return in these coming days so 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.030
 what you most hate about you 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.040
 that I am a distracted a complete 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.410
 clueless you can ask my 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.690
 closest friends that so 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.910
 clueless I am another of the things that most 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.160
 I detest myself is that wherever I go 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.870
 heading something as it was called your first 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.180
 band my first band had a name 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.090
 quite quite strange and it was called 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.070
 suspend and why suspend the 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.600
 reasons are very stupid but in that 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.040
 then when we were looking for a 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.500
 man for that band the vocalist 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.170
 I was about to turn off the computer when 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.760
 this one asked you want to suspend this 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.440
 session and how were we guys 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.990
 covered with very very little intelligence 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.450
 father still would not be the band 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.830
 called to suspend and then the 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.420
 name of my first band after 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.970
 We decided to change the name of the band 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.250
 to learn their and intelligently was 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.740
 Suspend backwards as it makes you feel 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.900
 have 20,000 subscribers honestly 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.210
 It makes me feel very special and how 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.190
 I said at the beginning of this video I continue without 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.810
 believe that 20,000 people follow this one 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.310
 main that makes videos and plays the guitar 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.260
 than what began with simple curiosity 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.090
 and simple relax 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.830
 that has become a passion in 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.810
 a passion that I love to share with 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.450
 all of you and I want you to know that 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.310

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.140

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.630
 work and if in you really 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.700
 believe me there would not be a graph has 20 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.740
 thousand subscribers and we started to get 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.690
