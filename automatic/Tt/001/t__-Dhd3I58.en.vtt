can<00:02:12.060> show<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.260> told<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.830> folks

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
can show it to you but I told the folks

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.160 
can show it to you but I told the folks
at<00:02:14.160> straight<00:02:14.400> I'll<00:02:14.730> talk<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.690> really

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
at straight I'll talk to that I really

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.750 
at straight I'll talk to that I really
think<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.530> knife<00:02:16.800> blurs<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.459> line<00:02:17.730> between

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
think this knife blurs the line between

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.180 
think this knife blurs the line between
assisted<00:02:18.599> opening<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.110> automatic<00:02:19.680> knife<00:02:19.860> and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
assisted opening and automatic knife and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.589 
assisted opening and automatic knife and
really<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.670> only<00:02:20.819> difference<00:02:21.030> between<00:02:21.300> this

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
really the only difference between this

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.010 
really the only difference between this
and<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.080> where<00:02:22.739> this<00:02:22.920> one<00:02:23.450> opens<00:02:24.450> you

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
and that is where this one opens you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.400 
and that is where this one opens you
have<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.230> manually<00:02:25.560> retract<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:28.320> know

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
have to manually retract it the you know

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.230 
have to manually retract it the you know
a<00:02:28.440> true<00:02:28.890> automatic<00:02:29.460> out<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.700> front

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
a true automatic out of front

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.150 
a true automatic out of front
praxis<00:02:30.540> self-retracting<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.830> other<00:02:31.920> thing

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
praxis self-retracting the other thing

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.230 
praxis self-retracting the other thing
this<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.520> only<00:02:32.670> other<00:02:32.820> thing<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.090> really

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
this the only other thing is really

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.060 
this the only other thing is really
different<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:34.260> got<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.590> track<00:02:34.860> here

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
different is it's got this track here

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.100 
different is it's got this track here
that<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> retractor<00:02:35.940> runs<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.330> if<00:02:36.720> you've<00:02:36.930> got

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
that the retractor runs in if you've got

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.270 
that the retractor runs in if you've got
your<00:02:37.230> hands<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.710> way<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.040> when<00:02:38.190> you

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
your hands in the way of that when you

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.180 
your hands in the way of that when you
open<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:39.510> see<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.780> gets<00:02:40.410> in<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.560> way<00:02:40.590> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
it actually it's still got pretty strong

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.710

possible<00:03:40.170> but<00:03:40.740> it's<00:03:41.160> definitely<00:03:41.580> not<00:03:41.790> easy

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
possible but it's definitely not easy

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.060 
possible but it's definitely not easy
and<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.930> particular<00:03:43.380> version<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.740> double

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
and this particular version is double

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.700 
and this particular version is double
edged<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:45.180> like<00:03:46.050> everything<00:03:46.440> else<00:03:46.560> I've

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
edged and like everything else I've

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.950 
edged and like everything else I've
gotten<00:03:46.950> from<00:03:47.010> shrade<00:03:47.340> in<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.550> last<00:03:47.760> year<00:03:48.060> it's

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960 
gotten from shrade in the last year it's

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.090 
gotten from shrade in the last year it's
got<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.110> really<00:03:49.350> really<00:03:49.560> good<00:03:49.680> edge<00:03:49.920> and<00:03:50.070> I

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
got a really really good edge and I

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.080 
got a really really good edge and I
don't<00:03:50.190> know<00:03:50.310> if<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:50.520> see<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.940> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
don't know if you can see that the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.700 
don't know if you can see that the
profile<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.690> blade<00:03:51.930> but<00:03:52.140> it's<00:03:52.260> just<00:03:52.410> smooth

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
profile that blade but it's just smooth

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.170 
profile that blade but it's just smooth
and<00:03:52.860> even<00:03:53.330> very<00:03:54.330> sharp<00:03:54.600> very<00:03:55.140> smooth<00:03:56.180> just

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and even very sharp very smooth just

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.700 
and even very sharp very smooth just
works<00:03:57.390> like<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.570> champ<00:03:57.840> another<00:03:58.470> thing<00:03:58.650> I

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
works like a champ another thing I

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.550 
works like a champ another thing I
really<00:03:58.830> think<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.190> cool<00:03:59.400> this<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:01.320> glass

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
really think is cool this the glass

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.220 
really think is cool this the glass
breaker<00:04:01.890> on<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.220> end<00:04:02.370> here<00:04:02.580> okay<00:04:03.230> functions

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
breaker on the end here okay functions

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.070 
breaker on the end here okay functions
as<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.470> hold<00:04:05.010> down<00:04:05.160> bolt<00:04:05.400> for<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.720> pocket

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
as the hold down bolt for the pocket

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.360 
as the hold down bolt for the pocket
clip<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.470> it's<00:04:07.590> got<00:04:07.710> a<00:04:07.740> hole<00:04:07.950> in<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.220> you

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
clip and it's got a hole in it so you

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.160 
clip and it's got a hole in it so you
can<00:04:08.490> stick<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.700> pin<00:04:08.910> or<00:04:09.090> needle<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.330> nail<00:04:10.050> or

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
can stick a pin or needle a nail or

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.020 
can stick a pin or needle a nail or
something<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.500> there<00:04:10.620> unscrew<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.220> just

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
something in there unscrew it and just

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.210 
something in there unscrew it and just
reverse<00:04:12.330> this<00:04:12.540> pocket<00:04:12.780> clip<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.980> this<00:04:14.070> is

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
reverse this pocket clip and this is

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.470 
reverse this pocket clip and this is
definitely<00:04:14.460> not<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.670> bushcraft<00:04:15.090> knife<00:04:15.270> this<00:04:15.360> is

definitely not a bushcraft knife this is

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.460 
definitely not a bushcraft knife this is
something<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> little<00:04:15.900> different<00:04:16.290> for<00:04:16.320> this

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
something a little different for this

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.830 
something a little different for this
channel<00:04:16.770> maybe<00:04:16.920> but<00:04:17.700> it's<00:04:18.359> definitely<00:04:18.720> pretty

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
channel maybe but it's definitely pretty

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.039 
channel maybe but it's definitely pretty
cool<00:04:18.960> tactical<00:04:19.500> knife<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.750> do<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.780> little<00:04:21.930> bit

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
cool tactical knife and do a little bit

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
of knife stuff with it I'm not gonna

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.370 
of knife stuff with it I'm not gonna
beat<00:04:23.280> on<00:04:23.400> with<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.700> obviously<00:04:24.000> one<00:04:24.360> thing<00:04:24.540> that

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.530 
beat on with it obviously one thing that
I<00:04:25.500> don't<00:04:25.860> think<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:26.790> is<00:04:26.820> going<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.150> be<00:04:27.300> really

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
I don't think this is going to be really

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.780 
I don't think this is going to be really
useful<00:04:27.930> for<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.380> lighting<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.340> fire<00:04:29.520> steel

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
unless you use the edge obviously the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.350 
unless you use the edge obviously the
eggs<00:04:31.860> will<00:04:32.010> scrape<00:04:32.190> or<00:04:32.370> fire<00:04:32.520> still<00:04:32.790> we're<00:04:33.330> not

design<00:05:27.600> for<00:05:27.810> but<00:05:28.020> let's<00:05:28.560> just<00:05:28.710> see<00:05:28.880> okay<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.090> I

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
design for but let's just see okay so I

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.040 
design for but let's just see okay so I
got<00:05:30.360> a<00:05:30.390> little<00:05:30.450> piece<00:05:30.600> of<00:05:30.780> wood<00:05:30.900> here

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
got a little piece of wood here

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.150 
got a little piece of wood here
something<00:05:31.290> what<00:05:31.380> kind<00:05:31.560> of<00:05:31.590> yes<00:05:31.710> it's<00:05:31.890> kind<00:05:32.130> of

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
something what kind of yes it's kind of

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.520 
something what kind of yes it's kind of
damp<00:05:32.370> but<00:05:32.580> just<00:05:33.270> see<00:05:33.420> this<00:05:34.050> thing<00:05:34.110> would<00:05:34.350> carve

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
damp but just see this thing would carve

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.500 
damp but just see this thing would carve
some<00:05:34.650> feathers<00:05:34.950> anyway<00:05:35.310> I<00:05:38.180> mean<00:05:39.180> I<00:05:39.210> don't<00:05:39.270> see

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
some feathers anyway I mean I don't see

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.590 
some feathers anyway I mean I don't see
why<00:05:39.630> I<00:05:39.660> wouldn't<00:05:39.870> it's<00:05:40.020> very<00:05:40.560> sharp

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.280 

again<00:05:45.600> that's<00:05:45.690> not<00:05:45.810> really<00:05:45.930> what<00:05:46.170> it's

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
again that's not really what it's

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.200 
again that's not really what it's
designed<00:05:46.380> for<00:05:46.680> this<00:05:47.460> is<00:05:47.580> not<00:05:47.700> a<00:05:47.730> bushcraft

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
designed for this is not a bushcraft

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
knife this it's a great job he's a

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.530 
knife this it's a great job he's a
little<00:05:53.010> photo<00:05:53.160> stick<00:05:53.400> here<00:05:54.920> see<00:05:55.920> that<00:05:56.130> so<00:05:56.540> that

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
little photo stick here see that so that
