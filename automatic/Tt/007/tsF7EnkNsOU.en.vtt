00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.910
 Hi, welcome to the board in this class. 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.619
 let's connect some concepts that are 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.070
 related to viruses and diseases 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.090
 human beings as if it were a great summary 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 OK 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.530
 well we know that there is a great 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.580
 variety of viruses and that many of these 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:34.170
 viruses can contaminate animals and animals 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.370
 such as dogs bats birds 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.109
 ok then how can we relate 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.550
 animal viruses 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:48.929
 we know that many viruses can 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:52.859
 contaminate many species of animals 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:56.699
 but there is also a relationship between 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:01:00.690
 virus animals that people right 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.019
 mainly because there is a relationship 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.990
 very close between some species of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.119
 animals and humans 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.909
 especially when we think of 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.909
 domestic animals chickens ducks 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.060
 cats dogs etc. 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.500
 because of this relationship, which can 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.920
 many animals can happen 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.109
 transmit the virus to people and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.600
 usually this virus transmission 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:35.369
 is related to the transmission of 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 diseases and is any type of disease 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:42.240
 good are several diseases but these diseases 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.750
 receives a special name when the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.369
 diseases that afflict people are 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.020
 transmitted by animals 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.109
 these diseases are called zoonoses and 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.679
 how are diseases caused by viruses 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:01.710
 these diseases are called 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:06.030
 zoonoses want to see an example 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:09.479
 rabies is an example of viral zoonosis 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.770
 she attacks humans is provoked by 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.890
 a virus and it is transmitted for example 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.830
 by dogs, that is, how a 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.270
 transfer from an animal to another. 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.540
 A person 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.840
 rabies is classified as a zoonosis 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.890
 viral and these animals 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.420
 these animals because they are transmitters of 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.110
 diseases are also 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.310
 Special 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.530
 they are classified as 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.860
 natural reservoirs of disease or 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.460
 natural reservoirs of viruses and 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.040
 to know the greatest curiosity 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.820
 virus reservoir for the species 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.990
 human being is the man himself looks at 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.170
 interesting 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.760
 we are viral reservoirs 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.450
 for example we are reservoirs of 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.970
 hepatitis a 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:14.670
 we are reservoirs of measles rubella and 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.110
 girls have to pay close attention to 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.530
 rubella 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.560
 we are also reservoirs of the virus of the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:27.030
 flu virus aids 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.300
 Look, we can transmit 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.440
 for other human beings various types 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.680
 of diseases 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.470
 and you know what's most interesting some 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.990
 of these diseases were previously restricted 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.130
 only to animals 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:47.280
 but it was precisely this proximity 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:50.250
 between men and animals that made 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.670
 many of these diseases 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.160
 virus attack without cells as well 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.470
 that the videos 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.430
 suffer many mutations 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.420
 these new viruses can 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.870
 adapted to the man being then 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:14.040
 transferred from animals to humans and 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:16.830
 was the man who caused this 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.840
 approach to animals 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:23.060
 mainly because man causes 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.840
 changes in the environment 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.980
 changes that will lead to degradation 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:36.630
 environment and because of this degradation 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:40.080
 animals are leaving their 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:43.710
 their natural habitats are living together 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.530
 in the midst of man and the transmission as 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.220
 this virus transmission 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.500
 animals for people or between people is 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.730
 good and there are different forms of it 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:01.910
 happen it can happen for example 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:05.100
 through touch or through secretions 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.010
 usually viruses that are transmitted 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.620
 by touch or secretions are lives that do not 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.010
 survive outside the body of the 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.610
 host is the case for example the virus 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.570
 which causes eps and also of the virus of the 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.930
 aids 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.360
 viruses that are more resistant than 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:28.290
 survive longer in the environment can 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.980
 be transmitted for example through the 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:36.060
 soil and water are usually viruses that 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:40.320
 are released by feces as is the case 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:43.380
 e.g. hepatitis e is 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.800
 then these videos stay on the ground in the 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:50.280
 water and contaminates food 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.970
 sun contaminated people manipulate sun 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:58.370
 and lack of personal hygiene facilitates 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:02.490
 contamination and there are also the 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.990
 Many videos vectors are streamed 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.919
 by vectors 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.570
 This is the case, for example, of yellow fever and 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.300
 also of dengue 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:15.450
 these two viral diseases are 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.630
 transmitted by mosquitoes that when 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.590
 pica the man left the particles there 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.410
 viral 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.230
 these mosquitoes are the vectors 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:28.410
 disease transmitters 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.660
 good staff here we have several advices 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.150
 important especially for 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.650
 you can understand the diseases 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.020
 viral 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.680
 these viral diseases 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:42.080
 you can see in our classes of 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:45.639
 parasitology our class ends with 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.639
 Stay here and study here.
