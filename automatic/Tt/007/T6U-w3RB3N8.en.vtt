00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 sometimes a video game can be weird 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.080
 and can be developed in an environment 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.719
 creepy and creepy video games 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.000
 stranger and little known are these 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.000
 that you will see below enjoy 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.780
 and the 'resident evil' games are the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.290
 most known and most talked about but the 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:28.020
 4 secrets secrets the resident evil 4 is 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.750
 the best of the saga and the darkest by 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.480
 example the group of people that we kill 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.900
 through the game are not zombies like 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.090
 it seems they are really people is a 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.790
 group called the enlightened ones that in the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.559
 real life if the enlightened ones existed 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.989
 they return to life as normal as 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.790
 can agriculture attend the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.100
 worship services in the local church 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.530
 as guards of the palace of 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.300
 salazar or work the mines that's why 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.280
 we see that in the game the villagers 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.680
 when they ring the bell they go to the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.630
 church to pray and we see that the site 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.140
 it is abandoned and also the houses 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:08.060
 are damaged now I ask you would you play 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.060
 resident evil 4 in the same way 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.030
 the luigi's mansion of a game of 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.670
 adventures for several have played it 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.399
 It has been a good game but it has a 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.409
 very dark story ahead the game 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.750
 is about our protagonist luigi 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.819
 that curiously wins a mansion 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.520
 due to a contest that never entered 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:34.130
 luigi calls mario invites him to celebrate 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.109
 to his new mansion mario accepts and leaves 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.899
 to the mansion to surprise him 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:41.359
 wifi mario is abducted by the king duo and 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.329
 luigi has to save him after that 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:45.079
 I will not tell anymore the rest is history in 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.209
 the game 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.090
 luigi must capture ghosts to 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.399
 reach the king and rescue marlo in 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.129
 beta phase of the game was to be rescued 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.420
 mario in 24 hours if you do not rescue it you go 

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:58.610
 in that period of time 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.099
 the mansion disappeared and luigi 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.289
 I would appear as a depressed zombie 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.750
 also the clock that appeared to us was the 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.579
 time when mario was to be rescued 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.859
 suppose that if you suck you go the 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.290
 picture where mario appears he shouted 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:15.200
 with a very spooky voice and mario 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.660
 I said to Luigi in a strange voice because 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.590
 does not rescue me this brother now you 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.450
 I ask 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.450
 would you dare to play luigi's mansion 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.829
 zelda majora's mask you can say that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.439
 it is the darkest game in the franchise 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.140
 of zelda the game presents a story 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.970
 unusual for a cell title instead 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.709
 to pass in the land of hair rubber 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.900
 like most zelda games 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.870
 Lynn has his adventure on earth 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.790
 determines a world parallel to hajri with 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.730
 many physically identical characters 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.950
 to the characters of ocarina oscar the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.959
 game is about link that should help 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.720
 a seller of masks to recover his 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.420
 mask but behind that mask it 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.970
 they hide many secrets the story of the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.370
 seller tells us something like this the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.889
 mask that I have been robbed is called the 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.389
 Improvement mask is a cursed object 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.400
 of the legend that says it has been 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.829
 used by an ancient tribe in their 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.930
 rituals it is said that an evil and 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.329
 perverse power is granted to whoever carries 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.220
 the mask according to legend the 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.079
 problems caused by the mask 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.260
 improvement were so great that 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.819
 ancestors for fear of such catastrophe 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.510
 They sealed the mask in the shadows to 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.220
 always to prevent its misuse 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.379
 now that tribe of legend has 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.269
 disappeared so nobody knows 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.299
 really the true nature of 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.310
 power of the mask but I'm sorry there 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.099
 a missing piece in the history of 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.890
 seller if the mask was sealed away 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.989
 because the seller is worried we have to 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.760
 suppose that the seller himself broke the 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.950
 seal that released to prison improvement 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.540
 believing that I could do better 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.269
 I work protecting the evil 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.640
 artifact this does not seem to have any 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.950
 meaning but the game omits this detail 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.250
 at the beginning I leave you with a question 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.450
 who is the seller of masks because 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.450
 he knows so much about improvement 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.470
 the game of art world is a game rpg 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.420
 normal but its history is half rare the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.210
 game is about what you should save the 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.670
 world of an alien called gigas the 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:26.040
 which one wants to destroy the world what 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.380
 gigas weirder is that no body no 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.500
 he has a heart he has no life he is nothing 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.750
 it's just badness the weirdest thing is that when 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.440
 we get to gigas this one tells us about a 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:41.460
 strange way tells us to help me month 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.250
 month month nor are you as if you wanted me to 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.140
 help but he does not know how to be rumored 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.300
 that gigas may have been an abortion 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.480
 because of how he behaves and talks to us 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.780
 through the fight I ask them what is 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.150
 gigas is actually an abortion because 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.060
 wants to destroy the world does it with 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.760
 good intentions I hope you have them 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.800
 liked the video sorry for not uploading 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.900
 videos every day is that the school 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.540
 has busy and few times 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.210
 I can upload a video I promise to upload 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.000
 more videos in this month of terror like this 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.129
 I forgot I brought them this channel is from 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.289

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:22.020
 who makes parody and criticism videos 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.209
