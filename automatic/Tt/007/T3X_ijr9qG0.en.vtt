00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.640
 what am I currently preparing a video 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.680
 a bit special for my 50 subscribers 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 so I invite damage to share this 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.309
 video leaked and ask your questions 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.790
 in the comments or just 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.360
 to encourage me in the comments 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.460
 today it's going to be a video on the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.600
 creation how to make oneself a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.690
 incubator for the eyes makes them the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.100
 pardon eyes of gold crickets often 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.989
 we manage to have them but we do not arrive 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.570
 not to hatch it can happen 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.800
 it happened to me guys 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.039
 before each time I decided to 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.140
 make this video for you so there already 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.750
 it is done so I'll remove all 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.360
 that way I'll be able to talk to you 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.220
 materials that you need so everything 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.070
 first you need a plastic tray a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.200
 bac blue I am a classic bac haj 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.250
 decaux so there I have this side all 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.280
 just because they were open 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.610
 so enough to make even a little sun 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.790
 are not totally hermetic 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.009
 here it is an old I was so here 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.930
 for the first the first search 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.729
 then you need one or two mats 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.630
 warming up so I put two of two 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.150
 heating mat 2 at home you see the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.759
 head directly plays so for that you 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.770
 do you have it you're going to have to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.570
 the scotcher where the colleges they are 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.930
 nine months is not to be a work of 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.280
 the escaut then makes you need some 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.100
 scot tissues so the town hall the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.500
 time as lids from boxes of 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.570
 pencils and boxes of crickets so 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.450
 our forgiveness and a fogger a 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.450
 humidifier so our goal is going 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.629
 to be having a maximum of moisture a 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.520
 good temperature for the games of 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.790
 field crickets as far as they 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.680
 get drowned 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.140
 often when it's closed we have 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.239
 condensation and especially the towers so 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.040
 he condensing deschamps the little ones 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.230
 long walk in a millimeter of water 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.590
 and Chinese result he bursts 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.959
 short is not the goal so for that we 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.970
 will create boxes to recover the 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.319
 crickets and boxes for and moistened 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.390
 so to moisten you will take 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.060
 your cricket box that has small 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.280
 holes there and there on two sides there are some 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.920
 do not talk about that it does not look 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.170
 important but it will be so you 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.000
 go put a tissue in one or 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:03:00.040
 two years is only one in the zones 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:03.750
 of endemic 2 that's it and humidified yes I 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.069
 am probably no problem at the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.439
 conca will have to do it very regularly 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.730
 about once by agreement to keep 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:14.019
 and militate confirmed makes that moisture 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.870
 it's finally the heat created by the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:21.340
 carpet will evaporate slowly 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.180
 the water into water vapor so create a 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.229
 limited area 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.720
 it's a bit the same role well 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:29.019
 of incubator so to go to place the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.449
 box above the carpets so there he 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.479
 is the two more they done 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:38.440
 flash that like that and like that like that 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:39.819
 I have three boxes not then our goal 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.590
 it's going to be recovering the hailstones and 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.269
 that a wetland is needed, so go 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.159
 take 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.949
 so my summer bottom boxes used 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.859
 so you only have a gueugnon box 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:53.079
 normal with small wheels on one side 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.629
 and a second on the second you 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.620
 will do when I do not want to do you 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.900
 because at one round it's a real task 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.310
 is hard you've placed scot for 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:07.000
 plug all holes all holes there 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.400
 and there my ticket I coach then you 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.060
 go take the other box that has 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.060
 holes on one side and really place the 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.500
 little holes there opposite the little ones 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.599
 box water holes to avoid when 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.039
 they go out there they grow old 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.529
 stuck on the code in the small wheels 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.500
 like that the little names will hatch there 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:29.080
 in actually they will stay in 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.729
 you're going to go out fell to the bottom 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.469
 for some links and get me to 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.240
 go out at the top but they're going to be 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.800
 recovered in the box and julie boulet 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.800
 of the franchise will not drown but this 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.710
 who will be a minority so I was going 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:48.490
 place and that like that and then put 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:56.010
 your lid so then with the 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:05:01.950
 finger you see there we have to put them 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:05.349
 text in then you will take 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.680
 your eyes the lectern at places so of 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:10.750
 connect open old boxes and 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.050
 placards in so cat you put 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.060
 in 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.400
 I have already done so the pace you 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.510
 do and you place the holes well at 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.449
 the opposite and then you close what 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.639
 does that moisture created by carpets 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.469
 and the tissues that will come out 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.770
 little holes of the boxes are going to be there 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:31.720
 not returned but Dad to talk 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.460
 side part 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.310
 away from the two boxes the day that 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.110
 haunt and boxes then go back in there 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.020
 in 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.550
 in there then went back into the 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.800
 holes in the box to keep the box 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:50.410
 wet without the rays 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:53.320
 do not then tac tac tac 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.150
