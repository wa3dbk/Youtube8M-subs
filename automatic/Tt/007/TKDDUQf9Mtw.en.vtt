00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.130
 nor do we do a theory of 3 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.200
 yes, we have just received the trailer already 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.910
 several theories have appeared on the internet 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.910
 What is this about? 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.930
 I'll explain to you my 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.910
 theory about what it is or who it is 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.070
 doll but it fills everything they want in the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.710
 golden set to sign up for the channel and 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.390
 have more theories like this and also follow 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.210
 on social networks that are on the screen 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.440
 there I put things that before a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.480
 series that the channel then you can 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.579
 keep track of the things that will come out before 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.969
 to launch on the channel but without further ado 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.980
 let 's theory we will not have a new one 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.469
 animatronic the old man wants his 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.600
 extremely moving appearance if 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.760
 showing a lot of classical pursuit of the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.550
 fight night fred what took a lot of people 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.170
 to consider who this doll is many 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.090
 assume it was a kind of golden 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.879
 donin but I have a little vision 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.539
 more obscure about this to analyze 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.550
 my vision 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.030
 Let's try to find out where it goes. 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.710
 this game and where it stays in chronology 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.810
 according to extinguishing light was 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.720
 revealed pot in the history of the game that is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.240
 written in English and is as follows 30 years 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.409
 have passed since asking for pizza 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.960
 closed its doors 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.759
 the events that took place there do not 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.979
 have become nothing more than a 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.340
 a children's story but the owners of 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.650
 I know the terror attraction is coming 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.200
 determined to revive the legend and do 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.970
 the most authentic experience possible for 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 your customers going to great 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.140
 distances to find here may have 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.799
 survived decades of neglect and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.420
 ruin 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.280
 which we can analyze its part of the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 story is that apparently this game 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.439
 will pass after the other two in the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.579
 chronology and the owners of the place are 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.640
 trying to transform an old 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.619
 restaurant in a performance of 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.810
 more bizarre than they are 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.460
 willing to go after everything that can 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.710
 to remember the events that occurred in the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.420
 past games more mysterious than me 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.570
 I see in this area are two points 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.700
 first the great distances by the fact 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.069
 from the text if you notice that they are 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.289
 literally willing to do everything to 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.490
 to be able to live the events that occurred in 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.270
 past games and that I say everything 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.040
 it's all the second point is fesbe flight 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.840
 place really turned into a 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.460
 of tourist attraction what 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.240
 shows that a lot of bad things are going 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.040
 to happen 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.340
 imagine a tourist attraction with 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.360
 people who see cursed dolls do not 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.580
 will work 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.250
 after separating globe we saw the following 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.920
 first plane only empty shells 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.990
 then the hand after the hook after the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.720
 doll but then a remarkable discovery 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.490
 was made before we went ahead of you 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.100
 we are going to analyze essentially what 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.840
 we have seen here or apparently with what 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.940
 presented here in the text were 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.180
 various parts of the dolls are found 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.520
 old in these searches by the owners and they 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.950
 found many references of the games 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.320
 past, such as the hook that 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.960
 I think I'm selling animatronic fox if 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.110
 I 'm not sure but the subject is 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.480
 this hook is part of the climatological 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.670
 on a doll other things indicate 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.610
 other parts of other dolls 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.870
 were found separated by there and there 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.330
 we have seen an extremely 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.690
 interesting in the last paragraph written 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.360
 the following attraction now only has one 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.810
 animal tonic watch 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.220
 yes you ask yourself what it's like, just have one 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.670
 atomic animal 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.110
 well let me explain with my theory 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.110
 first I believe that if a 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.820
 chronic animal is a junction of all 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.550
 other parts that have been found 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.770
 by the owners of the feb flight they 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.930
 found the parties joined all 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.690
 in that doll that appears in the trailer 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.600
 believe all this text we you 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:53.440
 this adventure in quotation marks that were 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.350
 made to find these parts and 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.510
 to put this exposure there are 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.340
 several factors that show it 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.260
 own appearance of the trailer in which 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.970
 we saw a heap of pieces that were 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.560
 attached to one another 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.470
 through a series of objects that 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.590
 help and also the rudimentary form that 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.660
 is every part of the body shows this 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.400
 on the site of the creator we have a photo that 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.200
 resembles all that said 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.049
 we can see all animatronics 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.870
 stacked partly in a carton 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.120
 as if they were several separate things 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.490
 be used after 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.680
 one very dark thing happens 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.449
 commonly light photoshop photo 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.760
 we used the brightness effect in the 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.750
 photoshop we have the image of the 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.790
 trailer 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.430
 a little higher up where you are 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.040
 now something else when we went to save the 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.680
 file it has the following name which 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.630
 we can use ours we use our own 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.479
 filename indicates that what they 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.750
 could use on dolls they used 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:55.570
 to create this new doll of 3 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.030
 So I'll tell you who this doll is. 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.430
 doll as I said are all the others 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.080
 dolls that will pass an exhibition 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.300
 of terror and we probably controlled a 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.669
 character who is a local guard and we saw 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.949
 belts myths to the children of the 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.620
 old fesp pizza are real and are 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.180
 all in one the doll waits for 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.039
 make one more victim 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.830
 but this is just a theory made with a 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.479
 game a gamer is subscribe to the channel 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.580
 clicking the fred goal for more 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.610
 theories and a favorite video that this will 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.840
 help very much also click 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.940
 in the other theories that are appearing 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.639
 there is another theory that the son of 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.900
 fas net fed also other theories 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.360
 scary 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.360
 Thank you so much, that's good.
