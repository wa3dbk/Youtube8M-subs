00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
okay now we want to take a look at how

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.639 
okay now we want to take a look at how
animated<00:00:05.400> masks<00:00:06.120> work<00:00:06.480> inside<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.020> flash<00:00:07.379> so

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
animated masks work inside a flash so

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.980 
animated masks work inside a flash so
we're<00:00:07.799> gonna<00:00:07.890> combine<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.910> shape<00:00:09.450> tween<00:00:09.780> we

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
we're gonna combine the shape tween we

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.940 
we're gonna combine the shape tween we
looked<00:00:10.200> at<00:00:10.349> before

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
looked at before

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.999 
looked at before
along<00:00:11.910> with<00:00:12.360> created<00:00:12.990> just<00:00:13.139> an<00:00:13.320> animated<00:00:13.769> mask

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
along with created just an animated mask

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.770 
along with created just an animated mask
in<00:00:14.280> flash<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> very<00:00:15.240> first<00:00:15.450> thing<00:00:15.599> I'm

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
in flash so the very first thing I'm

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.930 
in flash so the very first thing I'm
going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> do<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.379> select<00:00:16.740> create<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> new<00:00:17.730> layer

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
going to do is select create a new layer

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.740 
going to do is select create a new layer
here<00:00:17.970> with<00:00:18.330> my<00:00:18.480> text<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:19.400> a<00:00:20.400> static<00:00:20.910> text

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
here with my text in a static text

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.200 
here with my text in a static text
element<00:00:22.109> here<00:00:22.699> make<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> little<00:00:24.119> bit

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
element here make that a little bit

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.179 
element here make that a little bit
longer<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.480> move<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.080> down<00:00:28.349> towards

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
longer and I will move this down towards

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.080 
longer and I will move this down towards
the<00:00:29.369> center<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.000> my<00:00:30.240> stage<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:31.130> on<00:00:32.130> top<00:00:33.059> of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the center of my stage and on top of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.500 
the center of my stage and on top of
this<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.840> want<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.590> create<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.160> shape<00:00:35.760> tween<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
this I want to create a shape tween to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.500 
this I want to create a shape tween to
reveal<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.980> text<00:00:38.309> element<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.360> going

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
reveal the the text element so I'm going

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.020 
reveal the the text element so I'm going
to<00:00:39.570> create<00:00:39.750> an<00:00:39.960> additional<00:00:40.200> layer<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.920> just

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
to create an additional layer and just

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.970 
to create an additional layer and just
call<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.170> animation<00:00:43.730> and<00:00:45.170> in<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.350> case<00:00:46.590> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
call it animation and in this case I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.110 
call it animation and in this case I
want<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.230> create<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> rectangle<00:00:49.649> tool<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.340> just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
want to create a rectangle tool and just

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.430 
want to create a rectangle tool and just
draw<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.600> about<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.140> about<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.010> size<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
draw it about the about the size of the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.290 
draw it about the about the size of the
first<00:00:56.160> character<00:00:56.550> there<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> stroke<00:00:59.300> so

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
first character there in that stroke so

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.689 
first character there in that stroke so
we'll<00:01:00.480> modify<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.050> about<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> about<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> size

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
we'll modify it about the about the size

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.509 
we'll modify it about the about the size
there<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.180> actually<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.530> kind<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
there I actually want it to be kind of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.899 
there I actually want it to be kind of
start<00:01:05.880> off<00:01:06.090> character<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.130> then

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
start off character like so and then

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.300 
start off character like so and then
what<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.119> will<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.810> create<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> wanted<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
what I will do is create but I wanted to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.850 
what I will do is create but I wanted to
be<00:01:11.430> about<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> second<00:01:12.060> long<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.200> I'll<00:01:13.409> create<00:01:13.710> an

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
be about a second long so I'll create an

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.120 
be about a second long so I'll create an
additional<00:01:14.070> keyframe<00:01:14.790> there<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.740> in<00:01:16.740> this

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
additional keyframe there and in this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.469 
additional keyframe there and in this
case<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.729> want<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.350> modify<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> shape<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.580> this

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
case I want to modify the shape of this

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.590 
case I want to modify the shape of this
graphic<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:23.009> what<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> want<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.820> happen<00:01:24.060> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
graphic so what I want to have happen is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.920 
graphic so what I want to have happen is
come<00:01:24.990> down<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.710> shape<00:01:26.310> tween<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.930> then

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
come down here to shape tween and then

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.910 
come down here to shape tween and then
come<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.560> my<00:01:28.799> final<00:01:29.520> keyframe<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.590> drag<00:01:31.590> this

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
come to my final keyframe and drag this

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.410 
come to my final keyframe and drag this
to<00:01:32.159> stretch<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> way<00:01:33.869> across<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:35.100> so

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
to stretch all the way across like so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
to stretch all the way across like so
now<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.350> happen<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.950> want

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
now what I want to have happen is I want

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.450 
now what I want to have happen is I want
to<00:01:38.460> still<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:38.970> able<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.780> my<00:01:40.020> text<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
to still be able to see my text at the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.420 
to still be able to see my text at the
very<00:01:41.850> end<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.329> animation<00:01:42.810> right<00:01:43.229> now<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
very end of this animation right now it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.370 
very end of this animation right now it
starts<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:45.540> then<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> disappears

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
starts at one but then it disappears

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.109 
starts at one but then it disappears
here<00:01:46.710> through<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> rest<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> animation

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
here through the rest of the animation

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.359 
here through the rest of the animation
so<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.170> case<00:01:49.439> since<00:01:49.619> I'm<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
so in this case since I'm not going to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.020 
so in this case since I'm not going to
change<00:01:51.079> anything<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> text<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.549> just

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
change anything on the text I'm just

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.709 
change anything on the text I'm just
going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.180> press<00:01:54.479> f5<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:56.310> insert<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> frame<00:01:57.360> and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
going to press f5 to insert a frame and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.940 
going to press f5 to insert a frame and
if<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:59.570> hide<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.750> animation<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.680> we'll

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
if we hide the animation like so we'll

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.179 
if we hide the animation like so we'll
notice<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.869> name<00:02:04.110> all<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.070> way

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
notice that we have the name all the way

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.660 
notice that we have the name all the way
from<00:02:05.490> 1<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.969> 24<00:02:06.540> which<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.079> I

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
from 1 to 24 which is what I

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.740 
from 1 to 24 which is what I
then<00:02:08.600> for<00:02:08.960> my<00:02:09.080> shape<00:02:09.350> tween<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:10.180> have<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.210> full

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
then for my shape tween I have a full

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.870 
then for my shape tween I have a full
shape<00:02:12.080> tween<00:02:12.440> kind<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:12.980> stretching<00:02:13.520> across

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
shape tween kind of stretching across

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.870 
shape tween kind of stretching across
the<00:02:14.530> cross<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.710> characters<00:02:16.130> itself<00:02:16.550> all<00:02:16.850> the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
the cross the characters itself all the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.600 
the cross the characters itself all the
way<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.510> Y<00:02:17.720> there<00:02:18.050> now<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.310> very<00:02:19.520> last

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
way to the Y there now the very last

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.090 
way to the Y there now the very last
thing<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.150> want<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.450> do<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:20.750> jump<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.440> my

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
thing I want to do is jump to my

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.390 
thing I want to do is jump to my
animation<00:02:22.760> layer<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.560> simply<00:02:24.560> convert<00:02:25.130> this

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
animation layer and simply convert this

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.750 
animation layer and simply convert this
into<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:26.480> mask<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.860> what's<00:02:28.310> going<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.610> have

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
into a mask so what's going to have

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.590 
into a mask so what's going to have
happen<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:30.650> shape<00:02:31.490> tween<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.150> going<00:02:32.480> to

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
happen is this shape tween is going to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.920 
happen is this shape tween is going to
hide<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.410> characters<00:02:34.010> as<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:35.330> continues

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
hide the characters as it continues

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.660 
hide the characters as it continues
through<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.230> animation<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.400> I'm<00:02:37.459> going<00:02:37.610> to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
through the animation so I'm going to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.449 
through the animation so I'm going to
select<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.150> animation<00:02:38.750> layer<00:02:38.959> itself<00:02:39.459> right

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
select the animation layer itself right

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.470 
select the animation layer itself right
click<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.150> go<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.870> mask<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:43.209> what<00:02:44.209> we'll<00:02:44.300> have

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
click and go to mask and what we'll have

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.220 
click and go to mask and what we'll have
happen<00:02:44.900> here<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.320> it'll<00:02:45.950> actually<00:02:46.390> reveal<00:02:47.390> the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
happen here is it'll actually reveal the

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.800 
happen here is it'll actually reveal the
characters<00:02:48.709> as<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.280> plays<00:02:49.489> through<00:02:49.810> my

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
characters as it plays through my

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.910 
characters as it plays through my
animation<00:02:51.380> with<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.709> mask<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:54.440> if<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.650> wanted

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
animation with the mask and if I wanted

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.699 
animation with the mask and if I wanted
to<00:02:54.980> go<00:02:55.070> back<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.520> tweak<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.060> animation<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:57.650> I

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
to go back and tweak that animation so I

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.270 
to go back and tweak that animation so I
can<00:02:57.920> go<00:02:58.040> back<00:02:58.220> here<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.540> can<00:03:00.280> right-click

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
can go back here and I can right-click

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.410 
can go back here and I can right-click
and<00:03:01.850> deselect<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.570> mask<00:03:02.810> again<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:04.420> insert

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
and deselect a mask again and insert

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.740 
and deselect a mask again and insert
maybe<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:06.020> keyframe<00:03:06.590> here<00:03:07.010> around<00:03:07.459> around<00:03:08.300> 12

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
maybe a keyframe here around around 12

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.780 
maybe a keyframe here around around 12
and<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:10.220> could<00:03:10.459> modify<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:12.070> knob<00:03:13.070> if<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:13.430> wanted

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
and I could modify the knob if I wanted

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.310 
and I could modify the knob if I wanted
to<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:13.940> could<00:03:14.180> go<00:03:14.209> back<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.690> kind<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.900> modify

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
to I could go back and kind of modify

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.140 
to I could go back and kind of modify
that<00:03:15.530> object<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.220> terms<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.640> animation

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
that object in terms of the animation

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.890 
that object in terms of the animation
you'd<00:03:17.440> unlock<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.650> first<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.940> say<00:03:20.660> well

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
you'd unlock that first and say well

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.090 
you'd unlock that first and say well
yeah<00:03:21.140> I<00:03:21.200> wanted<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.560> be<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:22.010> know

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
yeah I wanted to be a you know

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.710 
yeah I wanted to be a you know
approximately<00:03:22.400> right<00:03:22.880> here<00:03:23.330> make<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.660> a

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
approximately right here make it a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.590 
approximately right here make it a
little<00:03:23.900> bit<00:03:23.989> tighter<00:03:24.459> animation<00:03:25.459> so<00:03:26.239> it<00:03:26.390> plays

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
little bit tighter animation so it plays

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.420 
little bit tighter animation so it plays
through<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.110> then<00:03:27.200> I<00:03:27.290> can<00:03:27.470> just<00:03:27.620> quickly<00:03:27.980> go

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
through and then I can just quickly go

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.070 
through and then I can just quickly go
back<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:29.209> mask<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:30.459> switch<00:03:31.459> my<00:03:31.489> animation<00:03:32.180> or

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
back to mask and switch my animation or

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.640 
back to mask and switch my animation or
I<00:03:33.110> can<00:03:33.410> turn<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.709> off<00:03:33.769> once<00:03:34.130> again<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:35.650> click

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
I can turn that off once again and click

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.580 
I can turn that off once again and click
on<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:37.070> layer<00:03:37.700> itself<00:03:38.180> right<00:03:38.959> click<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.560> go

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
on the layer itself right click and go

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.130 
on the layer itself right click and go
to<00:03:40.329> actually<00:03:41.329> we<00:03:41.420> would<00:03:41.600> want<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:41.870> select

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
to actually we would want to select

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.069 
to actually we would want to select
these<00:03:42.410> frames<00:03:42.829> here<00:03:43.480> right<00:03:44.480> click<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.989> go

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
these frames here right click and go

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.670 
these frames here right click and go
reversed<00:03:45.560> frames<00:03:47.079> so<00:03:48.079> then<00:03:48.260> it<00:03:48.380> does<00:03:48.530> the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
reversed frames so then it does the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.370 
reversed frames so then it does the
opposite<00:03:49.160> of<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.340> animation<00:03:49.880> go<00:03:50.870> back<00:03:51.110> to

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
opposite of the animation go back to

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.430 
opposite of the animation go back to
create<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:51.950> mask<00:03:52.160> itself<00:03:52.600> so<00:03:53.600> now<00:03:53.630> it's

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
create the mask itself so now it's

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.250 
create the mask itself so now it's
reversed<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:56.030> either<00:03:56.299> way<00:03:56.540> will<00:03:57.049> work<00:03:57.079> just

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
reversed so either way will work just

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.530 
reversed so either way will work just
fine<00:03:57.560> but<00:03:58.070> that's<00:03:58.730> essentially<00:03:59.329> how<00:03:59.510> you

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
fine but that's essentially how you

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.590 
fine but that's essentially how you
create<00:04:00.079> your<00:04:00.110> your<00:04:00.950> mask<00:04:01.160> or<00:04:01.790> animated<00:04:02.360> mask

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
create your your mask or animated mask

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.240 
create your your mask or animated mask
you<00:04:02.930> would<00:04:03.220> select<00:04:04.220> your<00:04:04.700> select<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.570> new<00:04:05.720> layer

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
you would select your select a new layer

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.390 
you would select your select a new layer
create<00:04:07.250> your<00:04:07.430> animation<00:04:08.030> on<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.720> layer<00:04:08.989> and

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
create your animation on that layer and

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.530 
create your animation on that layer and
simply<00:04:10.400> go<00:04:10.519> back<00:04:10.549> to<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:11.000> layer<00:04:11.209> right<00:04:11.480> click

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
simply go back to that layer right click

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.120 
simply go back to that layer right click
and<00:04:12.110> turn<00:04:12.769> it<00:04:12.920> into<00:04:13.160> a

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
and turn it into a

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.230 
and turn it into a
turning<00:04:14.340> into<00:04:14.460> a<00:04:14.520> mask<00:04:14.850> there<00:04:15.840> you<00:04:15.930> have<00:04:16.080> it
