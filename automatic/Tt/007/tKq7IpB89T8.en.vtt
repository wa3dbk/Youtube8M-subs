not<00:00:28.920> winning<00:00:29.250> too<00:00:29.369> many<00:00:29.460> games<00:00:29.730> were<00:00:29.880> getting

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
into a game it's going to be what is

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.720 
into a game it's going to be what is
this<00:00:54.719> ass<00:00:54.960> 6<00:00:55.710> game<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.340> Division<00:00:56.699> two

this ass 6 game now in Division two

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.209 
this ass 6 game now in Division two
we're<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.660> win<00:00:57.870> two<00:00:58.289> draws<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.739> losses<00:00:58.949> are

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
we're one win two draws two losses are

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.250 
we're one win two draws two losses are
not<00:00:59.430> doing<00:00:59.699> too<00:01:00.059> great<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> moment<00:01:01.199> but

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
not doing too great at the moment but

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
not doing too great at the moment but
hopefully<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.859> turn<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.070> around<00:01:02.280> we<00:01:02.640> are

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
hopefully we can turn that around we are

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.270 
hopefully we can turn that around we are
struggling<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.559> probably<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.890> about

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
stupidly annoying and this is just the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.410 
stupidly annoying and this is just the
most<00:03:11.160> annoying<00:03:11.430> part<00:03:11.640> because<00:03:11.940> he's<00:03:12.060> gonna<00:03:12.209> go

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
most annoying part because he's gonna go

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.810 
most annoying part because he's gonna go
ahead<00:03:12.600> scores<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.500> really<00:03:14.280> really<00:03:14.459> close<00:03:14.640> I

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
ahead scores it really really close I

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
ahead scores it really really close I
couldn't<00:03:15.030> believe<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.270> keeper<00:03:15.510> didn't<00:03:15.690> save

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
couldn't believe the keeper didn't save

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.840 
couldn't believe the keeper didn't save
that<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:16.290> no<00:03:16.470> he<00:03:16.560> didn't<00:03:16.830> save<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.310> that's

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
that so no he didn't save it and that's

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.220 
that so no he didn't save it and that's
how<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.060> game<00:03:18.330> finished<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:18.959> should<00:03:19.140> have

here<00:03:54.570> I<00:03:54.600> think<00:03:54.750> because<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.110> was<00:03:55.260> running<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.739> low

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
here I think because I was running a low

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.170 
here I think because I was running a low
below<00:03:55.980> actually<00:03:56.549> not<00:03:56.700> going<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:56.940> go<00:03:57.000> ahead<00:03:57.060> and

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180
