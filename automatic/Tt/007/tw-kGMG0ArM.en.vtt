thousand billion in two plus three and

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.680 
thousand billion in two plus three and
so<00:00:14.309> what<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.490> did<00:00:14.580> was<00:00:14.730> actually<00:00:15.299> took<00:00:15.509> my

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
so what I did was actually took my

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.720 
so what I did was actually took my
original<00:00:16.170> chicken<00:00:16.379> farm<00:00:16.710> cooker<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.550> made

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
original chicken farm cooker and I made

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.179 
original chicken farm cooker and I made
it<00:00:17.850> even<00:00:18.119> better<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.740> made<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.070> little

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
it even better and I made it a little

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.859 
it even better and I made it a little
bit<00:00:20.340> more<00:00:20.460> compact<00:00:20.850> as<00:00:21.029> well<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.779> if<00:00:21.840> you

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
bit more compact as well and so if you

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.269 
bit more compact as well and so if you
want<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.109> see<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.410> original<00:00:22.590> video<00:00:22.949> there

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
can go ahead and check that out but

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.200 
can go ahead and check that out but
let's<00:00:31.230> go<00:00:31.410> ahead<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.189> into<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> video<00:00:32.790> so

let's go ahead and get into the video so

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.750 
let's go ahead and get into the video so

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
in case you don't know this is a machine

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.060 
in case you don't know this is a machine
that<00:00:36.030> creates<00:00:36.450> an<00:00:36.690> infinite<00:00:37.469> amount<00:00:37.620> of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
that creates an infinite amount of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.639 
that creates an infinite amount of
cooked<00:00:38.430> food<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.210> automatically<00:00:39.960> you

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.690 
will never have to do any work and all
you<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.620> come<00:00:44.010> by<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.430> check

you have to do is just come by and check
the<00:00:44.879> chest<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.390> see<00:00:46.110> when<00:00:46.379> you've<00:00:46.500> got<00:00:46.649> food

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
the chest and see when you've got food

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.910 
the chest and see when you've got food
it's<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.420> simple<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.200> here's<00:00:49.469> how<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.770> all

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it's really simple so here's how it all

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.590 
it's really simple so here's how it all
works<00:00:50.190> well<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> group<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.180> chickens

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
works well we have a group of chickens

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.510 
works well we have a group of chickens
up<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.530> will<00:00:52.710> lay<00:00:52.949> their<00:00:53.250> eggs

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
up here and they will lay their eggs

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
up here and they will lay their eggs
into<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.149> hopper<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.750> into<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.320> dispenser

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
into this hopper and into this dispenser

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160 
into this hopper and into this dispenser
the<00:00:56.399> dispenser<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:57.030> fire<00:00:57.329> out<00:00:57.570> an<00:00:57.750> egg<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the dispenser will fire out an egg and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.750 
the dispenser will fire out an egg and
we<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.379> hopefully<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.859> baby<00:00:59.100> chicken<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
we will hopefully get a baby chicken and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580 
we will hopefully get a baby chicken and
they<00:01:00.510> will<00:01:00.660> hang<00:01:00.870> out<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.469> area

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
they will hang out in this little area

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.119 
they will hang out in this little area
for<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.370> whole<00:01:02.910> minecraft<00:01:03.510> day<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.350> 20<00:01:04.860> minutes

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
for a whole minecraft day or 20 minutes

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.480 
for a whole minecraft day or 20 minutes
and<00:01:05.960> interestingly<00:01:06.960> enough<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.740> takes<00:01:08.010> baby

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and interestingly enough it takes baby

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.090 
and interestingly enough it takes baby
chickens<00:01:09.030> 20<00:01:09.750> minutes<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.229> around<00:01:10.530> 20<00:01:10.799> minutes

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
chickens 20 minutes or around 20 minutes

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.420 
chickens 20 minutes or around 20 minutes
to<00:01:11.610> fully<00:01:11.820> mature<00:01:12.330> into<00:01:12.720> an<00:01:12.810> adult<00:01:13.049> chicken

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
to fully mature into an adult chicken

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.130 
to fully mature into an adult chicken
and<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.520> after<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> full<00:01:15.210> minecraft<00:01:15.720> day<00:01:15.900> these

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and so after a full minecraft day these

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.450 
and so after a full minecraft day these
chickens<00:01:16.530> will<00:01:16.650> drop<00:01:16.890> into<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.220> chamber

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
chickens will drop into this chamber

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.700 
chickens will drop into this chamber
over<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.240> there's<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.990> dispenser<00:01:19.530> back

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
over here and there's a dispenser back

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
over here and there's a dispenser back
there<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> lava<00:01:20.400> bucket<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.540> will

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
there with a lava bucket and that will

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.050 
there with a lava bucket and that will
activate<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.320> burn<00:01:23.250> these<00:01:23.430> chickens<00:01:23.880> for

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
activate and burn these chickens for

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.789 
activate and burn these chickens for
just<00:01:24.390> enough<00:01:24.630> time<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.840> them<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.170> catch<00:01:25.409> fire

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
just enough time for them to catch fire

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.740 
just enough time for them to catch fire
and<00:01:26.040> burn<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.759> death<00:01:26.880> without<00:01:27.090> killing<00:01:27.659> them

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and burn to death without killing them

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.050 
and burn to death without killing them
instantly<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.310> after<00:01:29.460> they<00:01:29.700> burn<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
instantly and so after they burn to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.240 
instantly and so after they burn to
death<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.600> drop<00:01:30.900> cooked<00:01:31.320> chicken<00:01:32.070> as

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
death they will drop cooked chicken as

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.700 
death they will drop cooked chicken as
well<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.670> feathers<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.630> else<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.049> now

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
well as feathers and what else and now

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.370 
well as feathers and what else and now
we'll<00:01:34.860> all<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.610> chest<00:01:35.939> right<00:01:36.150> here

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
we'll all go into this chest right here

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.719 
we'll all go into this chest right here
so<00:01:37.380> let's<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:37.770> ahead<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.040> take<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.340> look<00:01:38.520> at<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
so let's go ahead and take a look at the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.429 
so let's go ahead and take a look at the
Redstone<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> guys<00:01:39.659> remember<00:01:39.869> from<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
Redstone if you guys remember from the

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.350 
Redstone if you guys remember from the
original<00:01:40.920> chicken<00:01:41.159> farm<00:01:41.490> video<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.030> actually

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
original chicken farm video we actually

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.690 
original chicken farm video we actually
had<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> fat<00:01:42.899> box<00:01:43.229> right<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.579> only

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
had a fat box right here and that only

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
had a fat box right here and that only
served<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.149> purpose<00:01:45.329> which<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.229> emit<00:01:46.890> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
served one purpose which was to emit a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.899 
served one purpose which was to emit a
single<00:01:47.520> pulse<00:01:47.759> once<00:01:48.630> every<00:01:49.049> minecraft<00:01:49.590> day

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
single pulse once every minecraft day

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.219 
single pulse once every minecraft day
well<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.270> able<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.659> rid<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
well I was able to get rid of that and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.660 
well I was able to get rid of that and
replace<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.680> another<00:01:52.799> invention<00:01:53.460> of

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
replace it with another invention of

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.039 
replace it with another invention of
mine<00:01:53.909> which<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.509> see<00:01:54.689> right<00:01:54.720> here

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
mine which is what you see right here

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.540 
mine which is what you see right here
and<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.530> is

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
and this is

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.330 
and this is
automatic<00:01:57.180> daily<00:01:57.660> pulse<00:01:57.960> generator<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.740> this

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
automatic daily pulse generator and this

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.490 
automatic daily pulse generator and this
does<00:01:59.550> basically<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.150> same<00:02:00.300> thing<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:01.140> emits<00:02:01.350> a

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
does basically the same thing it emits a

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.600 
does basically the same thing it emits a
pulse<00:02:01.530> once<00:02:02.190> every<00:02:02.520> minecraft<00:02:03.030> day<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:04.610> it's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
pulse once every minecraft day and it's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.010 
pulse once every minecraft day and it's
a<00:02:05.670> lot<00:02:05.820> more<00:02:05.940> compact<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.630> I've<00:02:06.840> actually

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
a lot more compact and I've actually

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.840 
a lot more compact and I've actually
created<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.620> video<00:02:07.740> dedicated<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.670> this

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
created a video dedicated to this

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.820 
created a video dedicated to this
machine<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:10.229> will<00:02:10.350> be<00:02:10.440> linked<00:02:10.710> in<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
machine and that will be linked in the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.410 
machine and that will be linked in the
description<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.030> want<00:02:12.240> more

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
description so if you want more

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.150 
description so if you want more
clarification<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.410> recommend<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.130> watch

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
clarification I recommend that you watch

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.530 
clarification I recommend that you watch
that<00:02:14.370> video<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:16.110> anyways<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.150> going<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that video but anyways this is going to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.330 
that video but anyways this is going to
admit<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.960> pulse<00:02:19.260> into<00:02:19.530> two<00:02:19.710> directions<00:02:20.190> right

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
admit a pulse into two directions right

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.670 
admit a pulse into two directions right
here<00:02:20.550> on<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.210> way<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.570> one<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.900> way<00:02:22.080> well

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
here on this way and one that way well

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.140 
here on this way and one that way well
let's<00:02:22.860> follow<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.310> path<00:02:23.550> right<00:02:23.820> here<00:02:23.850> this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
let's follow this path right here this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.930 
let's follow this path right here this
will<00:02:24.360> lead<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.960> piston<00:02:25.560> which<00:02:26.280> will<00:02:26.490> retract

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
will lead to a piston which will retract

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.810 
will lead to a piston which will retract
and<00:02:27.470> allow<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.530> chickens<00:02:29.010> up<00:02:29.160> here<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> drop

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
and allow the chickens up here to a drop

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.990 
and allow the chickens up here to a drop
into<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.420> chamber<00:02:30.690> over<00:02:30.960> here<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:32.000> this

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
into this chamber over here and this

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.340 
into this chamber over here and this
path<00:02:33.300> right<00:02:33.540> here<00:02:33.570> will<00:02:33.870> lead<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.200> this

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
path right here will lead to this

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.710 
path right here will lead to this
dispenser<00:02:34.770> with<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.280> lava<00:02:35.460> bucket<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.150> if

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
dispenser with the lava bucket and if

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.320 
dispenser with the lava bucket and if
you<00:02:36.840> notice<00:02:37.020> i<00:02:37.320> actually<00:02:37.830> have<00:02:38.030> excuse<00:02:39.030> me<00:02:39.150> i

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
you notice i actually have excuse me i

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.600 
you notice i actually have excuse me i
actually<00:02:39.960> have<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.350> lever<00:02:40.650> right<00:02:41.010> below<00:02:41.370> this

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
actually have a lever right below this

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.610 
actually have a lever right below this
dispenser<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> activated<00:02:43.440> mode

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
dispenser and it's in the activated mode

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.580 
dispenser and it's in the activated mode
what<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.520> does<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.060> acts<00:02:45.690> as<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:45.990> double

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
what this does is it acts as a double

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.610 
what this does is it acts as a double
pulsar<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:50.240> dispenser<00:02:51.240> so<00:02:52.200> what<00:02:52.410> will

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
pulsar to this dispenser so what will

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.380 
pulsar to this dispenser so what will
what<00:02:52.980> will<00:02:53.040> happen<00:02:53.520> is<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.910> will<00:02:54.120> spit<00:02:54.360> out

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
what will happen is that will spit out

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.930 
what will happen is that will spit out
the<00:02:54.630> lava<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.220> retract<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.340> lava<00:02:56.550> meet

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
the lava and retract the lava meet

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.630 
the lava and retract the lava meet
immediately<00:02:57.650> so<00:02:58.650> that's<00:02:58.920> exactly<00:02:59.160> what<00:02:59.550> we

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
immediately so that's exactly what we

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.420 
immediately so that's exactly what we
want<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.240> actually<00:03:00.390> really<00:03:00.690> convenient

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
want and it's actually really convenient

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.250 
want and it's actually really convenient
also<00:03:02.430> another<00:03:02.700> change<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.330> i<00:03:03.360> made<00:03:03.630> was<00:03:03.930> in

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
also another change that i made was in

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.930 
also another change that i made was in
the<00:03:04.440> original<00:03:04.530> machine<00:03:05.040> i<00:03:05.250> had<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.550> weighted

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
the original machine i had a weighted

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.699 
the original machine i had a weighted
pressure<00:03:06.209> plate<00:03:06.510> up<00:03:06.720> here<00:03:06.989> but<00:03:07.230> i<00:03:07.260> got<00:03:07.500> rid<00:03:07.680> of

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
pressure plate up here but i got rid of

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.120 
pressure plate up here but i got rid of
that<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.780> replaced<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.930> with<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.380> clock<00:03:10.830> right

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
that and replaced it with a clock right

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.460 
that and replaced it with a clock right
here<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.180> what<00:03:12.330> will<00:03:12.450> happen<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.870> if<00:03:13.050> there

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
here and so what will happen is if there

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.949 
here and so what will happen is if there
is<00:03:13.590> an<00:03:13.770> egg<00:03:14.010> inside<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.640> dispenser<00:03:15.030> this

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
is an egg inside this dispenser this

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.560 
is an egg inside this dispenser this
comparator<00:03:16.500> will<00:03:16.650> activate<00:03:17.190> this<00:03:17.520> clock<00:03:17.940> and

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
comparator will activate this clock and

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.110 
comparator will activate this clock and
as<00:03:19.350> long<00:03:19.650> as<00:03:19.890> there<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.220> an<00:03:20.340> egg<00:03:20.550> inside<00:03:20.940> of

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
as long as there is an egg inside of

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.880 
as long as there is an egg inside of
this<00:03:21.209> dispenser<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.959> clock<00:03:22.230> will<00:03:22.440> continue

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
this dispenser this clock will continue

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.490 
this dispenser this clock will continue
to<00:03:22.980> fire<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.390> demonstrate<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:25.170> i<00:03:25.320> have

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
to fire so to demonstrate that i have

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.000 
to fire so to demonstrate that i have

this machine in action so I'm going to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.610 
this machine in action so I'm going to
speed<00:03:44.240> up<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.390> process<00:03:44.600> I<00:03:45.170> know<00:03:45.230> it's<00:03:45.470> not

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
speed up the process I know it's not

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
we're going to speed up the process to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.340 
we're going to speed up the process to
just<00:03:52.610> before<00:03:52.760> day<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.830> pay<00:03:54.830> attention<00:03:54.860> to

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
last thing I forgot to mention is that

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.850 
last thing I forgot to mention is that
items<00:04:31.790> can<00:04:32.120> go<00:04:32.480> through<00:04:32.780> half<00:04:33.020> slabs<00:04:33.380> into

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
items can go through half slabs into

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.710 
items can go through half slabs into
hoppers<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.490> that's<00:04:35.000> actually<00:04:35.330> something<00:04:35.480> I

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
hoppers and that's actually something I

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.140 
hoppers and that's actually something I
discovered<00:04:36.320> a<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.920> while<00:04:37.310> back<00:04:37.580> which<00:04:37.850> allowed

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
discovered a a while back which allowed

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.660 
discovered a a while back which allowed
me<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.570> create<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:39.080> original<00:04:39.530> machine<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:40.220> so

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
me to create the original machine and so

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.010 
me to create the original machine and so
I<00:04:40.730> thought<00:04:40.940> I'd<00:04:41.090> bring<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.390> up<00:04:41.570> since<00:04:41.930> I

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
I thought I'd bring that up since I

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.470 
I thought I'd bring that up since I
