00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.190
 Welcome to the river guide I'm ed and 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.050
 you play in this guide let's start the 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.850
 runes that we will use based more on the 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.369
 cooling reduction are brands of 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.770
 attack damage was given his armor glyphs 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.440
 of progressive reduction by level and 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.180
 removes attack damage essences 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.210
 runes are focused to be a 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.670
 better novo since with two objects of 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.590
 cooling reduction to be seen 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.020
 later on and a few levels will 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.449
 it reaches 40% which with riva in it makes 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.520
 a very broken champion that already many 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.770
 You will know a note that I want to emphasize 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.500
 here is that it is one of the sets of 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.840
 runes that a famous box box usually uses 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.730
 streamer known by his rival and thank you 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.010
 to which this guide could be well 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.930
 formulated link of your tweet and a 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.440
 surprise in the description 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 in masters we will have 2109 a page 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.520
 of mastery is very standard 21 in attack 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.990
 to improve the damage that is what 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.240
 look to be able to carry more 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.100
 ease and 9 defense points for 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.960
 attend our dear arriben list 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.930
 for the summoner's crack 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.720
 we come to the powers we normally go 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.970
 to focus on maximizing the cv since 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.740
 it is our main source of damage but 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.990
 in different situations when you have 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.970
 much enemy pressure or because or 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.300
 you can maximize the first option 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.860
 which is the good shield in most 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.290
 the cases maximize we have the coop 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.509
 then the e and leaving the double as 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.940
 last option remembering that the 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.470
 Ultimate multi skill is up each 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.210
 that can be in levels 6 11 and 16 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.820
 ignition flash are the best option of 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.080
 deportation invoker spells not 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.640
 it's a bad idea 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.320
 in the construction of objects 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.180
 We start with the long sword and three 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.160
 positions you can go with dorantes if it is 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.470
 that you do not require the potions after 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.930
 The essential items to buy are 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.090
 the ion boots and the stultifying with 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.670
 these two objects plus the runes is reached 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.190
 at 40% cooling reduction that 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.630
 is the limit that can be reached before 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.520
 to continue with the following objects 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.380
 I want to clarify that all objects 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.720
 mentioned here may not be the 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.550
 optimal for the game since for a 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.920
 better performance should be purchased in accordance 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.840
 the enemies for example if you have 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.580
 several attack damage enemies or one 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.410
 with enough damage the best thing would be to buy 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.780
 armor against power of ability 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.760
 buy magic resistance if the enemy 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.590
 has a lot of armor penetration of 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.360
 armor and when the enemy team does not 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.220
 is affiliated neither tank the best is 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.250
 make pure tea harm to be able to carry 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.320
 more easily good once cleared 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.630
 all this the construction of objects 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.110
 common riven is voracious or last hydra 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.670
 sigh guardian angel randín complete 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.380
 the brutalizer in any of his two 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.510
 options and drops of reduction 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.000
 cooling the rest are objects 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.940
 situational as I mentioned 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.860
 game boy river is quite recommended 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.880
 for the qualifier only duo since 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.430
 he is a champion that makes an excellent 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.710
 snowboarding work he also owns is a 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.080
 auto for lifting the third qy 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.730
 your stand of the w without talking about your shield 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.200
 too much damage and his series of powers 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.410
 is designed to cross your enemy 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.270
 everything sounds beautiful but not good riven 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.980
 has its obvious disadvantages is a 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.840
 champion who has many counter picks 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.209
 on top powerful enough bamboo 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.130
 with the song and others that they may wish 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.110
 never have chopped up and if you 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.120
 careless you can die countless times 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.770
 since they arrive in the same way that it is a 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.810
 champion who will give the advantage of good 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.700
 way if it does not and it dies a lot to be a 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.290
 hindrance for the team that is going to clarify 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.090
 which is not bad choice arriving for 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.620
 individual qualification but it's not the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.360
 better in the snow top there are better 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.400
 champions in the current goal that can 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.350
 be of more help in the team the best 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.360
 when playing arriben is to take advantage of 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.040
 the first levels you have to do everything 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.810
 the bullying that may be your opponent in 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.730
 the beginnings of the game and kill him how many 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.709
 Sometimes you can because if you do not 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.720
 possibly at higher levels the tea 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.010
 he will do it but that does remember the 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.560
 jungle sentinels win games 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.120
 in phase of lines not only with rubén but 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.860
 with all the champions you must learn 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.870
 when is the best time to attack 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.849
 when your jungle is close to your rival 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.920
 have spent their summoner spells or 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.540
 even some his champion powers and 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.970
 enter the precise moment when 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.350
 have a disadvantage other tips that 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.120
 I can give you is to remember that with 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.310
 rivense can cancel the animation of the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.289
 self attack with his powers with which 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.150
 Do more damage in less time just like 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.400
 that is a escapist born recalls that 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.380
 you can jump walls practice it several 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.150
 times and you will achieve it to do it 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.630
 wait just when you're on the limit 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.340
 of the wall 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.590
 As you already know they can be combined 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.690
 powers at the same time to cancel the 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.630
 animation of some power and drop them on 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.700
 less time an example is more w al 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.250
 same time which puts you shield 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.530
 you advance and separate in the tournaments quite 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.540
 good does not search and try different 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.850
 combinations or you can look them up in 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.220
 internet in the box box string or 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.930
 some other high in height the or 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.820
 surprise to leave in the description you 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.000
 will be very useful to master jumps and 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.100
 skill combinations 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.360
 in ruben team fights can 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.460
 eliminate the weak champions 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.100
 quickly why you should focus 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.840
 in the elk and I usually remember 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.760
 every battle is different too 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.350
 I recommend having active flash in the 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.540
 fights since it will serve to achieve 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.350
 position yourself better and kill the 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.910
 cars 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.280
 if you do not have flash the best will be 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.780
 wait for the right moment eye here not 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.330
 wait too much or try 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.800
 whitening them is a good idea just remember 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.600
 have warned your team that you are going to 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.730
 get on the other side to fight and 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.520
 you do not end up leaving or leaving bad 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.380
 stopped when you start the active fight you 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.630
 ultimate from the start a good 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.600
 way to throw your last one is re for 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.370
 cancel the animation and just release it 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.800
 good and finally with this build of 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.870
 40% reduction of cooling you have 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.940
 a pretty good advantage before 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.130
 start you can have two loaded 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.350
 flashing to the team fight drop the 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.060
 tercerca to raise them and in the same 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.950
 moment thanks to the objects already 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.960
 mentioned you will have ready the cv again 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.960
 so you can continue even more damage 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.870
 with this we have reached the end of this 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.370
 guide all the tips to care are 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.220
 to help you improve in the 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.480
 mechanics of the champion and his understanding 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.150
 remember to share it with your friends on 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.100
 subtle touch your uncle your grandfather the fide that 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.570
 always ends the games the support

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.180
 I want to tell you that this first guide is 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.340
 a preview of how the design will be 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.350
 will change greatly expect in future 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.600
