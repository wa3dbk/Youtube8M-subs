00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 so hello to everyone we continue with the engine 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.509
 eights seemingly the most 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.250
 banal simple question what is better than 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.230
 one eight you answer maxim 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.849
 bully 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.620
 I'll say it's better than making the world 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.109
 better than one eight is two 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.470
 Eight here are handsome 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.119
 here is a slightly different basket that is on 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.699
 there were little holes here 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 so wide 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:35.309
 I do not know what better principle can be 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:40.410
 there is no difference but here the coil is better 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.030
 it is evident that our both pleased here 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:50.730
 poured a lot of glue that is not sparing 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:53.789
 don't know here he even sweat in places then 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.300
 if they did not feel sorry for him if that is not the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.300
 I know to make out and already definitely will not work 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:10.080
 heavy and oak 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:19.280
 frequencies for fun I press us 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.280
 absolutely don't care take a pancake curtain 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:37.979
 also from for fun 2 nifiga not asked 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:47.250
 literally a couple of millimeters I clean 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:49.590
 first I choose the second that's the maximum 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.140
 what is it possible to push you? 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.140
 five millimeters not more 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:08.910
 In general, the whole thing will be very long 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:12.019
 warm up eating everything as usual there 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.019
 you can see the coil a little bit 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.880
 because 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:27.810
 coils 2 + 2 that is, two speakers can 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:36.980
 05 omit what pleased let the blacks 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:36.980
 no bear plays from the same 4 channel to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:47.550
 everyone didn't teach the defense you are missing 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.040
 powered by the dynamics he enters 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.040
 5 mm no more 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.370
 absolutely any knead I will hand it 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.370
 a very long time 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.170
 but soon you will settle down to everything 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.629
 play already from how many things will be there 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.030
 power 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:20.319
 so far like this even in these 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.879
 Magnitka Is that a bit more than that 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:27.489
 the past was the dynamics there are suspicions 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.980
 even the fact that it will be very problematic 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.849
 insert in the box because it is very 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:42.540
 little space left our you wonâ€™t think 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:42.540
 you are bad than healthy here are the birds
