00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
but in this example we'll pretend that

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.499

we<00:02:03.440> edited<00:02:03.799> this<00:02:04.009> audio<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:05.210> what<00:02:05.390> we're

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
we edited this audio and what we're

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.719 
we edited this audio and what we're
going<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.750> do<00:02:05.929> now<00:02:06.110> is<00:02:06.319> rerecord<00:02:07.280> this<00:02:07.399> audio

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
going to do now is rerecord this audio

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.120 
going to do now is rerecord this audio
into<00:02:07.970> new<00:02:08.090> track<00:02:08.569> thus<00:02:09.110> printing<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.830> audio

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
into new track thus printing the audio

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.090 
into new track thus printing the audio
so<00:02:11.000> we'll<00:02:11.120> come<00:02:11.269> up<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.510> track<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.140> choose<00:02:12.440> new

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
so we'll come up to track and choose new

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.100 
so we'll come up to track and choose new
from<00:02:13.610> our<00:02:13.730> drop-down<00:02:13.970> I'm<00:02:14.600> going<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.870> create<00:02:15.050> a
