00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.110
 Hi, I'm Maria Acha, 12, and today we're going to 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.330
 show you how a toy works 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.340
 interactive for our dogs and how 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.980
 you can integrate them in your training 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.449
 and also have fun together with us 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.439
 our lectures courses and workshops 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.929
 we always talk about the importance 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.550
 efficient mental stimulation in 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.019
 the life of our dogs besides the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.079
 physical exercise 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:32.079
 it is essential for them to have a life 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.760
 enriched and balanced the 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.920
 mental stimulation is achieved by a 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.960
 part of course with the training 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.670
 tax but also in another way 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.710
 great is through friends 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.210
 interactive and puzzles that 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.559
 fortunately also now in the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.559
 market there are a lot of them very 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.079
 interesting to us particularly 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.239
 The ones we like most are those of a 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.630
 author that here we have a selection of 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.550
 the 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.620
 today in particular let's talk is about the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.360
 box that is this from here 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.160
 today we are going to talk to us about the box because 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.410
 is the toy that we have chosen for the 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.540
 home this Christmas to the mine that 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.570
 wolves 460 lewis 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.240
 the box works like this is simply this 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.400
 It is a wooden box with a lid on the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.810
 top then this part 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.400
 superior who does not have gangs 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.230
 different depending on the degree of 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.600
 difficulty you want may be the 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.900
 hole having larger or 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.760
 small then you put one of them and 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.300
 he asked what he has to do is ask 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.520
 with the card and throw the door what happens 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.650
 that here is a ramp where you place 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.410
 some prizes when the dog so much the 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.590
 record the prizes fall out this 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.600
 is the basic way to play with the box 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.160
 we are going to see with dyna is a 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.130
 I tell a different story because we're going to 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.360
 bury in this sequence of 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.130
 training with her then you will see 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.540
 that at the end instead of letting 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.460
 awards that arrive directly in a 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.770
 What I 'm going to do 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.170
 when one puts the file and pay 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.729
 directly 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.820
 and this is all if you have passed the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.070
 verbs 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.400
 but before stopping 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:11.929
 teach us other stars 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.929
 and that today in particular is yes 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.930
 but to be here and we're going to 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.659
 understand written 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.250
 stay here, we do not leave you behind 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.250
 end of the rest d 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.480
 yes 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.350
 and if he asks again then 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.620
 to look for it and an electricity 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.640
 and that 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.110
 there are different 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.280
 because 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.280
 and then come back 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.280
 as well 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.280
 and how 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.770
 in the initial phases 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.930
 this could be building the 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.930
 behaviors little by little 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.440
 then let's try it 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.100
 and later 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.730
 yes 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.850
 the floor tile I'm going to do 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.850
 we do that 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.160
 is a 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.050
 do not 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.940
 A) Yes
