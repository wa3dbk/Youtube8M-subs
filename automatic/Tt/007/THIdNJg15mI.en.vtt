00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
what I want to show you is the

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.149 
what I want to show you is the
difference<00:03:40.340> in<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.790> size<00:03:41.180> of<00:03:41.359> these<00:03:41.480> files

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
difference in the size of these files

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:50.770 
difference in the size of these files
the<00:03:43.159> girls<00:03:43.400> jpg<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.359> 4<00:03:44.870> 5<00:03:45.650> 8<00:03:46.190> 6<00:03:46.790> K<00:03:47.479> that's<00:03:49.780> 4586

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
the girls jpg is 4 5 8 6 K that's 4586

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.920 
the girls jpg is 4 5 8 6 K that's 4586
kilobytes<00:03:53.379> now<00:03:54.379> there<00:03:54.560> are<00:03:55.150> 1,024<00:03:56.150> kilobytes

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
kilobytes now there are 1,024 kilobytes

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.469 
kilobytes now there are 1,024 kilobytes
for<00:03:57.109> every<00:03:57.500> megabyte

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
for every megabyte

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:04.229 
for every megabyte
so<00:03:59.479> that<00:03:59.720> file<00:04:00.349> is<00:04:01.099> over<00:04:01.699> 4<00:04:02.030> megabytes<00:04:02.720> in<00:04:03.139> size

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
so that file is over 4 megabytes in size

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.050 
so that file is over 4 megabytes in size
and<00:04:05.239> in<00:04:06.079> contrast<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:07.190> curriculum<00:04:07.639> vitae

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
and in contrast the curriculum vitae

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.180 
and in contrast the curriculum vitae
document<00:04:08.900> is<00:04:09.379> 52<00:04:10.250> kilobytes<00:04:10.819> so<00:04:12.010> that<00:04:13.010> just

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
document is 52 kilobytes so that just

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.890 
document is 52 kilobytes so that just
demonstrates<00:04:13.340> that<00:04:14.000> photographs<00:04:14.599> and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
demonstrates that photographs and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.789 
demonstrates that photographs and
documents<00:04:16.060> are<00:04:17.060> quite<00:04:17.479> different<00:04:18.109> in<00:04:18.440> size

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
documents are quite different in size

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.240 
documents are quite different in size
and<00:04:19.430> this<00:04:20.150> is<00:04:20.269> important<00:04:20.810> because<00:04:21.250> every

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
and this is important because every

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.860 
and this is important because every
email<00:04:22.580> client<00:04:22.880> would<00:04:22.970> have<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.150> limit<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:23.779> the

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
email client would have a limit to the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.890 
email client would have a limit to the
size<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.349> email<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:24.770> you<00:04:25.039> can<00:04:25.070> send<00:04:25.250> and<00:04:26.210> with

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
size of email that you can send and with

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.000 
size of email that you can send and with
Gmail<00:04:27.349> is<00:04:27.560> 2

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
Gmail is 2

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.270 
Gmail is 2
see<00:04:28.160> five<00:04:28.630> megabytes<00:04:29.630> so<00:04:30.040> really<00:04:31.040> you<00:04:31.130> could

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
see five megabytes so really you could

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.690 
see five megabytes so really you could
only<00:04:31.430> send<00:04:31.760> four<00:04:32.510> or<00:04:32.750> five<00:04:32.990> pictures<00:04:33.410> with<00:04:34.370> an

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
only send four or five pictures with an

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.860 
only send four or five pictures with an
email<00:04:36.460> documents<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.670> you<00:04:38.240> can<00:04:38.390> send<00:04:38.630> quite<00:04:38.810> a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
email documents and you can send quite a

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.390 
email documents and you can send quite a
few<00:04:38.930> documents<00:04:39.290> within<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.600> limits<00:04:42.400> and

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
few documents within that limits and

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.640 
few documents within that limits and
just<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.270> demonstrate<00:04:44.450> I'm<00:04:45.020> gonna<00:04:45.200> open<00:04:45.440> that

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
just to demonstrate I'm gonna open that

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.090 
just to demonstrate I'm gonna open that
file<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:46.480> the<00:04:47.480> picture<00:04:47.780> file<00:04:47.960> opens<00:04:48.410> with<00:04:49.070> a

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
file and the picture file opens with a

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.030 
file and the picture file opens with a
picture<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.240> girls<00:04:50.510> with<00:04:51.260> a<00:04:51.290> background

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
picture of the girls with a background

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.220 
picture of the girls with a background
of<00:04:52.250> timbi<00:04:52.820> for<00:04:53.180> those<00:04:53.330> who<00:04:53.480> may<00:04:53.600> recognize<00:04:54.080> it

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
of timbi for those who may recognize it

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.010 
of timbi for those who may recognize it
so<00:04:54.940> that's<00:04:55.940> a<00:04:56.090> picture<00:04:56.420> file<00:04:56.630> that<00:04:56.780> has<00:04:56.990> been
