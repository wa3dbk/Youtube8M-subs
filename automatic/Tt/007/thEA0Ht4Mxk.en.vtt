00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello how are you I hope I'm very 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.629
 well today I will do the taxi 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.550
 all my makeup disappeared this 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.740
 text I saw him for the first time to danny 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.660
 o'brien and I put together here on youtube so 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.210
 If you want to see your tag I invite you to 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.880
 do so also this taxi deals so 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.800
 I understood to mention 10 products 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.600
 that you would buy again if all your 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.939
 makeup disappear and I think it is 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.099
 So it's fabulous because you can give yourself a 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.109
 idea of â€‹â€‹the products that are essential 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.490
 for everyone so without more than 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.260
 add let's start 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.300
 the first thing I would run to buy if 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.239
 all my makeup would disappear would be 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.430
 my bicrim of mass for those who have not 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.710
 heard and talk and talk about this 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.590
 life that I like because it protects you from 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.379
 Sun treats its imperfections and apart from you 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.750
 It leaves the skin very pretty so this is 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.700
 the first thing that would run to buy if all 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.970
 disappear that for those who see my 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.700
 horses I know almost the beginnings that 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.620
 once so but then not 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.570
 I knew the bicrim but now I do 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.630
 next for a girl like me that the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.900
 dark circles haunt me from small would be 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.400
 corrector and I chose these that can see 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.440
 very dear 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.910
 these maybelline correctors I have 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.770
 a review on my blog about this 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.260
 collector in case they want to see it but in 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.540
 summary I love the finish that you 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.220
 Leave is precious unlike others 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.070
 correctors that only dries me in the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.070
 eye contour these do not do so 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.869
 that this would be my other product if everything 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.180
 my makeup disappeared the next 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.040
 that I would buy would be this paint pot of 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.350
 mac that is in fact my first paintball 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.900
 and I love what I bought thanks to dani 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.790
 because more was because of dani because 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.400
 I saw it, I think they were his favorites 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.650
 2012 and it fascinates me is divine is a color 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.680
 as well as amarillito that I use in the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.229
 eyelid to highlight shadows but on 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.720
 all the main reason why I 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.820
 I use is to neutralize my eyelids 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.510
 because I also see the little veins 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.600
 see purple 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.540
 it looks looks fried then for the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.700
 this is the newspaper that he used to 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.310
 neutralize and I already put my shadows and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.890
 everything before I used the first mattress 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.470
 of vulva nikkei in eden but since 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.060
 I met this and not the next thing 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.150
 what would I buy if all my makeup 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.030
 would disappear would be the gel liner 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.330
 of mac a slightly cheaper option 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.520
 rather cheaper and almost as 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.190
 good is the gel eyeliner 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.730
 Maybelline, I like them very much 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.070
 pigment precious last very well but 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.720
 the mac lasts a little longer and I like it 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.730
 a little more but the mehuin and you 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.800
 does the competition to divine so 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.990
 these would be the next thing I would buy 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.460
 If all my makeup disappeared 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.610
 next product that went into the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.320
 competition is my small town of the work 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.630
 martial that I use to seal my 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.820
 corrector they already saw it in my video of my 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.220
 basic routine and there I explained why 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.260
 I like it and everything but in summary it's a 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.750
 very finite body does not mark me the lines 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.530
 nor so that my outline looks very dry 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.690
 of eyes 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.060
 and it makes my proofreader stay in his 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.220
 place all day so this one 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.380
 love and really if they have problems 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.110
 of dryness I recommend that you 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.420
 try the following would be my mascara 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.370
 maybelline I like this because it leaves me 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.950
 the tabs up all day the one 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.800
 I use it is waterproof does not run 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.209
 the pigmentation is also very beautiful and 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.340
 Well, I have nothing more to say 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.250
 I just love it and it's the one 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.050
 He used the other tested but none 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.090
 he compares him always I come back to is what 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.610
 next I would buy would be a palette 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.370
 of shadows and in this case I chose the nike 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.230
 basics of nikkei horma this one I love 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.940
 cent that has coloring if you want 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.410
 make a luxury daily which is that is 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.510
 the 7 want to be a night look 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.150
 you can also do it pigmentation 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.830
 of each shadow is divine the black 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.300
 You can even use it for 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.970
 delineate you and it's what I've done 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.160
 many of these days so I do not have 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.250
 nothing but add more than is done to 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.080
 as its name says something very basic that 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.610
 apart from the size you can take it 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.070
 if you go on a trip 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.410
 it's divine I love this palette what 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.180
 next is not a surprise either and it is this 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.400
 lipstick of the region that I have already spoken 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.620
 too much in fact I will not tire you 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.570
 but this would be another of the things that 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.130
 I would buy help design my blog there 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.350
 a review on youtube in case 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.780
 they want to see this is the hong tone and I 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.960
 it seems divine for daily also if you 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.110
 you make a super smoky look and I'll 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.540
 put is a very subtle color and very beautiful 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.790
 that makes your lips look better and 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.470
 Well, I have nothing more to add 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.919
 following have also already seen 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.440
 other videos and it 's a place of so expos 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.750
 that as I told you a million times 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.150
 I get a color that would fit the 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.090
 Most people is a very color 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.250
 nice that gives you that extra little color that 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.350
 you need your skin sometimes I do not have 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.669
 nothing else to add I have other 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.250
 nations in my blog if they want it 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.870
 see I 'm not going to tire them anymore because 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.510
 the people who watch my videos from 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.030
 they are used to seeing 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.400
 this blush in my favorites in 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.830
 good tutorials in that you have not seen it 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.360
 but the truth is that I like it a lot and 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.180
 the benefits that it also brings to the 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.400
 skin is an extra benefit the next 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.290
 product even though I almost never 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.490
 I put dust but there are times I do 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.650
 in the t zone is this sea dust that 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.390
 I love I feel that his pigmentation is 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.390
 very beautiful the finish that leaves also 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.640
 It's very beautiful I do not have any complaints 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.400
 I use it daily but when I use it 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.290
 I enjoy using it and have seen reviews 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.150
 of people with oily skin who say that 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.419
 he holds them very well before they are 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.330
 begins to slip so this would be the 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.460
 last product that I would choose if all my 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.800
 makeup disappeared I do not know if I said 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.180
 10 but I hope so but above all 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.700
 I hope you liked this video 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.950
