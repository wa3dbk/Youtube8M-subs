salt and here's another optional on this
is<00:03:32.280> cayenne<00:03:32.730> pepper<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.389> like<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.900> little<00:03:34.109> spice

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
is cayenne pepper I like a little spice

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.940 
is cayenne pepper I like a little spice
in<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:35.000> no<00:03:36.000> more<00:03:36.329> than<00:03:36.690> probably<00:03:37.109> an<00:03:37.349> eighth<00:03:37.680> of

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
in it no more than probably an eighth of

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.910 
in it no more than probably an eighth of
a<00:03:38.069> teaspoon<00:03:38.959> but<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.170> just<00:03:40.319> adds<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.799> little

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
a teaspoon but it just adds a little

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.699 
a teaspoon but it just adds a little
kick<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.519> like<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.349> don't<00:03:43.530> want

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
kick that I like but if you don't want

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.430 
kick that I like but if you don't want
that<00:03:43.889> you<00:03:44.190> could<00:03:44.430> totally<00:03:44.840> leave<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:46.049> up<00:03:46.200> out

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
that you could totally leave that up out

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.039 
that you could totally leave that up out
too<00:03:46.709> so<00:03:47.010> basically<00:03:47.910> what<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.209> almost<00:03:48.569> is<00:03:48.810> is

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
too so basically what this almost is is

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:57.949 
too so basically what this almost is is
like<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:50.090> sticky<00:03:51.090> bun<00:03:51.500> face<00:03:56.389> you<00:03:57.389> just<00:03:57.599> want<00:03:57.810> to

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
like a sticky bun face you just want to

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.220 
like a sticky bun face you just want to
heat<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:58.799> through<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.690> turn<00:04:00.690> up<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.900> heat<00:04:01.200> a

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
heat it through and turn up the heat a

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.890

let the sugar and all the other
ingredients<00:04:08.419> dissolve<00:04:09.419> into<00:04:09.630> each<00:04:09.840> other

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269
