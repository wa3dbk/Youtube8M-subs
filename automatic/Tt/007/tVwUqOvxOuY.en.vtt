00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
last Friday I think and I finally

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.259 
last Friday I think and I finally
decided<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.620> convert<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.190> BB<00:00:11.460> cream<00:00:11.730> but<00:00:12.000> only

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.749 
decided to convert to BB cream but only
because<00:00:12.750> my<00:00:13.500> favorite<00:00:13.860> tinted<00:00:14.219> moisturizer

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
because my favorite tinted moisturizer

year<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:29.580> sad<00:00:29.849> about<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.150> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
year which I was really sad about it and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.370 
year which I was really sad about it and
I've<00:00:31.080> been<00:00:31.140> having<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.219> hard<00:00:32.489> time<00:00:32.610> on

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
I've been having a really hard time on

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.080 
I've been having a really hard time on
finding<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.530> replacement<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.730> it's

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
finding a replacement for it and it's

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.270 
finding a replacement for it and it's
it's<00:00:36.899> replacement<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.710> supposed<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.129> be

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
it's replacement it's supposed to be

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.400 
it's replacement it's supposed to be
this<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.850> by<00:00:39.030> Clinique<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:39.960> called<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
this one by Clinique and it's called the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.959 
this one by Clinique and it's called the
Moisture<00:00:40.800> Surge<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:44.399> only<00:00:44.579> real

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
Moisture Surge and the only real

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
Moisture Surge and the only real
difference<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.660> supposed<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.770> it's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
difference is supposed to be that it's

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.910 
difference is supposed to be that it's
more<00:00:47.809> moisturizing<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> locks<00:00:49.680> in

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
more moisturizing and it locks in

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.420 
more moisturizing and it locks in
moisture<00:00:50.329> better<00:00:51.469> but<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.620> found<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.250> this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
moisture better but I found that this

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
moisture better but I found that this
actually<00:00:53.879> has<00:00:54.030> less<00:00:54.210> product<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.020> also<00:00:55.500> more

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
actually has less product it's also more

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.189 
actually has less product it's also more
expensive<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.600> shade<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
expensive and I think this shade is a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.760 
expensive and I think this shade is a
bit<00:00:58.530> off<00:00:59.840> they're<00:01:00.840> supposed<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> same

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
bit off they're supposed to be the same

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.910 
bit off they're supposed to be the same
shade<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.550> light<00:01:02.879> though<00:01:03.149> -<00:01:03.470> but<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.769> found

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
shade and light though - but I found

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.460 
shade and light though - but I found
that<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.580> has<00:01:06.299> more<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.229> pink

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that this one has more of a pink

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.340 
that this one has more of a pink
undertone<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.390> I'm<00:01:09.390> also<00:01:09.689> finding<00:01:10.080> this

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
undertone and I'm also finding this

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.520 
undertone and I'm also finding this
really<00:01:10.409> hard<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.970> daily<00:01:12.540> foundation<00:01:13.290> for

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
really hard to be a daily foundation for

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.170 
really hard to be a daily foundation for
me<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.930> wanted<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> go<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.350> something<00:01:17.180> that

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
was more of a cheaper alternative and

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.380 
was more of a cheaper alternative and
something<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> could<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.740> wear

vibrant<00:02:48.390> looking<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.410> realized<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.490> after

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
vibrant looking I realized that after

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.390 
vibrant looking I realized that after
taking<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.390> off<00:02:51.630> my<00:02:52.020> skin<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.770> little<00:02:53.190> more

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
taking this off my skin is a little more

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.690 
taking this off my skin is a little more
dull<00:02:53.790> kind<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.600> like<00:02:54.780> Mac<00:02:55.220> foundations<00:02:56.220> where

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
dull kind of like Mac foundations where

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.940 
dull kind of like Mac foundations where
after<00:02:57.180> you've<00:02:57.330> worn<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.080> long<00:02:58.350> time<00:02:58.380> it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
after you've worn it for a long time it

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.800 
after you've worn it for a long time it
makes<00:02:59.130> your<00:02:59.280> skin<00:02:59.340> look<00:02:59.580> really<00:02:59.850> dead<00:03:00.210> this

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
makes your skin look really dead this

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.080 
makes your skin look really dead this
isn't<00:03:01.230> as<00:03:01.410> bad<00:03:01.950> as<00:03:02.400> Mac<00:03:02.970> makeups<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:05.790> does

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
isn't as bad as Mac makeups but it does

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.930 
isn't as bad as Mac makeups but it does
it<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:07.050> guess<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.830> comparison<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.459> cleaning

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
it I guess in comparison to cleaning

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.810 
it I guess in comparison to cleaning
makeups<00:03:09.330> it's<00:03:09.570> just<00:03:09.810> not<00:03:09.989> as<00:03:10.200> good<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.830> so

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
makeups it's just not as good and so

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.690 
makeups it's just not as good and so
that's<00:03:12.060> probably<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.260> only<00:03:13.700> disappointment

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
that's probably the only disappointment

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.600 
that's probably the only disappointment
I<00:03:14.940> have<00:03:15.180> with<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.540> EB<00:03:15.840> cream<00:03:16.200> but<00:03:16.830> overall<00:03:17.160> I

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
I have with this EB cream but overall I

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.780 
I have with this EB cream but overall I
am<00:03:17.640> satisfied<00:03:18.480> with<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.890> hasn't<00:03:20.280> made<00:03:20.640> me

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
am satisfied with it it hasn't made me

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.030 
am satisfied with it it hasn't made me
break<00:03:21.090> out<00:03:21.270> it<00:03:21.690> hasn't<00:03:22.260> irritated<00:03:22.920> my<00:03:23.010> skin

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
break out it hasn't irritated my skin

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.670 
break out it hasn't irritated my skin
and<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.820> have<00:03:24.000> very<00:03:24.239> sensitive<00:03:24.360> skin<00:03:24.780> also

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
and I have very sensitive skin also

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.440 
and I have very sensitive skin also
another<00:03:26.250> thing<00:03:26.489> with<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.239> if<00:03:27.420> you

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
another thing with this is that if you

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.740 
another thing with this is that if you
have<00:03:27.780> dry<00:03:28.110> -<00:03:28.680> combination<00:03:29.580> dry<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.030> oily<00:03:30.180> skin

have dry - combination dry and oily skin

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.580 
have dry - combination dry and oily skin
it<00:03:31.380> doesn't<00:03:31.650> make<00:03:32.010> your<00:03:32.489> skin<00:03:32.550> look<00:03:33.120> flaky

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
it doesn't make your skin look flaky

it doesn't make your skin look flaky
which<00:03:34.590> was<00:03:34.739> really<00:03:34.920> surprising<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.610> me

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
which was really surprising to me

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.840 
which was really surprising to me
because<00:03:36.020> it's<00:03:37.020> almost<00:03:37.440> like<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.890> dry<00:03:38.220> formula

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
because it's almost like a dry formula

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.390 
because it's almost like a dry formula
to<00:03:39.030> me

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
to me

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.429 
to me
and<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.730> don't<00:03:39.790> know<00:03:40.030> if<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:40.299> because<00:03:40.510> I'm<00:03:41.140> so

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
and I don't know if it's because I'm so

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.470 
and I don't know if it's because I'm so
used<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.829> tinted<00:03:42.220> moisturizers<00:03:42.849> that<00:03:42.879> apply

yellow and gray tone to it which is

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.750 
yellow and gray tone to it which is
really<00:04:07.780> good<00:04:08.109> for<00:04:08.140> my<00:04:08.349> skin<00:04:08.409> because<00:04:08.920> actually

that if I don't moisturize very well the
foundation<00:05:01.330> were<00:05:01.659> actually<00:05:02.199> kind<00:05:02.470> of<00:05:02.590> build

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
foundation were actually kind of build

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.969

on<00:05:02.979> to<00:05:03.250> my<00:05:03.370> dry<00:05:03.610> skin<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:04.210> make<00:05:04.389> make<00:05:05.169> I<00:05:05.530> guess

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
on to my dry skin and make make I guess

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.760 
on to my dry skin and make make I guess
make<00:05:06.820> my<00:05:07.120> dry<00:05:07.810> skin<00:05:08.229> a<00:05:08.260> little<00:05:08.650> more

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
make my dry skin a little more

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.469 
make my dry skin a little more
noticeable<00:05:09.099> like<00:05:09.520> enhancing<00:05:10.120> it

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
noticeable like enhancing it

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.330 
noticeable like enhancing it
but<00:05:11.020> with<00:05:11.199> this<00:05:11.320> BB<00:05:11.650> cream<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:12.190> actually

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
but with this BB cream I actually

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.610 
but with this BB cream I actually
realize<00:05:12.820> that<00:05:13.120> even<00:05:13.300> with<00:05:13.570> dried<00:05:13.780> drier<00:05:14.229> skin

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
realize that even with dried drier skin

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.020 
realize that even with dried drier skin
it<00:05:15.250> doesn't<00:05:15.550> make<00:05:16.389> my<00:05:16.810> dry<00:05:17.380> skin<00:05:17.520> like<00:05:18.520> pop<00:05:18.820> out

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
it doesn't make my dry skin like pop out

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.839 
it doesn't make my dry skin like pop out
so<00:05:19.780> that<00:05:20.320> was<00:05:20.409> also<00:05:20.590> a<00:05:20.800> really<00:05:21.280> good<00:05:21.610> thing

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
so that was also a really good thing

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.080 
so that was also a really good thing
that<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.180> liked<00:05:22.449> about<00:05:22.570> this<00:05:22.900> BB<00:05:23.229> cream<00:05:23.590> as<00:05:24.490> for

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
that I liked about this BB cream as for

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.540 
that I liked about this BB cream as for
scent<00:05:25.449> it<00:05:25.930> does<00:05:26.229> have<00:05:26.530> a<00:05:26.800> bit<00:05:27.099> of<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:27.490> low

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
scent it does have a bit of a low

abstract<00:05:28.330> in<00:05:28.539> it<00:05:28.720> and<00:05:28.930> so<00:05:29.590> you<00:05:29.650> can<00:05:30.220> kind<00:05:30.580> of

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
abstract in it and so you can kind of

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.089 
abstract in it and so you can kind of
tell<00:05:31.060> that<00:05:31.389> there<00:05:31.630> is<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.750> hint<00:05:32.199> of<00:05:32.380> a<00:05:32.620> low<00:05:32.680> in

overpowering
it's<00:05:37.229> not<00:05:37.500> very<00:05:37.949> noticeable<00:05:38.550> unless<00:05:39.330> you

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
it's not very noticeable unless you

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.540 
it's not very noticeable unless you
actually<00:05:40.410> just<00:05:40.620> kind<00:05:40.860> of<00:05:40.919> stick<00:05:41.160> your<00:05:41.310> nose

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.860 
I am thinking of repurchasing again
depending<00:06:02.669> on<00:06:02.759> how<00:06:02.970> it<00:06:03.120> plays<00:06:03.389> out<00:06:03.570> in<00:06:03.630> the

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
depending on how it plays out in the

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
within the first week and then for some

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.240 
within the first week and then for some
reason<00:06:08.870> disliking<00:06:09.870> them<00:06:10.080> later<00:06:10.590> on<00:06:10.830> for

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
reason disliking them later on for

whatever<00:06:11.520> reason<00:06:12.449> so<00:06:13.349> I'll<00:06:13.740> see<00:06:13.919> how<00:06:14.099> that

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
whatever reason so I'll see how that

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.860 
whatever reason so I'll see how that
plays<00:06:14.430> out<00:06:14.639> in<00:06:14.759> the<00:06:14.849> future<00:06:14.880> but<00:06:15.449> I<00:06:15.690> am

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
plays out in the future but I am

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.930 
plays out in the future but I am
planning<00:06:16.259> on<00:06:16.410> sticking<00:06:16.620> to<00:06:16.889> the<00:06:16.949> IVA<00:06:17.370> cream<00:06:17.639> I

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
do like it I think it's actually one of

do like it I think it's actually one of
the<00:06:20.610> shades<00:06:20.820> that<00:06:21.060> matched<00:06:21.660> me<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.320> best<00:06:22.590> out
