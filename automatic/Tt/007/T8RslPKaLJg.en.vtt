00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
just thought about it and I analyzed it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.790 
just thought about it and I analyzed it
and<00:00:48.420> basically<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.780> put<00:00:48.989> him<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.170> Miss<00:00:49.590> straight

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and basically I put him on Miss straight

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.139 
and basically I put him on Miss straight
draw<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.460> was<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:50.730> close<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.120> being

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
draw and I was pretty close to being

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.790 
draw and I was pretty close to being
correct<00:00:51.539> he<00:00:51.960> had<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> parent<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.590> straight

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
correct he had a parent of a straight

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
correct he had a parent of a straight
draw<00:00:53.010> miss<00:00:53.190> got<00:00:53.399> shot<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.840> a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
that's pretty much go I think I hope

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.050 
that's pretty much go I think I hope
they<00:01:53.200> didn't<00:01:53.409> show<00:01:53.500> any<00:01:53.709> had<00:01:53.890> much<00:01:54.429> draw<00:01:54.789> that

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060
