00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
all right I said I would do a review on

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.880 
all right I said I would do a review on
this<00:00:03.179> longboard<00:00:03.750> once<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.319> wrote<00:00:04.529> it<00:00:04.650> for<00:00:04.680> a

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
this longboard once I wrote it for a

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.970 
this longboard once I wrote it for a
little<00:00:05.040> bit<00:00:05.250> I've<00:00:05.430> written<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:05.790> for<00:00:05.819> two<00:00:06.180> days

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
little bit I've written it for two days

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.009 
little bit I've written it for two days
I'm<00:00:07.980> going<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.130> do<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> quick<00:00:08.519> review<00:00:08.670> here<00:00:09.019> this

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
I'm going to do a quick review here this

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.020 
I'm going to do a quick review here this
is<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.260> third<00:00:10.469> time<00:00:10.530> I've<00:00:10.980> done<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
is the third time I've done this the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.940 
is the third time I've done this the
first<00:00:12.269> time<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> feel<00:00:12.929> like<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.049> rambled<00:00:13.559> on<00:00:13.650> too

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
first time I feel like I rambled on too

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.099 
first time I feel like I rambled on too
much<00:00:14.099> about<00:00:14.610> nonsense<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.480> said<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> same

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
much about nonsense and said the same

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.170 
much about nonsense and said the same
thing<00:00:16.350> over<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.619> over<00:00:16.770> again<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:18.150> just

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
thing over and over again and I just

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.810 
thing over and over again and I just
recorded<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.840> again<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:20.100> replayed<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.699> and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
recorded it again and I replayed it and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.230 
recorded it again and I replayed it and
it's<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.510> slow<00:00:21.750> motion<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.820> this<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> last

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
it's in slow motion so this is the last

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.700 
it's in slow motion so this is the last
time<00:00:24.480> I'm<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.470> hope

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
time I'm going to do this and this hope

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.769 
time I'm going to do this and this hope
this<00:00:25.890> time<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.250> works<00:00:26.960> here's<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.199> longboard

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
this time it works here's the longboard

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.160 
this time it works here's the longboard
it<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.520> 2012<00:00:32.520> land<00:00:33.210> yox<00:00:33.510> battle-ax

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
it is a 2012 land yox battle-ax

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.260 
it is a 2012 land yox battle-ax
there's<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.559> graphic<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.820> samurai

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
there's the graphic it is like a samurai

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.970 
there's the graphic it is like a samurai
on<00:00:39.510> there<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.989> think<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.710> looks<00:00:40.860> pretty<00:00:41.100> cool<00:00:41.340> uh

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
on there I think it looks pretty cool uh

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.139 
on there I think it looks pretty cool uh
this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.190> basically<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:46.370> how<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> say<00:00:47.730> stop

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this is basically like how I say stop

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.930 
this is basically like how I say stop
but<00:00:48.590> what<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.680> see<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.370> what<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.700> get

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
but what you see here is what you get

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.850 
but what you see here is what you get
for<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> price<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:52.050> only<00:00:52.199> thing<00:00:52.379> upgraded

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
for the price the only thing upgraded

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.729 
for the price the only thing upgraded
are<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> wheels<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.559> got<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
are the wheels you know you got the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.340 
are the wheels you know you got the
board<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.789> got<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> trucks<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.079> trucks

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
board then you got the trucks the trucks

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.860 
board then you got the trucks the trucks
here<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:59.070> Z<00:01:00.000> flex<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:01.100> 180<00:01:02.100> millimeter<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
here are Z flex a 180 millimeter the the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
here are Z flex a 180 millimeter the the
bearings<00:01:04.260> inside<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.799> wheels<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.280> rush<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
bearings inside the wheels are rush a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.590 
bearings inside the wheels are rush a
back<00:01:06.090> 5s<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.369> wheels<00:01:08.760> themselves<00:01:09.000> are

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
back 5s and the wheels themselves are

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.560 
back 5s and the wheels themselves are
hogs<00:01:10.369> mini-monster<00:01:11.479> 70<00:01:12.479> millimeter<00:01:12.900> 82<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
hogs mini-monster 70 millimeter 82 a and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.130 
hogs mini-monster 70 millimeter 82 a and
the<00:01:15.570> 82<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.570> durometer<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:19.020> I

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the 82 a is the durometer I think I

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.780 
the 82 a is the durometer I think I
don't<00:01:19.200> know<00:01:19.320> how<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> pronounce<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.920> that's

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
don't know how to pronounce it that's

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.080 
don't know how to pronounce it that's
the<00:01:21.409> like<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.070> thickness<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.790> hardness

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the like the the thickness the hardness

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.450 
the like the the thickness the hardness
of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> wheel<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.320> means<00:01:25.530> from<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.430> I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
of the wheel and that means from what I

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.030 
of the wheel and that means from what I
gather<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.600> wheel<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.350> you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
gather is that this wheel you know you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.170 
gather is that this wheel you know you
can<00:01:29.159> kind<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.460> slide<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.790> them<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.060> they're

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
can kind of slide on them but they're

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.719 
can kind of slide on them but they're
also<00:01:30.299> grippy<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.990> don't<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.040> can't<00:01:32.340> sign<00:01:32.579> on

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
also grippy I don't know I can't sign on

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.340 
also grippy I don't know I can't sign on
I<00:01:33.000> mean<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.509> first<00:01:33.540> longboard<00:01:34.229> I'm

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
I mean this is my first longboard I'm

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.550 
I mean this is my first longboard I'm
not<00:01:34.470> very<00:01:34.650> experienced<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.689> I<00:01:36.689> haven't<00:01:37.439> been

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
not very experienced and I haven't been

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.020 
not very experienced and I haven't been
able<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.040> sideways<00:01:38.280> which<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.729> haven't

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
able to get it sideways which I haven't

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.359 
able to get it sideways which I haven't
really<00:01:39.420> tried<00:01:39.600> yet<00:01:39.930> because<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.040> said<00:01:41.100> it's

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
really tried yet because as I said it's

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.560 
really tried yet because as I said it's
my<00:01:41.490> first<00:01:41.729> longboard<00:01:42.060> I'm<00:01:42.180> trying<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> get

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
my first longboard I'm trying to get

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
my first longboard I'm trying to get
used<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:44.329> and<00:01:45.590> my<00:01:46.590> legs<00:01:46.829> could<00:01:47.070> definitely

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
used to it and my legs could definitely

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.950 
used to it and my legs could definitely
tell<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> my<00:01:48.299> first<00:01:48.600> line<00:01:48.780> board

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
tell you this is my first line board

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.460 
tell you this is my first line board

looking<00:02:26.590> at<00:02:26.680> this<00:02:26.800> board<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.280> it's<00:02:27.460> super

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
looking at this board that it's super

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.470 
looking at this board that it's super
flexy<00:02:28.390> but<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.320> me<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.770> don't<00:02:30.340> know<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:31.270> is

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
flexy but to me I don't know this is

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.150 
flexy but to me I don't know this is
super<00:02:31.900> flexing<00:02:32.550> and<00:02:33.550> then<00:02:34.650> because<00:02:35.650> it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
super flexing and then because it

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.980 
super flexing and then because it
doesn't<00:02:36.490> feel<00:02:36.640> super<00:02:36.970> flex<00:02:37.180> maybe<00:02:37.420> it's

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
doesn't feel super flex maybe it's

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:49.530 
doesn't feel super flex maybe it's
perfect<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.590> weigh<00:02:39.130> 155<00:02:40.080> at<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.320> most<00:02:48.540> it's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
perfect I weigh 155 at the most it's

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.260 
perfect I weigh 155 at the most it's
made<00:02:49.810> of<00:02:50.020> bamboo<00:02:50.200> it's<00:02:51.100> got<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.520> believe<00:02:51.580> three

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
made of bamboo it's got I believe three

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.030 
made of bamboo it's got I believe three
plies<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.720> bamboo<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.140> lighter<00:02:53.350> color<00:02:53.710> here

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
plies of bamboo the lighter color here

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.070 
plies of bamboo the lighter color here
on<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.490> top<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.910> middle<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.600> bottom<00:02:55.750> and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
on the top the middle and the bottom and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.200 
on the top the middle and the bottom and
I<00:02:56.590> believe<00:02:56.830> this<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.040> maple<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.760> between<00:02:58.090> the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
I believe this is maple in between the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.880 
I believe this is maple in between the
dark<00:02:58.420> pillar<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.020> that's<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.530> give<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.770> its

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
dark pillar and that's to give it its

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.510 
dark pillar and that's to give it its
strength<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:02.110> nap<00:03:02.500> whatever<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.280> call

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
strength and it's nap whatever you call

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.610 
strength and it's nap whatever you call
it<00:03:03.550> here's<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:05.610> concave<00:03:07.260> it's<00:03:08.260> got<00:03:08.410> pretty

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
it here's the concave it's got pretty

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.280 
it here's the concave it's got pretty
good<00:03:08.740> concave<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.580> think<00:03:10.570> they<00:03:10.780> said<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
good concave I think they said in the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.570 
good concave I think they said in the
description<00:03:11.710> on<00:03:11.800> that<00:03:11.860> it's<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.250> medium

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
description on that it's a medium

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.030 
description on that it's a medium
concave<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:14.110> you<00:03:14.230> know<00:03:14.350> there's<00:03:14.530> some<00:03:14.710> boards

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
concave so you know there's some boards

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.280 
concave so you know there's some boards
that<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.400> know<00:03:15.489> they<00:03:15.610> come<00:03:15.910> way<00:03:16.600> down<00:03:16.630> and

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
that you know they come way down and

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.050 
that you know they come way down and
they're<00:03:17.739> like<00:03:17.860> really<00:03:18.280> curved<00:03:18.640> up<00:03:18.790> on<00:03:18.910> the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
they're like really curved up on the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.930 
they're like really curved up on the
edges<00:03:19.750> here<00:03:20.310> but<00:03:21.310> since<00:03:21.670> it's<00:03:21.820> my<00:03:21.880> first

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
edges here but since it's my first

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.380 
edges here but since it's my first
longboard<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.750> really<00:03:22.989> can't<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:24.040> know<00:03:24.390> say

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.080 
longboard I really can't you know say
too<00:03:25.450> much<00:03:25.989> about<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.100> like<00:03:27.430> oh<00:03:27.670> it's<00:03:27.880> bad
