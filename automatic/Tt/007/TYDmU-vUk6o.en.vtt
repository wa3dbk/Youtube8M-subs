hello today I'm going to discuss another
possible<00:00:03.870> reason<00:00:03.929> why<00:00:04.350> your<00:00:04.620> relief<00:00:05.220> valve<00:00:05.490> is

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
possible reason why your relief valve is

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.810 
possible reason why your relief valve is

your<00:00:35.850> pressure<00:00:36.570> has<00:00:37.140> gone<00:00:37.380> up<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.680> your

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
your pressure has gone up in your

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.350 
your pressure has gone up in your
furnace<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.840> you<00:00:39.840> check<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.110> quite<00:00:40.469> easily

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
furnace and you check that quite easily

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.700 
furnace and you check that quite easily
there's<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> relief<00:00:42.809> valve<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.290> furnace

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
there's the relief valve in this furnace

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.060 
there's the relief valve in this furnace
but<00:00:44.489> there's<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.969> trad<00:00:45.210> occator<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.890> what<00:00:46.890> that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
but there's a trad occator and what that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.560 
but there's a trad occator and what that
does<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.730> measures<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.829> pressure<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> top

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
does it measures the pressure on the top

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.299 
does it measures the pressure on the top
right<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.770> temperature<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
right here and the temperature on the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.319 
right here and the temperature on the
bottom<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.440> operating<00:00:56.280> pressure<00:00:57.000> when

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
bottom so the operating pressure when

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.040 
bottom so the operating pressure when
the<00:00:57.480> water<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.809> heated<00:00:58.320> should<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.460> around<00:01:00.050> 20

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the water is heated should be around 20

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.250 
the water is heated should be around 20
pounds<00:01:02.840> if<00:01:04.640> it's<00:01:05.640> creeping<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.110> get

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
pounds if it's creeping up there you get

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.039 
pounds if it's creeping up there you get
27<00:01:07.619> 28<00:01:08.159> pounds<00:01:08.869> might<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:10.020> time<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:11.900> find<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
27 28 pounds might be time to find the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.810 
27 28 pounds might be time to find the
reason<00:01:13.350> why<00:01:15.920> there's<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.009> relief<00:01:17.310> valve<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
reason why there's a relief valve and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.789 
reason why there's a relief valve and
that's<00:01:18.090> what<00:01:18.299> you're<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.570> see<00:01:18.840> blowing

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
that's what you're going to see blowing

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.240 
that's what you're going to see blowing
off<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.340> blows<00:01:20.700> off<00:01:20.909> at<00:01:21.119> 30<00:01:21.390> psi<00:01:21.799> 30<00:01:22.799> pounds

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
off that blows off at 30 psi 30 pounds

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.760 
off that blows off at 30 psi 30 pounds
and<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.540> an<00:01:24.659> extra<00:01:24.990> tank<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.530> your

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and if you have an extra tank on your

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.730 
and if you have an extra tank on your
system<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.869> are<00:01:27.869> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.439> replace
