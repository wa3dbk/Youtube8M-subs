for<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> few

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.839 

first<00:00:22.230> off<00:00:22.470> grand<00:00:22.769> theft<00:00:22.919> auto<00:00:23.130> 4<00:00:23.429> is<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> great

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
first off grand theft auto 4 is a great

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.370 
first off grand theft auto 4 is a great
game<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.329> I<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:24.570> feel<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.199> could<00:00:25.320> have

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
game but I just feel like it could have

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.830 
game but I just feel like it could have
been<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.859> much<00:00:25.890> more<00:00:26.070> let's<00:00:27.060> say<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.269> much<00:00:27.599> more

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
been so much more let's say so much more

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.990 
been so much more let's say so much more
I<00:00:27.869> mean<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.829> just<00:00:28.890> feels<00:00:29.309> like<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.489> step<00:00:29.759> down

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
I mean it just feels like a step down

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.359 
I mean it just feels like a step down
from<00:00:30.059> San<00:00:30.480> Andreas<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:31.859> kind<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.099> annoys

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
from San Andreas it just kind of annoys

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.640 
from San Andreas it just kind of annoys
me<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:33.210> take<00:00:33.480> away<00:00:33.690> features<00:00:34.290> instead

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
me that they take away features instead

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.460 
me that they take away features instead
of<00:00:34.769> increasing<00:00:34.890> them<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:36.269> I'm<00:00:36.720> guessing<00:00:37.140> this

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
of increasing them but I'm guessing this

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.200 
of increasing them but I'm guessing this
is<00:00:37.589> because<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.920> doing<00:00:38.519> it<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.730> multiple

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
is because of doing it on multiple

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.869 
is because of doing it on multiple
platforms<00:00:39.629> at<00:00:40.170> one<00:00:40.320> time<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.589> I<00:00:41.250> would<00:00:41.730> prefer

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
platforms at one time so I would prefer

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270 
platforms at one time so I would prefer
if<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.480> didn't<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.079> next<00:00:43.290> time<00:00:43.470> I<00:00:43.829> don't

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
if they didn't do that next time I don't

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.710 
if they didn't do that next time I don't
care<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.519> I<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.909> wait<00:00:45.089> but<00:00:45.269> I<00:00:45.329> prefer<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
care if I have to wait but I prefer a

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.350
