 arrest it of the sharing that was in sef 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:31.130

 sousa commented that he had a rack, right? 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.250
 showing humility is not that the daily 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.469

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.829
 I searched there and it seemed that I was 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.860
 We are going to end the team there behind 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:01.949
 cinema here he was killing everything 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:05.330
 world and the base was wasting a bullet 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:11.960
 and a bullet 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:17.659
 I understood recording mask is and 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:29.220
 patent an album is not lacking but reasonable 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:35.159
 here it is almost impossible to play 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:38.579
 not to mention you can play well in the room 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.390
 closed but most of the time I 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:58.049
 I have but already in which the team now 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:02:02.189
 this is the little toque that helps the band 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.969
 emphasizes that it will take you to the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.969
 game 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.789
 the guy comes with his uncle's radio, right? 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.849
 the goal touched tokyo 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.579
 Then he changed teams to drop the coritiba. 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.799
 started killing and killing me and killing everyone 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:20.219
 Red Team 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.859
 I did not tip for you to have give you 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:29.010
 to spare your affection from you even have 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:30.629
 among what it is make sure you download 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.739
 your each of these garbage 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:39.120
 he would kill flashing energy he was 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:42.299
 killing on high that the pr is very 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.269
 very much to play has to have 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.209
 A lot of desire to play this game has to 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.599
 If you think that crazy to invest test 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.840
 This money continues the idea I like 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.419
 much of the car has and this 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.939
 Tip and squeeze in the moment waiting for you 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:05.010
 between right or helicopter if 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:08.700
 be on the bridge between the whip 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.689
 You will see that you do not die until 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.220
 today are very negative for the 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:20.400
 result the guy did not leave the room 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.349
 persist at the end of the second day, people 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.750
 can not even car meet the guys 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:29.629
 they were in the precincts or knew me 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:34.680
 I asked to give new and nothing is the 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:37.769
 google is still not 100% perfect goal and 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:43.139
 people got to play he got 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:47.280
 stay him and that's what you need to 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:49.979
 who do not play fair and see that where ' 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.790
 below the hair in the negative field with 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:56.689
 sef most guys that go right to 1 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.349
 here, thankfully 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:03.810
 here comes the excuse why you have 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.060
 what to do small I had a guy this 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.079
 Sorry for my pussy, who knows? 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.959
 playing and staying are appealing to the player and 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.840
 For fifa kaka you did not have to 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:20.340
 The positive chain with a kick of shit. 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.690
 understood to be at 80 and hs high 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.450
 understood 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:32.040
 the guy got screwed worse 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:36.150
 Biggest loser with the little seat I have. 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.500
 What to say, I'll create a suitcase on the channel. 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.510
 it is clear that there is no 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.430
 report all pb games 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.630
 I really wanted to race, I do not know everyone. 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.700
 Not here at all 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:50.820
 but besides consuming a lot of time, 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:54.690
 editing a youtube on the forum still the 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:58.440
 support also has in-game has not 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.020
 life in the work of twins the genius then 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.810
 does not gain anything by doing this and so 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.420
 no longer it is clear that the 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.630
 request will no longer believe it but 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.210
 besides my notebook is bad it does not 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.790
 import very well flex with pb together 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.820
 of the leg sometimes falls clearly possible 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:21.450
 record a match with fps high and 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:26.250
 without crashing but that's it they are 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:28.740
 ipoque report over 90 using the 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.580
 top spoke 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.580
 hugs
