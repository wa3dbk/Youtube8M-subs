00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
stall weak foot so that makes him even

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
stall weak foot so that makes him even
worse<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.680> his<00:01:56.280> shooting<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> actually

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
worse and his shooting is actually

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.179 
worse and his shooting is actually
decent<00:01:57.450> inside<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> penalty<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.799> just

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
decent inside the penalty or just

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.219 
decent inside the penalty or just
outside<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.329> long<00:02:00.540> distance<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229

amazing one with him but like
said<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.440> lot<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.800> time<00:02:15.010> they<00:02:15.160> were<00:02:15.190> just

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
said a lot of the time they were just

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.970 
said a lot of the time they were just
off<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:16.090> off<00:02:16.420> target<00:02:16.810> good<00:02:17.260> heading<00:02:17.590> as<00:02:17.770> well

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
off on off target good heading as well

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.590 
off on off target good heading as well
once<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.700> find<00:02:18.940> him<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.240> penalty<00:02:19.450> area

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
once you find him in the penalty area

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.750 
once you find him in the penalty area
he's<00:02:20.290> most<00:02:20.650> likely<00:02:20.740> gonna<00:02:21.070> school<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.550> head

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
he's most likely gonna school you a head

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.820 
he's most likely gonna school you a head
up<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:22.090> he<00:02:22.210> just<00:02:22.450> takes<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:22.990> long<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.650> he

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
up but he just takes so long and he

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.040 
up but he just takes so long and he
isn't<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.370> player<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.970> would<00:02:25.120> buy<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.630> feel<00:02:25.840> a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
isn't a player you would buy and feel a

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.200 
isn't a player you would buy and feel a
difference<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.190> lot<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.700> time<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.180> just

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
difference so a lot of the time you just

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.710 
difference so a lot of the time you just
try<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.020> search<00:02:29.380> for<00:02:29.620> him<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.860> find<00:02:30.130> them<00:02:30.340> and
