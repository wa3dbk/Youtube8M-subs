say the program is probably the best
program<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.400> I've<00:02:02.550> been<00:02:02.760> involved<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.360> or

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
program that I've been involved in or

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.320 
program that I've been involved in or
seen<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.590> technical<00:02:05.040> elements<00:02:05.400> fantastic<00:02:06.120> I

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
seen the technical elements fantastic I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.990 
seen the technical elements fantastic I
would<00:02:07.290> recommend<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.040> any<00:02:08.280> coach<00:02:08.670> at<00:02:08.850> any

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
would recommend it to any coach at any

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.940 
would recommend it to any coach at any
age<00:02:09.240> whether<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.630> be<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> young<00:02:10.080> aspiring<00:02:10.350> coach

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
age whether it be a young aspiring coach

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.830 
age whether it be a young aspiring coach
just<00:02:11.340> coming<00:02:11.580> out<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.790> school<00:02:12.060> or<00:02:12.210> college<00:02:12.390> or

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
just coming out of school or college or

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.080 
just coming out of school or college or
an<00:02:13.260> older<00:02:13.560> more<00:02:13.740> experienced<00:02:14.220> coach

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
an older more experienced coach

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.080 
an older more experienced coach
I<00:02:15.120> still<00:02:15.900> think<00:02:16.170> whatever<00:02:17.130> age<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.640> coaches

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
I still think whatever age the coaches

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.940 
I still think whatever age the coaches
they<00:02:18.540> could<00:02:18.720> still<00:02:18.960> learn<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> lot<00:02:19.440> on<00:02:19.710> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
they could still learn a lot on the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.030 
they could still learn a lot on the
concept<00:02:20.340> before<00:02:20.430> program
