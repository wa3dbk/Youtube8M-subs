car you need to locate the Schrader

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.360 
car you need to locate the Schrader
valve<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:54.559> it's<00:00:55.559> important<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.219> this

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
valve and it's important to do this

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.260 
valve and it's important to do this
while<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.640> car<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.120> cool<00:00:58.079> or<00:00:58.879> fuel<00:00:59.879> will<00:01:00.120> go

while the car is cool or fuel will go
spewing<00:01:01.079> everywhere<00:01:01.670> push<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.940> Schrader

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
spewing everywhere push the Schrader

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.939 
spewing everywhere push the Schrader
valve<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.750> screwdriver<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> relieve

any<00:01:05.070> pressure

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:19.780 

there<00:01:08.490> wasn't<00:01:08.640> much<00:01:08.850> pressure<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.540> there

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.490 

and<00:01:22.040> then<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.190> can<00:01:23.369> remove<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.840> inner<00:01:25.080> part

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and then you can remove the inner part

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:38.270 
and then you can remove the inner part
of<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> valve<00:01:26.300> with<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.510> little<00:01:27.780> tool<00:01:37.280> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
of that valve with the little tool and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.210 
of that valve with the little tool and
be<00:01:38.790> careful<00:01:39.149> the<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:40.380> inner<00:01:40.590> part<00:01:41.009> doesn't

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
be careful the little inner part doesn't

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.389 
be careful the little inner part doesn't
go<00:01:41.490> falling<00:01:41.970> down<00:01:42.180> into<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.159> depths<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
go falling down into the depths of the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.389 
go falling down into the depths of the
engine<00:01:44.700> bay<00:01:45.560> I'll<00:01:46.560> set<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:46.950> here<00:01:47.190> on<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
engine bay I'll set it here on the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.130 
engine bay I'll set it here on the
battery<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.600> safekeeping

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:59.990 

next<00:01:52.970> hook<00:01:53.970> pure<00:01:55.220> rubber<00:01:56.220> fuel<00:01:57.090> line<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:59.000> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
next hook pure rubber fuel line to the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:19.510 
next hook pure rubber fuel line to the
Schrader<00:02:00.990> valve<00:02:01.940> and<00:02:03.140> tighten<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.350> clamp

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:33.420 

and<00:02:20.520> then<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.900> start<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.350> car

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.160 

and<00:02:33.519> there<00:02:34.209> should<00:02:34.359> be<00:02:34.480> about<00:02:34.629> forty<00:02:35.019> three

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
and there should be about forty three

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.430 
and there should be about forty three
pounds<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.680> pressure

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.430 

it<00:02:42.830> shows<00:02:43.010> 40<00:02:43.600> that's<00:02:44.600> pretty<00:02:44.870> close<00:02:45.110> either

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
it shows 40 that's pretty close either

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.259 
it shows 40 that's pretty close either
my<00:02:45.590> gauge<00:02:45.800> is<00:02:46.040> off<00:02:46.190> or

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
my gauge is off or

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.309 
my gauge is off or
I<00:02:47.299> feel<00:02:47.750> pressure<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.260> little<00:02:48.349> bit

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
I feel pressure is a little bit

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.979 
I feel pressure is a little bit
it's<00:02:49.769> also<00:02:49.890> important<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.840> holds<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
it's also important that holds the

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:17.350 
it's also important that holds the
pressure

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:25.920
