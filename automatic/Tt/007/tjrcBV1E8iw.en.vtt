00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.280
 he was "completely and completely" Bauer said the job Dennis Diekmeier professional of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.169
 Hamburger SV his personal dream more ahead 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.850
 which should if the host 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.449
 oriented by investors 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.449
 So a goal is clearly Oliver Kahn 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.689
 Of course he does not call drums 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.270
 I would also like to use realist there or do I have those on the left side 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.270
 park 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.120
 in central defense is still not clear whether Mio 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.120
 Lucio could be Daimler 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.980
 then I would be with two defensive players 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.790
 Schweinsteiger Lampard 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.300
 in natural world out with Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.300
 super-kicker MSC 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.870
 Although counting the US would leave the natural one no good 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.250
 Time, though 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.280
 there you could hear what he can call up to 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 Great coach 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.920
 and before the storm or what role can play from Super Game 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.889
 have with me and what he did not feel was for me 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 Super striker 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.080
 perfect or 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.869
 this is my dream 11 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.869
 4 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.299
 He was a member of the relatives as a singer Liam 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.819
 Nvidia even set up a double floors and the waves though 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.849
 the Nordbremer show 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.530
 For environmental protection as well as play the likely to hold up rather 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.890
 would immediately in the question of whether it is private or she has set herself 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.910
 the 11 which could interact so the position are reasonably well 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.569
 Examined dreaming occupied 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.429
 otherwise 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.699
 Bloch game table played stressed that percent 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.009
 Euro for the four goals 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:52.369
 he probably set himself up for Hinrichs 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:56.040
 You can see that even in his career there is still a lot in mind 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.039
 you can say that it is also with Schweinsteiger Lambert in the defensive 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.759
 Midfield but then quite offensively aligned but Michelle is nothing 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.819
 be bad and the regulation storm 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.919
 Surely his best time is over now for the end of his career 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:14.009
 The MLS percent end was then of course absolute old-ob 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.259
 Player and and certainly one of the best strikers in the world 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:21.409
 All the grants formed an absolutely topping is the vegetables and 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.369
 all 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:26.239
 curious Dennis Diekmeier in the back right for Dani Alves had then left 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.399
 Dodge so it can go every penny he likes the Dennis Diekmeier 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.629
 of course a nice thank you to the fans of the tv-spectators until the next one 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:34.919
 goodbye me nothing
