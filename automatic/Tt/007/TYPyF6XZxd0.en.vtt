probably<00:02:50.220> cool<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.360> let's<00:02:51.630> try<00:02:51.960> this<00:02:52.020> thing

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
probably cool so let's try this thing

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.770 
probably cool so let's try this thing
out<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.440> little<00:02:52.650> bit

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
out a little bit

intimidating but let's try the initial

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.230 
intimidating but let's try the initial
sharpness<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:01.920> don't<00:03:02.820> know<00:03:02.880> if<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.120> gonna

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
sharpness I don't know if this is gonna

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.670 
sharpness I don't know if this is gonna
work<00:03:03.300> cuz<00:03:03.780> there's<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:04.020> beat-up<00:03:04.260> piece<00:03:04.530> of

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
work cuz there's a beat-up piece of

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.340 
work cuz there's a beat-up piece of
paper<00:03:04.860> I'd<00:03:05.100> had<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:05.490> backpack<00:03:05.990> hey<00:03:06.990> we'll<00:03:07.170> try

it's pretty sharp he's got to work out
my<00:03:20.220> people<00:03:20.580> cutting<00:03:20.820> skills<00:03:22.760> it's<00:03:23.760> doing<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.240> I

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
my people cutting skills it's doing it I

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.730 
my people cutting skills it's doing it I
got<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> big<00:03:25.050> mess<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.290> pick<00:03:25.530> up<00:03:25.680> that's<00:03:26.640> okay<00:03:27.000> so

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
got a big mess to pick up that's okay so

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.980 
got a big mess to pick up that's okay so
initial<00:03:28.740> sharpness<00:03:29.160> is<00:03:29.370> pretty<00:03:29.670> good<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.210> the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
initial sharpness is pretty good and the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.900 
initial sharpness is pretty good and the
tip<00:03:31.230> feels<00:03:31.470> pretty<00:03:31.710> pointy<00:03:32.070> let's<00:03:32.700> try<00:03:32.850> this

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
tip feels pretty pointy let's try this

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.080 
tip feels pretty pointy let's try this
thing<00:03:33.060> out<00:03:33.270> on<00:03:33.300> some<00:03:33.600> wood<00:03:34.760> next<00:03:35.760> we'll<00:03:35.880> try<00:03:36.060> a

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
thing out on some wood next we'll try a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.420 
thing out on some wood next we'll try a
little<00:03:36.270> bit<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.570> whittling<00:03:37.100> see<00:03:38.100> how<00:03:38.190> that

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
little bit of whittling see how that

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.330 
little bit of whittling see how that
goes<00:03:39.230> that's<00:03:40.230> like<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.560> said<00:03:40.740> it<00:03:40.920> seemed<00:03:41.160> pretty

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
goes that's like I said it seemed pretty

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.310 
goes that's like I said it seemed pretty
damn<00:03:41.610> sharp<00:03:41.880> oh<00:03:42.800> yeah<00:03:43.830> Wow<00:03:44.130> actually<00:03:45.320> that's

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
fixed blade instead but boulders are

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.190 
fixed blade instead but boulders are
nice<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.970> have<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.390> always<00:04:00.510> got<00:04:00.720> one<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:01.020> me

it's<00:04:07.020> doing<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.350> job<00:04:07.380> pretty<00:04:07.800> damn<00:04:07.980> well<00:04:08.010> a

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
it's doing the job pretty damn well a

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.050 
it's doing the job pretty damn well a
little<00:04:09.780> bit<00:04:09.870> bigger<00:04:10.080> piece<00:04:10.880> some<00:04:11.880> nice

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
little bit bigger piece some nice

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.240 
little bit bigger piece some nice
control<00:04:12.480> push<00:04:13.110> cuts<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.390> works<00:04:18.570> well

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
control push cuts and that works well

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.009 
control push cuts and that works well
and<00:04:20.250> it's<00:04:20.580> sharp<00:04:21.060> everywhere<00:04:21.540> on<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.780> blade

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
and it's sharp everywhere on the blade

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:28.720 
and it's sharp everywhere on the blade
so<00:04:22.710> it's<00:04:22.830> pretty<00:04:22.980> consistent<00:04:23.780> at<00:04:24.780> least<00:04:26.960> nice

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
so it's pretty consistent at least nice

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.250 
so it's pretty consistent at least nice
next<00:04:29.730> we'll<00:04:29.910> do<00:04:30.090> some<00:04:30.270> stab<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:30.840> see<00:04:30.990> how<00:04:31.080> that

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
next we'll do some stab and see how that

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.440 
next we'll do some stab and see how that
goes<00:04:31.440> some<00:04:31.770> hammer<00:04:31.950> stabs<00:04:32.340> now<00:04:33.060> I'm<00:04:33.120> not<00:04:33.300> gonna

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
it'd be nice for this to have traction -

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.680 
it'd be nice for this to have traction -
instead<00:05:54.460> of<00:05:54.520> totally<00:05:55.360> smooth<00:05:55.660> like<00:05:55.960> that

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690

test<00:06:05.140> a<00:06:05.230> little<00:06:05.350> bit<00:06:05.590> of<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:05.800> durability<00:06:06.100> -

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
test a little bit of the durability -

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:16.350 
test a little bit of the durability -
from<00:06:07.000> the<00:06:07.120> shock<00:06:07.330> of<00:06:07.660> hitting<00:06:07.870> it<00:06:15.210> check<00:06:16.210> out
