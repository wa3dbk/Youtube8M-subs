00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:08.140
 hello everyone in this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:11.950
 teach how to make this pencil 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.580
 for this we are going to need three gummies 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:20.740
 black 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:23.500
 in six white gummies 11 pink gummies 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.950
 Y 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.240
 17 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.070
 you are not 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.010
 and yellow 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.280
 so let's start only 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.910
 we will need our crochet can 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.790
 be like mine metal or if not 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.280
 one of plastic that comes in the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:54.579
 packets of the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.579
 of the gummies so we go there 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.149
 we start from the bottom up with what 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:06.290
 which we take a black rubber band and we're going 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:08.750
 to do four laps on our 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.040
 crochet 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.240
 A) Yes 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.690
 we take two more gummies 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.350
 and we pass this to the center 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.420
 if sliding 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.630
 pushing with fingers 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.690
 it stays in the center and now 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.410
 we hooked the end 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.410
 A) Yes 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:43.110
 we take two white gummies 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:48.170
 we went through the center like that with the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.170
 crochet hooked the end 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.970
 two other white 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.670
 we passed them and hooked the end 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.560
 now two yellows are spent 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.740
 we hooked the end 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.200
 other two yellow 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.480
 the raisins if we hooked and we're going to put 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.620
 two times more 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.350
 two others 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:25.390
 we pass and hooked and two others 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.610
 so to make it the same size what 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.890
 you can make bigger, smaller 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.740
 as you want, I'm going to do it 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:38.400
 size this one 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.400
 now we take two pink gummies 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.409
 we had them in the middle we hooked and 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.409
 two others 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:58.870
 we pass and hooked now I put the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:01.420
 crochet here in the first half in 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.709
 this gap that remains of the first 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:09.660
 white with which he stretched a little while ago and 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.660
 I put the crochet here 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.610
 I take the other two white that I have left 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:23.170
 I pass through the middle hooked the end 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:25.530
 and now I take two yellow ones and 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.360
 hooked the end 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.700
 two others 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.750
 He passed 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.750
 in hook at the end 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.540
 another two happened and hooked 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.830
 and two others 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:52.830
 to have 4 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.730
 now I take two roses he passed them on hook 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.560
 the end 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.560
 two other roses 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.390
 and now we are going to close it for 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.269
 close it we take a single pink gum 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.720
 we went through the center of all the 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.900
 gummies that we have the crochet and now 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.860
 we close putting the side of the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.100
 left inside the side on the right 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.480
 A) Yes 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.480
 and stretch 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:39.190
 and as you will see here you are separated 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:44.800
 and I have a trick that I have so that 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:46.660
 stay together like that is to turn it around good 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.550
 that is really the same, what you do 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.550
 on the side you want to do it 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:56.400
 and here 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:04.430
 I put the crochet 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:04.430
 in the middle thus taking only one side 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.990
 to see if it focuses 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.770
 well this has two sides of this 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:20.560
 side and the one of here therefore I take a side 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:24.280
 and the side of the other pretty yellow well 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.540
 that the first two yellow gummies 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:30.640
 lame 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:33.680
 one side of each one like that and now under 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.960
 another yellow rubber band 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.630
 I pass through the center 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.960
 hooked the end and now I tie a knot 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:47.529
 again the same putting the side of the 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:51.569
 left inside of the right 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.569
 which I do the knot 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:02.700
 and you're going to see that there's still that 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.700
 good hole well now 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:12.270
 this little gummy that I'm going to put the 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.780
 crochet so here in the middle in 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.780
 zig Zag 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.400
 joining one side with the other 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.400
 A) Yes 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.710
 lame 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.650
 the gummy 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.690
 and now 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:38.139
 I'm going to throw the gun and the crochet 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:42.660
 outside with which when throwing it outside 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:46.990
 What we do is hide the gummy 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:49.380
 yellow and step together these two 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.380
 sides 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:02.379
 and we have 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:05.610
 the two sides together this is the part 

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:05.610
 hardest d 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:14.990
 of the whole tutorial put both sides together 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:14.990
 and if it does not come out then another way is 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.680
 do as we have done here in the 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.960
 first a knot on three sides by 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.710
 example here another at the end and another at 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:32.540
 half a knot in each part and 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:34.940
 then cut the gummies that are left over 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:39.490
 but come on, I hope it comes out 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.490
 so without having to spend more gummies 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:47.530
 Well, it's already finished, I hope you 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:50.169
 like the tutorial that has served you and 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:53.800
 that comes out 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:57.330
 and nothing guys see you in the next 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.330
 tutorial see you later
