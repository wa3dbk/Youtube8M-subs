more meaningful interactions between
them<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:11.310> post<00:03:11.549> then<00:03:11.760> goes<00:03:11.970> on<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> say<00:03:12.420> that

before<00:04:58.319> and<00:04:58.909> I<00:04:59.909> like<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.449> way<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:01.080> if<00:05:01.590> your

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
before and I like the way that if your

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.680 
before and I like the way that if your
squad<00:05:02.190> gets<00:05:02.430> completely<00:05:02.909> eliminated<00:05:03.539> you

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
squad gets completely eliminated you

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.439 
squad gets completely eliminated you
sort<00:05:03.930> of<00:05:03.990> taken<00:05:04.800> back<00:05:04.830> because<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:06.030> gives<00:05:06.240> you

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
sort of taken back because it gives you

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.300 
sort of taken back because it gives you
the<00:05:06.599> incentive<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.259> try<00:05:07.289> and<00:05:07.620> always<00:05:07.830> stick

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
the incentive to try and always stick

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.040 
the incentive to try and always stick
with<00:05:08.520> your<00:05:08.610> squad<00:05:08.909> and<00:05:09.090> always<00:05:09.449> stay<00:05:09.599> alive

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
with your squad and always stay alive

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.409 
with your squad and always stay alive
for<00:05:10.620> as<00:05:10.740> long<00:05:10.860> as<00:05:10.919> possible<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:12.000> know<00:05:12.060> as<00:05:12.240> we

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
for as long as possible you know as we

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.330 
for as long as possible you know as we
know<00:05:12.599> there<00:05:12.840> are<00:05:12.870> five<00:05:13.349> members<00:05:13.949> in<00:05:14.159> the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
know there are five members in the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.209 
know there are five members in the
squad's<00:05:14.639> now<00:05:14.849> in<00:05:15.090> bf4<00:05:15.449> so<00:05:16.289> I<00:05:16.319> think<00:05:16.409> getting<00:05:17.099> a

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
squad's now in bf4 so I think getting a

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.459 
squad's now in bf4 so I think getting a
squad<00:05:17.490> wife<00:05:17.669> will<00:05:18.000> be<00:05:18.180> a<00:05:18.389> lot<00:05:18.810> harder<00:05:19.020> unless

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
squad wife will be a lot harder unless

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.830 
squad wife will be a lot harder unless
you're<00:05:19.860> like<00:05:19.979> in<00:05:20.189> a<00:05:20.310> helicopter<00:05:20.969> together<00:05:21.629> and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
you're like in a helicopter together and

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.879 
you're like in a helicopter together and
someone<00:05:22.110> who<00:05:22.169> supplies<00:05:22.409> Europe<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:22.770> you'll

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
someone who supplies Europe and you'll

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.219 
someone who supplies Europe and you'll
just<00:05:23.039> die<00:05:23.310> straight<00:05:23.789> away<00:05:23.969> like<00:05:24.569> that<00:05:24.840> but<00:05:25.050> I

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
just die straight away like that but I

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.019 
just die straight away like that but I
think<00:05:25.469> with<00:05:25.740> infantry<00:05:26.159> combat<00:05:26.370> in<00:05:26.699> particular

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:27.029 
think with infantry combat in particular

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.089 
think with infantry combat in particular
it's<00:05:27.719> going<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:27.960> be<00:05:28.020> quite<00:05:28.199> hard<00:05:28.469> to<00:05:28.620> wipe<00:05:28.889> an

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
it's going to be quite hard to wipe an

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.980 
it's going to be quite hard to wipe an
entire<00:05:29.400> squad<00:05:29.699> out<00:05:29.849> but<00:05:30.120> if<00:05:30.419> you're<00:05:30.900> not

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
entire squad out but if you're not

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.200 
entire squad out but if you're not
careful<00:05:31.289> and<00:05:31.770> you'll<00:05:32.490> be<00:05:32.580> relentless<00:05:33.060> and

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
careful and you'll be relentless and

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.149 
careful and you'll be relentless and
you're<00:05:33.330> not<00:05:33.419> really<00:05:33.659> working<00:05:33.990> as<00:05:34.259> a<00:05:34.289> team<00:05:34.620> then

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
you're not really working as a team then

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.369 
you're not really working as a team then
yeah<00:05:35.550> you're<00:05:36.330> going<00:05:36.449> to<00:05:36.539> get<00:05:36.599> squad<00:05:36.900> wipes<00:05:37.110> and

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
yeah you're going to get squad wipes and

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:38.119 
yeah you're going to get squad wipes and
you're<00:05:37.469> going<00:05:37.589> to<00:05:37.650> lose<00:05:37.770> all<00:05:38.009> those

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
you're going to lose all those

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.550 
you're going to lose all those
specializations<00:05:39.089> and<00:05:39.210> perks<00:05:39.479> you<00:05:39.659> know<00:05:39.839> they

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
specializations and perks you know they

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.320 
specializations and perks you know they
are<00:05:40.680> really<00:05:41.129> trying<00:05:41.339> to<00:05:41.490> hone<00:05:41.849> the<00:05:41.940> team<00:05:42.120> play

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
are really trying to hone the team play

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.899 
are really trying to hone the team play

here finally the post goes on to making

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.969 
here finally the post goes on to making
some<00:05:45.240> interesting<00:05:45.810> aspects<00:05:46.259> of<00:05:46.319> al<00:05:46.440> evolution

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
some interesting aspects of al evolution

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.430 
some interesting aspects of al evolution
that's<00:05:47.490> our<00:05:47.729> favorite<00:05:47.940> new<00:05:48.599> feature<00:05:48.870> and<00:05:49.199> bf4

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
that's our favorite new feature and bf4

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.980 
that's our favorite new feature and bf4
not<00:05:50.099> only<00:05:50.460> can<00:05:50.699> they<00:05:50.789> make<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:50.969> skyscraper<00:05:51.659> for

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
not only can they make a skyscraper for

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.930 
not only can they make a skyscraper for
we've<00:05:52.199> all<00:05:52.319> seen<00:05:52.560> that<00:05:52.620> but<00:05:53.129> they<00:05:53.250> can<00:05:53.279> also<00:05:53.490> do

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
we've all seen that but they can also do

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.249 
we've all seen that but they can also do
stuff<00:05:54.240> like<00:05:54.300> changing<00:05:55.020> weather<00:05:55.169> conditions

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
stuff like changing weather conditions

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.740 
stuff like changing weather conditions
that<00:05:55.949> affect<00:05:56.039> visibility<00:05:56.819> I'm<00:05:57.089> hoping<00:05:57.569> that

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
that affect visibility I'm hoping that

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.300 
that affect visibility I'm hoping that
that's<00:05:57.990> going<00:05:58.199> to<00:05:58.259> include<00:05:58.379> like<00:05:58.740> dynamic

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
that's going to include like dynamic

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.999 
that's going to include like dynamic
rain<00:05:59.759> and<00:06:00.000> dynamics<00:06:00.629> know<00:06:00.930> if<00:06:01.529> I<00:06:01.830> think

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
rain and dynamics know if I think

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:02.869 
rain and dynamics know if I think
they've<00:06:02.099> said<00:06:02.310> that<00:06:02.460> they're<00:06:02.550> not<00:06:02.580> doing

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:02.879 
they've said that they're not doing

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.540 
they've said that they're not doing
day-night<00:06:03.419> cycles<00:06:03.930> but<00:06:04.139> maybe<00:06:04.550> dynamic

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
day-night cycles but maybe dynamic

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.040 
day-night cycles but maybe dynamic
weather<00:06:05.729> don't<00:06:06.360> really<00:06:06.599> know<00:06:06.690> that<00:06:06.900> would<00:06:06.990> be

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
weather don't really know that would be

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.230 
weather don't really know that would be
really<00:06:07.289> cool<00:06:07.620> anyways<00:06:08.279> they<00:06:08.430> also<00:06:08.610> do<00:06:09.029> stuff

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
really cool anyways they also do stuff

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.790 
really cool anyways they also do stuff
like<00:06:09.300> car<00:06:09.629> alarms<00:06:10.050> going<00:06:10.229> off<00:06:10.469> metal

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
like car alarms going off metal

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.469 
like car alarms going off metal
detectors<00:06:10.860> alerting<00:06:11.370> plays<00:06:11.879> of<00:06:12.120> enemy

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
detectors alerting plays of enemy

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.510 
detectors alerting plays of enemy
presence<00:06:12.690> or<00:06:13.469> even<00:06:13.889> the<00:06:14.009> ability<00:06:14.339> to

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
presence or even the ability to

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.129 
presence or even the ability to
completely<00:06:14.819> shroud<00:06:15.150> a<00:06:15.270> building<00:06:15.599> in<00:06:15.690> darkness

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
completely shroud a building in darkness

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.829 
completely shroud a building in darkness
and<00:06:16.289> take<00:06:16.560> out<00:06:16.740> the<00:06:16.770> enemies<00:06:17.250> using<00:06:17.940> your<00:06:18.300> IR

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:18.839 
and take out the enemies using your IR

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:20.990 
and take out the enemies using your IR
and<00:06:18.990> V<00:06:19.319> scopes<00:06:19.830> and<00:06:20.430> that's<00:06:20.610> something<00:06:20.849> that

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
and V scopes and that's something that

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.969 
and V scopes and that's something that
they've<00:06:21.240> talked<00:06:21.509> about<00:06:21.870> before<00:06:22.080> so<00:06:22.710> I'm

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
they've talked about before so I'm

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.649 
they've talked about before so I'm
thinking<00:06:23.699> that<00:06:23.819> there's<00:06:24.000> definitely<00:06:24.479> going

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:24.659 
thinking that there's definitely going

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.249 
thinking that there's definitely going
to<00:06:24.719> be<00:06:24.779> a<00:06:24.900> multiplayer<00:06:25.620> level<00:06:25.919> in<00:06:26.099> bf4

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
to be a multiplayer level in bf4

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.050 
to be a multiplayer level in bf4
potentially<00:06:28.259> a<00:06:28.289> rush<00:06:28.589> level<00:06:28.979> where<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.430> the<00:06:29.940> M

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
potentially a rush level where the the M

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.930 
potentially a rush level where the the M
comms<00:06:30.300> are<00:06:30.449> inside<00:06:30.779> a<00:06:30.810> building<00:06:31.319> and<00:06:31.440> as<00:06:31.560> the

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
comms are inside a building and as the

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.300 
comms are inside a building and as the
hackers<00:06:32.240> you<00:06:33.020> can<00:06:33.260> shut<00:06:33.560> the<00:06:33.680> electricity<00:06:34.190> off

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
hackers you can shut the electricity off

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.700 
hackers you can shut the electricity off
by<00:06:34.550> cutting<00:06:34.880> in<00:06:35.180> the<00:06:35.210> fuse<00:06:35.810> boxes<00:06:36.200> may<00:06:36.410> be<00:06:36.470> on
