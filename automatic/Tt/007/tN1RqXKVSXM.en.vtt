I'm Josh I work in the R&amp;D department of
cooks<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.470> use<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:59.010> basis<00:02:59.700> 3d<00:02:59.970> arm<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.540> create<00:03:01.020> a

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
cooks I use the basis 3d arm to create a

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.470 
cooks I use the basis 3d arm to create a
digital<00:03:01.440> image<00:03:01.710> of<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:02.310> vehicle<00:03:02.880> or<00:03:03.030> engine<00:03:03.330> bay

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
digital image of a vehicle or engine bay

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.750 
digital image of a vehicle or engine bay
the<00:03:03.810> computer<00:03:04.230> knows<00:03:04.440> where<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.100> arm<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.460> but

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the computer knows where the arm is but

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.850 
the computer knows where the arm is but
it<00:03:05.850> does<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:06.120> know<00:03:06.330> where<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.660> car<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.870> that's

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
it does not know where the car is that's

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.920 
it does not know where the car is that's
why<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.190> got<00:03:08.460> to<00:03:08.490> plot<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.910> three<00:03:09.180> points<00:03:09.540> yes

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
why you got to plot you three points yes

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.060 
why you got to plot you three points yes
so<00:03:10.710> now<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.520> computer<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.630> arm<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.800> car

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
so now the computer the arm and the car

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.860 
so now the computer the arm and the car
are<00:03:14.370> one<00:03:14.760> they<00:03:14.970> are<00:03:15.000> at<00:03:15.210> one<00:03:15.420> with<00:03:15.570> each<00:03:15.690> other

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
are one they are at one with each other

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.920 
are one they are at one with each other
yes<00:03:16.620> once<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.100> create<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.790> image<00:03:18.000> I'll<00:03:18.450> take

split hit the start button of course you

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.700 
split hit the start button of course you
see<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.390> running

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.129 

and<00:04:53.340> it<00:04:53.520> feeds<00:04:53.880> it<00:04:54.090> right<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.570> specific

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
and it feeds it right to specific

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.020 
and it feeds it right to specific
lengths<00:04:55.380> that<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.650> needs<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:56.009> go<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.250> every

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
lengths that it needs to go to every

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.730 
lengths that it needs to go to every
time<00:04:57.270> every<00:04:57.720> time<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:58.259> then<00:04:58.410> he's<00:04:58.560> going<00:04:58.680> to

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
time every time and then he's going to

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.890 
time every time and then he's going to
change<00:04:59.009> the<00:04:59.340> long<00:04:59.639> clamps<00:05:00.180> to<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:00.690> short

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
change the long clamps to the short

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.719 
change the long clamps to the short
clamps<00:05:01.229> for<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.500> shorter<00:05:01.830> straight<00:05:02.100> which

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
clamps for the shorter straight which

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.120 
clamps for the shorter straight which
eliminate<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.570> clamp<00:05:03.870> marks<00:05:04.050> that's<00:05:05.009> the

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
eliminate the clamp marks that's the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.830 
eliminate the clamp marks that's the
reason<00:05:05.370> we<00:05:05.460> use<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:05.820> lone<00:05:06.060> clamps<00:05:06.539> on<00:05:06.660> there

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
reason we use the lone clamps on there

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.749 
reason we use the lone clamps on there
with<00:05:07.410> the<00:05:07.530> smaller<00:05:07.830> clamps<00:05:08.310> that<00:05:08.430> tends<00:05:08.669> to

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
with the smaller clamps that tends to

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.060 
with the smaller clamps that tends to
leave<00:05:09.000> marks<00:05:09.389> on<00:05:09.600> there<00:05:09.810> right

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.100

now<00:05:48.570> I<00:05:48.599> know<00:05:48.810> why<00:05:49.110> Kooks<00:05:49.440> headers<00:05:49.590> never<00:05:50.190> have

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
now I know why Kooks headers never have

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.640 
now I know why Kooks headers never have
any<00:05:50.580> marks<00:05:51.090> later<00:05:51.479> on<00:05:51.750> we'll<00:05:51.990> find<00:05:52.229> out<00:05:52.440> why

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
any marks later on we'll find out why

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:00.780 
any marks later on we'll find out why
they<00:05:52.860> always<00:05:53.130> fit<00:05:53.520> and<00:05:53.699> flow<00:05:54.389> so<00:05:54.930> good

flow everything's smooth no edges so you

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.580 
flow everything's smooth no edges so you
don't<00:06:55.630> end<00:06:55.750> up<00:06:55.900> cutting<00:06:56.050> yourself<00:06:56.230> when<00:06:56.530> you

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
don't end up cutting yourself when you

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.870 
don't end up cutting yourself when you
take<00:06:56.740> the<00:06:56.830> headers<00:06:57.040> out<00:06:57.130> of<00:06:57.250> the<00:06:57.310> box<00:06:57.490> that<00:06:57.730> way

when you get it it bolts in and you

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.930 
when you get it it bolts in and you
don't<00:06:59.740> have<00:06:59.830> to<00:06:59.980> do<00:07:00.070> anything<00:07:00.400> exactly

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 
don't have to do anything exactly

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.520 
don't have to do anything exactly
because<00:07:01.510> you<00:07:01.780> know<00:07:01.900> there's<00:07:02.170> a<00:07:02.230> lot<00:07:02.410> of

full chassis car so the next thing you
know<00:07:19.240> you're<00:07:19.420> heating<00:07:19.690> up<00:07:19.780> pipe<00:07:20.020> and<00:07:20.410> you're

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
know you're heating up pipe and you're

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.290 
know you're heating up pipe and you're
painting<00:07:20.950> it<00:07:21.010> over<00:07:21.340> which<00:07:21.760> actually

you guys this way everything flows right
out<00:07:27.130> you<00:07:27.790> get<00:07:28.030> more<00:07:28.210> horsepower<00:07:28.750> that's<00:07:29.170> why

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:29.380 
out you get more horsepower that's why

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.440 
out you get more horsepower that's why
you<00:07:29.440> buy<00:07:29.740> headers<00:07:30.160> they're<00:07:30.640> good<00:07:30.790> to<00:07:30.910> go<00:07:30.940> I've
