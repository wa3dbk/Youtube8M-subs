00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.280 

I'm<00:00:13.690> interested<00:00:14.080> that<00:00:14.970> Helen<00:00:15.970> was<00:00:16.150> almost<00:00:16.660> 34

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290 
I'm interested that Helen was almost 34

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.140 
I'm interested that Helen was almost 34
years<00:00:17.500> old<00:00:17.740> when<00:00:18.190> she<00:00:18.220> made<00:00:18.580> this<00:00:18.820> painting

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
years old when she made this painting

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.890 
years old when she made this painting
and<00:00:19.600> yet<00:00:20.050> it's<00:00:20.500> a<00:00:20.890> very<00:00:21.520> strong<00:00:21.910> statement<00:00:22.330> and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
and yet it's a very strong statement and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.080 
and yet it's a very strong statement and
really<00:00:23.230> seems<00:00:23.440> like<00:00:23.560> a<00:00:23.590> very<00:00:23.830> very<00:00:24.160> mature

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
really seems like a very very mature

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.740 
really seems like a very very mature
aspect<00:00:25.690> of<00:00:25.810> her<00:00:25.960> work<00:00:26.170> yeah<00:00:26.680> I<00:00:26.890> think<00:00:27.040> so<00:00:27.490> and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
aspect of her work yeah I think so and

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.350 
aspect of her work yeah I think so and
also<00:00:28.750> that<00:00:29.020> this<00:00:29.259> is<00:00:29.320> exactly<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:30.460> decade<00:00:31.029> after

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
also that this is exactly a decade after

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.020 
also that this is exactly a decade after
mountains<00:00:32.140> and<00:00:32.410> sea<00:00:32.619> which<00:00:33.310> is<00:00:33.520> generally

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
mountains and sea which is generally

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.280 
mountains and sea which is generally
thought<00:00:34.270> to<00:00:34.330> be<00:00:34.450> her<00:00:34.720> sort<00:00:34.960> of<00:00:35.050> breakthrough

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
thought to be her sort of breakthrough

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.020 
thought to be her sort of breakthrough
work<00:00:35.829> so<00:00:36.220> that<00:00:36.430> in<00:00:36.970> fact<00:00:37.960> this<00:00:38.410> is<00:00:38.940> almost<00:00:39.940> like

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
work so that in fact this is almost like

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.660 
work so that in fact this is almost like
the<00:00:40.180> beginning<00:00:40.720> of<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.140> second<00:00:42.100> phase<00:00:42.310> of<00:00:42.340> her

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
the beginning of the second phase of her

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.780 
the beginning of the second phase of her
career<00:00:43.000> at<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.900> time<00:00:44.170> when<00:00:44.500> many<00:00:45.190> artists<00:00:45.640> are

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
career at a time when many artists are

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.520 
career at a time when many artists are
really<00:00:45.970> only<00:00:46.210> getting<00:00:46.510> going<00:00:46.930> in<00:00:47.080> the<00:00:47.260> first

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
really only getting going in the first

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.560 
really only getting going in the first
place<00:00:47.800> of<00:00:48.040> their<00:00:48.220> career<00:00:48.520> but<00:00:48.820> she<00:00:49.030> has<00:00:49.210> all

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
place of their career but she has all

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.370 
place of their career but she has all
this<00:00:49.900> stuff<00:00:50.170> behind<00:00:50.590> her<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.070> then<00:00:51.130> is

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
this stuff behind her and then is

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.560 
this stuff behind her and then is
drastically<00:00:53.380> simplifying<00:00:54.160> her<00:00:54.490> means<00:00:54.790> in<00:00:55.270> the

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
drastically simplifying her means in the

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.920 
drastically simplifying her means in the
early<00:00:55.930> 1960s<00:00:56.970> another<00:00:57.970> aspect<00:00:58.510> of<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.750> piece

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
early 1960s another aspect of the piece

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.140 
early 1960s another aspect of the piece
that<00:00:58.960> I<00:00:59.200> think<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.620> very<00:01:00.100> strong<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.090> very

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
that I think is very strong and very

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.720 
that I think is very strong and very
striking<00:01:01.960> is<00:01:02.080> the<00:01:02.230> balance<00:01:02.830> or<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.130> interplay

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
striking is the balance or the interplay

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.200 
striking is the balance or the interplay
between<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.330> areas<00:01:04.689> of<00:01:04.869> color<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.939> white

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
between the areas of color and the white

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.960 
between the areas of color and the white
space<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.080> surrounding<00:01:08.650> canvas<00:01:09.189> and<00:01:09.549> and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
space of the surrounding canvas and and

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.440 
space of the surrounding canvas and and
that<00:01:10.630> seems<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:10.990> really<00:01:11.290> give<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:11.740> work<00:01:11.979> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that seems to really give the work a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.630 
that seems to really give the work a
sense<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.689> airiness<00:01:14.530> in<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.830> kind<00:01:15.040> of<00:01:15.100> breathing

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
sense of airiness in a kind of breathing

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.340 
sense of airiness in a kind of breathing
quality<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.299> makes<00:01:16.450> it<00:01:16.600> almost<00:01:16.780> feel<00:01:17.079> alive

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
quality that makes it almost feel alive

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.580 
quality that makes it almost feel alive
the<00:01:17.850> method<00:01:18.850> obviously<00:01:19.390> is<00:01:19.659> very<00:01:20.049> intuitive

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
the method obviously is very intuitive

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.200 
the method obviously is very intuitive
and<00:01:21.929> accepting<00:01:22.929> of<00:01:23.109> chance<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:24.549> is<00:01:24.789> actually

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
and accepting of chance this is actually

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.779 
and accepting of chance this is actually
part<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.719> you<00:01:26.649> know<00:01:26.799> wonderful<00:01:27.369> pleasure

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
part of the you know wonderful pleasure

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
the picture provides that you you sort

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.050 
the picture provides that you you sort
of<00:01:30.549> try<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.619> recapitulate<00:01:32.619> for<00:01:33.460> yourself<00:01:33.850> what

of try to recapitulate for yourself what

of try to recapitulate for yourself what
the<00:01:34.179> process<00:01:34.659> was<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:35.249> recall<00:01:36.249> words<00:01:36.670> that<00:01:37.030> you

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
the process was I recall words that you

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.480 
the process was I recall words that you
wrote<00:01:37.509> about<00:01:37.810> Helens<00:01:38.409> work<00:01:38.649> of<00:01:38.829> this<00:01:38.979> period

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
wrote about Helens work of this period

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.969 
wrote about Helens work of this period
and<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.819> said<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.210> is<00:01:40.530> affirmative<00:01:41.530> Lee<00:01:41.829> of

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
and you said it is affirmative Lee of

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.550 
and you said it is affirmative Lee of
its<00:01:42.159> time<00:01:42.520> but<00:01:43.060> exceptional<00:01:43.810> within<00:01:44.139> it<00:01:44.319> and

its time but exceptional within it and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.389 
its time but exceptional within it and
to<00:01:45.369> me<00:01:45.520> that's<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.909> very<00:01:46.179> apt<00:01:46.479> way<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.399> describe

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
to me that's a very apt way to describe

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.330 
to me that's a very apt way to describe
what<00:01:48.460> was<00:01:48.819> going<00:01:49.090> on<00:01:49.509> in<00:01:49.749> her<00:01:49.899> work<00:01:50.079> it<00:01:50.319> was<00:01:50.590> not

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
what was going on in her work it was not

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.330 
what was going on in her work it was not
only<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.759> transitional<00:01:52.479> moment<00:01:52.630> for<00:01:53.109> her<00:01:53.619> but

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
only a transitional moment for her but

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.029 
only a transitional moment for her but
also<00:01:54.939> there<00:01:55.119> was<00:01:55.210> so<00:01:55.539> many<00:01:55.780> changes<00:01:56.350> happening

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
also there was so many changes happening

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.489 
also there was so many changes happening
in<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.310> art<00:01:57.459> world<00:01:57.670> generally<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:58.630> it's<00:01:59.319> so

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
in the art world generally and it's so

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.440 
in the art world generally and it's so
interesting<00:01:59.859> to<00:02:00.100> think<00:02:00.429> about<00:02:00.729> in<00:02:00.939> what<00:02:01.179> ways

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
interesting to think about in what ways

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.230 
interesting to think about in what ways
her<00:02:02.139> work<00:02:02.380> was<00:02:02.649> responding<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.520> some<00:02:03.999> of<00:02:04.119> those

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
her work was responding to some of those

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.539 
her work was responding to some of those
things<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:04.810> reverberating<00:02:05.469> with<00:02:05.799> certain

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
things and reverberating with certain

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.249 
things and reverberating with certain
attributes<00:02:07.149> being<00:02:07.479> explored<00:02:07.869> by<00:02:08.080> other

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
attributes being explored by other

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.710 
attributes being explored by other
artists<00:02:08.770> and<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.009> which<00:02:09.220> ways<00:02:09.550> she<00:02:10.119> was<00:02:10.149> really

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
artists and in which ways she was really

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.170 
artists and in which ways she was really
sticking<00:02:11.410> with<00:02:11.680> her<00:02:11.830> own<00:02:12.010> quite<00:02:12.670> personal

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
sticking with her own quite personal

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.170 
sticking with her own quite personal
vocabulary<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:14.920> think<00:02:15.340> characteristic

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
vocabulary it is I think characteristic

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.800 
vocabulary it is I think characteristic
of<00:02:16.390> her<00:02:16.720> whole<00:02:17.170> work<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.860> willingness<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.940> you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
of her whole work is willingness to you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.620 
of her whole work is willingness to you
know<00:02:19.959> take<00:02:20.170> chances<00:02:20.800> and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
know take chances and

in<00:02:33.960> a<00:02:34.200> funny<00:02:34.470> way<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.740> think<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.550> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
in a funny way I think the the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.140 
in a funny way I think the the
constraint<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.960> all<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.440> actually<00:02:38.370> provided

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
constraint of all that actually provided

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.720 
constraint of all that actually provided
freedom<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:40.050> her<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.530> do<00:02:40.830> think<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.610> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
freedom for her I do think that in the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.090 
freedom for her I do think that in the
case<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.300> exhibition<00:02:42.720> we<00:02:43.320> see<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.950> many

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
case of this exhibition we see so many

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.120 
case of this exhibition we see so many
different<00:02:44.340> aspects<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.300> her<00:02:45.690> work<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
different aspects of her work in a

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.700 
different aspects of her work in a
relatively<00:02:47.790> short<00:02:47.910> period<00:02:48.240> we<00:02:49.050> see<00:02:49.290> how<00:02:49.470> she's

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
relatively short period we see how she's

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.890 
relatively short period we see how she's
referencing<00:02:50.430> art<00:02:50.820> history<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.570> earlier

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
referencing art history and earlier

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.190 
referencing art history and earlier
artists<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.740> see<00:02:53.280> her<00:02:54.020> experiments<00:02:55.020> with<00:02:55.170> a

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
artists we see her experiments with a

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.980 
artists we see her experiments with a
new<00:02:55.440> medium<00:02:55.950> we<00:02:56.640> see<00:02:56.850> her<00:02:57.000> drawing<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:57.630> color

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
new medium we see her drawing with color

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.260 
new medium we see her drawing with color
expanding<00:02:58.800> in<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.950> different<00:02:59.280> direction<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.850> I

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
expanding in a different direction and I

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.510 
expanding in a different direction and I
think<00:03:00.300> it's<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.720> very<00:03:00.930> rich<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.590> an<00:03:01.800> infertile

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
think it's a very rich and an infertile

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.290 
think it's a very rich and an infertile
couple<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:03.180> years<00:03:03.740> for<00:03:04.740> Helen<00:03:05.100> that<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.460> very

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
couple of years for Helen that is very

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.330 
couple of years for Helen that is very
well<00:03:06.510> represented<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.800> selections

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
well represented in the the selections

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:17.320 
well represented in the the selections
in<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:09.090> exhibition
