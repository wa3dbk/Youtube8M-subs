good
don't<00:01:05.939> use<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.479> want<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> use<00:01:06.810> these<00:01:06.900> as

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
don't use you don't want to use these as

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.750 
don't use you don't want to use these as
a<00:01:07.049> backup<00:01:07.229> desk<00:01:07.619> unless<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> want<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.729> I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
a backup desk unless you want to but I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.490 
a backup desk unless you want to but I
don't<00:01:09.000> want<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.900> that's<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.200> first<00:01:10.350> way

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
don't want to and that's the first way

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.550 
don't want to and that's the first way
the<00:01:10.530> second<00:01:11.070> way<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.640> partition<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.299> drive

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
the second way is to partition the drive

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.630 
the second way is to partition the drive
sometimes<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> might<00:01:13.920> get<00:01:14.100> an<00:01:14.220> error<00:01:14.400> when

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
sometimes you might get an error when

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.920 
sometimes you might get an error when
you're<00:01:14.760> formatting<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.360> if<00:01:15.450> that's<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> case

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
you're formatting and if that's the case

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.719 
you're formatting and if that's the case
you<00:01:16.140> could<00:01:16.259> partition<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.490> wipes

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you could partition it it just wipes

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.980 
you could partition it it just wipes
everything<00:01:18.180> off<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.540> creates<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.840> new

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
everything off and creates a new

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.219 
everything off and creates a new
partition<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.740> create<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:20.970> partition<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
partition so create a one partition and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.510 
partition so create a one partition and
I'm<00:01:22.350> gonna<00:01:22.439> change<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.950> Mac<00:01:23.220> OS<00:01:23.490> extended

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
I'm gonna change this to Mac OS extended

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.289 
I'm gonna change this to Mac OS extended
again<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.930> time<00:01:25.170> we're<00:01:25.320> gonna<00:01:25.409> name<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.299> well

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
again this time we're gonna name it well

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.789 
again this time we're gonna name it well

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
gonna want to do this GUI D partition

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.200 
gonna want to do this GUI D partition
table<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:52.560> that's<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> partition

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
table and that's just going to partition

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.149

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.319 
it's gonna format clear off the drive
but<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.119> creating<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.479> brand<00:02:03.750> new<00:02:03.840> partition

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.389 
but it's creating a brand new partition
and<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.509> sometimes<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.770> good<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.280> do

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
and so sometimes it's good just to do

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.979 
and so sometimes it's good just to do
this<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.670> sort<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.940> completely<00:02:09.509> wipe<00:02:09.810> the
