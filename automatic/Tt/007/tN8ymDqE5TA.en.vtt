ghana at the beginning of this world cup
one<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.000> my<00:01:06.060> favorites<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> final

one of my favorites to make to the final

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.530 
one of my favorites to make to the final
was<00:01:07.320> Germany<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.130> I've<00:01:08.369> had<00:01:08.610> my<00:01:08.820> doubts<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:09.390> I

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
was Germany but I've had my doubts as I

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.880 
was Germany but I've had my doubts as I
believe<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.930> they've<00:01:10.080> been<00:01:10.260> slightly<00:01:10.590> weak

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
believe that they've been slightly weak

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.920 
believe that they've been slightly weak
on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> offensive<00:01:11.610> side<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> ball<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.450> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
on the offensive side of the ball as of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
on the offensive side of the ball as of
late<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.799> despite<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.640> still<00:01:14.939> believe

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
late but despite this I still believe

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.460 
late but despite this I still believe
that<00:01:15.330> they<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.450> potential<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.110> make<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
that they have potential to make it to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.380 
that they have potential to make it to
the<00:01:16.560> final<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.520> way<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.180> game

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the final the way that I see this game

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.640 
the final the way that I see this game
finishing<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> 90<00:01:19.320> minutes<00:01:19.590> of

finishing in the 90 minutes of
regulation<00:01:19.950> time<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.670> 121<00:01:21.240> tie<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
regulation time is with 121 tie but the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.899 
regulation time is with 121 tie but the
bet<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:22.740> recommending<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> play

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
bet that I'm recommending is on a play

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.550 
bet that I'm recommending is on a play
at<00:01:24.030> Brazil's<00:01:24.450> plus<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> half<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> goal<00:01:25.290> for<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
at Brazil's plus a half a goal for the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.730 
at Brazil's plus a half a goal for the
first<00:01:25.799> half<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.310> Asian<00:01:26.790> Handicap<00:01:26.939> with-<00:01:27.869> 360
