00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.559
 south 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.139
 knowing the new ford focus that now 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.539
 earned the surname of fastback change one 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.119
 little car rear end trim

 specialization journalist and will be 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.730
 sharing the views of this 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.950
 car even slightly different as the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.230
 people like to do by actually bringing 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.260
 opinions that are worth listening to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.309
 so this is our drive test drive 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.309
 news and start now 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.909
 in the new focus jeff beck is won the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.049
 front of the global is a car and was 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.530
 released last year with the back is 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.530
 similar to the one here but in this new 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.399
 some changes in your legs that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.970
 also increased the area of ​​the trunk 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:27.899
 a little bit is actually the front 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.180
 she is very advanced very modern and there 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.360
 a conversation that before recording did not 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.509
 we are having here in relation to the rear 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.569
 because it is ahead of the innovator with 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.780
 that mouth, that the fugitive brought the 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:48.780
 other models rock one right marketing 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.929
 the fort's portfolio all and the front 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.060
 she is very innovative and modern. 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.479
 back I think I was missing a 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.509
 but innovative is also more modern. 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.119
 It's to give a completely 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.640
 within a standard of a car not to 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.640
 I'm standing before the back of the company 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.900
 the deal this car really is a 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.209
 highlight is the 2.0 of 178 horses that walks 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.080
 enough and the promise still to be 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.450
 economic 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.000
 who does not have the measurement here in our 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.010
 the dashboard in the on- board computer but 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.480
 end of the test I'll put it to you 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.200
 see the average we've done in our 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.090
 mixed route or descending route s / ae 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.310
 also upstream sections 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.500
 the exchange also the highlight of this car 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.519
 dual-clutch automatic are six 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.739
 speeds 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.400
 she changes gear very fast gives 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.400
 driver comfort 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.430
 talking a little in the comfort of the car 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.260
 I find it a little tight 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.240
 it has this very central console 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
 pretty and functional but he 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.930
 missed some of the lateral space to 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.250
 who travels behind 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.250
 space is also not the best 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.880
 I 'm paulo brandão, we've already been 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.000
 here together other times and the last time 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:21.030
 I was with you when lulu jec 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.890
 16 and paulo cruz remained the beginning block of 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.280
 test at the rear 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.370
 he thinks that it is absurd characteristic of 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.710
 each carey that rear 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.900
 car the guy seems boss understood 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:39.680
 and four still in the backseat in 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.160
 motor and legal there was no space here 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.910
 has arrived 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.960
 You got your seat back to 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.990
 You stay comfortably in the lift 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.500
 if I was a little older and I have one 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.240
 meter and seventy-six I'd be 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.930
 problems and now if I had already 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.930
 it was curled up 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.709
 completing this our drive test the 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.260
 I'll tell you the following the focus 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.720
 best beck is a great option 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.330
 within this segment of the sedans he 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.350
 faces very strong competitors 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.440
 mainly Japanese 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.700
 the toyota corolla honda team and the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.160
 nissan sentra 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.000
 then there is that I am in the lead 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.070
 segment 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.050
 but it's really worth knowing the 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.180
 car closely he has many qualities 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.520
 mainly quality and dynamics 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.000
 It looked great, it 's a car. 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.700
 pretty good to drive well equipped and is 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.570
 with competitive price in that disputed 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.570
 segment
