all<00:00:13.710> right<00:00:13.830> now<00:00:13.920> we're<00:00:14.070> feel<00:00:14.219> like<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.400> motion

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
all right now we're feel like a motion

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.550 
all right now we're feel like a motion
at<00:00:15.000> DSP<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> way<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.809> cleaning<00:00:16.080> up<00:00:16.320> your

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
at DSP this is a way of cleaning up your

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.099 
at DSP this is a way of cleaning up your
videos<00:00:17.279> using<00:00:17.460> GPU<00:00:17.910> technology<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.690> we're

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
videos using GPU technology and we're

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.240 
videos using GPU technology and we're
here<00:00:19.199> with<00:00:19.320> Mike<00:00:19.439> Saunders<00:00:19.680> Mike<00:00:19.980> they<00:00:20.130> can

great explain everybody a little bit

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.859 
great explain everybody a little bit
about<00:00:23.160> motion<00:00:23.340> DSP<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.970> what<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.330> does<00:00:24.480> yeah

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
about motion DSP and what it does yeah

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.900 
about motion DSP and what it does yeah
sure<00:00:25.140> well<00:00:25.590> our<00:00:25.710> history<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.160> actually<00:00:26.699> in

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
sure well our history is actually in

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.910 
sure well our history is actually in
video<00:00:27.269> enhancement<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.230> military<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
video enhancement for military and

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.250 
video enhancement for military and
intelligence<00:00:29.099> apps<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.330> know<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.810> CSI

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
intelligence apps so you know the CSI

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.049 
intelligence apps so you know the CSI
type<00:00:31.560> stuff<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> grainy<00:00:32.759> video

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
type stuff like we get the grainy video

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.580 
type stuff like we get the grainy video
and<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.360> can<00:00:33.510> actually<00:00:33.780> resolve<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> details

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and we can actually resolve the details

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.340 
and we can actually resolve the details
of<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> license<00:00:35.190> plate<00:00:35.370> sort<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.700> things<00:00:36.350> but

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
of the license plate sort of things but

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.190 
of the license plate sort of things but
what<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:38.000> realized<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.360> realizes<00:00:39.840> generous

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
what we realized and realizes generous

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.049 
what we realized and realizes generous
because<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.739> obvious<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.550> lot<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
because it's so obvious is that a lot of

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.090 
because it's so obvious is that a lot of
junkie<00:00:42.480> consumer<00:00:42.960> video<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.710> benefit

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
junkie consumer video can really benefit

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.860 
junkie consumer video can really benefit
from<00:00:44.160> our<00:00:44.370> technology<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.450> know<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.780> can

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
from our technology you know so we can

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.720 
from our technology you know so we can
do<00:00:45.960> all<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> basic<00:00:46.559> stuff<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:47.010> fixing

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
do all the basic stuff like fixing

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.160 
do all the basic stuff like fixing
lighting<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.390> sharpening<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.050> that's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
lighting and sharpening but that's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.569 
lighting and sharpening but that's
really<00:00:49.289> kind<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.620> rudimentary<00:00:49.860> fixes

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
really kind of rudimentary fixes

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
really kind of rudimentary fixes
honestly<00:00:51.030> what<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:51.870> really

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
honestly what we can do that's really

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.740 
honestly what we can do that's really
neat<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.559> noise<00:00:53.039> removal<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:54.120> removing<00:00:54.510> like

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
neat is noise removal so removing like

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.110 
neat is noise removal so removing like
pixilation<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.829> jagged<00:00:56.460> edges<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.879> all<00:00:56.969> that

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
pixilation and jagged edges and all that

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.650 
pixilation and jagged edges and all that
kind<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> stuff<00:00:57.800> increasing<00:00:58.800> real<00:00:59.039> resolution

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
kind of stuff increasing real resolution

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.119 
kind of stuff increasing real resolution
and<00:01:00.660> even<00:01:00.960> doing<00:01:01.170> really<00:01:01.440> neat<00:01:01.649> things<00:01:01.920> with

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
and even doing really neat things with

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.740 
and even doing really neat things with
motion<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:02.940> doing<00:01:03.180> best<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.539> class

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
motion so like doing best of class

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.840 
motion so like doing best of class
stabilization<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.309> I'd<00:01:05.430> love<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> show<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
stabilization and I'd love to show you

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.200 
stabilization and I'd love to show you
some<00:01:05.970> examples<00:01:06.060> awesome<00:01:06.750> let's<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> so

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
some examples awesome let's see it so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.149 
some examples awesome let's see it so
this<00:01:09.210> isn't<00:01:09.570> very<00:01:09.750> typical<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.409> consumer

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
this isn't very typical of consumer

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.010 
this isn't very typical of consumer
video<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:11.880> gets<00:01:12.060> into<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.780> really

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
video but it really gets into it really

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
video but it really gets into it really
demonstrates<00:01:13.260> really<00:01:13.710> well<00:01:14.189> what<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:14.610> do

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
demonstrates really well what we can do

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880 
demonstrates really well what we can do
with<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> technology<00:01:15.259> this<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> cell<00:01:16.680> phone

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
with the technology this is a cell phone

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.380 
with the technology this is a cell phone
video<00:01:17.130> i<00:01:17.189> zoomed<00:01:17.490> him<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.939> bit<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.210> can<00:01:18.330> see

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
video i zoomed him in a bit you can see

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.600 
video i zoomed him in a bit you can see
some<00:01:18.750> big<00:01:18.990> problems<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.680> video<00:01:19.950> lots

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
some big problems with this video lots

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.719 
some big problems with this video lots
of<00:01:20.759> noise<00:01:20.939> awful<00:01:21.450> detail<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:22.890> what

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
of noise awful detail you know what

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.190 
of noise awful detail you know what
we've<00:01:23.880> tried<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.630> make<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.960> very

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
we've tried to do here is make this very

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
we've tried to do here is make this very
powerful<00:01:25.409> technology<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.220> accessible<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
powerful technology very accessible to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.090 
powerful technology very accessible to
consumers<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.560> fix<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.979> I'm

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
consumers so really to fix this up I'm

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
consumers so really to fix this up I'm
going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> hit<00:01:29.369> exactly<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:30.030> button<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
going to hit exactly one button it's the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.480 
going to hit exactly one button it's the
clean<00:01:30.840> button<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.979> are<00:01:32.070> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> see

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
clean button and you are going to see

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.450 
clean button and you are going to see
this<00:01:32.640> go<00:01:32.790> from<00:01:33.000> noisy<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.689> junky<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:35.280> can

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
this go from noisy and junky to you can

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.999 
this go from noisy and junky to you can
actually<00:01:35.970> read<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.840> details<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> books

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
actually read the details on the books

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.609 
actually read the details on the books
they're<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.390> junkie<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.900> illegible<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
they're so like junkie and illegible to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.260 
they're so like junkie and illegible to
you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.189> actually<00:01:41.460> read<00:01:41.670> those<00:01:41.880> books<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you can actually read those books and

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.030 
you can actually read those books and
this<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.450> super<00:01:42.659> zoomed<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.439> four

other<00:01:49.920> videos<00:01:50.310> more<00:01:50.850> typical<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.360> what

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
other videos more typical of what

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
other videos more typical of what
consumers<00:01:52.290> might<00:01:52.560> actually<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:53.070> taking<00:01:53.460> so

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
consumers might actually be taking so

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.219 
consumers might actually be taking so
for<00:01:53.820> example<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.420> taken<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> canon

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
for example this was taken on a canon

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.740 
for example this was taken on a canon
powershot<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.860> video<00:01:56.100> mode<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.659> was

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
powershot in video mode and it was

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.149 
powershot in video mode and it was
taking<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> room<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.469> natural<00:01:58.920> lighting

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
taking in a room with natural lighting

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.330 
taking in a room with natural lighting
so<00:02:00.149> unfortunately<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.350> video<00:02:02.009> ended<00:02:02.219> up

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
so unfortunately the video ended up

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.010 
so unfortunately the video ended up
being<00:02:02.549> dark<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.659> see<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> lot<00:02:03.990> of

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
being dark and you can see a lot of

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.200 
being dark and you can see a lot of
noise<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.829> picture<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.280> well<00:02:05.520> if<00:02:05.820> you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
noise in that picture as well if you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.300 
noise in that picture as well if you
were<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.390> fix<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.530> video<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.009> something

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
were to fix up this video with something

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.650 
were to fix up this video with something
like<00:02:08.459> Adobe<00:02:08.879> Premiere<00:02:09.360> which<00:02:09.509> is<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
like Adobe Premiere which is a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.540 
like Adobe Premiere which is a
full-fledged<00:02:09.989> editing<00:02:10.560> app<00:02:10.709> versus<00:02:11.099> us<00:02:11.280> where

full-fledged editing app versus us where

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.430 
full-fledged editing app versus us where
an<00:02:11.610> enhancement

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
an enhancement

an enhancement
you<00:02:13.440> could<00:02:13.590> fix<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.980> lights<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.580> fact<00:02:15.150> I'm

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
you could fix the lights in fact I'm

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.580 
you could fix the lights in fact I'm
going<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.480> go<00:02:15.540> into<00:02:15.660> fine<00:02:15.870> tuning<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.320> just<00:02:16.470> do

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
going to go into fine tuning and just do

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.170 
going to go into fine tuning and just do
that<00:02:16.710> myself<00:02:16.890> by<00:02:17.220> hand<00:02:17.460> bring<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that myself by hand bring up the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.880 
that myself by hand bring up the
lighting<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.660> little<00:02:18.690> bit<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.590> I'm<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:19.830> to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
lighting a little bit and I'm going to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.050 
lighting a little bit and I'm going to
fix<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.480> color<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:23.400> know<00:02:23.490> that's<00:02:23.670> fine<00:02:23.880> but

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
fix the color you know that's fine but

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.610 
fix the color you know that's fine but
unfortunately<00:02:24.570> I've<00:02:24.690> also<00:02:25.020> enhanced<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
unfortunately I've also enhanced the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.460 
unfortunately I've also enhanced the
noise<00:02:25.830> that's<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.490> video<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:28.350> see

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
noise that's in that video you can see

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.570 
noise that's in that video you can see
all<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.650> junk<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.070> still<00:02:29.250> there<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.520> I'm

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
all that junk is still there so I'm

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.050 
all that junk is still there so I'm
going<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.760> turn<00:02:29.880> on<00:02:30.060> clean<00:02:30.420> again<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:31.020> too<00:02:31.620> high

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
going to turn on clean again up too high

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.310 
going to turn on clean again up too high
and<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.270> see<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.480> noise<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.140> kind<00:02:34.290> of

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
and you can see that noise just kind of

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.010 
and you can see that noise just kind of
disappear<00:02:34.770> again<00:02:34.920> that's<00:02:35.250> before<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.060> after

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
disappear again that's before and after

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.970 
disappear again that's before and after
and<00:02:37.080> i'll<00:02:37.140> zoom<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.500> little<00:02:37.560> bit<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.890> can

then<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.810> could<00:03:18.990> even<00:03:19.110> start<00:03:19.350> sharpening<00:03:19.620> that

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
then I could even start sharpening that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.620 
then I could even start sharpening that
up<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.760> cool<00:03:20.910> thing<00:03:21.090> about<00:03:21.120> running<00:03:21.390> on

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
up and the cool thing about running on

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.570 
up and the cool thing about running on
an<00:03:21.720> NVIDIA<00:03:22.050> GPU<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.620> even<00:03:23.220> though<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.370> is<00:03:23.550> a

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
an NVIDIA GPU is even though this is a

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.710 
an NVIDIA GPU is even though this is a
Windows<00:03:23.880> software<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.300> can<00:03:24.390> run<00:03:24.510> on<00:03:24.570> any

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
Windows software that can run on any

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.740 
Windows software that can run on any
computer<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.230> has<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> CPU<00:03:26.100> in<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.450> we<00:03:27.450> can<00:03:27.600> run

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
computer that has a CPU in it we can run

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.230 
computer that has a CPU in it we can run
up<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.900> five<00:03:28.230> times<00:03:28.530> faster<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.280> an<00:03:29.370> NVIDIA<00:03:29.760> GPU

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
up to five times faster on an NVIDIA GPU

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.730 
up to five times faster on an NVIDIA GPU
so<00:03:30.480> right<00:03:30.630> now<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.840> know<00:03:31.080> we've<00:03:31.200> got<00:03:31.380> some<00:03:31.620> of

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
so right now you know we've got some of

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.890 
so right now you know we've got some of
our<00:03:31.860> enhancements<00:03:32.850> set<00:03:33.030> up<00:03:33.120> too<00:03:33.270> high<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.690> fact

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
our enhancements set up too high in fact

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.420 
our enhancements set up too high in fact
I'm<00:03:34.020> going<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.440> increase<00:03:34.710> the<00:03:34.830> resolution<00:03:35.010> of

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
I'm going to increase the resolution of

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.560 
I'm going to increase the resolution of
this<00:03:35.550> as<00:03:35.700> well<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.000> really<00:03:36.060> bring<00:03:36.360> out<00:03:36.450> the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
this as well and really bring out the

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.180 
this as well and really bring out the
details<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.080> kids<00:03:37.260> faces<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:38.010> can<00:03:38.100> see

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
details in the kids faces you can see

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.980 
details in the kids faces you can see
running<00:03:38.430> about<00:03:38.640> 14<00:03:39.060> frames<00:03:39.270> per<00:03:39.540> second<00:03:39.900> on

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
running about 14 frames per second on

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.360 
running about 14 frames per second on
the<00:03:40.080> graphics<00:03:40.470> card<00:03:40.710> I'm<00:03:41.040> going<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.220> turn<00:03:41.340> off

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
the graphics card I'm going to turn off

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.010 
the graphics card I'm going to turn off
usage<00:03:41.880> of<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.150> graphics<00:03:42.480> card<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.900> you're

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
usage of the graphics card and you're

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.680 
usage of the graphics card and you're
going<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.170> see<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.290> drop<00:03:43.650> down<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.690> about

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
going to see that drop down to about

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.780 
going to see that drop down to about
five<00:03:45.990> frames<00:03:46.350> per<00:03:46.620> second<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.460> I<00:03:47.490> mean<00:03:47.670> we

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
five frames per second so I mean we

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.250 
five frames per second so I mean we
really<00:03:47.970> get<00:03:48.210> a<00:03:48.240> lot<00:03:48.390> of<00:03:48.450> extra<00:03:48.780> juice<00:03:48.990> on<00:03:49.140> the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
really get a lot of extra juice on the

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.600 
really get a lot of extra juice on the
graphics<00:03:49.620> card<00:03:49.830> yeah<00:03:50.130> I<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.310> really<00:03:50.490> imagine

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
graphics card yeah I can really imagine

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.890 
graphics card yeah I can really imagine
doing<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.030> type<00:03:51.240> of<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.750> type<00:03:51.870> of

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
doing this type of this type of

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.390 
doing this type of this type of
enhancement<00:03:52.410> on<00:03:52.470> your<00:03:52.590> videos<00:03:52.860> takes<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.250> lot

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
enhancement on your videos takes a lot

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.580 
enhancement on your videos takes a lot
of<00:03:53.430> power<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.060> it's<00:03:54.360> all<00:03:54.510> parallel<00:03:55.080> computing

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
of power and it's all parallel computing

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.320 
of power and it's all parallel computing
so<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:56.160> would<00:03:56.280> really<00:03:56.400> help<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.670> use<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:56.970> GPU

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
so it would really help to use the GPU

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.580 
so it would really help to use the GPU
versus<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.690> CPU<00:03:58.050> there's<00:03:58.230> almost<00:03:58.350> no<00:03:58.560> point

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
versus the CPU there's almost no point

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.220 
versus the CPU there's almost no point
and<00:03:59.520> it<00:04:00.150> all<00:04:00.300> works<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.660> all<00:04:00.810> based<00:04:00.990> on<00:04:01.110> the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
and it all works this all based on the

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.080 
and it all works this all based on the
CUDA<00:04:01.470> platform<00:04:01.890> that's<00:04:02.250> exactly<00:04:02.670> right<00:04:02.880> this

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
CUDA platform that's exactly right this

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.820 
CUDA platform that's exactly right this
has<00:04:03.180> been<00:04:03.300> poured<00:04:03.570> with<00:04:03.810> cuda<00:04:04.080> so<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.740> you

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
has been poured with cuda so that you

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.320 
has been poured with cuda so that you
can<00:04:04.950> use<00:04:04.980> your<00:04:05.220> nvidia<00:04:05.460> graphics<00:04:05.970> card<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.240> do

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
can use your nvidia graphics card to do

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.550 
can use your nvidia graphics card to do
this<00:04:06.450> kind<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.690> stuff<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.020> let<00:04:07.320> me<00:04:07.380> ask<00:04:07.440> you<00:04:07.500> a

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
this kind of stuff and let me ask you a

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.200 
this kind of stuff and let me ask you a
question<00:04:07.590> how<00:04:08.220> long<00:04:08.280> or<00:04:08.730> far<00:04:08.760> away<00:04:08.940> are<00:04:09.180> we

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
question how long or far away are we

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.030 
question how long or far away are we
from<00:04:09.300> seeing<00:04:09.630> this<00:04:09.750> on<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.320> consumer<00:04:10.590> market

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
from seeing this on the consumer market

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.930 
from seeing this on the consumer market
because<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.550> something<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.760> i<00:04:11.850> could

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
because this is something that i could

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.250 
because this is something that i could
definitely<00:04:12.120> use<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.630> my<00:04:12.780> crappy<00:04:13.110> little

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
definitely use on my crappy little

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.120 
definitely use on my crappy little
iphone<00:04:13.680> videos<00:04:14.010> or<00:04:14.820> my<00:04:15.210> my<00:04:15.660> flip<00:04:15.930> mino<00:04:16.260> HD<00:04:16.290> cams

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
iphone videos or my my flip mino HD cams

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.430 
iphone videos or my my flip mino HD cams
those<00:04:17.580> are<00:04:17.730> ideal<00:04:18.239> scenarios<00:04:18.780> although<00:04:19.200> even

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
those are ideal scenarios although even

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.590 
those are ideal scenarios although even
with<00:04:19.799> HD<00:04:20.250> camera<00:04:20.609> videos<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.359> know<00:04:21.450> if<00:04:21.510> you're

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
with HD camera videos you know if you're

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.180 
with HD camera videos you know if you're
not<00:04:21.690> using<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:22.020> tripod<00:04:22.169> or<00:04:22.410> lights<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.950> mean<00:04:23.100> you

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
not using a tripod or lights I mean you

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.620 
not using a tripod or lights I mean you
still<00:04:23.340> get<00:04:23.490> yonke<00:04:23.730> video<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.360> then

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
still get yonke video and then

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.330 
still get yonke video and then
to<00:04:24.720> your<00:04:24.900> question<00:04:25.200> is<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:25.710> will<00:04:25.890> be<00:04:25.980> out<00:04:26.160> in
