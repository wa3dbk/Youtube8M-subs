00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello girls welcome to your camera 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.240
 same as today I bring you one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.710
 new review of the planet the city ​​with the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.019
 girls so if you want to know a 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.530
 little bit of this product keep seeing in 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.530
 this video 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.500
 indication about the first on the 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.020
 packaging this comes packaged in a 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.080
 plastic tube 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.560
 quite flexible which is designed 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.260
 in a very nice pink color the lid 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.599
 this is black color the amount of 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.699
 product that this brings is 27 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.160
 milliliters thing that I think is pretty 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.440
 for the price of this product the 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.960
 price of this product walks in 100 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.330
 pesos more or less in Mexican pesos what 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.040
 that is being an approximate of 9 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.930
 dollars in something else that I also 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.269
 really liked this product that did not 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.070
 this state in animals as you go 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.559
 to be able to see the shape of the bunny 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.839
 also says that this product only 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.449
 It can last 12 months which I do 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:01.119
 fair enough for the amount of 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.460
 product and I think maybe we could 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.199
 give up much more use of time than 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.630
 he says once you want him 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.409
 apply what they will achieve to see is 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.600
 like a pretty dense pastit type in 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.220
 color okay girl but one of the things 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.580
 good thing about this product is that once 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.580
 that you 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.540
 apply on your face this simply 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.370
 returns in color 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.470
 I'm going to play a lot with the amounts 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.720
 there is no need to apply too many 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.540
 girls products because I really like 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.820
 a small amount are not going to be able to go 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.040
 able to have very good results something 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.720
 that I also found is that we should not 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.170
 to apply it say in the yolk of the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.390
 fingers or things like that that tends like 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.460
 that will update much more product as 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.580
 it will be wasted the way that I 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.979
 I found was to apply it directly to my 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.260
 face and that's where I start to 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.750
 blur the absorption of this product 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.770
 It is also quite fast, there is not one 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.750
 sticky or greasy and the best of this 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.700
 that this same feeling will be able to 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.740
 achieve throughout the length that I 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.110
 really liked about this first one is that 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.229
 is capachica to leave you beautiful 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.660
 totally matt leaves a face lit 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.580
 but tell him what instruments do not say 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.580
 it's not even sticky after 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.720
 touch your foot when applying this 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.270
 after the base 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.600
 everything they are going to use and really 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.060
 that his face is going to look really good 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.490
 mate but at the same time illuminated 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.410
 begins to freshness that we always look for 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.350
 that the face looks quite natural 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.660
 nothing is you or another of the things that 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.060
 he also did is that everything you have 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.810
 applied on your face keeps it in its 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.390
 place either what makeup is 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.550
 blushes the contours the illuminators 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.130
 all keeps them with a vibration of 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.800
 color that is really gross another of the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.270
 things that I also wrote full 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.130
 perfectly pores something that all 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.830
 the primers should be filled 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.350
 those pores making that canvas of your 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.570
 face look much softer and for 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.570
 supposedly much cuter and above all 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.320
 much more natural and much younger 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.530
 this first one brings a bass or logic like to 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.770
 How much to me is a combination 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.990
 comfort of both but it is a color 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.270
 very dim girls is not something like that 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.209
 bother you in fact once you 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.130
 apply streaming 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.560
 you get used to the smell or just 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.360
 it disappears because I really 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.209
 no time I felt that harassment 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.400
 of smell because as I repeat the smell is 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.319
 It's too short and I saw girls like that 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.780
 how have they reached the end of this review 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.150
 I hope you liked very much this 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.310
 video and above all can be useful for 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.140
 your next purchases if you want 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.180
 acquire this product have the 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.000
 security that is going to be a very good 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.190
 investment for your repertoire of 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.019
 makeup girls so well that has 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.030
 been all for today and we 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.030
 we are watching in a next video
