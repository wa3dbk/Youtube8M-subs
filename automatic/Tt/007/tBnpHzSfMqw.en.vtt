00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 always committed wonderfully written 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.500
 a rail away a train runs through the 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.420
 nature this form of transport 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.589
 appears to be relatively environmentally friendly 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.570
 but that might be one 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.309
 misunderstanding 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.860
 driving a steam locomotive is hard 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.360
 work because nothing goes without saying and 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.740
 everything has to be constant 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.740
 arranged and adjusted 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.130
 the houses are getting bigger and more luxurious 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.300
 sign that the track the suburbs 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.160
 once he has reached the city 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.170
 comes from in the wooded areas 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.759
 from the harz 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.040
 Those are also the reason that the doctor 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.540
 loved is the big variety in it 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.540
 landscape and clean air 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.300
 the wow driving program 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.040
 railways in switzerland and just like 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.719
 the timepiece is the train traffic you can 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.239
 very punctual as the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.190
 could serve that good track 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.690
 connections were also of great importance 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.340
 at the decision to 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.170
 narrow gauge railway to him to Briek 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 laying of course is also in the region 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.540
 many made use of a line of 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.340
 the nicolai ball to the rest of fear 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.920
 soon after the arrival of one train 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.970
 leaves the next one according to 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.580
 the timetable 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.350
 I go to Zermatt a lot every day 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.820
 think time is small ode to the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.740
 vw yes yes yes that is sometimes possible in the TV 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.050
 running through it is a very quiet 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.960
 praise it now said everything this not 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.550
 agree that it is and that makes it one 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.220
 other way also very good because it 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.530
 just very quiet very meditative 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.360
 you can never know for a long time 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.020
 thinks no done locomotives for that reason 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.120
 that who 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.500
 yes yes free with a train, and get 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.330
 you hear something about where you are 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.070
 but it is such an initiative program 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.100
 if you take a half look then you talk 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.920
 much slower after that I think and that 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.570
 prick this kind of very meditatively 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.910
 something strange happened to the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.040
 perception of time itself that is the one here 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.979
 in the board again from the castle 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.540
 exercised by the Counts of Stolberg 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.220
 family of the mother of willem van 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.900
 Orange 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.630
 time came in the middle of the 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.310
 19th century yes so the time spent on and 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.979
 so the then in the middle of the 19th 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.649
 century began the time best modern clock 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.149
 also known for when you feel anarchistic 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.740
 crazy going on but you are in such a 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.870
 Meditative suede is also likely to be 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.490
 the studio where then the voice of one 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.600
 open a very nice voice at home 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.880
 voice over that 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.920
 who is also into a meditation itself 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.690
 so that he can also have the time himself 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.860
 manipulate or something 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.860
 so later he says this 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.590
 just like before there are still here today 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.920
 all kinds of activities to one 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.720
 to make the steam locomotive operational 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.950
 in that respect time hardly has any 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.569
 stood still 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.209
 yes hardly stood still so it is possible 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.760
 apparently yes and he knows that 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.760
 We now thanks to low even could
