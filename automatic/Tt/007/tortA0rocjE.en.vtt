00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
to film this video with the proper light

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.380 
to film this video with the proper light
ambient<00:00:32.110> lighting<00:00:32.320> so<00:00:32.890> i'm<00:00:33.760> using<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.180> link

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
ambient lighting so i'm using the link

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.140 
ambient lighting so i'm using the link
the<00:00:34.600> lighting<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.170> built-in<00:00:35.530> lighting<00:00:35.740> on<00:00:35.980> my

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
the lighting the built-in lighting on my

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.510 
the lighting the built-in lighting on my
handheld<00:00:37.500> camera<00:00:38.500> so<00:00:38.740> that's<00:00:38.980> why<00:00:39.190> it<00:00:39.250> looks

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
handheld camera so that's why it looks

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.460 
handheld camera so that's why it looks
kind<00:00:39.730> of<00:00:39.760> shadowy<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.420> glaring<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:41.260> things

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
kind of shadowy and glaring and things

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.110 
kind of shadowy and glaring and things
like<00:00:41.620> that<00:00:41.680> so<00:00:42.130> we're<00:00:42.670> going<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:42.850> do<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.000> best

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
like that so we're going to do the best

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.840 
like that so we're going to do the best
we<00:00:43.270> can<00:00:43.300> here<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:44.490> let's<00:00:45.490> take<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.670> light

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
we can here so let's take the light

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.080 
we can here so let's take the light
apart<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.420> show<00:00:46.450> you<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.500> insides<00:00:47.829> and<00:00:48.130> how

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
apart and show you the insides and how

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.700 
apart and show you the insides and how
it<00:00:49.180> works<00:00:49.300> so<00:00:49.750> here's<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.260> head<00:00:50.380> of<00:00:50.470> the<00:00:50.530> light

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
it works so here's the head of the light

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.540 
it works so here's the head of the light
is<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:51.640> it<00:00:52.090> uses<00:00:52.329> a<00:00:52.540> Cree<00:00:52.900> p<00:00:53.770> for<00:00:54.239> LED<00:00:55.239> emitter<00:00:55.630> a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
is a it uses a Cree p for LED emitter a

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.400 
is a it uses a Cree p for LED emitter a
glass<00:00:57.550> lens<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.420> textured<00:00:58.690> aluminum

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
glass lens and a textured aluminum

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.000 
glass lens and a textured aluminum
reflector<00:00:59.590> and<00:01:00.600> there's<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.739> dc-dc<00:01:02.739> driver

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
reflector and there's a dc-dc driver

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.330 
reflector and there's a dc-dc driver
board<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:03.730> has<00:01:03.880> an<00:01:04.030> actual<00:01:04.449> DC<00:01:04.750> DC<00:01:05.110> converter

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
board it has an actual DC DC converter

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.730 
board it has an actual DC DC converter
which<00:01:06.340> is<00:01:06.790> a<00:01:06.850> pretty<00:01:07.360> good<00:01:07.600> circuit<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.140> it

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
which is a pretty good circuit and it

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.530 
which is a pretty good circuit and it
does<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:08.890> pretty<00:01:09.040> good<00:01:09.190> job<00:01:09.540> regulating

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
does a pretty good job regulating

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.450 
does a pretty good job regulating
current<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.020> LED<00:01:11.440> as<00:01:11.680> the<00:01:12.100> battery

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
current to the LED as the battery

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.350 
current to the LED as the battery
depletes<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:14.310> let's<00:01:15.310> let's<00:01:15.670> take<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.090> battery

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
depletes so let's let's take the battery

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.870 
depletes so let's let's take the battery
out<00:01:16.830> there's<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.040> inside<00:01:18.340> of<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:18.549> battery

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
out there's the inside of the battery

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.130 
out there's the inside of the battery
tube<00:01:19.090> pretty<00:01:19.840> thin<00:01:20.080> walled<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:22.140> pretty

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
tube pretty thin walled it pretty

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.230 
tube pretty thin walled it pretty
adequately<00:01:24.479> fits<00:01:25.479> at<00:01:25.690> our<00:01:26.190> cr123<00:01:27.240> without

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
adequately fits at our cr123 without

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.890 
adequately fits at our cr123 without
being<00:01:29.110> too<00:01:29.290> big<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:29.830> causing<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.490> rattle<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
being too big and causing a rattle so

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.340 
being too big and causing a rattle so
that's<00:01:32.200> kind<00:01:32.440> of<00:01:32.470> nice<00:01:33.299> here's<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.450> body<00:01:35.200> of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
that's kind of nice here's the body of

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.740 
that's kind of nice here's the body of
the<00:01:35.409> light<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:36.490> tail<00:01:37.090> cap<00:01:37.330> is<00:01:37.479> kind<00:01:37.690> of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
the light and the tail cap is kind of

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.149 
the light and the tail cap is kind of
all<00:01:37.900> one<00:01:38.110> assembly<00:01:38.380> being<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.010> light<00:01:39.130> is

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
all one assembly being that the light is

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.120 
all one assembly being that the light is
so<00:01:39.430> small<00:01:39.729> so<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.630> can<00:01:40.840> simply<00:01:41.350> take<00:01:41.560> apart

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
so small so you can simply take apart

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.679 
so small so you can simply take apart
the<00:01:43.090> clip<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:45.430> this<00:01:45.460> by<00:01:46.000> unscrewing<00:01:46.510> this

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
the clip like this by unscrewing this

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.440 
the clip like this by unscrewing this
little<00:01:47.189> tail<00:01:48.189> cap<00:01:48.430> piece<00:01:48.670> here<00:01:49.000> with<00:01:49.360> the

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
little tail cap piece here with the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.320 
little tail cap piece here with the
spring<00:01:49.750> on<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:51.549> clip<00:01:51.760> simply<00:01:51.970> falls

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
spring on it and the clip simply falls

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.500 
spring on it and the clip simply falls
out<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:55.450> reattach<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.140> you<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:58.390> the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
out and to reattach it you do the

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.260 
out and to reattach it you do the
reverse<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.110> tighten<00:01:59.560> it<00:01:59.619> back<00:01:59.680> up<00:01:59.799> so<00:02:00.369> pretty

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
reverse and tighten it back up so pretty

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.940 
reverse and tighten it back up so pretty
good<00:02:01.330> threads<00:02:01.750> overall<00:02:02.470> for<00:02:02.740> all<00:02:02.830> the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
good threads overall for all the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.730 
good threads overall for all the
assemblies<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:04.290> pretty<00:02:05.290> good<00:02:05.439> Oh<00:02:05.560> ring

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740

assemblies and pretty good Oh ring
engagement<00:02:06.009> as<00:02:06.549> well<00:02:06.850> I've<00:02:08.519> held<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.640> wall

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
engagement as well I've held the wall

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.580 
engagement as well I've held the wall
held<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.450> light<00:02:10.659> under<00:02:10.989> running<00:02:11.139> water<00:02:11.290> and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
held the light under running water and

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.920 
held the light under running water and
it<00:02:12.040> sheds<00:02:12.279> water<00:02:12.489> just<00:02:12.849> fine<00:02:13.090> although<00:02:13.749> we

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
it sheds water just fine although we

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.610 
it sheds water just fine although we
have<00:02:14.079> not<00:02:14.200> submersed<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.829> water<00:02:15.040> in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
have not submersed the water in

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.460 
have not submersed the water in
deeper<00:02:16.549> water<00:02:16.849> than<00:02:16.940> than<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.629> so<00:02:18.019> I'm<00:02:18.290> not

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
deeper water than than that so I'm not

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.229 
deeper water than than that so I'm not
really<00:02:18.769> sure<00:02:18.890> if<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:19.280> submersible<00:02:19.909> or<00:02:20.060> not

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
really sure if it's submersible or not

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.420 
really sure if it's submersible or not
so<00:02:21.049> keep<00:02:21.379> that<00:02:21.409> in<00:02:21.560> mind<00:02:21.799> when<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.190> use<00:02:22.400> it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
so keep that in mind when you use it

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.750 
so keep that in mind when you use it
near<00:02:22.849> water<00:02:24.129> pretty<00:02:25.129> straightforward<00:02:25.340> that's

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
near water pretty straightforward that's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.899 
near water pretty straightforward that's
really<00:02:25.940> about<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.269> it<00:02:26.690> goes<00:02:27.620> on<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.220> mean<00:02:28.700> this

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
really about it it goes on I mean this

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.339 
really about it it goes on I mean this
is<00:02:28.970> probably<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.510> most<00:02:29.690> simple<00:02:30.019> light<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.319> I

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
is probably the most simple light that I

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.050 
is probably the most simple light that I
have<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> can't<00:02:30.980> really<00:02:31.190> say<00:02:31.370> much<00:02:31.400> more<00:02:31.610> about

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
have I can't really say much more about

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.899 
have I can't really say much more about
it<00:02:32.690> than<00:02:32.720> what<00:02:33.019> I've<00:02:33.290> already<00:02:33.440> said<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.069> it

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
it than what I've already said so it

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.770 
it than what I've already said so it
tale<00:02:35.180> stands<00:02:36.099> really<00:02:37.099> nicely<00:02:37.390> as<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.599> see

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
tale stands really nicely as you see

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.100 
tale stands really nicely as you see
there<00:02:39.849> obviously<00:02:40.849> it<00:02:41.450> roll<00:02:41.599> but<00:02:41.810> there's<00:02:42.019> no

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
there obviously it roll but there's no

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.069 
there obviously it roll but there's no
anti-roll<00:02:42.590> bezel<00:02:42.920> being<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.370> it's<00:02:43.489> an<00:02:43.579> EDC

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
anti-roll bezel being that it's an EDC

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.350 
anti-roll bezel being that it's an EDC
pocketable<00:02:45.079> light<00:02:45.409> so<00:02:46.400> you're<00:02:47.090> going<00:02:47.209> to<00:02:47.269> want

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
pocketable light so you're going to want

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.550 
pocketable light so you're going to want
to<00:02:47.540> eat<00:02:47.690> you're<00:02:47.870> going<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.049> want<00:02:48.140> in<00:02:48.379> fact

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
to eat you're going to want in fact

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.930 
to eat you're going to want in fact
that's<00:02:48.739> probably<00:02:48.859> the<00:02:49.190> main<00:02:49.220> function<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.790> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
that's probably the main function of the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.880 
that's probably the main function of the
shirt<00:02:50.120> clip<00:02:50.359> is<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.660> prevent<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.410> body<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.829> the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
shirt clip is to prevent the body of the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.860 
shirt clip is to prevent the body of the
light<00:02:52.069> from<00:02:52.280> rolling<00:02:52.849> all<00:02:52.970> over<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.299> place<00:02:53.510> so

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
light from rolling all over the place so

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.699 
light from rolling all over the place so
a<00:02:54.760> little<00:02:55.760> bit<00:02:55.879> about<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.349> operation<00:02:57.349> of<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
a little bit about the operation of the

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.140 
a little bit about the operation of the
light<00:02:58.150> it's<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.269> single-mode<00:02:59.799> twist<00:03:00.799> on<00:03:01.250> twist

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
light it's a single-mode twist on twist

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.770 
light it's a single-mode twist on twist
off<00:03:02.620> very<00:03:03.620> simple<00:03:04.010> very<00:03:04.040> straightforward

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
off very simple very straightforward

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.420 
off very simple very straightforward
it's<00:03:05.780> opposite<00:03:06.170> from<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.440> mini<00:03:06.650> maglite<00:03:06.890> in

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
it's opposite from a mini maglite in

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.309 
it's opposite from a mini maglite in
that<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.909> tighten<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.629> thread<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.140> you

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
that you tighten the thread and you

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.830 
that you tighten the thread and you
completely<00:03:09.920> tighten<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.489> in<00:03:11.299> order<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.690> turn

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
completely tighten it in order to turn

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.690 
completely tighten it in order to turn
it<00:03:11.989> on<00:03:12.109> so<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.769> doesn't<00:03:13.040> really<00:03:13.159> feel<00:03:13.250> like

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
it on so it doesn't really feel like

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.849 
it on so it doesn't really feel like
you're<00:03:14.120> taking<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.629> light<00:03:14.810> apart<00:03:15.590> or

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
you're taking the light apart or

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.190 
you're taking the light apart or
disassembling<00:03:16.609> it<00:03:16.760> when<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.750> turn<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.049> light

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
disassembling it when you turn the light

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.039 
disassembling it when you turn the light
on<00:03:18.230> anyone<00:03:18.799> it's<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.069> operation<00:03:19.870> obviously<00:03:20.870> to

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
on anyone it's in operation obviously to

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.530 
on anyone it's in operation obviously to
to<00:03:21.919> unscrew<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.459> unscrew<00:03:22.819> it<00:03:22.849> to<00:03:23.150> turn<00:03:23.329> it<00:03:23.419> off

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
to unscrew you unscrew it to turn it off

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.650 
to unscrew you unscrew it to turn it off
and<00:03:23.569> so<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.139> feels<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.829> little<00:03:25.099> bit<00:03:25.340> loose<00:03:25.660> you

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
and so it feels a little bit loose you

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.830 
and so it feels a little bit loose you
know<00:03:26.690> under<00:03:27.319> that<00:03:27.530> type<00:03:27.799> of<00:03:27.829> scenario<00:03:28.389> as<00:03:29.389> well

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
know under that type of scenario as well

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.349 
know under that type of scenario as well
but<00:03:30.200> let's<00:03:30.769> see<00:03:30.950> one<00:03:31.579> of<00:03:31.669> the<00:03:31.760> neat<00:03:32.000> hidden

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
but let's see one of the neat hidden

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.210 
but let's see one of the neat hidden
features<00:03:32.690> about<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:33.049> light<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.620> find<00:03:33.980> is

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
features about this light that I find is

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.699 
features about this light that I find is
it<00:03:34.459> has<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.609> momentary<00:03:35.480> operation<00:03:36.169> type<00:03:36.560> of

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
it has a momentary operation type of

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.150 
it has a momentary operation type of
mode<00:03:36.950> for<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:39.200> can<00:03:39.349> obviously<00:03:39.590> turn<00:03:39.829> on

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
mode for it so you can obviously turn on

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.550 
mode for it so you can obviously turn on
but<00:03:40.910> if<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.060> turn<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.690> off<00:03:41.930> just<00:03:42.200> a<00:03:42.290> little<00:03:42.319> bit

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
but if you turn it off just a little bit

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.920 
but if you turn it off just a little bit
like<00:03:42.859> that<00:03:43.040> okay<00:03:43.879> now<00:03:44.030> you've<00:03:44.209> pretty<00:03:44.840> much

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
like that okay now you've pretty much

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.309 
like that okay now you've pretty much
entered<00:03:45.489> like<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.519> momentary<00:03:47.319> forward

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
entered like a momentary forward

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.750 
entered like a momentary forward
operation<00:03:49.359> there<00:03:50.359> as<00:03:50.569> you<00:03:50.840> can<00:03:50.959> see<00:03:51.760> it's

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
operation there as you can see it's

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.400 
operation there as you can see it's
comfortable<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:53.419> small<00:03:53.690> enough<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:54.169> hold

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
comfortable it's small enough to hold

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.809 
comfortable it's small enough to hold
you<00:03:54.739> know<00:03:54.829> very<00:03:55.099> comfortably<00:03:55.459> in<00:03:55.549> a<00:03:55.579> cigar

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
you know very comfortably in a cigar

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.900 
you know very comfortably in a cigar
hold<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.750> like<00:03:57.079> you<00:03:57.230> use<00:03:57.500> using<00:03:57.919> it<00:03:58.010> like<00:03:58.160> a

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
hold I like you use using it like a

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.970 
hold I like you use using it like a
cigar<00:03:59.810> holder<00:03:59.989> knuckle<00:04:00.440> hold<00:04:00.620> or<00:04:00.769> whatever

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
cigar holder knuckle hold or whatever

you<00:05:29.800> go<00:05:29.860> and<00:05:30.099> you<00:05:30.219> can<00:05:30.339> get<00:05:30.429> a<00:05:30.490> feel<00:05:30.729> for<00:05:30.969> the

out<00:05:33.399> to<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:33.639> sides<00:05:33.939> so<00:05:34.449> it's<00:05:34.569> a<00:05:34.599> very<00:05:34.659> floody

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080
