anyways<00:00:25.199> these<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.340> been<00:00:26.519> worn<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:26.970> just

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
anyways these have been worn so just

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.000 
anyways these have been worn so just
ignore<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> scuffs<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.230> dirt<00:00:28.439> marks<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
ignore the scuffs or dirt marks on the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.519 
ignore the scuffs or dirt marks on the
outsole<00:00:29.570> but<00:00:30.570> as<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:30.869> see<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.320> an

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
outsole but as you can see it's just an

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.459 
outsole but as you can see it's just an
all<00:00:31.619> white<00:00:31.830> outsole<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.489> six<00:00:33.210> black<00:00:33.660> pads<00:00:34.110> on

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
all white outsole with six black pads on

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.520 
all white outsole with six black pads on
each<00:00:34.620> shoe<00:00:37.160> midsole<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.460> Wolfe<00:00:38.969> gray<00:00:39.530> or

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530

each shoe midsole is Wolfe gray or
midsole<00:00:40.980> top-line<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> guess<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.360> midsole<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
midsole top-line I guess the midsole and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.190 
midsole top-line I guess the midsole and
outsole<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.530> same<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> nike<00:00:45.390> 3.0

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
outsole are the same this is a nike 3.0

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.240 
outsole are the same this is a nike 3.0
outsole<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:48.680> it's<00:00:49.680> comfortable

outsole and it's comfortable

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.790 
outsole and it's comfortable
