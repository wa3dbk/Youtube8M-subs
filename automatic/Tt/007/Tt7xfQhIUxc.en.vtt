 agency society looking for a property goes

 demand what you want where you want it 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.140
 because he wants it that way and they cross 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.430
 data with the system with all the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.079
 housing all the offers that 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.670
 introduced not only since I nodded 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.379
 furniture but of other companions 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.090
 other audiences that are associated 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.250
 how do you add sell homes in 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.079
 full crisis with the unemployment that follows 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.199
 increasing and with hardly financing 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.670
 look at one of the few positive things 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.500
 that has brought the crisis to our 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.750
 sector is that it has also cleaned up a 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.100
 little demand today for the family 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.289
 that goes to a real estate agency 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.000
 look for a property more or less know that 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.380
 can afford it there is less demand 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.939
 but what there is 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.649
 better of much more quality than the one 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.500
 there were four years ago and there are always 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.909
 people like there are always people who 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.950
 you need mind of problems there is always 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.960
 people who need to buy and for the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.130
 same circumstances and there will be some 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.640
 families that will also come with 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.960
 losses those who bought their home 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.960
 after 2003-2004 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.760
 and if to top it off we did it financing 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.160
 one hundred percent as the majority was 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.440
 They can not sell but you have to put 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.270
 money on the table because what happens 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.150
 that the value of your home today is 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.470
 lower than what the mortgage owes 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.060
 promontories have done and many have 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.810
 assumed losses and have put money and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.330
 have you sold below cost is a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.580
 family 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.080
 the normal thing is that they can not do what 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.270
 type of customer buying living today in 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.830
 day the market is entering many people 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.110
 that in the last years of the book 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.670
 they were left out because they could not because 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.680
 the prices went up so much that they did not 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.210
 they could access the house and now 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.040
 are coming in I think because you imagine 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.450
 another how is to buy us going to 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.950
 have what you have to have the 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.690
 Buying intelligence does not buy 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.840
 anything what kind of real estate 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.330
 comes out today 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.000
 by looks that are even those that 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.519
 adapt they change the chip they understand that what 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.700
 what was done before does not work anymore and 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.530
 that you have to recycle is a process 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.440
 that I accept age has cost because 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.440
 he also clarified I assumed 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.880
 that you can not is hard indeed 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.590
 curiously in clients that we have 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.780
 had us who have entered the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.390
 profession in full crisis have prospered 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.950
 much more quickly than veterans 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.130
 Spain will emerge from the crisis with the sector 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.130
 real estate 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.140
 the watertight compartments do not exist or 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.920
 there are two fundamental sectors for 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.450
 the economy 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.280
 the real estate sector and other centers 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.500
 financial until this is not fixed 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.990
 not only fix for live 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.990
 is that everything is intimately related 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.500
