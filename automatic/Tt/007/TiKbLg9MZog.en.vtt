budget films from Sony and Microsoft and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.420 
budget films from Sony and Microsoft and
let's<00:00:14.580> see<00:00:14.820> which<00:00:15.540> one<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.199> faster<00:00:17.990> so<00:00:18.990> if<00:00:19.650> we

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
let's see which one is faster so if we

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.910 
let's see which one is faster so if we
stirred<00:00:20.789> up<00:00:21.090> by<00:00:21.270> simple<00:00:21.750> speed<00:00:21.990> test<00:00:22.320> well

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
stirred up by simple speed test well

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.490 
stirred up by simple speed test well
it's<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:24.289> little<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.439> everything

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
it's just a little of everything

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.620 
it's just a little of everything
Microsoft<00:00:28.500> should<00:00:28.769> actually<00:00:29.670> add<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:29.910> close

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
Microsoft should actually add that close

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.190 
Microsoft should actually add that close
old<00:00:30.929> button<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.800> wouldn't<00:00:32.809> it<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:33.989> be<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
old button it wouldn't it would be a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.389 
old button it wouldn't it would be a
nice<00:00:34.410> thing<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.950> have

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
nice thing to have

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.260 
nice thing to have
so<00:00:35.730> let's<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.120> speedtest.net<00:00:36.690> speed<00:00:37.590> test

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
so let's go to speedtest.net speed test

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.750 
so let's go to speedtest.net speed test
Internet<00:00:40.579> where<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:43.010> here<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.219> go

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
Internet where is it here we go

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.549 
Internet where is it here we go
let's<00:00:45.629> make<00:00:45.809> sure<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.440> same<00:00:46.829> server

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
let's make sure is the same server

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.779 
let's make sure is the same server
Ostrow<00:00:49.760> what<00:00:50.760> about<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.949> not<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.160> in

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
Ostrow what about this one not to be in

and<00:00:55.469> let's<00:00:56.129> go<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.449> test<00:00:57.750> Vitas

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
and let's go and do this be test Vitas

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.230 
and let's go and do this be test Vitas
begin<00:00:59.399> test<00:01:00.379> whoo<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.890> interesting<00:01:02.460> like

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
begin test whoo this is interesting like

I<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.450> no<00:01:06.869> idea<00:01:07.110> who<00:01:07.619> will<00:01:07.830> wind<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:09.840> could

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
I have no idea who will wind it could

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.260 
I have no idea who will wind it could
really<00:01:10.439> be<00:01:10.650> both<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.070> them<00:01:13.040> but<00:01:14.040> well<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.970> is

really be both of them but well this is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.140 
really be both of them but well this is
definitely<00:01:15.900> some<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> baddest<00:01:17.610> worst

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
definitely some of the baddest worst

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.140 
definitely some of the baddest worst
okay<00:01:19.909> it<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.060> actually<00:01:21.210> pretty<00:01:21.540> good

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
well I have like a third you megabyte

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.330 
well I have like a third you megabyte
connection<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.430> should<00:01:30.770> be<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> little<00:01:32.130> more

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
connection that should be a little more

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.149 
connection that should be a little more
than<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.659> okay<00:01:33.840> 25<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.710> not<00:01:34.890> that

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
bad well let's see I swiped these over

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:52.340 
bad well let's see I swiped these over
moon<00:01:42.439> 25<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.649> about<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> upload<00:01:48.320> 725<00:01:51.350> 709

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
moon 25 what about the upload 725 709

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.370 
moon 25 what about the upload 725 709
iPad<00:01:52.799> okay<00:01:53.189> pings<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:53.970> sucks<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:55.170> look

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
iPad okay pings it here sucks but look

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
iPad okay pings it here sucks but look
at<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> mm<00:01:56.100> speed<00:01:56.369> definitely<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> little

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
at the mm speed definitely a little

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.929 
at the mm speed definitely a little
bitter<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.960> little<00:01:58.020> bit<00:01:58.619> better<00:01:59.040> than<00:01:59.549> that

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:10.040 

you're<00:02:02.939> up<00:02:03.210> at<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:05.030> 24<00:02:06.030> what<00:02:08.030> okay<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
you're up at the 24 what okay so the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.580 
you're up at the 24 what okay so the
average<00:02:10.340> download<00:02:11.340> speed<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.120> guy

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
average download speed on this guy

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:21.860 
average download speed on this guy
is<00:02:13.680> not<00:02:14.099> as<00:02:14.629> good<00:02:15.629> at<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:15.989> one<00:02:19.370> mmm<00:02:20.870> pretty

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
is not as good at this one mmm pretty

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.940 
is not as good at this one mmm pretty
weird<00:02:22.280> results<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.580> looks<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.599> SUNY<00:02:25.230> has

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
weird results it looks like the SUNY has

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.900 
weird results it looks like the SUNY has
a<00:02:25.980> little<00:02:26.310> bit<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.430> advantage<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.360> speed

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
a little bit of advantage on speed

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.089 
a little bit of advantage on speed
so<00:02:29.910> let's<00:02:30.180> shut<00:02:30.510> them<00:02:30.690> down<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.230> see<00:02:31.680> which

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
so let's shut them down and see which

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.350 
so let's shut them down and see which
one<00:02:32.459> will<00:02:32.760> be<00:02:33.000> faster<00:02:33.720> power<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:38.060> okay<00:02:39.060> that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
one will be faster power of okay that

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.990 
one will be faster power of okay that
was<00:02:39.690> slow<00:02:39.989> look<00:02:40.379> at<00:02:40.500> how<00:02:40.650> fast<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.489> one<00:02:41.700> shut

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
was slow look at how fast this one shut

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.740 
was slow look at how fast this one shut
down<00:02:42.140> now<00:02:43.140> let's<00:02:43.470> do<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:44.459> boot<00:02:44.730> up<00:02:44.940> test<00:02:45.180> three

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
down now let's do the boot up test three

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.420 
down now let's do the boot up test three
two<00:02:45.959> one

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.030 

okay<00:02:50.430> Microsoft<00:02:50.970> soon<00:02:51.209> here<00:02:51.690> we<00:02:51.870> go<00:02:54.560> who<00:02:55.560> will

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
okay Microsoft soon here we go who will

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
okay Microsoft soon here we go who will
win<00:02:56.900> like<00:02:57.900> these<00:02:58.319> two<00:02:58.590> guys<00:02:58.829> costs<00:02:59.670> around

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
win like these two guys costs around

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.850 
win like these two guys costs around
pretty<00:03:00.480> much<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.870> same<00:03:01.220> maybe<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:03.000> like

pretty much the same maybe this is like

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.479 
pretty much the same maybe this is like
ten<00:03:04.860> bucks<00:03:05.099> cheaper<00:03:06.260> but<00:03:07.260> no<00:03:07.530> huge<00:03:07.829> difference
