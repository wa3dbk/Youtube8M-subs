it<00:03:58.570> from<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.810> oil<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.410> way<00:03:59.530> we're<00:03:59.650> going<00:03:59.739> to

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
it from the oil the way we're going to

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.770 
it from the oil the way we're going to
dis<00:03:59.950> check<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.580> you<00:04:01.239> know<00:04:01.360> there's<00:04:01.660> many

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
dis check it is you know there's many

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.509 
dis check it is you know there's many
ways<00:04:02.050> but<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:02.380> just<00:04:02.470> give<00:04:02.620> that's<00:04:02.800> so<00:04:03.310> knit

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
ways but you just give that's so knit

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.910 
ways but you just give that's so knit
that<00:04:03.790> bone<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.120> little<00:04:04.300> twist<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.769> just

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
that bone a little twist and it just

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.580 
that bone a little twist and it just
falls<00:04:06.160> out<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:07.720> is<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:08.200> is<00:04:08.380> how<00:04:08.470> we're
