00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.719
 well and when it comes to racism and which groups are made and not made afterwards 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.979
 can be then you soon end up with the men of free speech 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.019
 as a theologian 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.289
 that hans 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:11.170
 how does that work 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.539
 well done 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.199
 there are welcome inside 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.380
 how did you experience it all? 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.359
 on television the street robber could be seen in the talk show set 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.550
 the year after 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.289
 well I also noticed that it is racism 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.269
 antal of the town hall is getting worse 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.030
 And then a look in New York people already say yes that's all to blame 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.789
 the Jews too often that is so but in this case I do not know if that is what is 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.530
 there's actually all the fault of the know that but do 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.429
 diddy with the verdict the public 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.159
 who did that because of this kind of a sign is the place where the team with 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.999
 The blanket and I have always been a few times per day in a leaky case 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:51.020
 band had 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.760
 well by the government what a disgusting remarks with which 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.030
 billions of Chinese people have actually put the line below the bar and then 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.120
 they must defend them 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.710
 how to defend against shorten I really like the things that things 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.820
 she hard who does not care 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.850
 so what i got is trying to do at least 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.170
 is because that is the Chinese in any case 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.350
 make it more resilient 6 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.350
 china is 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.149
 I have been working with this young for a few weeks now 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.739
 and what I am trying to teach is that I myself have mentioned cordonni record 

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:27.570
 donating that is at the moment 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.850
 that someone is being treated to you or that you don't like it 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.360
 that person serves directly in the reply 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.520
 with a joke to give an example she knew he says to me I have 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.380
 yesterday 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.599
 they did not get a chance that I have you they are good that they had given 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.710
 that was yesterday during this final that is in this time she would have pants 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.290
 wore some in sudan he says 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.660
 that's better 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.200
 yet the program is 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.550
 who have to wait on the side of the field 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.920
 I described how can 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.900

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.390
 h 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.480
 that was too low 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.320
 they must be directly on top of that 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.399
 they say they don't have the time to realize that the joke isn't that strong 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.839
 had a meat day 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.079
