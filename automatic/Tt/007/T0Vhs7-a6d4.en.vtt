hook up a pull station to a fire alarm
so<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.550> I'm<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.970> be<00:00:36.180> doing<00:00:36.440> so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so that is what I'm going to be doing so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.400 
so that is what I'm going to be doing so
the<00:00:38.100> first<00:00:38.399> thing<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.090> will<00:00:39.239> need<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.899> power

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the first thing you will need is a power

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.270 
the first thing you will need is a power
source<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.160> some<00:00:41.670> sort<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.100> have

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
source of some sort so if you don't have

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.520 
source of some sort so if you don't have
anything<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.720> simple<00:00:46.140> thing

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
anything what you can the simple thing

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.220 
anything what you can the simple thing
to<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.220> just<00:00:47.400> take<00:00:47.610> two<00:00:47.879> 9-volt

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
to do is you can just take two 9-volt

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.360 
to do is you can just take two 9-volt
batteries<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.980> connect<00:00:50.280> them

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
batteries and then just connect them

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.479 
batteries and then just connect them
together<00:00:50.519> like<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.150> BAM<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.290> got<00:00:52.409> 18<00:00:52.980> volts

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
together like that BAM you got 18 volts

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.689 
together like that BAM you got 18 volts
of<00:00:53.670> power<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:54.440> fire<00:00:55.440> alarms<00:00:55.890> most<00:00:56.220> fire<00:00:56.430> lines

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
of power in fire alarms most fire lines

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
of power in fire alarms most fire lines
run<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.239> DC<00:00:58.230> voltage<00:00:58.710> um<00:00:59.010> instead<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.210> AC<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.079> on

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
run on DC voltage um instead of AC so on

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.450 
run on DC voltage um instead of AC so on
in<00:01:02.399> 9-volt<00:01:02.910> batteries<00:01:03.329> run<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.050> DC<00:01:04.440> voltage<00:01:05.129> so

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
in 9-volt batteries run on DC voltage so

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.460 
in 9-volt batteries run on DC voltage so
you<00:01:05.550> can<00:01:05.910> use<00:01:06.149> 9-volt<00:01:06.720> batteries<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.289> your

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you can use 9-volt batteries as your

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.100 
you can use 9-volt batteries as your
power<00:01:07.649> source<00:01:08.660> or<00:01:09.660> um<00:01:10.580> most<00:01:11.580> phones<00:01:12.050> this<00:01:13.050> is

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
power source or um most phones this is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.260 
power source or um most phones this is
an<00:01:13.320> old<00:01:13.500> one<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.920> doesn't<00:01:14.100> work<00:01:14.310> anymore<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
an old one it doesn't work anymore the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.950 
an old one it doesn't work anymore the
chargers<00:01:15.899> that<00:01:15.929> go<00:01:16.289> into<00:01:16.679> them<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.960> nine

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
chargers that go into them are nine

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.359 
chargers that go into them are nine
volts<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.830> nine<00:01:20.640> volts<00:01:21.119> DC<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:23.070> will<00:01:23.220> work

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
volts and nine volts DC that will work

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.260 
volts and nine volts DC that will work
for<00:01:23.610> your<00:01:23.789> thing<00:01:24.149> this<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.690> 12<00:01:24.990> volt<00:01:25.289> DC

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
for your thing this one is a 12 volt DC

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
for your thing this one is a 12 volt DC
plug<00:01:27.270> power<00:01:27.630> adapter<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.460> way<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:29.640> can

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
plug power adapter but the way it can

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.950 
plug power adapter but the way it can
tell<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.360> every<00:01:30.630> plug<00:01:30.979> it'll<00:01:31.979> tell<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.960> its

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
tell is on every plug it'll tell you its

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.410 
tell is on every plug it'll tell you its
voltage<00:01:34.890> what<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> comes<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.210> what<00:01:36.329> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
voltage what it comes in and what it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.560 
voltage what it comes in and what it
comes<00:01:36.540> out<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:37.590> right<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> says<00:01:38.570> 12

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
comes out see right here it says 12

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.889 
comes out see right here it says 12
volts<00:01:39.869> DC<00:01:40.049> output<00:01:40.970> so<00:01:41.970> you'll<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
volts DC output so you'll know that this

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.840 
volts DC output so you'll know that this
puts<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.320> 12<00:01:43.619> volts<00:01:43.890> DC<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> that'll<00:01:44.759> work

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
puts out 12 volts DC and that'll work

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.510 
puts out 12 volts DC and that'll work
alright<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:46.320> after<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.920> figure<00:01:47.220> out<00:01:47.250> what

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
alright so after you figure out what

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.819 
alright so after you figure out what
you're<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> get<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:48.990> your<00:01:49.229> power

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
9-volt batteries but it's kind of

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.190 
9-volt batteries but it's kind of
basically<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> same<00:02:23.570> just<00:02:24.570> one<00:02:24.750> more<00:02:24.930> thing

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
basically the same just one more thing

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.440 
basically the same just one more thing
before<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.680> show<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.280> how<00:02:26.549> to<00:02:26.609> wire<00:02:26.850> these<00:02:27.150> up

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
before I show you how to wire these up

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.289 
before I show you how to wire these up
never<00:02:28.320> when<00:02:28.769> you're<00:02:28.950> wiring<00:02:29.220> anything<00:02:30.000> have

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
never when you're wiring anything have

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.660 
never when you're wiring anything have
anything<00:02:31.170> plugged<00:02:31.620> into<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:32.160> wall<00:02:32.190> or

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
anything plugged into the wall or

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.309 
anything plugged into the wall or
connected<00:02:33.299> that's<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> number<00:02:34.170> one

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
connected that's like the number one

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.210 
connected that's like the number one
rule<00:02:34.620> okay<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:36.349> let's<00:02:37.349> get<00:02:37.500> started<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:37.920> you're

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
rule okay so let's get started so you're

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.260 
rule okay so let's get started so you're
just<00:02:38.370> going<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.519> flip<00:02:38.790> your<00:02:38.819> far

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
just going to flip your far

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.450 
just going to flip your far
in<00:02:39.570> your<00:02:39.690> pool<00:02:39.930> station<00:02:40.350> over<00:02:40.620> all<00:02:40.740> right<00:02:40.890> put

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
in your pool station over all right put

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.990 
in your pool station over all right put
those<00:02:41.580> aside<00:02:42.320> so<00:02:43.340> here<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.640> my<00:02:45.420> plug<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:47.000> it

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
those aside so here is my plug so it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.450 
those aside so here is my plug so it
plugs<00:02:48.300> into<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.750> wall<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.890> wire<00:02:50.100> comes

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
plugs into the wall and the wire comes

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.600 
plugs into the wall and the wire comes
through<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.770> here's<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:53.010> ends<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.400> wires

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
through so here's the ends of the wires

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.440 
through so here's the ends of the wires
now<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:55.620> electricity<00:02:56.310> needs<00:02:56.580> someplace<00:02:56.940> to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
now the electricity needs someplace to

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.130 
now the electricity needs someplace to
go<00:02:57.630> so<00:02:58.610> what<00:02:59.610> you'll<00:02:59.760> do<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.690> first<00:03:00.930> get

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
go so what you'll do is to first get

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.990 
go so what you'll do is to first get
your<00:03:01.290> electricity<00:03:01.830> going<00:03:02.070> into<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.520> circuit

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
your electricity going into a circuit

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.240 
your electricity going into a circuit
you'll<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:03.810> put<00:03:04.200> um<00:03:06.560> you'll<00:03:07.560> put<00:03:07.830> one<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
you'll just put um you'll put one of the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.490 
you'll just put um you'll put one of the
wires<00:03:08.460> into<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.940> back<00:03:09.240> of<00:03:09.540> your<00:03:09.840> poll<00:03:10.080> station

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
wires into the back of your poll station

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.070 
wires into the back of your poll station
and<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.190> doesn't<00:03:11.520> matter<00:03:11.700> which<00:03:11.970> one<00:03:12.210> for

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
and it doesn't matter which one for

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.280 
and it doesn't matter which one for
right<00:03:13.260> now<00:03:13.440> okay<00:03:14.460> and<00:03:14.700> then<00:03:15.510> what<00:03:15.960> she'll<00:03:16.170> do

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
right now okay and then what she'll do

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.750 
right now okay and then what she'll do
at<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.500> terminal<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.100> you'll<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:17.280> screw<00:03:17.550> it

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
at the terminal is you'll just screw it

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.350 
at the terminal is you'll just screw it
shut

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.850 

see<00:03:24.360> now<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.630> wire<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.110> in<00:03:25.350> there<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.770> it

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
see now the wire is in there and it

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.300 
see now the wire is in there and it
can't<00:03:26.070> get<00:03:26.220> out<00:03:26.510> all<00:03:27.510> right<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.380> we<00:03:29.190> already

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
can't get out all right so we already

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.490 
can't get out all right so we already
have<00:03:29.550> our<00:03:29.700> first<00:03:29.880> wire<00:03:30.180> done<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:31.290> now<00:03:31.440> that

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
have our first wire done so now that

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.800 
have our first wire done so now that
it's<00:03:31.890> into<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> pole<00:03:32.580> station<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.390> needs<00:03:33.600> a

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
it's into the pole station it needs a

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.380 
it's into the pole station it needs a
way<00:03:33.960> to<00:03:34.020> get<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.680> alarm<00:03:35.010> all<00:03:35.850> right<00:03:36.000> so

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
way to get to the alarm all right so

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.420 
way to get to the alarm all right so
what<00:03:36.900> she'll<00:03:37.110> be<00:03:37.140> doing<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.620> you'll<00:03:37.770> be<00:03:37.800> taking

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
what she'll be doing is you'll be taking

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.910 
what she'll be doing is you'll be taking
your<00:03:38.460> other<00:03:38.700> spare<00:03:39.390> wire<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.990> then<00:03:40.680> just

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
your other spare wire and then just

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.620 
your other spare wire and then just
connecting<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.850> other<00:03:42.000> side<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
connecting that to the other side of the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.650 
connecting that to the other side of the
turn<00:03:42.840> terminal<00:03:43.470> again<00:03:44.340> just<00:03:45.209> do<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.450> same

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
turn terminal again just do the same

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:57.500 
turn terminal again just do the same
thing<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.050> I<00:03:46.140> just<00:03:46.170> did<00:03:46.380> all<00:03:56.120> right<00:03:57.120> see<00:03:57.330> now

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
thing that I just did all right see now

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.900 
thing that I just did all right see now
it's<00:03:57.690> connected<00:03:58.430> alright<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:01.110> now<00:04:02.100> that<00:04:02.130> wire

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
it's connected alright so now that wire

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.150 
it's connected alright so now that wire
somehow<00:04:03.540> needs<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:04.110> get<00:04:04.290> um<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:05.520> defy<00:04:06.150> alarms

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
somehow needs to get um to defy alarms

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.830 
somehow needs to get um to defy alarms
okay<00:04:08.160> so<00:04:08.220> now<00:04:08.550> you<00:04:08.610> see<00:04:09.000> right<00:04:09.240> here<00:04:09.300> where<00:04:09.750> it

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
okay so now you see right here where it

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.250 
okay so now you see right here where it
says<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.500> has<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.740> plus<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.370> minus<00:04:11.400> sign<00:04:12.260> so

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
says it has a plus and a minus sign so

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.720 
says it has a plus and a minus sign so
all<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.590> have<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:13.920> do<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:14.340> got<00:04:14.700> a

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
all you have to do is you just got a

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.060 
all you have to do is you just got a
wire<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.510> negative<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.350> negative<00:04:16.470> sign

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
wire the negative to the negative sign

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.240 
wire the negative to the negative sign
and<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.340> positive<00:04:17.850> wire<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.480> the<00:04:18.980> plus<00:04:19.980> sign

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
and the positive wire to the plus sign

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.790 
and the positive wire to the plus sign
so<00:04:20.630> basically<00:04:21.630> how<00:04:21.870> you<00:04:21.930> can<00:04:22.140> tell<00:04:22.380> if<00:04:22.560> these

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
so basically how you can tell if these

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.140 
so basically how you can tell if these
wires<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:24.390> wire<00:04:24.630> from<00:04:25.080> your<00:04:26.150> transformer

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
wires is the wire from your transformer

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.290 
wires is the wire from your transformer
here<00:04:27.450> this<00:04:28.050> wire<00:04:28.290> has<00:04:28.500> little<00:04:28.830> white<00:04:29.790> straight

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
here this wire has little white straight

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.960 
here this wire has little white straight
lines<00:04:30.630> on<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:30.960> you're<00:04:31.650> just<00:04:31.860> going<00:04:32.040> to<00:04:32.130> the

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
lines on it you're just going to the

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.090 
lines on it you're just going to the
wire<00:04:33.270> of<00:04:33.510> white<00:04:33.810> straight<00:04:34.200> lines<00:04:34.500> on<00:04:34.800> it<00:04:34.830> is

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
wire of white straight lines on it is

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.860 
wire of white straight lines on it is
positive<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.150> you're<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:36.419> going<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.630> wire

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
positive so you're just going to wire

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.050 
positive so you're just going to wire
that<00:04:37.680> wire<00:04:38.010> right<00:04:38.370> into<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:38.850> positive

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
that wire right into the positive

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.920 
that wire right into the positive
circuit<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:41.240> then<00:04:42.240> of<00:04:42.390> course<00:04:42.419> the<00:04:42.870> other

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
circuit and then of course the other

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.550 
circuit and then of course the other
wire<00:04:43.340> would<00:04:44.340> have<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.760> be<00:04:44.880> negative<00:04:45.410> so<00:04:46.410> we're

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
wire would have to be negative so we're

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.550 
wire would have to be negative so we're
just<00:04:46.590> going<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.919> wire<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.790> other<00:04:47.910> wire<00:04:48.560> right

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
just going to wire the other wire right

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.450 
just going to wire the other wire right
into<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:51.510> negative<00:04:51.930> spot

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
into the negative spot

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.330 
into the negative spot
all<00:04:53.460> right<00:04:53.960> so<00:04:54.960> now<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.140> basically<00:04:55.770> have<00:04:56.100> a

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
all right so now you basically have a

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.510 
all right so now you basically have a
little<00:04:57.210> simple<00:04:58.170> circuit<00:04:58.560> here<00:04:58.800> alright<00:04:59.100> see

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
little simple circuit here alright see

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.230 
little simple circuit here alright see
the<00:05:00.030> power<00:05:00.660> comes<00:05:01.080> in<00:05:01.320> it<00:05:01.740> wants<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.730> get<00:05:02.910> to

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
the power comes in it wants to get to

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.740 
the power comes in it wants to get to
the<00:05:04.020> fire<00:05:04.260> alarm<00:05:04.620> but<00:05:05.040> it<00:05:05.160> can't<00:05:05.430> if<00:05:06.090> it<00:05:06.570> could

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
the fire alarm but it can't if it could

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.160 
the fire alarm but it can't if it could
only<00:05:06.870> connect<00:05:07.350> and<00:05:07.640> so<00:05:08.720> when<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:09.810> pull<00:05:10.050> the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
only connect and so when you pull the

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.510 
only connect and so when you pull the
fire<00:05:10.320> alarm<00:05:10.470> it's<00:05:10.800> like<00:05:10.950> turning<00:05:11.310> on<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.430> switch

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
fire alarm it's like turning on a switch

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.820 
fire alarm it's like turning on a switch
the<00:05:12.390> power<00:05:12.600> connects<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.410> goes<00:05:13.560> through<00:05:13.770> a

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
the power connects and goes through a

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.680 
the power connects and goes through a
circle<00:05:14.280> but<00:05:14.820> when<00:05:14.970> you<00:05:15.090> turn<00:05:15.270> off<00:05:15.390> the<00:05:15.570> switch

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
circle but when you turn off the switch

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.140 
circle but when you turn off the switch
the<00:05:16.440> power<00:05:16.650> gets<00:05:17.010> stopped<00:05:17.310> and<00:05:17.580> it's<00:05:17.700> done<00:05:17.880> so

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
the power gets stopped and it's done so

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.750 
the power gets stopped and it's done so
now<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.360> basically<00:05:18.870> have<00:05:19.140> a<00:05:19.440> simple<00:05:20.280> fire

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
now you basically have a simple fire

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.020 
now you basically have a simple fire
alarm<00:05:21.060> circuit<00:05:21.330> right<00:05:21.780> here<00:05:22.670> so<00:05:23.670> let's<00:05:23.700> go

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
alarm circuit right here so let's go

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.330 
alarm circuit right here so let's go
ahead<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.330> pull<00:05:24.510> it<00:05:24.540> and<00:05:24.840> see<00:05:25.170> if<00:05:25.530> it<00:05:25.920> works

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
ahead and pull it and see if it works

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:41.120 
ahead and pull it and see if it works
three<00:05:26.670> two<00:05:27.300> one<00:05:39.320> alright<00:05:40.320> and<00:05:40.560> to<00:05:40.710> turn<00:05:40.920> it<00:05:40.950> off

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
three two one alright and to turn it off

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.460 
three two one alright and to turn it off
you<00:05:41.160> just<00:05:41.430> reset<00:05:41.790> your<00:05:41.940> full<00:05:42.120> station<00:05:42.360> and<00:05:43.170> yet

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
you just reset your full station and yet

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.850 
you just reset your full station and yet
and<00:05:43.860> I<00:05:44.570> guess<00:05:45.570> it<00:05:45.750> works<00:05:45.930> now<00:05:46.170> and<00:05:46.380> this<00:05:46.500> is<00:05:46.650> by

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
and I guess it works now and this is by

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.060 
and I guess it works now and this is by
the<00:05:46.890> way<00:05:47.040> set<00:05:47.370> on<00:05:47.490> 110<00:05:48.150> Candela<00:05:48.630> so<00:05:49.590> that<00:05:49.830> is

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
the way set on 110 Candela so that is

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.700 
the way set on 110 Candela so that is
how<00:05:50.280> you<00:05:50.310> are<00:05:50.580> wire<00:05:51.150> up<00:05:51.450> a<00:05:51.690> crew<00:05:52.110> station<00:05:52.560> to

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
how you are wire up a crew station to

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.470 
how you are wire up a crew station to
