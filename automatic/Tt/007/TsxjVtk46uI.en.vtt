minute I think I got burned by the hot
glue<00:01:43.020> gun<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.649> eventually<00:01:43.950> get<00:01:44.399> it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.090

just taking some tool from and I got
mine<00:03:09.069> at<00:03:09.189> the<00:03:09.280> regular<00:03:09.579> craft<00:03:09.790> store<00:03:10.060> Hobby

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
mine at the regular craft store Hobby

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.910 
mine at the regular craft store Hobby
Lobby<00:03:10.390> like<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.840> said<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.290> can<00:03:11.470> make<00:03:11.680> your

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
Lobby like I said you can make your

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.830 
Lobby like I said you can make your
sections<00:03:12.370> as<00:03:12.579> big<00:03:12.849> or<00:03:13.000> as<00:03:13.150> small<00:03:13.180> as<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:13.750> want

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
I use all different sizes and I just cut

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.170 
I use all different sizes and I just cut
a<00:03:17.950> piece<00:03:18.099> off<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.640> I<00:03:18.670> like<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:20.430> then<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.489> will

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
a piece off that I like and then I will

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.440 
a piece off that I like and then I will
take<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:23.280> piece<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.549> tool<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:25.000> had<00:03:25.209> cut

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
take the piece of tool that I had cut

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.319 
take the piece of tool that I had cut
and<00:03:26.049> I'm<00:03:26.170> going<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.620> kind<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:26.980> fold<00:03:27.220> one<00:03:27.909> side

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
and I'm going to kind of fold one side

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.720 
and I'm going to kind of fold one side
like<00:03:29.260> want<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.709> bottom<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.069> it<00:03:30.220> over<00:03:30.579> each

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
like want the bottom of it over each

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.250 
like want the bottom of it over each
other<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.239> it'll<00:03:31.390> kind<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.720> make<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:32.019> little

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
other and it'll kind of make it a little

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.800 
other and it'll kind of make it a little
zigzaggy<00:03:32.470> on<00:03:32.920> top

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
zigzaggy on top

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.000 
zigzaggy on top
eventually<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:35.170> I'm<00:03:35.290> going<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.680> cut<00:03:35.859> the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
eventually that I'm going to cut the

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.830 
eventually that I'm going to cut the
access<00:03:36.639> off<00:03:36.909> the<00:03:37.389> end<00:03:38.730> after<00:03:39.730> I<00:03:40.150> pinch<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.629> and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
access off the end after I pinch it and

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.390 
access off the end after I pinch it and
get<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.079> to<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.290> size<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:41.799> want

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
get it to the size that I want

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.399 
get it to the size that I want
and<00:03:43.269> after<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.659> I'm<00:03:43.810> just<00:03:43.840> going<00:03:44.109> to<00:03:44.200> take

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
and after that I'm just going to take

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.360 
and after that I'm just going to take
some<00:03:44.439> hot<00:03:44.859> glue<00:03:45.069> and<00:03:46.739> put<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:47.799> hot<00:03:47.980> glue<00:03:48.159> all

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
some hot glue and put a hot glue all

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.129 
some hot glue and put a hot glue all
over<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.790> bottom<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.359> it<00:03:49.659> will<00:03:49.840> melt

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
over the bottom of it and it will melt

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.140 
over the bottom of it and it will melt
the<00:03:50.379> plastic<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:51.069> I<00:03:51.099> think<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.489> makes<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:51.849> stay

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
the plastic so I think it makes it stay

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.089 
the plastic so I think it makes it stay
better<00:03:52.389> if<00:03:52.629> you<00:03:52.720> do<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.079> way<00:03:53.139> you<00:03:53.439> can<00:03:53.980> use

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
better if you do it that way you can use

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.830 
better if you do it that way you can use
wire<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.609> pinch<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:54.909> together<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.510> can<00:03:55.540> use

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
wire to pinch it together you can use

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.899 
wire to pinch it together you can use
zip<00:03:56.439> ties<00:03:56.680> anything<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.489> want<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:57.879> just

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
zip ties anything that you want I just

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.349 
zip ties anything that you want I just
prefer<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.510> do<00:03:58.810> hot<00:03:59.049> glue<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.639> after<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:01.090> I

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
prefer to do hot glue and after the I

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.890 
prefer to do hot glue and after the I
put<00:04:01.599> the<00:04:01.689> glue<00:04:01.870> on<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:03.359> after<00:04:04.359> it<00:04:04.660> dries<00:04:04.870> a

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
put the glue on and after it dries a

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.509 
put the glue on and after it dries a
minute<00:04:05.230> not<00:04:05.379> completely<00:04:05.889> drive<00:04:06.099> it<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.400> where

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
twist the glue around itself and it will

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.610

make<00:04:13.060> like<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.269> nice<00:04:13.480> point<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:14.440> will<00:04:14.530> be

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.290

they're<00:07:03.400> supposed<00:07:03.520> to<00:07:03.730> be<00:07:03.790> little<00:07:03.910> stickers

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
they're supposed to be little stickers

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.910 
they're supposed to be little stickers
but<00:07:04.540> I<00:07:04.720> use<00:07:04.870> them<00:07:05.080> for<00:07:05.110> everything<00:07:05.560> else<00:07:05.680> but

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:05.920 
but I use them for everything else but

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.280 
but I use them for everything else but
stickers<00:07:06.310> and<00:07:07.240> so<00:07:07.780> I'm<00:07:07.870> just<00:07:08.020> putting<00:07:08.170> some

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290 
stickers and so I'm just putting some

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.650 
stickers and so I'm just putting some
hot<00:07:08.620> glue<00:07:08.740> on<00:07:08.830> the<00:07:09.040> back<00:07:09.160> and<00:07:09.610> placing<00:07:10.540> it

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
hot glue on the back and placing it

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.440 
hot glue on the back and placing it
right<00:07:10.690> over<00:07:11.170> the<00:07:11.260> middle<00:07:11.940> where<00:07:12.940> we<00:07:13.150> glued

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.450 
right over the middle where we glued

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.160 
right over the middle where we glued
down<00:07:13.750> the<00:07:15.030> seam<00:07:16.030> before<00:07:16.390> so<00:07:16.540> you<00:07:16.630> can't<00:07:16.870> see<00:07:17.080> it

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.170 
down the seam before so you can't see it

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.590 
down the seam before so you can't see it
and<00:07:17.350> then<00:07:17.980> you<00:07:18.070> can<00:07:18.190> just<00:07:18.400> put<00:07:18.940> as<00:07:19.060> many<00:07:19.180> or<00:07:19.360> as

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.320
