 This the letter a photo follows me there is this 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.529
 Friends, this is the technical video of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.080
 I set up a scenario here well this week. 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.510
 cool, I'll explain to you how it is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.519
 the scenario as is my scenario is a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.619
 very cool scene simple to do I 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.080
 I'm using simple materials, not mine. 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.090
 home studio here in my home studio 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 I'm using a ironing board 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.890
 simple clothes nÃ© 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.829
 My little glass that I have at home that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.640
 it's a video to support the given mug letter 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.340
 also using a tripod of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.559
 hold the microphone I use for 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.910
 to be able to record my things and I here 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.070
 I'm using it to be able to hold my 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 cardboard here is a black card stock 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.590
 baratinha that we buy in any 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.420
 place right learned from tape that she will me 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.789
 give the scenario I need to be able to 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.640
 to draw my picture inside my 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.850
 home studio here my camera already 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.010
 it's on the tripod I'm using the 5 mark 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.170
 three is not right but you can use your 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.850
 common camera such a kind of thing to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.790
 this photo works cool you'll have 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:24.330
 that use the maximum sun of your lens then 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:27.000
 I am using the 55 right because it is she's 55 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.810
 in advertisement mark three or using 70 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.500
 huh 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.659
 it may distance my mug from the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.119
 my background this distance 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.070
 Are you going to take the test until you can 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.259
 find the distance that is more 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.960
 nice for you coolest more to 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.200
 the bottom of the bottom closes behind the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.829
 background opens our back 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.329
 I'm going to make a book with this paper here. 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.170
 beauty people then I will show several 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.750
 ways to make aa this picture I will 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.710
 choose whichever is is legal and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.170
 come on 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.670
 This is it friends, I'm using that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.700
 You buy a deposit 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.740
 construction of such an electrical material is 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.080
 that you take a car to such 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.649
 pull and sometimes you fix a car 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.780
 at 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.180
 in your garage is very cheap 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.939
 movie I paid 25 reais 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.459
 I put a feeble lamp right 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.340
 I put a lamp here frankly and I 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.359
 I will position this lamp brings a 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:32.459
 chair on the stool here behind 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:35.790
 best of my cards and I'll ask 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.849
 here is not the angle 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.510
 I'll punch in my wallet 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.510
 so come on 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.370
 This is it, friends, I did type one. 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.430
 triangle 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.080
 I did some were bigger here and then 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.300
 the minors 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.180
 you can interleave several types 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.800
 and my creativity to the 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.080
 your limit you can test several 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.370
 Ways to do it here, ok, I did. 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.550
 a triangle to look like mine 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.920
 book is coming out from inside the mug 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.440
 so let's see now I'll use the focus 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.430
 lens manual and the two-way timer 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.890
 seconds 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.420
 you can use the 10 - second timer I 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.310
 I will use two will try to do after 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.400
 if it works out fine if you do not give people 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.519
 go working until you can and I 'll go 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.709
 Manual focusing on my lens here ok I 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.050
 I'll try to find her manual focus. 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.630
 the environment is clearly logical in the 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.790
 A year showing you but here 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.519
 little will darken the environment and will 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.290
 stay just at work here to 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.800
 to be able to do so is that 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.800
 though 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.880
 friends I'll use the focal to make the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.790
 my side lamp in a package that 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.739
 see a product I went to buy on the internet 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.090
 but it's kind of like a cloth paper with the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.419
 such paper 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.660
 I'll use it to spread my light, right? 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.600
 the idea why is is there is no light 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.220
 interfere in this light that is behind 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.440
 so that's why I'm going to use a light 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.810
 point you can use that lamp that 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.389
 sells in lighting stores of 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.979
 illustrious one who learns that 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.419
 legal vacuum that you can learn in 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.340
 door of the wardrobe you can 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.660
 undertake at the table and he has a light 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.000
 directed 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.650
 there you put a shirt on the front and 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.630
 it gets a diffused light too 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.180
 A diffused light became more beautiful. 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.550
 so I'm going to use this from here to power 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.040
 make my fill light on my 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.490
 object so let's not go there let's try 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.490
 Photograph 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.680
 so now I'll show you the 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.600
 machine configuration 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.840
 so friends is the following I am 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.450
 using four speed 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.550
 2.8 iso 100 the image that people 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.700
 Got it, it's good, but let's go 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.190
 increment this image I bought 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.110
 This yellow little paper here is a movie. 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.790
 huh 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.880
 I paid well for that one or those 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.810
 what school near school 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.730
 It's very cool. 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.260
 beauty let's use this from here a vehicle 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.260
 what is our balls 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.620
 I have now decided to change my 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:14.180
 scenario I'll do I do with the 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:18.500
 microphone and a microphone and I 'll try 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.449
 embrace him with the bucket of the other vision 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.909
 because then I'll make more holes in the 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.909
 my name ok cardboard so come 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.140
 so I'm using the same technique as 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.330
 again 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.260
 But now I've made several holes in 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.350
 come back 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.860
 the microphone to appear 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:51.200
 hugging the microphone in the image of that 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.930
 I once did the polka dots yet the polka dots 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.730
 coming out of the mug and now I 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.890
 I made the microphone 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.830
 the balls hugging the microphone and a 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:03.350
 Another good idea is to use the microphone and 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:07.730
 I put pink on the bottom here, um. 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:11.720
 pink paper the pink film and I'll use the 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:16.340
 Blue looks there blue in mine on mine 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.500
 focus on what I'm going to do blue light on 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.020
 the microphone as if it were a 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:25.480
 even music studio 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.480
 so come on let's see with me 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:38.820
 This is it, friends, I hope you have 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.260
 liked the technical photo of the week to help 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.960
