00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.010
 Hello, I am both Sergeev 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:13.550
 Today I will tell you how to stroke 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.380
 the shirt is quick and easy is not mine 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.160
 notion I looked at her in one 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.960
 broadcast on TV at one time she 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.659
 I saved a lot of time and 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.349
 so today I am sharing with you in this 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:27.650
 not . 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.339
 attachment if your shirt is good 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.759
 dried up 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.460
 but not yet peresushila you can proceed 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.460
 true but if it is a little dry we 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.519
 her first 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:46.460
 squirted every modern iron there 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:51.109
 Such a function is very convenient to water 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:58.120
 shirt can be another way as 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:01:01.120
 did our grandmothers and mothers splattered 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.120
 turned off 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:13.460
 and then lie down it is necessary as it is possible 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:17.120
 more tightly so that moisture gets into the cart if 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:23.380
 you iron 2 3 shirts can be prepared 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.680
 and in advance so our shirt is dipped 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.260
 We start was 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.510
 iron start necessarily with the collar 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:36.380
 and wrong side of it 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:39.100
 in order not to burn 3 we set the right one 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.100
 the temperature 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.990
 proceed 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.970
 then 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.970
 turn in the face amount 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.390
 and speaking front side collar 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.119
 then 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.119
 we put on shoulder shoulder 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.580
 smooth the napkin 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:34.840
 if cancer develops bad use 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.840
 steam or splash function 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.930
 there is also acting from the other side 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:54.300
 when the shoulders are ironed we start 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:58.050
 nesting with sleeves we stretch a button 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:02.170
 will become buttoned if you have 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:07.950
 special board i take coval this is still 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.950
 better unfortunately no 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:39.430
 himself and the parties then with another new cathedral 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:50.690
 proglazhivaetsya can jump 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:54.709
 used the function of a pair of arrows to us on 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.340
 the sleeve does not need so I also have to 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.340
 smooth out 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.120
 first one 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:36.320
 and cuff also use for taxation 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.610
 smears or use a projection or 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.610
 special board of what 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.410
 do the same thing with the second pricked 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:02.110
 Well, the sleeves are ironed 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.220
 start ironing the shelves first 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.220
 put one 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.100
 using youtube on the ironing board 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.830
 I didnâ€™t play 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:28.170
 do not release and leave on the ironing 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:31.540
 blackboard + one shelf who went crush 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:40.930
 of course you can not move 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:45.160
 move the bun gave the wife 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.850
 we come back also descend from 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.910
 one side on the other using the protrusion 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.910
 ironing board 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:59.160
 Again, smooth words but during 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.160
 how to use the function 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.300
 and 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.720
 when ironed back pass 2 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.720
 shelves 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:32.920
 the main principle of this technique is smoothed 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:39.430
 start complicated here small 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:41.950
 the details are large and the reason here is very 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.840
 weighty because if you start 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:46.600
 iron sad details later 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.630
 go to the smaller your club 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:54.480
 details - and they have to be ironed 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:07:02.020
 second time, our shirt is ready 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:02.910
 can her big boys from speed 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.870
 depend on 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:12.100
 the speed of the hostess depends on who is in time 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:15.030
 but usually it takes 7 to 10 minutes 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.030
 bye me
