I<00:01:27.450> don't<00:01:27.689> know<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.080> because<00:01:28.229> they

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
I don't know if it's because they

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.780 
I don't know if it's because they
weren't<00:01:28.680> able<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> rest<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.490> them<00:01:29.640> or

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and you know I never said it was

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800 
and you know I never said it was
supposed<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.790> challenging<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.780> just

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
supposed to be challenging I just I just

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.999 
supposed to be challenging I just I just
said<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.140> was<00:01:46.259> gonna<00:01:46.350> be<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> nuke<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.829> every

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
said it was gonna be a nuke with every

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.590 
said it was gonna be a nuke with every
gun<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.520> know<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.759> started<00:01:48.360> off<00:01:48.479> with

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
gun and you know I I started off with

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.389 
gun and you know I I started off with
every<00:01:48.810> gun<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.290> got<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> majority<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
every gun I got the majority of the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.310 
every gun I got the majority of the
kills<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:50.700> every<00:01:50.880> gun<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.869> ended<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
kills with every gun and I ended the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.700 
kills with every gun and I ended the
game<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:53.180> nuke<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.170> title<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.560> always

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
game with a nuke so the title was always

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.080 
game with a nuke so the title was always
collide<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.219> did<00:01:56.399> defend<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.759> real<00:01:56.909> quick

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
collide I did defend that real quick

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.719 
collide I did defend that real quick
because<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:58.469> said<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.740> done<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.579> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
because this is all said and done and to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.889 
because this is all said and done and to
get<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.000> out<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.210> I'm<00:02:00.509> tired<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.810> people

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
get that out there I'm tired of people

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.719 
get that out there I'm tired of people
bitching<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.409> complaining<00:02:01.500> about<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.310> of

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
bitching and complaining about it and of

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.370 
bitching and complaining about it and of
course<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.149> would<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.540> ending<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:03.990> Afghan

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
course it would it be ending on Afghan

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.270 
course it would it be ending on Afghan
you<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.740> mean<00:02:04.920> there's<00:02:05.100> probably

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you know what I mean there's probably

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
you know what I mean there's probably
like<00:02:05.549> half<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> nukes<00:02:06.270> were<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.840> day

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
like half of the nukes were on this day

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.619 
like half of the nukes were on this day
a<00:02:07.049> map<00:02:07.350> so<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.030> its<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.420> quite

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
a map so and it's in its it's quite

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.119 
a map so and it's in its it's quite
unusual<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.259> lot<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.500> these<00:02:10.649> these

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
unusual because a lot of these these

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.860 
unusual because a lot of these these
dual<00:02:11.580> wielded<00:02:12.000> weapons<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.450> wouldn't<00:02:12.720> expect

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
dual wielded weapons you wouldn't expect

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.700 
dual wielded weapons you wouldn't expect
them<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.349> left

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
them to be left

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.070 
them to be left
like<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.130> GE<00:02:14.310> teens<00:02:14.580> were<00:02:14.730> on<00:02:14.760> wasteland<00:02:15.300> it's

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
like the GE teens were on wasteland it's

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.240 
like the GE teens were on wasteland it's
not<00:02:16.200> something<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.560> would<00:02:16.620> have<00:02:16.740> expected

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
not something you would have expected

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.280 
not something you would have expected
you<00:02:17.520> know<00:02:17.730> obviously<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.630> deagle<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.080> even

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
you know obviously the deagle is even

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.200 
you know obviously the deagle is even
dual<00:02:19.500> wielded<00:02:19.890> are<00:02:19.980> probably<00:02:20.400> not<00:02:20.670> essential

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
dual wielded are probably not essential

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.300 
dual wielded are probably not essential
for<00:02:21.780> Afghan<00:02:22.140> even<00:02:22.350> though<00:02:22.410> Afghans<00:02:22.830> great<00:02:23.100> for

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
for Afghan even though Afghans great for

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.800 
for Afghan even though Afghans great for
nuking<00:02:23.610> from<00:02:23.790> straight<00:02:24.060> from<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.720> know

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
nuking from straight from the you know

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.860 
nuking from straight from the you know
areas<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.260> gutter<00:02:26.240> but<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.270> had<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> lot<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.720> fun

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
areas to gutter but I had a lot of fun

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.390 
areas to gutter but I had a lot of fun
and<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.110> really<00:02:28.140> really<00:02:28.500> underestimated<00:02:29.220> these

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
and I really really underestimated these

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.220 
and I really really underestimated these
guns<00:02:29.670> um<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.360> longest<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.840> was<00:02:30.960> running

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
guns um for the longest I was running

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.230 
guns um for the longest I was running
around<00:02:31.290> with<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.710> single<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.940> had

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
around with just a single and I had

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.850 
around with just a single and I had
Harriers<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:33.870> six<00:02:34.110> games<00:02:34.320> in<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.560> row<00:02:34.590> with

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
Harriers like six games in a row with

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.010 
Harriers like six games in a row with
them<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.280> that's<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.720> comes<00:02:36.810> down

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
them so that's that's what it comes down

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.460 
them so that's that's what it comes down
to<00:02:37.080> is<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:38.250> deagle<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.700> very<00:02:39.000> underrated

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
to is is the deagle is very underrated

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.230 
to is is the deagle is very underrated
it<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.770> takes<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.220> lot<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.520> skill<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.000> control

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
it just takes a lot of skill to control
