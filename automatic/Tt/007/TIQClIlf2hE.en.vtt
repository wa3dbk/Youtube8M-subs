00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.130
 Good morning, people, I have one more. 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.940
 review for you 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.580
 and this time it's the Moroccan brush of the 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.679
 that this is not the first time 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.320
 that I buy her already bought her two 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.820
 I used to like it so much before. 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.710
 I had tried the review that I solved 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.550
 buy 1 liter bottles this time 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.430
 come on she is you receive from the products 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.560
 in the shampoo and progressive in itself as the 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.540
 Most tests always work 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.400
 the shampoo is very tasty has the smell 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:38.530
 delicious has a scent of eyes 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.260
 so Moroccan to argan oil 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.240
 look here it does not stink as much as the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.430
 other progressive in my opinion I 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.140
 I think she smells like that. 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.000
 well tolerable because I'm very 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.079
 Sensitive full you know why I 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.140
 I have a lot of energy 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.910
 so I can smell her well tolerated 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.010
 my clients do not complain about the smell 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.470
 her very much the opposite most speak 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.540
 that you're not feeling anything just when I 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.520
 I can taste the front even though 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.439
 ends up getting a little stronger than 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.450
 is closer to the face but the smell 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.460
 her is well tolerated and what I found 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.549
 interesting within the brand that also 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.560
 there was on the website where I bought it that they 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.780
 have launched a progressive solution of 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.939
 is a product is cheap $ 30 some 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.770
 thing as you blend into the 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.899
 progressively to eliminate 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.200
 possible the pain she has 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.310
 step but I think with this 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.229
 sincerely do not need because she is the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.810
 smell of it is very weak indeed 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.999
 239 the auction on the beauty web site 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.439
 all the sick are going down here I go 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:41.020
 put the link of this site that I told 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.590
 but also at the samy beauty mall 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.770
 dana 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.869
 I found her a very moisturizing brushes 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.270
 is the chair base is butter 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.909
 cocoa seed extract wheat clay 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.060
 White it was generalized that is the 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.890
 cocoa butter extract is a 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.740
 I think this is a well-known street 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.829
 would be nice to say that the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.270
 natural oiliness has opened the 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.750
 wheat germ extract also it 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.170
 Provides softness and white clay 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.459
 has properties that are revitalizing 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.050
 rejuvenating or hair that 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.989
 It is very tired of Quincas 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.260
 dyes and straighteners it looks good 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.840
 so revitalized and lost again 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.410
 for the part of the reconstruction of 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.959
 fiber to give I saw the air force had 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.269
 take off that elastic hair effect 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.980
 I particularly pain this brush 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.549
 I think if the inter will be worth price 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.350
 it yields on average 20 applications in 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.630
 because it depends on the size of the 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.239
 volume hair if you will need 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.560
 more product does not yield on average 20 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:52.110
 applications and yellow is the base of the sea 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.630
 as it isa is based on boric acid 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.549
 that it is a very 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.230
 safe on the market today it is necessary to 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:02.790
 to smooth the hair and it releases 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.709
 She's a little formal in that way. 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.680
 formula only if it is also badly 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.530
 as a preservative and as a result also 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.109
 glycolic acid when it is 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.790
 hot on board 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.319
 however informed is not enough 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.010
 harmful to health which is an 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.350
 very little even ignores it is a brand 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.810
 very famous everyone must already have 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.180
 heard in the hall because it's a brand 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.750
 quality is exported to several 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.790
 countries then the question of formal in it I 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.430
 I trust that he is dismissed precisely by 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.680
 brand reputation 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.560
 so very safe to use during 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.670
 her calculation is usually in my 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.880
 hair of 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.040
 a month and a half to two months is she gives 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.930
 a smooth natural effect does not leave 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.870
 that account knows that 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.720
 progressively closed and I like 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.340
 enough of it and then just like the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.620
 application of it as I do 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.840
 twice washing the hair with shampoo 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.239
 deep cleaning what I like this 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.000
 game is that it is not a field that 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:09.239
 ends hair knows the same as the bridge by 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.340
 example is a shampoo do you think I live but 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.580
 it is a little moisturizing 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.530
 I really like him is after washing 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.359
 the hair twice I jet with 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.850
 dryer to get the maximum out of the unit 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.700
 possible on the hair until it is almost dry 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.270
 and then I support the hair treatment as 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.490
 giving a clear space a bit of 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.320
 one centimeter of the root just for you 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.940
 getting too peeling is because if you 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.840
 to touch the nice like that with any 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.880
 progressive 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.130
 you will stay with the dog by ta 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.560
 least the first week of a little space 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.570
 of a deviation from at least one 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.729
 that the movement afterwards I leave this 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.640
 product acting on the hair and about 20 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.400
 minutes to half an hour born to the 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.270
 product can penetrate heavily in fiber 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.539
 capillary 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.300
 then you do not need I do not think 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.800
 need to brush it whole 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.910
 in hair depends a lot on texture 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.890
 original hair 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.789
 if the hair is very caked essence 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:08.130
 school well to wear well in my hair in 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.620
 which has a hair thinner than the more 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.450
 Mine or more days than mine I did not 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.419
 School honestly I just take already there 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.729
 around two already solve enough and then 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.919
 You're going to find that fine wick of that. 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:22.050
 day you already know, you need 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.210
 pass the very fine march of this 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.970
 size so roughly and several 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.900
 times with a very hot board that 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.669
 at least 230 degrees and that 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.740
 and which is preferably a plate 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.300
 of titanium because they are usually 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.509
 keep warm so keep the temperature 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.039
 It's hot, that's it. I loved it. 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:42.240
 brushing progressive I ever bought 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.039
 several times 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.530
 I'll continue shopping from super 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.030
 recommended and that those who liked not 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.919
 stop subscribing to the channel if you 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.690
 Liked the review of a game 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.639
 any doubt is just to call that in the 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.680
 information box may ask the 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.580
 advantage and that's it 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.580
 since work
