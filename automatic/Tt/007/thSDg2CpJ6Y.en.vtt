00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.340
 how about friends I am a 'break' and today 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.990
 I bring you a short video about the 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.430
 jungle as we already know in the new 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.900
 jungle ray is placed effects 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.280
 additional in monsters to be is 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.599
 mid and today we will analyze what 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.189
 monsters is convenient that you have to give 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.200
 and which ones do not start with the 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.360
 Small rocky camps give us 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.800
 the bus of strong hands this what 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.689
 does it is that the first and the fifth blow 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.610
 of a series of 5 stuns the subjects 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.140
 and neutral monsters also the first 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.910
 hit we want a tower will cause damage 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.190
 extra but this ship will be consumed 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.899
 this vessel is quite situational is 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.340
 good for one of the two attacks and 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.470
 It is also good to clean the jungle 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.630
 without receiving so much damage but the effect 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.550
 over the tower is very poor so 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.290
 I would get them if we are going to clean 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.910
 jungle and we will not go directly to 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.070
 try to throw a tower the next 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.440
 camp are the grasps cos this one us 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.940
 grants the sharp razor bus this 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.560
 what it does is that it alerts you and you 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.200
 provides vision about sentinels 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.910
 enemies this is the best for the jungle 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.160
 since it allows us to control the vision 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.020
 easy and so wanted to destroy 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.610
 We can get into the enemy 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.409
 enemy jungle and know if they are us 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.060
 seeing also we saving extra for 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.409
 destroy them wards and what could be 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.240
 one disadvantage is that in very rare 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.979
 Sometimes we will not find any guard 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.710
 to kill but that really is very 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.900
 difficult and less 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.729
 another camp is the gloomy east 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.229
 grants the spirit to the crack invokes a 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.479
 sentinel wolf that vision in the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.619
 jungle for 90 seconds and it is reduced 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.780
 if you chase an enemy 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.950
 this effect is good if we use it in 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.869
 the enemy jungle when we are 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.159
 doing an angol but it's bad 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.530
 if we use it in our jungle since 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.600
 normally it's not going to do us any good 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.950
 the other camp would be the group this 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.110
 gives the book of the years of minutes 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.790
 this good came the attackers and they 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.409
 inflicts a little magic damage for three 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.020
 seconds this ship is quite 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.310
 situational the damage is not very big anymore 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.080
 that will not serve us so much in the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.240
 gangs but if we are going to clean jungle 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.950
 could benefit us a little bit so I 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.630
 I would just put them in if we are going to 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.300
 keep cleaning jungle and we will not go 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.280
 to try to win or something like that now 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.899
 let's go to the big camps the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.149
 first it's the blue guard or blue bofa 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.490
 as we all know this what it does 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.560
 is cancers put to 2 restores 25% of the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.240
 maximum mana is something very situational 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.220
 also because if we can stay with 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.080
 the gate buff we are going to regenerate 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.090
 manna then if I'm going to stay with 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.440
 the bug I would not put the matter 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.330
 the espai to take advantage of them mike in 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.459
 some other camp like the grabs 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.110
 cause it 's good if we're going to donate the buff 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.520
 someone since we probably have 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.470
 Mana problems after 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.970
 this and it is also unusable for 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.250
 characters that do not use mana like 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.500
 example renga roll and without the last 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.860
 camp would be red or red hawthorn 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.170
 this immediately restores 25% of 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.850
 our maximum life to malted cds this 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.260
 effect is pretty good since it's 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.090
 indispensable for many are the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.010
 weak in the first round what we 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.350
 It allows to clean the jungle a little 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.150
 better is also good because it increases 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.920
 considerably in thousand and in law game 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.600
 they already comment a lot not to be a value 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.040
 flat but a percentage value of 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.140
 our maximum life also serves to 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.550
 all the jungles is universal not like 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.710
 the blue buff that if we are not a 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.480
 character that week is bad does not work 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.130
 completely nothing is left for 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.900
 to mention and is that if for example we go 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.220
 to return to base to buy then 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.810
 obviously we are going to faint what 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.880
 we are killing since in what 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.990
 we return the base and we go back then 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.970
 more or less we will have the cooling 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.800
 available of what is ours is maite 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.690
 we're also going to enamel ar obviously if 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.280
 we are invading the enemy jungle not 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.170
 let's try to kill something without 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.090
 spend the smile for that is that 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.190
 we must also have a criterion when 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.930
 we must and when we should not use it 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.370
 normally we will decide when it is to put 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.990
 and when not when they are monsters of 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.880
 our own jungle or when we have 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.360
 complete control over the jungle 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.070
 enemy 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.870
 and good friends this would be all in this 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.370
 video remember that served the taste not 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.900
 forget to give line and share it 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.310
 You can also subscribe to the channel and 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.780
 they know that the comment box is 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.130
 precisely for that to leave 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.290
 any comments whether they are doubts 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.610
 suggestions or anything else also 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.750
 description stays on facebook and without 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.490
 more then I remind you that I am a man 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.090
 what friends we see until next time
