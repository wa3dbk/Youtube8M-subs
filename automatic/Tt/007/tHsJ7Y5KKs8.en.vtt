00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
simple way of doing that as well recent

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.549 
simple way of doing that as well recent
to<00:00:55.989> grab<00:00:56.229> either<00:00:56.769> a<00:00:56.949> spoon<00:00:58.290> awesome<00:00:59.290> people

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
to grab either a spoon awesome people

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.420 
to grab either a spoon awesome people
use<00:01:00.010> one<00:01:00.369> of<00:01:00.400> these<00:01:00.580> rubber<00:01:00.940> spatulas<00:01:01.269> and<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
use one of these rubber spatulas and you

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.170 
use one of these rubber spatulas and you
simply<00:01:03.610> just<00:01:04.089> get<00:01:05.019> your<00:01:05.140> spoon<00:01:05.440> in<00:01:05.860> behind<00:01:06.400> the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
simply just get your spoon in behind the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.050 
simply just get your spoon in behind the
meat<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:07.829> start<00:01:08.829> pulling<00:01:09.159> it<00:01:09.280> away<00:01:09.369> from<00:01:09.820> the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
meat and start pulling it away from the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.789 
meat and start pulling it away from the
nut<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.420> working<00:01:10.810> your<00:01:10.840> way<00:01:10.990> around<00:01:11.109> so<00:01:11.770> that

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
nut and working your way around so that

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.499 
nut and working your way around so that
hopefully<00:01:12.100> what<00:01:12.640> you'll<00:01:12.789> get<00:01:12.969> is<00:01:13.149> just<00:01:13.390> the

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
hopefully what you'll get is just the

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.679 
hopefully what you'll get is just the
whole<00:01:13.689> lot<00:01:13.960> coming<00:01:14.950> out<00:01:15.189> in<00:01:15.310> one<00:01:15.490> hit<00:01:15.759> which<00:01:16.479> is

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
whole lot coming out in one hit which is

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.679 
whole lot coming out in one hit which is
pretty<00:01:17.250> pretty<00:01:18.250> good<00:01:18.609> i'm<00:01:19.149> going<00:01:19.329> to<00:01:19.390> make<00:01:19.509> and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
pretty pretty good i'm going to make and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.510 
pretty pretty good i'm going to make and
we<00:01:22.689> should<00:01:22.990> check<00:01:23.259> there's<00:01:23.560> no<00:01:23.710> ground<00:01:24.039> fiber

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
we should check there's no ground fiber

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.020 
we should check there's no ground fiber
see<00:01:24.820> bits<00:01:25.030> on<00:01:25.359> the<00:01:25.630> actual<00:01:25.929> meat<00:01:26.770> itself<00:01:27.280> a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
see bits on the actual meat itself a

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.709 
see bits on the actual meat itself a
little<00:01:28.689> light<00:01:28.929> brown<00:01:29.229> ones<00:01:29.469> answer<00:01:29.979> bad<00:01:30.189> but

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
little light brown ones answer bad but

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.300 
little light brown ones answer bad but
if<00:01:31.719> you<00:01:31.899> get<00:01:32.079> the<00:01:32.200> dark<00:01:32.409> ones<00:01:32.710> it's<00:01:32.890> probably<00:01:33.249> a

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
if you get the dark ones it's probably a

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.739 
if you get the dark ones it's probably a
good<00:01:33.369> idea<00:01:33.549> just<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:33.969> try<00:01:34.179> and<00:01:34.210> get<00:01:34.420> them<00:01:34.600> off

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749 
good idea just to try and get them off

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:38.840 
good idea just to try and get them off
because<00:01:34.899> they<00:01:35.049> can<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:36.700> quite<00:01:37.350> hard<00:01:38.350> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
because they can be quite hard and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.359 
because they can be quite hard and
vibrancy<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.679> so<00:01:41.679> we're<00:01:41.829> going<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.039> do<00:01:42.130> is

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
vibrancy and so we're going to do is

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.130 
vibrancy and so we're going to do is
going<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.640> quickly<00:01:42.820> slice<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.509> up<00:01:46.140> coconuts

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
going to quickly slice that up coconuts

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.469 
going to quickly slice that up coconuts
are<00:01:48.039> amazing<00:01:48.609> day<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:49.679> high<00:01:51.270> medium<00:01:52.270> chain

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
are amazing day a high medium chain

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.340 
are amazing day a high medium chain
fatty<00:01:52.539> acids<00:01:53.229> which<00:01:53.670> actually<00:01:54.670> um<00:01:55.210> don't<00:01:56.170> get

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
fatty acids which actually um don't get

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.489 
fatty acids which actually um don't get
stored<00:01:56.619> as<00:01:56.740> fat<00:01:56.770> in<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.100> body<00:01:57.249> they<00:01:57.520> actually

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
stored as fat in the body they actually

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.200 
stored as fat in the body they actually
get<00:01:59.499> used<00:01:59.770> for<00:01:59.950> energy<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:00.609> they<00:02:01.060> actually

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
get used for energy so they actually

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.680 
get used for energy so they actually
help<00:02:01.689> increase

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
help increase

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.080 
help increase
your<00:02:02.780> metabolism<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.250> now<00:02:04.370> that<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.640> coconut
