that before in several blogs that when

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.590 
that before in several blogs that when

you're trying to lose weight you've got

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.810 
you're trying to lose weight you've got
to<00:00:57.780> create<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.379> caloric<00:00:58.890> deficit<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.550> need<00:00:59.699> to

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
to create a caloric deficit you need to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.569 
to create a caloric deficit you need to
burn<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.660> calories<00:01:00.989> than<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> take<00:01:02.370> in

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
burn more calories than what you take in

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.649 
burn more calories than what you take in
so<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.539> lose<00:01:03.750> weight<00:01:04.129> every<00:01:05.659> 3500

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
so that you can lose weight every 3500

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.050 
so that you can lose weight every 3500
calories<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.500> burn<00:01:07.790> weighs<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.030> pound

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
calories that you burn weighs one pound

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.600 
calories that you burn weighs one pound
so<00:01:09.869> every<00:01:10.080> 3500<00:01:10.890> calories<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.490> burn

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
so every 3500 calories that you burn

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.490 
so every 3500 calories that you burn
more<00:01:12.360> than<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> eat<00:01:12.869> you're<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> lose<00:01:13.439> a

more than you eat you're going to lose a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.010 
more than you eat you're going to lose a
pound<00:01:13.740> okay<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.970> where<00:01:15.390> does<00:01:15.479> weight<00:01:15.659> training

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
pound okay so where does weight training

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.859 
pound okay so where does weight training
play<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.729> weight<00:01:17.729> muscle<00:01:18.299> equals

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
play into this weight muscle equals

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.770 
play into this weight muscle equals
metabolism<00:01:19.560> right<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.600> you're<00:01:21.600> lifting

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
metabolism right so you're lifting

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.630 
metabolism right so you're lifting
weights<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.619> putting<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.009> muscle<00:01:23.220> every

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
weights you're putting on muscle every

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.200 
weights you're putting on muscle every
pound<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.869> muscle<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.189> put<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.939> going

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
pound of muscle that you put on is going

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.749 
pound of muscle that you put on is going
to<00:01:27.299> burn<00:01:27.479> an<00:01:27.720> additional<00:01:28.290> 50<00:01:28.710> calories<00:01:28.979> per

to burn an additional 50 calories per

to burn an additional 50 calories per
day<00:01:29.790> while<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:31.049> rest<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:32.549> we're<00:01:32.970> talking

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
day while at rest so when we're talking

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.270 
day while at rest so when we're talking
about<00:01:33.329> metabolism<00:01:33.840> we're<00:01:34.500> talking<00:01:34.890> about<00:01:35.009> how

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
about metabolism we're talking about how

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.120 
about metabolism we're talking about how
many<00:01:35.430> calories<00:01:35.700> your<00:01:36.060> body<00:01:36.090> burns<00:01:36.299> at<00:01:36.720> rest<00:01:37.350> so

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
many calories your body burns at rest so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.649 
many calories your body burns at rest so
if<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.310> were<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.700> lay<00:01:39.000> down<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.509> not

you<00:01:52.770> burn<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.159> day<00:01:53.659> seventy<00:01:54.659> percent<00:01:54.840> come

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
you burn in a day seventy percent come

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.609 
you burn in a day seventy percent come
from<00:01:55.890> your<00:01:56.040> metabolism<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.509> ideally<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.500> want

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
from your metabolism so ideally we want

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.200 
from your metabolism so ideally we want
to<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> ver

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
to have a ver

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.469 
to have a ver
high<00:01:59.390> metabolism<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:00.770> every<00:02:01.460> pound<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:02.119> muscle

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
high metabolism so every pound of muscle

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.990 
high metabolism so every pound of muscle
that<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:03.110> put<00:02:03.320> on<00:02:03.440> your<00:02:03.590> body<00:02:03.799> you're<00:02:04.729> going

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
that you put on your body you're going

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.109 
that you put on your body you're going
to<00:02:05.119> burn<00:02:05.330> an<00:02:05.510> extra<00:02:05.890> 50<00:02:06.890> calories<00:02:07.280> per<00:02:08.090> day

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
to burn an extra 50 calories per day

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.740 
to burn an extra 50 calories per day
while<00:02:08.660> at<00:02:08.959> rest<00:02:09.759> every<00:02:10.759> pound<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.390> fat<00:02:11.690> that

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
while at rest every pound of fat that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.690 
while at rest every pound of fat that
you're<00:02:12.230> carrying<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.770> your<00:02:12.950> body<00:02:13.130> burns<00:02:13.520> an

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
you're carrying on your body burns an

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.300 
you're carrying on your body burns an
extra<00:02:14.060> two<00:02:14.360> calories<00:02:14.959> per<00:02:15.590> day<00:02:15.620> while<00:02:16.010> at<00:02:16.190> rest

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
extra two calories per day while at rest

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.070 
extra two calories per day while at rest
so<00:02:16.580> do<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.760> see<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.000> difference<00:02:17.120> do<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:17.930> see

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
so do you see the difference do you see

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.559 
so do you see the difference do you see
why<00:02:18.319> we<00:02:18.350> want<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.739> have<00:02:18.860> more<00:02:19.040> muscle<00:02:19.250> less<00:02:20.239> fat

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
why we want to have more muscle less fat

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.720 
why we want to have more muscle less fat
because<00:02:21.080> our<00:02:21.230> metabolism<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.160> going<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.400> be<00:02:22.459> so

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
because our metabolism is going to be so

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.330 
because our metabolism is going to be so
much<00:02:22.880> faster<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:24.140> makes<00:02:24.319> sense<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.160> let<00:02:25.250> me

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
much faster that makes sense so let me

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.770 
much faster that makes sense so let me
show<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.640> little<00:02:25.850> trick<00:02:26.150> care<00:02:26.480> about<00:02:26.660> my

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
show you a little trick care about my

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.130 
show you a little trick care about my
driving<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.730> we<00:02:28.940> said<00:02:29.209> 30<00:02:30.080> hundred<00:02:30.830> calories

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
driving so we said 30 hundred calories

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.979 
driving so we said 30 hundred calories
messing<00:02:33.140> uniting<00:02:33.590> equals<00:02:34.250> 1<00:02:34.400> pound<00:02:34.640> right<00:02:35.120> so

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
messing uniting equals 1 pound right so

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.800 
messing uniting equals 1 pound right so
let's<00:02:36.709> pretend<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.940> our<00:02:37.970> goal<00:02:38.300> is<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.630> gain

Leslie<00:03:20.630> you<00:03:20.750> also<00:03:21.079> mentioned<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.250> do<00:03:22.549> a

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
Leslie you also mentioned that you do a

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.100 
Leslie you also mentioned that you do a
lot<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:22.880> interval<00:03:23.360> training<00:03:23.750> when<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:23.989> do

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
lot of interval training when you do

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.740 
lot of interval training when you do
cardio<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.860> you<00:03:25.610> go<00:03:25.760> fast<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.420> go<00:03:26.540> slow

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
cardio and you go fast and you go slow

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.150 
cardio and you go fast and you go slow
to<00:03:26.930> go<00:03:27.049> fast<00:03:27.079> you<00:03:27.470> go<00:03:27.590> slowly<00:03:27.799> because<00:03:28.070> you

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
to go fast you go slowly because you

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.770 
to go fast you go slowly because you
hurt<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.340> helps<00:03:28.850> with<00:03:29.360> losing<00:03:29.660> weight

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
hurt that helps with losing weight

hurt that helps with losing weight
faster<00:03:30.170> absolutely<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.190> does<00:03:31.870> compared<00:03:32.870> to

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
faster absolutely it does compared to

faster absolutely it does compared to
doing<00:03:33.320> a<00:03:33.560> steady-state<00:03:34.100> cardio<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.450> let's<00:03:35.630> say

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
doing a steady-state cardio so let's say

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.660 
doing a steady-state cardio so let's say
we<00:03:35.810> get<00:03:36.019> on<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.290> treadmill<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.769> just<00:03:37.100> run<00:03:37.340> for

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
we get on the treadmill and just run for

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.970 
we get on the treadmill and just run for
30<00:03:37.880> minutes<00:03:38.180> straight<00:03:38.570> versus<00:03:39.470> maybe<00:03:39.769> only
