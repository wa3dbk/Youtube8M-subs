00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the reason you're doing this is because

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.660 
the reason you're doing this is because
if<00:02:15.690> egg<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:16.110> have<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> different<00:02:16.670> consistency

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
if egg can have a different consistency

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.880 
if egg can have a different consistency
each<00:02:18.239> egg<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.350> just<00:02:19.500> want<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.739> make

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.300 
issue one that I use and you're gonna
want<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.079> spray<00:04:18.410> it<00:04:18.530> around<00:04:20.919> just<00:04:21.919> because

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
want to spray it around just because

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.270 
want to spray it around just because
they<00:04:22.510> do<00:04:23.510> tend<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.990> kind<00:04:24.350> of<00:04:24.410> lift<00:04:24.770> up<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:25.100> little

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
they do tend to kind of lift up a little

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.550 
they do tend to kind of lift up a little
you<00:04:25.940> don't<00:04:26.090> want<00:04:26.360> them<00:04:26.539> to<00:04:26.780> get<00:04:27.080> stuck<00:04:27.380> on<00:04:27.500> your

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
you don't want them to get stuck on your

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.339 
you don't want them to get stuck on your
pan<00:04:27.889> and<00:04:28.190> everything<00:04:28.580> like<00:04:28.729> muffin<00:04:29.090> tops<00:04:32.349> and

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
pan and everything like muffin tops and

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.260 
pan and everything like muffin tops and
then<00:04:33.500> I<00:04:33.590> do<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.919> think<00:04:34.130> I'm<00:04:34.760> using<00:04:35.030> the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
then I do you think I'm using the

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.080 
then I do you think I'm using the
scooper<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:35.960> it's<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.590> 20<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.729> good<00:04:37.910> thing

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
scooper and it's a 20 the good thing

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.700 
scooper and it's a 20 the good thing
about<00:04:38.150> using<00:04:38.570> one<00:04:38.840> of<00:04:38.960> these<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.440> that's<00:04:39.590> a

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
about using one of these and that's a

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.920 
about using one of these and that's a
trick<00:04:39.950> too<00:04:40.190> is<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.880> that<00:04:41.060> way<00:04:41.270> they<00:04:41.300> all<00:04:41.690> come

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
trick too is that that way they all come

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.680 
trick too is that that way they all come
out<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.410> same<00:04:43.310> size<00:04:43.760> and<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.300> don't<00:04:44.510> have<00:04:44.599> to

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
out the same size and you don't have to

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.540 
out the same size and you don't have to
worry<00:04:44.930> about<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.440> oh<00:04:45.680> yeah<00:04:46.010> and<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.250> probably

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
worry about that oh yeah and I probably

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.820 
worry about that oh yeah and I probably
forgot<00:04:47.000> to<00:04:47.360> mention<00:04:47.539> these<00:04:48.320> are<00:04:48.440> actually<00:04:48.710> the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
forgot to mention these are actually the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.450 
forgot to mention these are actually the
giant<00:04:49.490> muffins<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.599> so<00:04:51.200> I<00:04:51.440> mean<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:52.130> probably

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
giant muffins and so I mean you probably

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.490 
giant muffins and so I mean you probably
use<00:04:52.669> just<00:04:52.970> one<00:04:53.210> scoop<00:04:53.570> if<00:04:53.780> you're<00:04:53.960> gonna<00:04:54.110> do<00:04:54.349> it

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
use just one scoop if you're gonna do it

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.830 
use just one scoop if you're gonna do it
for<00:04:54.710> your<00:04:54.919> regular<00:04:55.070> happen<00:04:55.720> but<00:05:01.840> after

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
for your regular happen but after

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.860 
for your regular happen but after
putting<00:05:03.050> in<00:05:03.500> your<00:05:03.800> three<00:05:04.130> scoops<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:05.750> you

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
putting in your three scoops and you

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.820 
putting in your three scoops and you
want<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.110> make<00:05:06.200> sure<00:05:06.229> that<00:05:06.470> they're<00:05:06.650> all

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
want to make sure that they're all

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.830 
want to make sure that they're all
filled<00:05:07.130> up<00:05:07.220> to<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:07.400> top<00:05:07.520> like<00:05:07.849> this<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.660> that

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
filled up to the top like this and that

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.540 
filled up to the top like this and that
you<00:05:09.050> flatten<00:05:09.410> them<00:05:09.590> out<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:09.950> you<00:05:10.039> can<00:05:10.220> kind<00:05:10.490> of

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
you flatten them out so you can kind of

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.839 
you flatten them out so you can kind of
handle<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:11.870> all<00:05:12.020> or<00:05:12.289> with<00:05:12.979> your<00:05:13.190> finger<00:05:13.550> or<00:05:13.789> a
