00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830

the coaches now these are really nice
these<00:01:17.040> ones<00:01:17.420> were<00:01:19.100> built

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
these ones were built

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.730 
these ones were built
I<00:01:20.310> think<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.580> think<00:01:20.790> they're<00:01:20.909> mark<00:01:21.180> ones<00:01:21.740> but

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
I think I think they're mark ones but

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.060 
I think I think they're mark ones but
they've<00:01:22.890> got<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:24.600> very<00:01:25.080> nice<00:01:25.290> level<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.740> detail

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
they've got a very nice level of detail

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.590 
they've got a very nice level of detail
you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.490> about<00:01:26.610> make<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> interior

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
you can just about make out the interior

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.819 
you can just about make out the interior
in<00:01:27.810> there

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
in there

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
in there
I<00:01:28.860> also<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.729> printed<00:01:30.210> crest<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
I also like the printed crest on the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.420 
I also like the printed crest on the
side<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.259> car<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.799> very<00:01:31.979> nice<00:01:32.159> touch

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
side of the car that's a very nice touch

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.179 
side of the car that's a very nice touch
and<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.570> carnations<00:01:34.140> got<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> nameplate<00:01:34.560> LMS

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and the carnations got a nameplate LMS

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.740 
and the carnations got a nameplate LMS
and<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> numbers<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.299> crisply

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and the numbers are all very crisply

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.590 
and the numbers are all very crisply
detailed<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.070> stripes<00:01:38.369> don't<00:01:39.150> stand<00:01:39.450> out

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
detailed and the stripes don't stand out

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
detailed and the stripes don't stand out
too<00:01:39.810> much<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.350> windows<00:01:40.590> aren't<00:01:40.890> quite<00:01:41.220> flush

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
too much the windows aren't quite flush

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.710 
too much the windows aren't quite flush
with<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> edge<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> car<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> think

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
with the edge of the car but I think

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.749 
with the edge of the car but I think
that's<00:01:43.170> probably<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.829> probably<00:01:44.579> looks

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that's probably that probably looks

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.020 
that's probably that probably looks
right<00:01:45.000> for<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> prototype<00:01:45.990> or<00:01:46.350> something

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
right for the prototype or something

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.780 
York Central I'm showing you this
largely<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.420> kind<00:02:16.750> of<00:02:16.870> compare<00:02:17.799> the<00:02:17.980> style<00:02:18.519> of

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
largely to kind of compare the style of

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.270 
largely to kind of compare the style of
streamlining<00:02:19.590> which<00:02:20.590> is<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.709> very<00:02:20.859> different

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
streamlining which is a very different

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.940 
streamlining which is a very different
style<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.609> streamlining<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.469> nrm<00:02:23.469> in<00:02:23.620> York

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
style of streamlining the nrm in York

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.009 
style of streamlining the nrm in York
consider<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.549> be<00:02:24.579> a<00:02:24.700> more<00:02:25.599> complete

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
consider it to be a more complete

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.869 
consider it to be a more complete
version<00:02:26.260> of<00:02:26.439> streamlining<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.579> mean<00:02:27.730> it's

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
version of streamlining I mean it's

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.660 
version of streamlining I mean it's
obviously<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.239> more<00:02:28.659> smooth<00:02:28.989> shape<00:02:29.670> compared

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
obviously a more smooth shape compared

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.280 
obviously a more smooth shape compared
to<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.849> American<00:02:31.269> locomotive<00:02:31.780> -<00:02:31.959> it's<00:02:32.109> right

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
to the American locomotive - it's right

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.670 
to the American locomotive - it's right
here<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:34.090> Cumbria<00:02:34.870> this<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.500> real

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
here it is in Cumbria this is the real

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.069 
here it is in Cumbria this is the real
one<00:02:35.920> there's<00:02:36.639> a<00:02:36.700> painting<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.659> looking

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
one there's a painting of it looking

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.679 
one there's a painting of it looking
like<00:02:38.139> this<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.650> think<00:02:39.060> maybe<00:02:40.060> at<00:02:40.239> this<00:02:40.359> exact

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
like this I think maybe at this exact

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.589 
like this I think maybe at this exact
spot<00:02:40.810> here's<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.980> interior<00:02:42.489> of<00:02:43.239> one<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.510> the

spot here's the interior of one of the

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.240 
spot here's the interior of one of the
cars<00:02:43.810> which<00:02:44.079> obviously<00:02:44.319> looks<00:02:44.439> really<00:02:44.799> fancy

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
cars which obviously looks really fancy

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.940 
cars which obviously looks really fancy

there's two examples of a type of
streamlining<00:03:10.209> which<00:03:10.419> is<00:03:10.569> really<00:03:11.019> quite

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
streamlining which is really quite

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
package you get a little certificate

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.710 
package you get a little certificate
song<00:03:26.979> it<00:03:27.220> was<00:03:27.340> like<00:03:27.519> giving<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.090> certificates

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720

even<00:03:29.470> though<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.769> wonder<00:03:30.430> whether<00:03:30.639> people

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
even though I wonder whether people

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.399 
even though I wonder whether people
frame<00:03:31.329> them<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.689> put<00:03:31.840> them<00:03:31.900> on<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.109> wall<00:03:32.290> or

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
frame them and put them on the wall or

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.369 
frame them and put them on the wall or
whatever<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:34.090> doubt<00:03:34.599> that<00:03:34.810> they're<00:03:34.989> really

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
whatever I doubt that they're really

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.800 
whatever I doubt that they're really
used<00:03:35.650> for<00:03:35.829> that<00:03:35.979> you<00:03:36.909> get<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.030> nice<00:03:37.239> view<00:03:37.269> of<00:03:37.540> how

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
used for that you get a nice view of how

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.960 
used for that you get a nice view of how
the<00:03:37.870> paint<00:03:38.680> job<00:03:38.949> has<00:03:39.040> been<00:03:39.189> picked<00:03:39.459> out<00:03:39.609> here

those rivets really look great

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.599 
those rivets really look great
especially<00:03:44.259> when<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.739> get<00:03:44.859> really<00:03:45.159> up<00:03:45.310> close

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
especially when you get really up close

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.550 
especially when you get really up close
like<00:03:45.819> just<00:03:46.060> here<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.329> can<00:03:46.479> see<00:03:46.659> how<00:03:46.810> the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
like just here you can see how the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.949 
like just here you can see how the
nameplates<00:03:48.400> been<00:03:48.609> done<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:49.569> even<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.900> you

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
nameplates been done and even that you

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.300 
nameplates been done and even that you
get<00:03:50.169> the<00:03:50.259> builders<00:03:50.620> plate<00:03:50.829> look<00:03:50.979> at<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.189> you

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
get the builders plate look at that you

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.149 
get the builders plate look at that you
can<00:03:51.459> see<00:03:51.669> the<00:03:51.790> builders<00:03:52.120> play<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:53.590> says<00:03:53.799> LM<00:03:54.040> s

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
can see the builders play it says LM s

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.719 
can see the builders play it says LM s
crew

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
crew

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.240 
crew
there's<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:55.959> linkages<00:03:56.590> those<00:03:56.919> can<00:03:57.129> be<00:03:57.220> a

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
there's the linkages those can be a

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.830 
there's the linkages those can be a
nightmare<00:03:57.519> so<00:03:57.879> don't<00:03:58.090> try<00:03:58.479> and<00:03:58.509> take<00:03:58.689> them

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
nightmare so don't try and take them

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.399 
nightmare so don't try and take them
apart<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.199> fix<00:03:59.439> them<00:03:59.590> or<00:03:59.709> anything<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:01.409> really

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
apart and fix them or anything I really

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.749 
apart and fix them or anything I really
like<00:04:02.530> all<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.799> little<00:04:02.919> grab<00:04:03.250> irons<00:04:03.579> and

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:03.759 
like all the little grab irons and

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.360 
like all the little grab irons and
handrails<00:04:04.659> just<00:04:05.560> above<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.859> buffers<00:04:06.189> there

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
handrails just above the buffers there

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.129 
handrails just above the buffers there
you<00:04:06.489> can<00:04:06.639> actually<00:04:06.759> fit<00:04:07.090> little<00:04:07.299> lights<00:04:07.810> and

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
you can actually fit little lights and

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.509 
you can actually fit little lights and
so<00:04:08.290> on<00:04:08.319> there<00:04:08.620> might<00:04:08.769> be<00:04:08.799> a<00:04:08.889> way<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.099> get<00:04:09.340> them

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
so on there might be a way to get them

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.849 
so on there might be a way to get them
lit<00:04:10.060> up<00:04:10.269> I<00:04:10.449> don't<00:04:10.629> know<00:04:10.720> about<00:04:10.870> that<00:04:11.139> be<00:04:11.560> fun<00:04:11.739> to

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
lit up I don't know about that be fun to

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:16.860 
lit up I don't know about that be fun to
do<00:04:13.889> so<00:04:14.889> yeah<00:04:15.099> the<00:04:15.879> wheel<00:04:16.150> color<00:04:16.539> is<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.720> bit

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
do so yeah the wheel color is a bit

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.229 
do so yeah the wheel color is a bit
weird<00:04:17.259> I<00:04:17.530> think<00:04:17.590> it's<00:04:17.979> slightly<00:04:18.310> more<00:04:18.639> blue

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
weird I think it's slightly more blue

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.570 
weird I think it's slightly more blue
than<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.659> rest<00:04:19.900> of<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.049> shell<00:04:20.259> which<00:04:20.500> kind

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
than the rest of the shell which kind

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.010 
than the rest of the shell which kind
in<00:04:21.670> a<00:04:21.760> weird<00:04:21.970> way<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.300> don't<00:04:22.570> mind<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:22.870> much

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
in a weird way I don't mind it that much

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.150 
in a weird way I don't mind it that much
but<00:04:23.410> it<00:04:23.650> sticks<00:04:24.070> out<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:26.260> LMS<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.830> tender

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
but it sticks out the LMS and the tender

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160 
but it sticks out the LMS and the tender
is<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.310> really<00:04:27.790> nice<00:04:27.970> touch<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.540> really<00:04:28.960> like

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
is a really nice touch I really like

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.440 
is a really nice touch I really like
that<00:04:29.260> way<00:04:29.350> that's<00:04:29.530> been<00:04:29.770> done<00:04:30.180> you<00:04:31.180> can<00:04:31.330> just

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
that way that's been done you can just

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.970 
that way that's been done you can just
about<00:04:31.510> make<00:04:31.750> out<00:04:31.930> there's<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.500> builder's<00:04:32.770> plate

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
about make out there's a builder's plate

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.780 
about make out there's a builder's plate
on<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.190> very<00:04:33.370> back<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.730> tender<00:04:34.150> as<00:04:34.270> well

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
on the very back of the tender as well

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.700 
on the very back of the tender as well
which<00:04:36.790> is<00:04:36.940> nice<00:04:37.090> anyway<00:04:38.020> we'll<00:04:38.290> get<00:04:38.410> to<00:04:38.560> some

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
which is nice anyway we'll get to some

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.120 
which is nice anyway we'll get to some
running<00:04:39.130> videos<00:04:39.430> now<00:04:39.640> finally<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:44.110> yeah<00:04:44.350> it's

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
running videos now finally so yeah it's

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.010 
running videos now finally so yeah it's
a<00:04:45.220> very<00:04:45.430> nice<00:04:45.580> locomotive<00:04:46.450> runs<00:04:46.810> very

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
a very nice locomotive runs very

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.710 
a very nice locomotive runs very
smoothly<00:04:47.380> as<00:04:47.650> you'd<00:04:47.830> expect<00:04:48.480> it's<00:04:49.480> quite

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
smoothly as you'd expect it's quite

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.120 
smoothly as you'd expect it's quite
strong<00:04:49.990> though<00:04:50.170> I<00:04:50.200> wouldn't<00:04:50.530> advise<00:04:50.770> running

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
strong though I wouldn't advise running

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.860 
strong though I wouldn't advise running
more<00:04:51.250> than<00:04:51.310> six<00:04:51.700> cars<00:04:51.970> with<00:04:52.240> it<00:04:52.360> it<00:04:52.630> would

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
more than six cars with it it would

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.810 
more than six cars with it it would
probably<00:04:53.140> have<00:04:54.010> some<00:04:54.190> thought<00:04:54.340> laughter<00:04:54.580> that

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
probably have some thought laughter that

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.640 
probably have some thought laughter that
I<00:04:56.970> don't<00:04:57.970> have<00:04:58.450> this<00:04:58.570> one<00:04:58.810> over<00:04:59.050> with<00:04:59.410> me<00:04:59.560> in

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
I don't have this one over with me in

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.740 
I don't have this one over with me in
the<00:04:59.770> US<00:05:00.040> which<00:05:00.280> is<00:05:00.310> why<00:05:00.550> I'm<00:05:00.670> doing<00:05:00.700> this<00:05:01.000> video

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
the US which is why I'm doing this video

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.930 
the US which is why I'm doing this video
with<00:05:02.140> some<00:05:02.530> Oh<00:05:03.870> which<00:05:04.870> I<00:05:05.020> will<00:05:05.230> probably<00:05:05.950> I'll

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
with some Oh which I will probably I'll

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.760 
with some Oh which I will probably I'll
probably<00:05:07.150> do<00:05:07.360> another<00:05:07.390> version<00:05:07.900> once<00:05:08.290> once<00:05:08.620> I

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
probably do another version once once I

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.130 
probably do another version once once I
get<00:05:08.920> over<00:05:09.160> here<00:05:09.310> with<00:05:09.460> me<00:05:09.780> here's<00:05:10.780> some<00:05:10.930> very

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
get over here with me here's some very

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.750 
get over here with me here's some very
old<00:05:11.200> footage<00:05:11.620> from<00:05:11.800> my<00:05:12.010> old<00:05:12.190> lamp<00:05:12.520> on<00:05:12.730> the

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
old footage from my old lamp on the

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.360 
old footage from my old lamp on the
garage<00:05:13.000> my<00:05:13.900> parents<00:05:14.290> know<00:05:14.410> this<00:05:15.160> has

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
garage my parents know this has

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.130 
garage my parents know this has
unfortunately<00:05:15.700> had<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.150> all<00:05:16.540> be<00:05:16.570> dismantled

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
unfortunately had to all be dismantled

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.170 
unfortunately had to all be dismantled
on<00:05:17.470> account<00:05:17.770> of<00:05:17.890> my<00:05:18.040> not<00:05:18.400> going<00:05:18.610> to<00:05:18.700> be<00:05:18.790> living

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
on account of my not going to be living

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.560 
on account of my not going to be living
there<00:05:19.420> anymore<00:05:20.970> but<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.030> had<00:05:22.150> a<00:05:22.180> great<00:05:22.390> time

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
there anymore but I had a great time

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.500 
there anymore but I had a great time
with<00:05:22.750> it<00:05:22.840> and<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.710> would<00:05:24.550> probably<00:05:24.790> build<00:05:25.330> a

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
with it and I would probably build a

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.540 
with it and I would probably build a
more<00:05:25.780> detailed<00:05:26.200> one<00:05:26.410> at<00:05:26.560> some<00:05:26.680> point<00:05:26.950> I<00:05:27.160> really

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
more detailed one at some point I really

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.680 
more detailed one at some point I really
didn't<00:05:27.700> get<00:05:27.820> very<00:05:27.910> far<00:05:28.000> with<00:05:28.360> this<00:05:28.510> one<00:05:28.660> I

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
didn't get very far with this one I

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.910 
didn't get very far with this one I
really<00:05:29.020> did

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:43.160 

I<00:05:35.010> really<00:05:35.670> like<00:05:35.820> doing<00:05:36.120> shots<00:05:42.080> there's<00:05:43.080> a

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
I really like doing shots there's a

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.900 
I really like doing shots there's a
small<00:05:43.440> amount<00:05:43.470> of<00:05:43.770> noise<00:05:43.950> from<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.520> linkages

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
small amount of noise from the linkages

I think I did actually fix that though I

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460

on<00:05:50.730> something<00:05:51.090> you<00:05:51.960> sometimes<00:05:52.290> need<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:52.500> do

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
on something you sometimes need to do

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.960 
on something you sometimes need to do
that<00:05:52.800> with<00:05:52.920> these<00:05:53.010> zombie<00:05:53.340> locomotives<00:05:53.880> they

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
that with these zombie locomotives they

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:03.890 
that with these zombie locomotives they
sometimes<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.740> bit<00:05:55.740> too<00:05:55.770> loose<00:06:02.720> there<00:06:03.720> it<00:06:03.810> is

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
sometimes a bit too loose there it is

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:11.189 
sometimes a bit too loose there it is
really<00:06:04.560> eclectic<00:06:04.860> mix<00:06:05.370> of<00:06:05.490> other<00:06:05.670> trains

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.860 

the<00:06:11.740> other<00:06:11.860> coaches<00:06:12.219> run<00:06:12.400> really<00:06:12.639> nicely<00:06:12.819> -<00:06:13.240> it

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
the other coaches run really nicely - it

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.149 
the other coaches run really nicely - it
would<00:06:14.020> be<00:06:14.050> fun<00:06:14.139> to<00:06:14.319> try<00:06:14.560> and<00:06:14.680> like<00:06:14.800> those<00:06:14.949> up

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
would be fun to try and like those up

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:16.559 
would be fun to try and like those up
and<00:06:15.340> see<00:06:15.460> if<00:06:15.550> we<00:06:15.580> could<00:06:15.789> get<00:06:15.909> some<00:06:16.150> figures<00:06:16.539> in

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.569 
and see if we could get some figures in

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.830 
and see if we could get some figures in
stories<00:06:17.110> on<00:06:17.379> I<00:06:18.330> think<00:06:19.330> there's<00:06:19.599> a<00:06:19.689> little

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
stories on I think there's a little

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.959 
stories on I think there's a little
braid<00:06:20.080> so<00:06:20.740> it's<00:06:21.039> more<00:06:21.249> difficult<00:06:21.639> to<00:06:21.699> do<00:06:21.819> with

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
braid so it's more difficult to do with

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.619 
braid so it's more difficult to do with
English<00:06:22.169> things<00:06:23.169> with<00:06:23.710> American<00:06:24.129> sometimes

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
English things with American sometimes

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:33.220 
English things with American sometimes
some<00:06:25.629> of<00:06:25.689> the<00:06:25.749> Americans<00:06:26.110> on<00:06:26.229> that's<00:06:26.379> built<00:06:26.590> in

recommend<00:06:40.320> it<00:06:40.560> it<00:06:41.010> can<00:06:41.430> be<00:06:41.520> tough<00:06:41.700> to<00:06:41.820> find

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
recommend it it can be tough to find

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.850 
recommend it it can be tough to find
