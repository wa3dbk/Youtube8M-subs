00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.760
 environmentally friendly euro 6 diesel engines 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.679
 technologically merged 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.170
 new in the bus is the use of the 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:42.540
 additional supplies set blood to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.580
 nitrogen oxide reduction 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.980
 the tank sizes for the non-toxic and 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.230
 harmless urea solution are on 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.640
 The diesel tank volume is tuned 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.410
 the mature emma in 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.570
 Engine technology with common rail 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.230
 injection controlled exhaust gas recirculation 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.960
 agr and two-stage turbo-charging with 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.650

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.230
 new scr t system added 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.290
 the scr t system is in two-stage 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.730
 exhaust silencer housed 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.420
 it is made up of the closed 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.480
 particle filter system crt stands for 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.460
 continuously generating trap 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.490
 continuously regenerable 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.940
 filter system and the downstream 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.470
 scr catalysts together 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.600
 the electronic monitoring of the 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.570
 particulate filter shows when needed the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.490
 need for cleaning 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.580
 the sections of the particle filter 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.850
 reaches up to 99 percent 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.110
 the oxidation of the filter material 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.110
 retained soot particles too 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.080
 gaseous carbon dioxide regenerates the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.490
 system continuously 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.110
 the particle filter is therefore 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.110
 largely low maintenance 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.829
 Right handover of urea solution 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.070

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.620
 the ammonia blocking catalyst 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.080
 prevents the exit of the 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.010
