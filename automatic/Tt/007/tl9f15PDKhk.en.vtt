serum design a shirt it sort of give us
a<00:00:20.460> little<00:00:20.609> demo<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.029> how<00:00:21.300> they<00:00:21.449> work<00:00:21.630> yeah

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
a little demo of how they work yeah

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.230 
a little demo of how they work yeah
absolutely<00:00:22.260> what<00:00:23.010> happens<00:00:23.460> when<00:00:23.670> she<00:00:23.850> strums

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
absolutely what happens when she strums

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.830 
absolutely what happens when she strums
is<00:00:24.740> they're<00:00:25.740> all<00:00:26.070> based<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.820> center<00:00:27.269> section

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
is they're all based on a center section

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.830 
is they're all based on a center section
so<00:00:28.500> they're<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.279> same<00:00:29.310> exact<00:00:30.090> three-inch

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
so they're all the same exact three-inch

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.260 
so they're all the same exact three-inch
center<00:00:31.439> section<00:00:31.920> combined<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.880> different

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
center section combined with different

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.000 
center section combined with different
materials<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.829> all<00:00:34.980> have

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
materials and they all have

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.729 
materials and they all have
interchangeable<00:00:35.790> edges<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.600> they<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.590> have

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
interchangeable edges and they all have

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.840 
interchangeable edges and they all have
interlocking<00:00:38.180> indexes<00:00:39.180> which<00:00:39.440> line<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.850> the

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
interlocking indexes which line up the

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.119 
interlocking indexes which line up the
top<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.540> bottom<00:00:42.780> edges<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> snare<00:00:43.860> wires

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
top and bottom edges so the snare wires

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.770 
top and bottom edges so the snare wires
align<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.820> everything<00:00:45.270> aligns<00:00:45.600> perfectly

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
align and everything aligns perfectly

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.650 
align and everything aligns perfectly
each<00:00:46.379> time<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:47.550> happens<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.149> you're<00:00:48.300> able<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
each time what happens is you're able to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.939 
each time what happens is you're able to
go<00:00:48.840> from<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.879> five<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.149> half<00:00:51.289> to<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> six<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.890> a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
go from a five and a half to a six and a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.209 
go from a five and a half to a six and a
half<00:00:53.000> to<00:00:54.000> an<00:00:54.149> eight<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.469> can<00:00:55.620> change<00:00:55.920> all

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
half to an eight and you can change all

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.400 
half to an eight and you can change all
materials<00:00:56.969> from<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> center<00:00:57.629> section<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
materials from the center section to the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.760 
materials from the center section to the
edges<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.640> what<00:00:59.789> we're<00:00:59.969> doing<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.480> got<00:01:00.770> 10

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
edges so what we're doing is we got 10

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.710 
edges so what we're doing is we got 10
and<00:01:02.100> 15<00:01:02.789> ply<00:01:03.030> Keller<00:01:03.449> edges<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.070> also<00:01:05.720> step

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
and 15 ply Keller edges and we also step

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.990 
and 15 ply Keller edges and we also step
it<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:06.960> from<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.590> Keller<00:01:07.830> center<00:01:08.280> section<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
it up from the Keller center section to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.050 
it up from the Keller center section to
a<00:01:09.030> brushed<00:01:09.450> stainless<00:01:10.490> 16<00:01:11.490> gauge<00:01:11.700> stainless

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
a brushed stainless 16 gauge stainless

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.620 
a brushed stainless 16 gauge stainless
steel<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.810> then<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.400> also<00:01:14.580> move<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
steel and then we also move up to a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.109 
steel and then we also move up to a
polished<00:01:16.170> stainless<00:01:16.680> center<00:01:16.979> section<00:01:17.490> with

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
polished stainless center section with

solid<00:01:18.810> bird's<00:01:19.049> eye<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.680> then<00:01:20.610> even<00:01:20.759> from

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
solid bird's eye and then even from

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.990 
solid bird's eye and then even from
there<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.509> go<00:01:21.659> step<00:01:21.930> further<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.000> using

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
there we go step further and go to using

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.450 
there we go step further and go to using
a<00:01:24.090> copper<00:01:24.509> center<00:01:24.840> section<00:01:25.290> give<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.280> lot

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
a copper center section give it a lot

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.600 
a copper center section give it a lot
more<00:01:26.670> warmth<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.619> went<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> state

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
more warmth and we went to a state

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.690 
more warmth and we went to a state
walnut<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.570> half<00:01:30.930> inch<00:01:31.170> state<00:01:31.470> walnuts<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
we try to move it into an area where

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.709 
we try to move it into an area where
just<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.170> one<00:01:44.439> particular<00:01:44.799> drum<00:01:45.369> is<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.149> reason

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
just the one particular drum is a reason

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.779 
just the one particular drum is a reason
for<00:01:46.750> buying<00:01:47.109> it<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:47.740> then<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.039> benefit<00:01:48.579> of

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
for buying it and then the benefit of

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.179 
for buying it and then the benefit of
changing<00:01:49.359> it<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:49.869> just<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.289> plus<00:01:50.499> at<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:50.890> end

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
changing it is just a plus at the end

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.639 
changing it is just a plus at the end
the<00:01:51.369> future<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.909> drum<00:01:52.299> could<00:01:52.719> go<00:01:52.929> on<00:01:53.140> you

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
the future of the drum could go on you

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.059 
the future of the drum could go on you
know<00:01:53.799> however<00:01:53.979> long<00:01:54.250> one<00:01:54.789> and<00:01:55.630> we<00:01:55.810> also<00:01:56.069> want

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
know however long one and we also want
