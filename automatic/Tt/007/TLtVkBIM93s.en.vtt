same thing inside the packaging is

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.120 
same thing inside the packaging is
nothing<00:00:27.480> other<00:00:27.720> than<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> case<00:00:28.289> itself<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
nothing other than the case itself and

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.269 
nothing other than the case itself and
here<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:31.019> way<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.349> case<00:00:31.679> operates

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
here it is so the way this case operates

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.360 
here it is so the way this case operates
is<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> hard<00:00:33.210> exterior<00:00:33.690> plastic<00:00:34.590> shell<00:00:34.829> that

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
is a hard exterior plastic shell that

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.490 
is a hard exterior plastic shell that
has<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> matte<00:00:35.910> coating<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:37.110> has

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
has a matte coating and then has

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.350 
has a matte coating and then has
perforations<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.670> I'm<00:00:38.820> not<00:00:38.940> sure<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.239> can

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
perforations and I'm not sure if you can

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.389 
perforations and I'm not sure if you can
make<00:00:39.540> those<00:00:39.690> out<00:00:39.960> there<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.320> go<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:41.100> match

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
make those out there you go that match

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.940 
make those out there you go that match
the<00:00:41.820> perforations<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.870> back<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> s5

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the perforations on the back of the s5

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
the perforations on the back of the s5
so<00:00:44.219> let<00:00:44.340> me<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.520> bring<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.820> minus<00:00:45.090> 5<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.960> can

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
so let me just bring in minus 5 you can

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.260 
so let me just bring in minus 5 you can
see<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.469> hold<00:00:46.620> them<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.829> side-by-side<00:00:47.270> see

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
see if I hold them up side-by-side see

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.900 
see if I hold them up side-by-side see
the<00:00:48.390> perforations<00:00:48.809> match<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.670> hard

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the perforations match up so that hard

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970 
the perforations match up so that hard
shell<00:00:51.210> again<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.690> Matt<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.379> not<00:00:52.530> slippery

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
shell again is Matt so it's not slippery

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.340 
shell again is Matt so it's not slippery
the<00:00:53.579> inside<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.149> TPU<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.079> has<00:00:55.199> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
the inside is TPU and then it has this

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.920 
the inside is TPU and then it has this
spiderweb<00:00:56.010> style<00:00:56.789> design<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.510> shock

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
spiderweb style design for shock

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.250 
spiderweb style design for shock
absorption<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> let<00:00:59.640> me<00:00:59.670> slip<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> s5<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.960> here

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
absorption so let me slip the s5 in here

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.950 
absorption so let me slip the s5 in here
and<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.120> kind<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.359> mashing<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and you do so we just kind of mashing it

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.560 
and you do so we just kind of mashing it
in<00:01:04.080> place<00:01:04.519> like<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.640> would<00:01:05.820> any<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.270> piece

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
in place like you would any one piece

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.620 
in place like you would any one piece
case<00:01:06.900> i<00:01:07.170> guess<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:08.340> very<00:01:08.580> tight<00:01:08.820> fit<00:01:09.090> so

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
case i guess it's very tight fit so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.330 
case i guess it's very tight fit so
you're<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.110> take<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.439> time<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.650> pop<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.250> in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
you're just take your time and pop it in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
you're just take your time and pop it in
place<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.110> installed

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
place like so and there it is installed

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.020 
place like so and there it is installed
now<00:01:13.740> while<00:01:13.950> we're<00:01:14.100> looking<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> front<00:01:14.820> i

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
now while we're looking at the front i

will point out that you do get some lay
on<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> table<00:01:17.070> protection<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
on the table protection with this the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.940 
on the table protection with this the
lip<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> case<00:01:18.869> comes<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:19.380> higher<00:01:19.590> than<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
lip of the case comes up higher than the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.370 
lip of the case comes up higher than the
glass<00:01:20.130> screen<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.020> put<00:01:22.229> this
