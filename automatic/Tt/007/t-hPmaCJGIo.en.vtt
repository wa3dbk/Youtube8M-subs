00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
and I actually noticed that a lot more I

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.600 
and I actually noticed that a lot more I
using<00:02:18.410> was<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> right<00:02:18.740> forward<00:02:19.070> before<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:19.490> that

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
using was a right forward before so that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.130 
using was a right forward before so that
means<00:02:19.790> when<00:02:19.940> Lavezzi<00:02:20.630> on<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.780> left-hand<00:02:21.110> side
