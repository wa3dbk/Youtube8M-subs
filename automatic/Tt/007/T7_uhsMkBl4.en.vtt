00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.789
 Hello everyone yard with you and today in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.369
 heading master we have t18 this 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.590
 American pt 2 levels are very cheerful 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.119
 very interesting machine which 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.210
 allows us to roll it in two 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.939
 trim it good speed 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.189
 gun reload there I don't remember which 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.920
 just a long time ago he didn’t roll it, but something 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.840
 probably about two seconds there that is 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.300
 opportunity to play keep the opponent on 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.610
 gusle and the second version 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.149
 it is a high-explosive weapon which even 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.700
 land mine rides quite well 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.399
 this fight is very similar to that fight in 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.329
 which I took the master on t82 is 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.850
 The following Fri-shka after that and took was on 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.199
 same map in the same place for that is 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.760
 in the gut in a banana 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.700
 I really had them from this 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.700
 fun and funny but here I have a frag 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.299
 the ambassador is very unpleasant 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.580
 but oh well what good is this gun so that 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.920
 it has the speed'll be able to have some 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.960
 no armor really here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.640
 machine gunners she saves us to the extreme 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.340
 least density kill not all and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.350
 pretty bad if all the case back 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.840
 when there will retreat that very 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 it will be hard to pierce you like a second 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.710
 level so even some third well 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.820
 understandably something will go to the fourth 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.320
 then anyone who punishes you at all 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.630
 actually I can see that I got up so 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.970
 I am sticking out only the upper part of the cabin 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.040
 this part of the cabin is quite hard to break through 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.470
 unless of course you aim and here 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.090
 quietly shooting note bombs then 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.549
 there is to multi you are not needed here 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.140
 so very much 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.470
 firstly because the cumulative projectile 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.980
 deals less damage than a high explosive 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.420
 382 plus 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.240
 after all, it is actually a fugassnit 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.840
 normally breaks therefore there is nothing 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.369
 bad ride on his chest mine 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.480
 here it was very unpleasant that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.340
 I ransom for 17 tried to pick me up 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.230
 swirl as you can see I broke a couple 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.610
 since I can’t say it all in the forehead but still 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.620
 struck but nevertheless I saw that there is 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.350
 opportunity to push there is an opportunity 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.120
 go kill the enemy realizing that 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.410
 I will not get an answer to the pair, therefore 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.180
 went especially not straining here was 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.310
 cumulative shot I'm so clean 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.560
 let's experiment took it and apparently 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.709
 the damage takes place at the cumulative is not so 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.310
 very much so it's easier to shoot 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.370
 land mines actually no special 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.040
 meaning so bush is strong in the head 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.190
 so ride the cumulative hanoi with 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.470
 it is interesting to them how the fight goes by 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.800
 same rst system and warrior t82 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.930
 I Sasha just go and shoot and nothing 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.500
 no one with me no one can me 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.930
 prevent 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.970
 here I, unlike t82 what 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.720
 I have no armor and a gun 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.260
 good here is the control of light from 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.640
 window probably wanted to bum on 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.650
 this tank that I killed but LTP 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.470
 board naturally exploded through a mine 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.790
 naturally died and I notice that I have 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.410
 five frags need to choose a master 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.950
 it would be necessary to shoot even more 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.079
 take a warrior and see that a bunch of tanks 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.530
 the enemy shone on the mountain 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.860
 and since we have left on the mountain it means not 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.989
 I have to go, sorry 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.810
 head when I went to them very much 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.310
 I wanted to take a warrior, I really forgot 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.560
 at the moment that I am on this handouts 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.750
 there is no master despite the fact that I skated 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.430
 then on her a certain number of battles I have 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.240
 there was only 1 class master and not 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.460
 it was his boilers there so 1 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.200
 a certain amount of time before his bow 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.690
 take off but I did not take on her master and here 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.060
 now very stupid me here planted 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.400
 LTP hat was hoping for his gazku to 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.420
 sorry my shell relief that's it here 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.780
 incomprehensible pucci 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.320
 winter debris and other things and not in 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.320
 hit 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.260
 it was cumulative to the roof of the tower even there 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.550
 how to turn off 36 ron he was surely 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.080
 inflicted and I would kill him would take a warrior and 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.200
 I would be even more happy but unfortunately 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.170
 very Potapova Odessa , however, died 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.210
 I did the right amount of damage. 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.700
 I earned the number of frags plus ours 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.040
 took the base for which they, too, could praise 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.500
 would not take could go finish off like 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.330
 it often happens and eventually lose by 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.730
 capture though the card is quite small 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.610
 here you have time to get to the enemy base 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.490
 to be more precise up to a hundred base so 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.740
 capture but still very interesting 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.410
 the machine is very fast for the unhappy fight 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.180
 if not to get to the province map 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.120
 I don’t like a province map for this one 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.060
 vigorous tank standing because all 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.010
 are not afraid to leave someone because 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.280
 that immediately glows immediately gets a bunch 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.620
 damage and die and so very cheerfully 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.500
 very fun and as you see on land mines I 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.390
 took the master without much 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.950
 no teeth problems thanks to all who 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.630
 watched subscribe to my channel 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.280
 put likes write comments 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.950
 and if you still want short 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.440
 happy videos then write this in 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.440
 good luck everyone
