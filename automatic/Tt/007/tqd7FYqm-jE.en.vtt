00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
been through that the things that have

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.240 
been through that the things that have
changed<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.390> it's<00:02:12.540> particularly<00:02:13.020> odd<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:14.040> he

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
changed so it's particularly odd that he

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.890 
changed so it's particularly odd that he
would<00:02:14.280> make<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.850> statement<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.570> that's<00:02:15.780> how<00:02:15.870> he

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
would make a statement and that's how he

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.240 
would make a statement and that's how he
came<00:02:16.110> across<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.590> me<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.800> was<00:02:16.860> actually<00:02:17.220> very

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
came across to me it was actually very

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.890 
came across to me it was actually very
disappointing<00:02:18.000> because<00:02:18.150> unfortunately<00:02:18.420> we

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
going to be a

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.119 
going to be a
media<00:04:09.420> problem<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.170> know<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.319> mean<00:04:10.560> but<00:04:10.920> yet

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
deal and that's it but the reason it's

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.870 
deal and that's it but the reason it's
it's<00:04:40.139> grating<00:04:40.770> for<00:04:40.949> me<00:04:41.100> still<00:04:41.370> is<00:04:41.550> because

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
it's grating for me still is because

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.879 
it's grating for me still is because
look<00:04:42.060> at<00:04:42.180> he's<00:04:42.690> in<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:42.990> position<00:04:43.200> where<00:04:43.590> he

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
look at he's in that position where he

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.830 
look at he's in that position where he
knows<00:04:44.220> that<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.910> attention<00:04:45.360> is<00:04:45.450> often

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
knows that the attention is often

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.500 
knows that the attention is often
focused<00:04:46.229> not<00:04:46.590> on<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.830> game<00:04:47.190> but<00:04:47.820> on<00:04:48.060> people's

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
focused not on the game but on people's

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.230 
focused not on the game but on people's
personal<00:04:48.900> lives<00:04:48.960> or<00:04:49.470> race<00:04:49.710> or<00:04:50.040> or<00:04:50.280> sexual

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
orientation so instead instead of with

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.540 
orientation so instead instead of with
using<00:04:54.210> that<00:04:54.300> awareness<00:04:54.540> to<00:04:55.020> not<00:04:55.590> channel<00:04:56.430> the

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
using that awareness to not channel the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.280 
using that awareness to not channel the
focus<00:04:56.880> in<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.060> direction<00:04:57.479> that's<00:04:57.990> exactly
