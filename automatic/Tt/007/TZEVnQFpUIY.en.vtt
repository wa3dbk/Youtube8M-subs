00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.700
 hello to all and all those killing 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.500
 nine times this so 9 x 7 for the 63 on 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.629
 will present you a little video ac 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.940
 on ps3 I'm in the company of 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.400
 sniper 63 it's all so like you 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.110
 said mr tyrosse 9 owns one goes 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.290
 present a video on acts 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.720
 blackhawks 2 very helpful and who goes in 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.210
 to interest more than one I'm sure so 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.040
 you need two controllers a 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.350
 master prestige tale or tale 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.020
 prestige as you want and you have 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.850
 need in our account 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.320
 that's what good and normal the collar so 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.729
 in fact it is a duplication of the account 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.600
 we're actually going to copy 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.690
 stick of account and so we will do 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.710
 so videos every two weeks 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.979
 from Saturday 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.190
 so it will not necessarily be on the call 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.770
 of duty so or ps3 it will not be 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.289
 necessarily on ps3 or xbox it will be possible 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.179
 to be for pc so for example if the mac 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.860
 have you been taught how the 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.200
 crack and that's for example or others 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.060
 videos we will have that we have 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.100
 dickie we will do 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.930
 so mud start the game and you 're 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.180
 you spent all his cutscenes the 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.159
 sequel no has not finally passed for 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.450
 to show you because we took a 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.490
 new account and so again and one 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.049
 try to do like that so the for this 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.000
 taste for that it does not necessarily 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:02:01.390
 see a jailbroken ps3 or patch or 2 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.119
 ps3 it takes just two wii levers 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.950
 because single file to single file that is 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.290
 very very simple seen as you go 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.019
 see how are we going to show you against 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.940
 the division and all that so as you 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.860
 said mr shooter we will make videos 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.549
 every Saturday but if there are times 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.590
 no video 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.810
 well then 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.519
 and on Saturdays you will excuse us but 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.580
 normally it will be good every hundred 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.040
 the start and you go on my little 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.930
 player aulas us that that makes the other 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.349
 of departure so that entrusts on everything 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.099
 the screen 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:38.200
 so there you take multiplayer you 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:43.480
 wait but the lobby is really very 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:47.140
 very simple there is that it takes two 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.980
 minutes in fact so there you take 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.980
 To play online 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.890
 no need for parties the local double 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.269
 that it serves just understand party 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.220
 which to play online 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.010
 there you do understand you spend the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.170
 messages of the day yeah that's so after 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.239
 with your second joystick you will 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.160
 connect and you do you put the 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.650
 seals time after termites and you 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.620
 go on shop with the second 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.629
 course joystick there we go a little 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.849
 career to show you that he 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.530
 is level 1 but level there so there 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.150
 I miss my career 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.290
 we see a little emblem not title a 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.530
 few fight reports so here after 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.350
 with the second controller you're here 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.750
 double click on with cross made 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.579
 double click on shop with the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.829
 second joystick is directly with the 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.590
 first controller you will celebrate that 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.389
 will you put on the main menu that you 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.310
 put you profile was disconnected 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.750
 finally here is after you made believe with 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.519
 the first controller and you take the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.959
 account you want who already has a 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.519

 you want who is on your ps3 with 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.560
 the count of it proved useful hour 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.980
 there as you can see another 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.660
 account 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.790
