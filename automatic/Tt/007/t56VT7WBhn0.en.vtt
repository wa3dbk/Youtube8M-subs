00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
so here we are with an S 3 m3

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.480 
so here we are with an S 3 m3
of<00:00:11.019> the<00:00:11.259> motion<00:00:11.740> sensor

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
of the motion sensor

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.839 
of the motion sensor
saf3<00:00:13.450> comes<00:00:14.049> equipped<00:00:14.320> with<00:00:14.440> lot<00:00:14.769> of<00:00:14.849> sensors

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
saf3 comes equipped with lot of sensors

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.390 
saf3 comes equipped with lot of sensors
which<00:00:16.059> allow<00:00:16.299> it<00:00:16.480> to<00:00:16.600> do<00:00:16.900> various<00:00:17.260> tasks<00:00:17.560> so

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
which allow it to do various tasks so

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.220 
which allow it to do various tasks so
let's<00:00:18.700> go<00:00:18.910> through<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.180> list<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:19.840> first<00:00:20.080> is
