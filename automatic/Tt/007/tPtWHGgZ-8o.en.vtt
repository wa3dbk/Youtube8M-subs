same time now these items it was a very
mild<00:04:02.130> smoke<00:04:02.970> situation<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.530> we<00:04:05.069> didn't<00:04:05.280> have

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
mild smoke situation so I we didn't have

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.430 
mild smoke situation so I we didn't have
we<00:04:05.489> did<00:04:05.639> some<00:04:05.850> q-tipping<00:04:06.239> but<00:04:06.569> I<00:04:06.690> did<00:04:06.870> did<00:04:07.410> not

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
we did some q-tipping but I did did not

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.890 
we did some q-tipping but I did did not
have<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:07.950> ultrasonically<00:04:08.880> dip<00:04:09.299> these<00:04:09.510> items

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
have to ultrasonically dip these items

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.379 
have to ultrasonically dip these items
had<00:04:10.530> this<00:04:10.709> been<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:10.950> bad<00:04:11.130> fire<00:04:11.400> or<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.850> medium

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
had this been a bad fire or a medium

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.990 
had this been a bad fire or a medium
smoke<00:04:13.260> damage<00:04:13.799> fire<00:04:13.980> we<00:04:14.760> would<00:04:14.910> have

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
smoke damage fire we would have

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.520 
smoke damage fire we would have
definitely<00:04:15.150> been<00:04:15.450> dipping<00:04:15.870> most<00:04:16.260> of<00:04:16.410> these

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
definitely been dipping most of these

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.960 
definitely been dipping most of these
items<00:04:16.799> in<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.010> ultrasonic<00:04:17.459> machine<00:04:17.729> that<00:04:17.880> we

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
items in the ultrasonic machine that we

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.259 
items in the ultrasonic machine that we
have

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
have

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.039 
have
unit<00:04:18.599> so<00:04:19.049> we<00:04:19.560> would<00:04:19.709> take<00:04:19.859> row<00:04:20.160> by<00:04:20.370> row<00:04:20.609> and

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
unit so we would take row by row and

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.119 
unit so we would take row by row and
remove<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.199> items<00:04:22.440> once<00:04:22.620> they're<00:04:22.740> clean<00:04:22.949> we

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:23.129 
remove the items once they're clean we

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.860 
remove the items once they're clean we
pulled<00:04:23.400> up<00:04:23.490> our<00:04:23.639> picture<00:04:24.030> on<00:04:24.060> our<00:04:24.300> camera<00:04:24.720> and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
pulled up our picture on our camera and

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.430 
pulled up our picture on our camera and
then<00:04:25.020> we<00:04:25.110> would<00:04:25.229> put<00:04:25.440> all<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.370> items<00:04:26.819> back

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
then we would put all of the items back

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.110 
then we would put all of the items back
exactly<00:04:28.440> as<00:04:28.830> they<00:04:29.039> were<00:04:29.099> when<00:04:29.460> we<00:04:29.610> got<00:04:29.819> here

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
and clean but everything looks in place

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.469 
and clean but everything looks in place
so<00:05:18.270> it's<00:05:18.960> like<00:05:19.199> we<00:05:20.129> were<00:05:20.250> here<00:05:20.699> but<00:05:21.210> were<00:05:21.330> they

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
so it's like we were here but were they

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.170 
so it's like we were here but were they
really<00:05:21.509> here<00:05:22.110> you<00:05:22.590> know<00:05:22.710> her<00:05:23.009> home<00:05:23.250> everything

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
really here you know her home everything

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.600 
really here you know her home everything
is<00:05:24.389> laid<00:05:24.719> out<00:05:24.930> exactly<00:05:25.259> as<00:05:25.889> she<00:05:26.190> had<00:05:26.219> it<00:05:26.520> when

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
is laid out exactly as she had it when

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.809 
is laid out exactly as she had it when
she<00:05:26.819> left<00:05:27.030> three<00:05:27.330> days<00:05:27.539> ago<00:05:27.719> and<00:05:28.409> yet<00:05:29.009> it's

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
she left three days ago and yet it's

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.510 
she left three days ago and yet it's
better<00:05:30.120> when<00:05:30.360> she<00:05:30.509> gets<00:05:30.690> back<00:05:30.930> so<00:05:31.830> I<00:05:32.219> think

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
better when she gets back so I think

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.640 
better when she gets back so I think
that<00:05:32.969> it's<00:05:33.150> very<00:05:33.210> key<00:05:33.719> that<00:05:34.590> our<00:05:35.509> homeowners

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
that it's very key that our homeowners

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.689 
that it's very key that our homeowners
like<00:05:37.650> they<00:05:37.830> can<00:05:37.979> tell<00:05:38.159> we've<00:05:38.310> been<00:05:38.460> here

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
like they can tell we've been here

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.350 
like they can tell we've been here
obviously<00:05:39.419> are<00:05:40.190> the<00:05:41.190> effects<00:05:41.520> of<00:05:41.789> us<00:05:42.029> being

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
obviously are the effects of us being

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.870 
obviously are the effects of us being
here<00:05:42.569> and<00:05:42.690> our<00:05:42.810> presence<00:05:43.199> is<00:05:43.469> seen<00:05:43.800> and<00:05:44.190> yet

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
here and our presence is seen and yet

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.909 
here and our presence is seen and yet
it's<00:05:45.599> almost<00:05:45.870> like<00:05:46.080> we're<00:05:46.259> they<00:05:46.380> actually

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
it's almost like we're they actually

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.659 
it's almost like we're they actually
even<00:05:47.130> here<00:05:48.469> it<00:05:49.469> just<00:05:49.620> really<00:05:49.860> helps<00:05:50.310> the

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
even here it just really helps the

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.269 
even here it just really helps the
homeowner<00:05:51.000> to<00:05:51.180> be<00:05:51.360> less<00:05:52.199> interrupted<00:05:53.039> and

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
homeowner to be less interrupted and

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:55.790 
homeowner to be less interrupted and
affected<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:54.150> life<00:05:54.750> can<00:05:55.139> get<00:05:55.259> back<00:05:55.440> to<00:05:55.650> normal

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
affected and life can get back to normal

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.969 
affected and life can get back to normal
a<00:05:56.159> lot<00:05:56.340> quicker<00:05:56.520> for<00:05:56.819> them<00:05:57.000> so<00:05:57.630> I<00:05:57.960> hope<00:05:58.830> this

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
a lot quicker for them so I hope this
