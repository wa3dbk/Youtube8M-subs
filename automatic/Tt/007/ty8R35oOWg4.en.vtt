00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
fails dark as you can see I've added two

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.470 
fails dark as you can see I've added two
trees<00:00:25.650> here<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.220> they<00:00:26.580> also<00:00:26.730> have<00:00:26.970> pcl

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
trees here and they also have pcl

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.880 
trees here and they also have pcl
effects<00:00:27.960> spin<00:00:28.410> out<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.650> in<00:00:28.740> touch<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:33.710> in<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
effects spin out you in touch and in the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.430 
effects spin out you in touch and in the
background<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.370> see<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.640> am<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.239> am<00:00:36.750> using<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
background you see I am I am using the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.260 
background you see I am I am using the
original<00:00:37.559> sky<00:00:38.160> model<00:00:38.430> from<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.969> DS<00:00:39.149> version

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
original sky model from the DS version

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.250 
original sky model from the DS version
and<00:00:39.809> I'm<00:00:39.870> also<00:00:40.140> using<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.739> original<00:00:41.899> KMP<00:00:42.899> from

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and I'm also using the original KMP from

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.160 
and I'm also using the original KMP from
the<00:00:43.410> yes<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.550> converted<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.270> nkn<00:00:45.719> file<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the yes so I converted the nkn file to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.299 
the yes so I converted the nkn file to
KMP<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:48.480> texture<00:00:48.840> mapping<00:00:49.020> gear<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
KMP and the texture mapping gear was a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.069 
KMP and the texture mapping gear was a
lot<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.789> work<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.390> lot<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.690> hard<00:00:52.020> work<00:00:53.149> and<00:00:54.149> I

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
lot of work a lot of hard work and I

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959 
lot of work a lot of hard work and I
hope<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.410> here's<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.890> little<00:00:56.129> fail<00:00:56.370> box<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
hope like here's a little fail box I

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.639 
hope like here's a little fail box I
don't<00:00:57.420> care

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.000 

yes<00:01:01.649> sometimes<00:01:02.130> them<00:01:02.989> or<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.320> background<00:01:04.830> has

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
yes sometimes them or the background has

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.760 
yes sometimes them or the background has
a<00:01:05.040> reporter<00:01:05.670> effect<00:01:06.110> here<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> background

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
a reporter effect here the background

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
a reporter effect here the background
trees

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
trees

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.320 
trees
I<00:01:09.980> can't<00:01:10.980> fix<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:11.520> they're<00:01:11.940> using<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
I can't fix it because they're using the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.870 
I can't fix it because they're using the
same<00:01:12.510> texture<00:01:14.690> yeah<00:01:15.690> I<00:01:15.930> fixed<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.860> lot<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
same texture yeah I fixed a lot of you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.260 
same texture yeah I fixed a lot of you
hung<00:01:18.150> texture<00:01:19.110> mapping<00:01:19.500> problems<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.550> this

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
hung texture mapping problems and this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.360 
hung texture mapping problems and this
is<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> moving<00:01:22.530> trees<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.890> item

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
is one of the moving trees the item

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.810 
is one of the moving trees the item
boxes<00:01:26.730> here<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.660> you<00:01:27.780> always<00:01:28.310> three<00:01:29.310> mushrooms

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
boxes here if you always three mushrooms

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.070 
boxes here if you always three mushrooms
Oh<00:01:33.650> wrong<00:01:34.650> way<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.300> easier<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.840> drive

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
Oh wrong way so it's easier to drive

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.990 
Oh wrong way so it's easier to drive
here<00:01:37.410> on<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.710> month<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.530> also<00:01:40.710> use<00:01:41.000> this

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
here on the month you can also use this

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:55.460 
here on the month you can also use this
right<00:01:42.330> here<00:01:51.680> yeah<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.040> know<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.180> trees<00:01:54.420> are<00:01:54.690> not

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
right here yeah I know the trees are not

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.520 
right here yeah I know the trees are not
a<00:01:55.500> 3d<00:01:55.979> object<00:01:57.020> but<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.050> don't<00:01:58.350> care<00:01:58.530> and<00:02:00.530> sorry

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
a 3d object but I don't care and sorry

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.280 
a 3d object but I don't care and sorry
that<00:02:01.830> here<00:02:02.610> are<00:02:02.729> no<00:02:02.910> trees<00:02:03.330> on<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.720> grass<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
that here are no trees on the grass and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.800 
that here are no trees on the grass and
the<00:02:04.350> reason<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:05.010> is<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:06.330> sketchup

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
the reason for that is that the sketchup

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.090 
the reason for that is that the sketchup
file<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.500> dead<00:02:07.860> trees<00:02:08.310> as<00:02:08.610> 6mp<00:02:09.509> big<00:02:09.690> and

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
file for the dead trees as 6mp big and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.060 
file for the dead trees as 6mp big and
that's<00:02:11.100> big<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.570> course<00:02:12.900> model<00:02:13.260> file<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
that's big and the course model file the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.500 
that's big and the course model file the
corresponding<00:02:14.610> sketchup<00:02:14.970> file<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
corresponding sketchup file it's the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.130 
corresponding sketchup file it's the
only<00:02:15.780> hold<00:02:16.019> one<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.350> d<00:02:16.470> big<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:17.450> think<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.660> I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
only hold one and d big I think it I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.050 
only hold one and d big I think it I
think<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.370> lacked<00:02:20.760> if<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.150> add<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.890> dead<00:02:23.070> trees

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:34.130 

so<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.450> put<00:02:28.459> them<00:02:29.459> out<00:02:32.810> well<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.840> hope<00:02:34.019> you

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
so I just put them out well I hope you

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.059 
so I just put them out well I hope you
like<00:02:34.170> it

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.580 

is<00:02:37.249> there<00:02:37.819> any<00:02:37.999> glitches<00:02:38.329> i<00:02:38.629> think<00:02:38.900> i<00:02:39.079> won't

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
is there any glitches i think i won't

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.080 
is there any glitches i think i won't
fix<00:02:39.890> them<00:02:40.129> because<00:02:40.959> yes<00:02:41.959> i<00:02:42.200> am<00:02:42.939> just<00:02:43.939> not

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
fix them because yes i am just not

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:55.430 
fix them because yes i am just not
motivated<00:02:44.689> to<00:02:44.719> work<00:02:45.019> on<00:02:45.170> this<00:02:45.260> track<00:02:45.560> longer

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.120 

and<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:58.060> add<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.390> new<00:02:58.569> increase<00:02:59.050> this<00:02:59.920> was

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
and to add the new increase this was

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:12.050 
and to add the new increase this was
also<00:03:00.160> hard<00:03:00.760> work<00:03:08.760> i'm<00:03:09.760> using<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.810> combi

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
also hard work i'm using the the combi

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.270 
also hard work i'm using the the combi
hope<00:03:13.060> it's<00:03:13.380> right<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.730> right<00:03:15.880> Hank<00:03:17.160> for<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
hope it's right the right Hank for the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.960 
hope it's right the right Hank for the

here's<00:03:21.970> still<00:03:22.210> a<00:03:22.270> texture<00:03:23.230> mapping<00:03:23.410> problem

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
here's still a texture mapping problem

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:35.530 
here's still a texture mapping problem
but<00:03:24.100> I<00:03:24.130> can't<00:03:24.760> fix<00:03:25.000> this<00:03:25.240> so<00:03:26.170> sorry<00:03:26.410> for<00:03:26.650> that
