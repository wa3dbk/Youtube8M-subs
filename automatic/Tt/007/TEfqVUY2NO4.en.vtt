00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello my dear, I was now a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.609
 video to my toes slimming tips i 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.710
 have a few thought that I 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.139
 Firstly, you would like to reveal yourself 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.750
 if you have a sauce to eat well 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.969
 to noodles vegetables and so on then 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.740
 It always works better on vegetables instead 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.390
 cream and butter to use 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 second, where we are already at the vegetable 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.920
 There are many vegetable vegetables 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 Dietary fiber and important is that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.970
 then she also drinks a lot 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.189
 because the fiber swells afterwards 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.830
 open up and make yourself so full 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.110
 Third , press I know that's one 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.290
 strange tip but cress is probably very 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.600
 rich in samples and chrome controls 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.399
 the feeling of fullness can be positive 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.500
 for example in salads or bread 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.050
 fourth, eat slowly, chewing 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.210
 and do not be so distracted while eating 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.250
 Only then really realize what 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.250
 We have ever eaten for men 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.780
 5 brushing with hunger I do not know 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 but with me it is so when I am 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.440
 brush your teeth after eating or I have 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.359
 that used to mean me always 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.770
 line was found when I had teeth 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.480
 I did not clean that way anymore 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.309
 really buck something to eat at this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.270
 Method tastes me somehow 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.240
 appetite spoiled 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.310
 6 almost every person has it somehow 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.619
 a sugar addiction and this sugar addiction 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.939
 bring us back again and again 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.610
 to eat sweets and cares for 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.450
 ravenous attacks so that ours 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.310
 insulin levels keep rising and rising 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.610
 quickly drops what then as I said 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.470
 already just cravings 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.090
 The next tip should be generated in the evening 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.490
 do not eat anything the blood sugar level 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.770
 strong in the height drives in the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.689
 night, the growth hormone melatonin 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.560
 spilled which leads to fat 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.710
 is burned 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.020
 as long as the insulin level is up 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.179
 no fat burned would be 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.020
 Tip number eight not on fat 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.359
 renounce 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.369
 so rather avoid the things 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.049
 which really do not contain any good fats 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.939
 for example, the trans fatty acids in 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.530
 margarine or refrain for example 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.630
 on fat in potato chips and 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.369
 sweets so always the healthy ones 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.380
 prefer variant and above all 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.810
 left light products 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.759
 complements your meal plan with healthy ones 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.679
 fats such as leinÃ¶l 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.469
 fat from nuts or for example 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.750
 also from avocado 10,9 is you should 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.280
 drink enough to drink the crank 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.370
 metabolism one says so in the cut 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.290
 between 15 and one then day number 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.760
 10 really great tip 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.380
 but you probably also know 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.239
 not that stupid who can do it 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.040
 eat with chopsticks and not more 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.829
 can not eat with chopsticks will 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.480
 Guaranteed fast to satiety 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.599
 come twice so yes slower 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.209
 and so our stomach much faster 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.440
 can tell our brain that we are 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.180
 so maybe it's just fine 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.010
 if someone does not eat with chopsticks 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.299
 like i can only focus for example though 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.220
 now i can have learned 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.390
