00:00:57.587 --> 00:01:00.071
By a happy coincidence,
we're signing your contract...

00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:01.634
on the day of our weekly meeting.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.648
This committee is responsible for
making all the important decisions.

00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:10.492
Cembranelli, Ronald,

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:13.537
Luiz Cláudio,
our Vice-President,

00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:17.586
Thiers and Júlio Peralta.

00:01:17.782 --> 00:01:21.452
There are also
Berenguer and Zé Paulo,

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:23.543
and Daoun,
who will be here later.

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:28.963
You are very lucky,
you're here to sign your contract...

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:31.903
on the day we gather
to make our decisions.

00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:35.422
This is the group
that decided to sign you.

00:01:35.564 --> 00:01:39.328
This group would like
to welcome you,

00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:42.619
on behalf of
the Management Committee,

00:01:43.137 --> 00:01:45.294
we want you to be
very happy while you're here,

00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:47.281
you're back home.

00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:51.877
We've been dreaming of signing you
just like our fans,

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:54.610
we are managers,
but we're Santos fans as well.

00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:58.276
We negotiated in some opportunities,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.198
Santos FC has always been
very responsible when negotiating,

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:06.347
and back then
we couldn't compete with...

00:02:07.235 --> 00:02:12.414
the contracts offered to you
by European teams.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.451
Now you decided...

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.596
to come back to Santos FC,

00:02:21.597 --> 00:02:26.324
and we decided to sign you once again,
as we've always wanted to.

00:02:26.717 --> 00:02:31.652
Each part had to adapt
its initial demands,

00:02:31.653 --> 00:02:34.630
so that we could have
a happy ending,

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.876
and now we want to welcome you,

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:40.802
we understand...

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:45.104
everything you did
to make your return possible,

00:02:45.477 --> 00:02:48.248
we want you to be very happy,

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:52.679
together we'll make Santos FC
become even stronger,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.299
we will dispute titles,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.263
and we want to see...

00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:02.152
whenever you played for Santos FC,
you used to play with happiness,

00:03:02.404 --> 00:03:04.018
and that's what we want to see.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.344
You're going to be a reference
to the youngsters,

00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:12.733
and you will make
our squad even more qualified.

00:03:12.746 --> 00:03:15.280
Welcome back home.

00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:15.945
Thank you.

00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:18.564
I'd like to say thanks
for your efforts,

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:23.894
I don't even have to mention
how happy I'm to play for Santos FC,

00:03:23.895 --> 00:03:25.295
it's the team that raised me,

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.775
it's the team that gave me
everything I have.

00:03:27.992 --> 00:03:29.194
I'm not very good with speeches,

00:03:29.195 --> 00:03:31.450
I hope I manage
to say thanks while playing.

00:03:31.748 --> 00:03:35.513
I hope I manage to make you happy,

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:37.206
as well as the fans,
who are fond of me,

00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:44.523
I'll do everything I can
to take Santos FC to the top.

00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.862
Thank you,

00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:49.159
I'll be completely committed,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.936
I'm extremely happy
to be back home.

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:19.252
Considering what he represents,

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:24.546
not only to soccer in general,
but to us, here at Santos FC,

00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:27.794
it was a harsh negotiation,

00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:32.188
there were other teams
trying to sign him as well,

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.750
from Brazil and other countries,

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:40.028
but when both parts
have a common interest,

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:44.966
things tend to lead
to a happy ending.

00:04:47.122 --> 00:04:49.674
Both sides...

00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:55.272
had to diminish
their initial demands,

00:04:56.294 --> 00:05:00.159
giving up on certain things.

00:05:00.377 --> 00:05:04.461
Robinho has always worn
the jersey number 7,

00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:08.003
and Gabriel, our new idol,
has been wearing it,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.523
has this situation been sorted out?

00:05:11.306 --> 00:05:12.219
Certainly.

00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:15.411
Gabriel considers Robinho
as an idol,

00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:20.286
we talked and he was very happy
to give it back to Robinho.

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:25.612
Therefore, Robinho will wear
the jersey number 7,

00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:30.341
and Gabriel will wear
the jersey number 10,

00:05:30.342 --> 00:05:32.543
and he's very honored.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.387
We're very happy,

00:05:34.388 --> 00:05:38.087
we know what Robinho
represents to all Santos FC fans,

00:05:38.216 --> 00:05:41.566
the marvelous history
he wrote while playing here,

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:45.929
the happiness he shows
when he's playing for Santos FC,

00:05:46.308 --> 00:05:48.027
it's a huge privilege for me,

00:05:48.252 --> 00:05:53.024
as the club's President,
to sign Robinho once again,

00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:56.666
to give this well deserved gift
to our fans,

00:05:56.696 --> 00:06:00.355
our fans are very committed,
they really love their idols,

00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:05.681
and, besides all the things
Robinho represents to Santos FC,

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.704
he's very skilled,

00:06:07.705 --> 00:06:11.395
our squad will be
much more competitive,

00:06:11.396 --> 00:06:15.244
our attack line-up
will have more scoring chances,

00:06:15.245 --> 00:06:18.315
he has the Santos FC
style of playing in his DNA.

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:19.928
We are very happy,

00:06:20.476 --> 00:06:25.373
and we're sure
our fans couldn't be happier.

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.817
I'm extremely happy,

00:06:28.883 --> 00:06:30.528
I grew up playing here,

00:06:31.244 --> 00:06:33.959
Santos FC showed me
to the soccer world,

00:06:34.512 --> 00:06:40.291
I hope I manage to pay back
everyone's affection towards me...

00:06:40.407 --> 00:06:41.511
while playing.

00:06:41.512 --> 00:06:42.803
I'm very happy.
