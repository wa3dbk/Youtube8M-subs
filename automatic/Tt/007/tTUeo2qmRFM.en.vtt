00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.800
 because the secret is step by step I 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.130
 I find good finding very strong 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.810
 I take care of myself and in the end because that has its 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.660
 reward that little by little you go 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.670
 working day by day game by game 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.790
 never looking in the future and the past 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.890
 already forgetting a little and little by little 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.309
 Well, that's what I do, 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.050
 in that case he had an exemplary player 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.460
 that it was jesus would seem that when I 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.100
 I came because I was wearing 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.420
 I do not know if he was 10 years 11 years and lasted 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.180
 13 to 14 years old for me I admired him for 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.020
 that's because being in the best team in the 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:06.460
 world so many years is very complicated in 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.200
 that case I did not value it but now what 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.729
 I keep talking much much more because 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.830
 I think this best team in the world and 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.860
 it is very difficult to be so long 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.050
 It was a boy who wanted to play wanted 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.520
 have fun but I never thought about what I was going 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.990
 to play in division of honor I was going 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.970
 to get to the selection and that he was going to 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.710
 be the best team in the world has never 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.660
 there was a party match and in fact 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.200
 win in match match titles in 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.939
 the league 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.939
 when the first part of the cup arrives 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.280
 is the match is the final when it reaches 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.890
 a qualifying match with the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.240
 selection is the final match or 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.420
 be little by little they are getting 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.850
 these successes 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.909
 I did not have a full number waiting 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.290
 because he had not played for a long time 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.390
 well I had that little pressure because 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.729
 there was no other goalkeeper who could 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.610
 replace because I was injured 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.340
 the truth is that it 's a dream to win the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.500
 only title that you have left playing and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.310
 he said scoring a goal not then 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.799
 that was for me because the best I 'm a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.350
 unfair because it is true that the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.380
 goalkeepers we are always at the point of 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.760
 look better no matter what fails a goal is 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.620
 they put it 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.049
 and it has more significance that is a 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.829
 player before the goalkeeper fails who is 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.150
 for me it's the same, it's true that all 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.980
 players are not the goalkeepers of all 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.409
 the players go through ups and downs 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.569
 during the seasons and I think that 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.250
 Now it's happening to him but he's still 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.430
 It is a great big division 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.430
 goalie
