00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:19.820
 ok but then popping in my 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.560
 gestures 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 I quickly turned to animation 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.020
 in fact and robotic 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.400
 yes I was very influenced by 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.990
 the bike electric I think like 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.230
 like a lot of people with the movie 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.929
 breaking dawn is what I feel more 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.409
 quickly that's all that will be the 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.909
 effects changes of change 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:53.370
 of energy and control 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:55.050
 there was no plan to make my 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.159
 profession in fact I never took 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.359
 really serious but I always 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.749
 like dancing in my room like everything 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.609
 the world and I went to Chicago for 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.860
 my studies I was my license there and 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.720
 once there I was all integrated a 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.880
 group called Steckel words 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.770
 baby boy and they gave me my chance in 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.070
 did they put on a lot of plan 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.410
 there I was able to dance for artists and 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.270
 after that i went to los angeles and 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.890
 I have a crush per cent of the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.590
 relieving encounter is precisely what 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.970
 guide me and other amazing dancers 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.620
 and that's when I felt there was 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.620
 the source actually 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.270
 the reason I'm dancing is 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.190
 that I did by doing that way 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.290
 expression 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.700
 incredible that we have trouble communicating 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.080
 precisely in addition we are more and more 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.760
 individualistic we are each in our 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.780
 world and where we always end up with 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.250
 this means of expression the place of the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.840
 woman in the pop today she is 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.270
 very important especially level 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.880
 in the sense that in 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.580
 some countries still seem pretty 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.660
 macho in general not only in hip hop 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.070
 but it is more difficult for 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:27.400
 women to have their place in an environment 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:27.400
 more masculine and you what is your style
