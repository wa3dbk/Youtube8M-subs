gonna put a nut belief mm-hmm onto the
Tsushima<00:00:39.210> all<00:00:40.079> right<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.530> layering

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
Tsushima all right so you just layering

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.729 
Tsushima all right so you just layering
it<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> sushi<00:00:42.030> man<00:00:44.180> is<00:00:45.180> one<00:00:45.570> by<00:00:45.750> one<00:00:46.050> okay

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
it on the sushi man is one by one okay

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.650 
it on the sushi man is one by one okay
so<00:00:47.370> they're<00:00:47.520> overlapping<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.239> bit<00:00:48.420> times

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
so they're overlapping a bit times

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.529 
so they're overlapping a bit times
nothing<00:00:49.050> little<00:00:49.469> bit<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.300> change<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
nothing little bit and change the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.920 
nothing little bit and change the
direction<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:54.000> by<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.510> this

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
direction of the I see one by one this

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.650 
direction of the I see one by one this
way<00:00:55.170> go<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.980> stem<00:00:56.399> parties<00:00:56.879> decide<00:00:57.390> this

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
way go at the stem parties decide this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.540 
way go at the stem parties decide this
waste<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.199> part<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> other<00:00:58.859> side<00:00:59.190> it's

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
waste and part of the other side it's

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.880 
waste and part of the other side it's
each<00:00:59.969> layer<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
each layer so you get all the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.179 
each layer so you get all the
combination<00:01:02.579> that's<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.030> good<00:01:03.510> idea<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.920> turn

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
combination that's a good idea you turn

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.240 
combination that's a good idea you turn
