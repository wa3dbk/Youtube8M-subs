00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.359 
had with me and I tried to be as strong
as<00:01:32.939> possible<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.049> paid<00:01:34.229> off<00:01:34.369> is

it Redemption I think it's just
extremely<00:01:43.259> satisfying<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.970> finally<00:01:45.509> win<00:01:45.899> a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
extremely satisfying to finally win a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.950 
extremely satisfying to finally win a
