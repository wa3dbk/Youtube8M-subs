00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
it's pretty much the same method but

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.150 
it's pretty much the same method but
many<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> servers<00:00:25.949> for<00:00:26.340> 0.8.0<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.510> now

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
popular server for 0.9.0 right now but I

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
popular server for 0.9.0 right now but I
will<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:15.060> able<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.299> join<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.900> because

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
will not be able to join just because

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.249 
will not be able to join just because
many<00:01:17.220> people<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.210> now<00:01:18.259> it's

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
many people are on it right now it's

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.230 
many people are on it right now it's
overflowing<00:01:19.650> right<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.060> say

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
overflowing right now so as you can say

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
overflowing right now so as you can say
as<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.170> see<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.409> says<00:01:22.590> unable<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.100> connect

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
as you can see it says unable to connect

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.660 
as you can see it says unable to connect
to<00:01:23.729> world<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.140> means<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:26.159> server<00:01:26.430> isn't

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
to world so that means the server isn't

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670 
to world so that means the server isn't
outdated<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.990> either<00:01:28.259> full<00:01:28.650> or

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
outdated it's just either full or

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.760 
outdated it's just either full or
offline<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.000> right<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.020> obviously<00:01:31.229> it's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
offline so right now obviously it's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.289 
offline so right now obviously it's
gonna<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.100> full<00:01:33.290> but<00:01:34.549> trust<00:01:35.549> me<00:01:35.670> guys<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.090> does

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
gonna be full but trust me guys it does

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.730 
gonna be full but trust me guys it does
work<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.570> whenever<00:01:37.020> you're<00:01:37.320> watching<00:01:37.470> this

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
join this for sure unless they shut down

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.480 
join this for sure unless they shut down
the<00:01:42.960> server<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:43.920> pretty<00:01:44.130> sure<00:01:44.220> they

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the server but I'm pretty sure they

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
the server but I'm pretty sure they
won't<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.450> William<00:01:45.750> TDR<00:01:46.140> but

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
won't because this is William TDR but

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.679 
won't because this is William TDR but
