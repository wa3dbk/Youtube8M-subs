00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
the water wave all over and I love it

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.970 
the water wave all over and I love it
and<00:02:29.300> which<00:02:29.510> really<00:02:29.840> came<00:02:30.110> out<00:02:30.320> nice<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.620> it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
and which really came out nice and it

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.400 
and which really came out nice and it
looks<00:02:31.250> real<00:02:31.610> if<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:31.940> didn't<00:02:32.300> know<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:33.020> wasn't

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
looks real if you didn't know it wasn't

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.710 
looks real if you didn't know it wasn't
well<00:02:33.890> not<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.220> know<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:37.730> nice<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.690> I

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
well not you know but it's nice so I

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.660 
well not you know but it's nice so I
think<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.650> stay<00:02:39.860> up<00:02:40.040> i<00:02:40.160> can<00:02:40.310> get<00:02:40.520> to

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
think that this can stay up i can get to

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.120 
think that this can stay up i can get to
my<00:02:40.700> roots<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.270> can<00:02:41.450> all<00:02:41.660> my<00:02:41.900> scalp<00:02:42.320> it's<00:02:42.740> really

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.430 
my roots I can all my scalp it's really
light<00:02:43.430> so<00:02:44.330> i<00:02:44.390> think<00:02:44.450> i<00:02:44.690> could<00:02:44.840> keep<00:02:44.990> this<00:02:45.200> up
