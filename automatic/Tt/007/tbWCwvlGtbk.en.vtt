depends on your creepy with your

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.729 
depends on your creepy with your
creativity<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.890> it<00:04:14.010> comes<00:04:14.340> with<00:04:14.549> three<00:04:15.360> eyes

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
creativity and it comes with three eyes

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.620 
creativity and it comes with three eyes
of<00:04:16.739> course<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.220> one<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.700> going<00:04:17.940> to<00:04:18.060> be<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.209> pear

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
of course the one is going to be a pear

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.990 
of course the one is going to be a pear
and<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:20.370> larger<00:04:20.790> one<00:04:21.030> sometimes<00:04:22.790> minions<00:04:23.790> are

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
and the larger one sometimes minions are

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.100 
and the larger one sometimes minions are
like<00:04:24.210> Zaku's<00:04:24.840> they<00:04:25.169> only<00:04:25.440> have<00:04:25.620> one<00:04:25.860> eye<00:04:25.970> and

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
like Zaku's they only have one eye and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.590 
like Zaku's they only have one eye and
it<00:04:28.110> in<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.470> past<00:04:29.070> three<00:04:29.430> three<00:04:30.210> pupils

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
it in the past three three pupils

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.650 
it in the past three three pupils
this<00:04:33.600> is<00:04:33.780> probably<00:04:34.260> for<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.710> large<00:04:35.669> eye<00:04:36.120> and

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
this is probably for the large eye and

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.800 
this is probably for the large eye and
these<00:04:37.620> two<00:04:38.060> are<00:04:39.060> for<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:40.669> small<00:04:41.669> eyes<00:04:41.880> I'm<00:04:42.630> not

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
going to show vigil how to make this

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.090 
going to show vigil how to make this
maybe<00:04:47.870> I'll<00:04:47.990> just<00:04:48.200> show<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:49.070> finished

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
maybe I'll just show the finished

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.580 
maybe I'll just show the finished
product<00:04:49.940> because<00:04:50.290> it's<00:04:51.290> really<00:04:51.560> hard<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:52.910> film

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
product because it's really hard to film

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.710 
product because it's really hard to film
making<00:04:54.590> things<00:04:54.920> like<00:04:55.160> this<00:04:55.510> but<00:04:56.510> this<00:04:56.660> is

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
making things like this but this is

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.610 
making things like this but this is
really<00:04:57.020> sad<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:58.840> appreciate<00:04:59.840> your<00:05:00.170> effort

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
really sad I appreciate your effort

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.550 
really sad I appreciate your effort
putting<00:05:00.980> this<00:05:01.310> in<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.640> box<00:05:01.910> in<00:05:02.300> a<00:05:02.480> box<00:05:02.660> so<00:05:03.410> it

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
putting this in the box in a box so it

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.250 
putting this in the box in a box so it
would<00:05:03.710> be<00:05:04.030> more<00:05:05.030> protected<00:05:05.690> but<00:05:05.840> I<00:05:05.900> think

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
would be more protected but I think

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.810 
would be more protected but I think
that's<00:05:06.530> not<00:05:06.950> enough<00:05:07.340> in<00:05:08.000> this<00:05:08.180> case<00:05:09.700> so<00:05:10.700> yeah

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
that's not enough in this case so yeah

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.450 
that's not enough in this case so yeah
that's<00:05:11.090> really<00:05:11.330> sad<00:05:11.810> what<00:05:12.680> can<00:05:12.950> you<00:05:13.070> do

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460
