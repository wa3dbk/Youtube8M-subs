revolution<00:00:38.560> it's<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:38.950> tourmaline<00:00:39.489> flat<00:00:40.480> iron

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
revolution it's a tourmaline flat iron

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.140 
revolution it's a tourmaline flat iron
and<00:00:41.079> I<00:00:42.040> think<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:42.880> is<00:00:43.060> almost<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.489> highest

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
and I think that is almost the highest

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.660 
and I think that is almost the highest
me<00:00:46.510> is<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:46.750> second<00:00:47.050> highest<00:00:47.170> in<00:00:47.470> quality<00:00:48.010> as

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
me is the second highest in quality as

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.530 
me is the second highest in quality as
far<00:00:48.940> as<00:00:49.530> flat<00:00:50.530> irons<00:00:50.830> are<00:00:51.010> concerned<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.480> I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
far as flat irons are concerned so I

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.360 
far as flat irons are concerned so I
believe<00:00:52.660> you<00:00:52.840> have<00:00:52.870> ceramic<00:00:53.650> then<00:00:54.040> you<00:00:54.160> have

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
believe you have ceramic then you have

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.090 
believe you have ceramic then you have
tourmaline<00:00:54.940> somewhere<00:00:55.630> and<00:00:56.470> then<00:00:56.740> you<00:00:56.860> have

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
tourmaline somewhere and then you have

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.870 
tourmaline somewhere and then you have
titanium<00:00:57.640> um<00:00:58.210> I<00:00:59.140> actually<00:00:59.920> prefer<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.670> term

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
titanium um I actually prefer the term

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.570 
titanium um I actually prefer the term
Berlin<00:01:01.150> over<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.840> ceramic<00:01:02.410> because<00:01:02.860> when<00:01:03.550> i

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
Berlin over the ceramic because when i

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.420 
Berlin over the ceramic because when i
did<00:01:03.910> use<00:01:04.540> ceramic<00:01:05.019> flat<00:01:05.439> irons<00:01:05.770> i<00:01:05.979> noticed

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
did use ceramic flat irons i noticed

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.370 
did use ceramic flat irons i noticed
that<00:01:06.790> my<00:01:07.119> hair<00:01:07.540> was<00:01:07.840> more<00:01:08.619> dry<00:01:08.979> and<00:01:10.140> broke<00:01:11.140> off

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
that my hair was more dry and broke off

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.480 
that my hair was more dry and broke off
a<00:01:11.409> lot<00:01:11.829> more<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:13.420> I<00:01:13.810> invested<00:01:14.409> in<00:01:14.890> a

390 it varies but I try not to go above
400<00:01:43.320> which<00:01:44.320> can<00:01:44.650> be<00:01:44.830> damaging<00:01:45.400> um<00:01:45.790> i<00:01:46.330> would

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
400 which can be damaging um i would

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.910 
400 which can be damaging um i would
suggest<00:01:47.409> not<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:48.820> in<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.150> 400s<00:01:49.870> but<00:01:50.080> that's

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
suggest not going in the 400s but that's

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.620 
suggest not going in the 400s but that's
besides<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.580> point<00:01:51.670> because<00:01:52.120> everybody's

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
besides the point because everybody's

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.899 
besides the point because everybody's
hair<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:52.990> different<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.860> know<00:01:54.010> some<00:01:54.670> people

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
hair is different you know some people

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.910 
hair is different you know some people
might<00:01:55.030> be<00:01:55.210> able<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.479> tolerate<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:56.170> high<00:01:56.500> heat

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
might be able to tolerate that high heat

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.969 
might be able to tolerate that high heat
so<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:57.520> also<00:01:58.060> depends<00:01:58.479> on<00:01:58.600> what<00:01:58.900> you<00:01:59.440> know<00:01:59.619> he

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
so it also depends on what you know he

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.940 
so it also depends on what you know he
protect<00:02:00.610> him<00:02:00.760> to<00:02:00.940> using<00:02:01.510> and<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:02.770> why<00:02:02.920> I

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
protect him to using and that is why I

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.969 
protect him to using and that is why I

before silicone heat protectants because

they actually buffer against the heat of

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
a thermal count that I was talking about

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:19.570 
a thermal count that I was talking about
I<00:03:08.819> don't<00:03:09.599> use<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:10.290> rarely<00:03:10.680> rarely<00:03:11.069> use<00:03:11.489> it

going to really get in there and

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.309 
going to really get in there and
penetrate<00:03:52.010> typically<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.040> don't<00:03:53.370> go<00:03:53.790> up<00:03:53.819> in

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319

is good another tool that i use is this
thermal<00:04:01.650> cap<00:04:03.889> typically<00:04:04.889> when<00:04:05.220> i<00:04:05.280> use<00:04:05.639> this

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
thermal cap typically when i use this

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.990 
thermal cap typically when i use this
it's<00:04:06.239> usually<00:04:06.810> from<00:04:07.019> my<00:04:07.400> deep<00:04:08.400> conditioning

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
it's usually from my deep conditioning

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.229 
it's usually from my deep conditioning
treatments<00:04:09.859> I'll<00:04:10.859> use<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.459> stumbling<00:04:11.879> cap

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
treatments I'll use the stumbling cap

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.520 
treatments I'll use the stumbling cap
just<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:13.879> really<00:04:14.879> get<00:04:15.239> more<00:04:15.599> of<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.989> penetration

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
just to really get more of a penetration

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.370 
just to really get more of a penetration
of<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.039> heat<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.639> half<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.570> conditioner

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
of the heat and half the conditioner

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.460 
of the heat and half the conditioner
penetrate<00:04:19.949> my<00:04:20.099> hair<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.549> lot<00:04:20.849> better<00:04:21.060> anyways<00:04:21.780> I

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
use this tab and I think it's good to a

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.820 
use this tab and I think it's good to a
certain<00:04:26.250> extent<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:28.110> problem<00:04:28.530> I<00:04:28.620> have<00:04:28.800> with

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
certain extent the problem I have with

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.240 
certain extent the problem I have with
it<00:04:28.979> is<00:04:29.310> this<00:04:29.669> top<00:04:29.970> portion<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:31.530> front<00:04:31.949> right

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
it is this top portion the front right

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.490 
it is this top portion the front right
here<00:04:32.280> doesn't<00:04:32.970> have<00:04:33.120> any<00:04:33.270> thermal<00:04:33.900> element

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
here doesn't have any thermal element

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.960 
here doesn't have any thermal element
that<00:04:35.280> will<00:04:35.460> heat<00:04:35.880> up<00:04:36.270> your<00:04:37.229> hair<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.039> get<00:04:38.550> you

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
to do however one thing I would do is

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.060 
to do however one thing I would do is
just<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.250> flip<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.000> backwards<00:04:48.889> because<00:04:49.889> the

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
just to flip it backwards because the

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.969 
just to flip it backwards because the
element<00:04:50.639> is<00:04:50.789> all<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.300> way<00:04:51.449> back<00:04:51.659> here<00:04:51.979> it

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
element is all the way back here it

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.969 
element is all the way back here it
heats<00:04:53.280> up<00:04:53.490> nicely<00:04:53.789> and<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.780> just<00:04:55.110> let<00:04:55.409> it<00:04:55.560> heat

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
heats up nicely and I just let it heat

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.760 
heats up nicely and I just let it heat
up<00:04:56.009> the<00:04:56.460> front<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:57.000> get<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.020> conditioner<00:04:58.620> to

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
up the front and get the conditioner to

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.950 
up the front and get the conditioner to
penetrate<00:04:59.340> that<00:04:59.550> way<00:04:59.820> so<00:05:00.479> that's<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.930> only

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
penetrate that way so that's the only

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.749 
penetrate that way so that's the only
thing<00:05:01.440> i<00:05:01.560> don't<00:05:01.620> like<00:05:01.770> about<00:05:01.889> this<00:05:02.280> thermal

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
thing i don't like about this thermal

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:06.499 
thing i don't like about this thermal
tap<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:04.729> one<00:05:05.729> of<00:05:05.849> the<00:05:05.909> good<00:05:06.060> things<00:05:06.120> about

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
tap and one of the good things about

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.600 
tap and one of the good things about
this<00:05:06.840> though<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.080> that<00:05:07.289> you<00:05:07.770> have<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.220> cord

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
this though is that you have the cord

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.089 
this though is that you have the cord
you<00:05:09.210> can<00:05:09.240> move<00:05:09.630> around<00:05:09.870> a<00:05:10.440> little<00:05:10.590> bit<00:05:10.800> more

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
you can move around a little bit more

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.460 
you can move around a little bit more
and<00:05:11.990> it's<00:05:12.990> not<00:05:13.229> a<00:05:13.259> stationary
