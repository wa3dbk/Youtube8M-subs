00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.630 
I looked into things and I saw that
minecraft<00:01:03.690> 1.6<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.769> hit<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.070> 1.6

point one was going to hit the horse
update<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.080> knew<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.530> would<00:01:10.650> break

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
update and I knew that that would break

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.179 
update and I knew that that would break
a<00:01:11.070> whole<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.640> mods<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> did<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:13.860> release

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
a whole lot of mods so I did not release

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.490 
a whole lot of mods so I did not release
it<00:01:14.220> last<00:01:14.909> weekend<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> state

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it last weekend but it's in the state

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
it last weekend but it's in the state
where<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.680> probably<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.340> release<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.750> but

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
where I probably can release it but

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.390 
where I probably can release it but
since<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.590> point<00:01:19.770> six<00:01:19.830> point<00:01:20.070> one<00:01:20.130> came<00:01:20.310> out

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
since one point six point one came out

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.609 
since one point six point one came out
and<00:01:20.610> broke<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.060> mod<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.170> fix<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.730 
fix it and then distributed and well
actually<00:01:45.180> before<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.750> even<00:01:45.780> have<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.380> have

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
actually before that even have to I have

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.170 
actually before that even have to I have
to<00:01:46.860> add<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> few<00:01:47.340> more<00:01:47.399> finishing<00:01:47.640> touches<00:01:47.880> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to add a few more finishing touches to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.850 
to add a few more finishing touches to
the<00:01:48.329> mod<00:01:48.479> before<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.380> release<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the mod before I do actually release it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.859 
the mod before I do actually release it
so<00:01:50.520> we're<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.820> two<00:01:51.210> or<00:01:51.329> three<00:01:51.509> weeks<00:01:51.630> out

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
so we're about two or three weeks out

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.780 
so we're about two or three weeks out
maybe<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.380> month<00:01:52.590> out<00:01:52.799> before<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.640> actually

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
maybe a month out before I can actually

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.999 
maybe a month out before I can actually
release<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> mod<00:01:54.570> because<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.710> don't<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:55.920> how

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
release the mod because I don't know how

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.260 
release the mod because I don't know how
long<00:01:56.130> all<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.549> stuff<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> take

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
long all of that stuff is going to take

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.330 
long all of that stuff is going to take
like<00:01:57.479> i<00:01:57.600> said<00:01:57.750> i'm<00:01:57.869> waiting<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.259> other<00:01:59.009> people

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
like i said i'm waiting on other people

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.859 
like i said i'm waiting on other people
to<00:01:59.369> finish<00:01:59.670> their<00:01:59.850> work<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.270> forge<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.810> i

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
to finish their work on forge and i

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.359 
to finish their work on forge and i
think<00:02:01.079> at<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.320> point<00:02:01.439> at<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.009> release<00:02:02.250> of

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
think at this point at the release of

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.639 
think at this point at the release of
this<00:02:02.460> video<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.969> think<00:02:03.659> Forge<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.140> actually

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
this video I think Forge is actually

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.749 
this video I think Forge is actually
stabled<00:02:05.009> enough<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.250> where<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> could<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
stabled enough to where I could do that

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.039 
stabled enough to where I could do that
but<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.939> want<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> give<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.810> bit<00:02:06.960> more

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
but I want to give it a little bit more

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.440 
but I want to give it a little bit more
time<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:08.099> them<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> release<00:02:08.429> any<00:02:08.640> updates<00:02:08.970> in
