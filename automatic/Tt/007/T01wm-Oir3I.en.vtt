00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
it cooks when you're making crepes just

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.830 
it cooks when you're making crepes just
like<00:02:02.680> pancakes<00:02:03.220> don't<00:02:03.940> be<00:02:04.060> surprised<00:02:04.450> if<00:02:04.660> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
like pancakes don't be surprised if the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.590 
like pancakes don't be surprised if the
first<00:02:05.080> one<00:02:05.290> turns<00:02:05.560> out<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:05.830> little<00:02:06.130> odd<00:02:06.480> or<00:02:07.480> it's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
first one turns out a little odd or it's

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.590 
first one turns out a little odd or it's
not<00:02:07.720> as<00:02:07.840> pretty<00:02:08.170> as<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.530> might<00:02:08.710> like<00:02:08.740> it

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
not as pretty as you might like it

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.880 
not as pretty as you might like it
probably<00:02:10.600> because<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.140> pan<00:02:11.380> isn't<00:02:11.650> it's<00:02:11.860> just

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
probably because the pan isn't it's just

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.070 
probably because the pan isn't it's just
where<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.280> needs<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.520> be<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.690> I'm<00:02:13.750> gonna<00:02:13.870> turn

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
where it needs to be so I'm gonna turn

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.560 
where it needs to be so I'm gonna turn
down<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.320> pan<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.680> medium<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.730> when<00:02:16.450> you're

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
down the pan to medium and when you're

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.780 
down the pan to medium and when you're
making<00:02:16.720> crepes<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.680> don't<00:02:17.920> want<00:02:18.190> more<00:02:18.430> than

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
making crepes you don't want more than

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.340 
making crepes you don't want more than
maybe<00:02:18.970> two<00:02:19.180> tablespoons<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.810> batter<00:02:19.930> because

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
maybe two tablespoons of batter because

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.230 
maybe two tablespoons of batter because
the<00:02:20.440> idea<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:21.010> twirl<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.430> pan<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.910> if<00:02:22.060> you

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
the idea is to twirl the pan and if you

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.620 
the idea is to twirl the pan and if you
want<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.570> thinnest<00:02:22.930> possible<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:24.510> into<00:02:25.510> your

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
you're gonna move it around so it gets

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.370 
you're gonna move it around so it gets
to<00:02:32.410> all<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.770> edges
