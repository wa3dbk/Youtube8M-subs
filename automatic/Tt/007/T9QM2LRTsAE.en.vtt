00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
should be right exactly exactly so I'm

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
should be right exactly exactly so I'm
going<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> choose<00:01:43.380> three<00:01:43.710> seconds<00:01:44.250> that's

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.639 
going to choose three seconds that's
good<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> after<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.409> click

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
