but<00:01:23.119> his<00:01:23.210> difficulty<00:01:23.720> is<00:01:23.869> pretty<00:01:24.350> high<00:01:24.790> in<00:01:25.930> my

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
but his difficulty is pretty high in my

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.690 
but his difficulty is pretty high in my
opinion<00:01:27.290> once<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:27.800> get<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.009> learn<00:01:28.130> him<00:01:28.310> he<00:01:28.580> is

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
opinion once you get to learn him he is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.990 
opinion once you get to learn him he is
extremely<00:01:28.729> powerful<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:30.229> easy<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:31.369> just

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
extremely powerful and easy to just

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.609 
extremely powerful and easy to just
dominate<00:01:32.270> he's<00:01:32.660> a<00:01:32.690> hyper<00:01:32.930> carry<00:01:33.290> he<00:01:33.500> can

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
dominate he's a hyper carry he can

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.890 
dominate he's a hyper carry he can
definitely<00:01:33.830> change<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.640> game<00:01:34.900> from

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
definitely change the game from

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.870 
definitely change the game from
beginning<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.440> end<00:01:36.470> depending<00:01:37.009> on<00:01:37.340> how<00:01:37.820> you

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
beginning to end depending on how you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.450 
beginning to end depending on how you
play<00:01:38.270> so<00:01:38.810> just<00:01:39.410> going<00:01:39.560> over<00:01:39.770> his<00:01:39.979> abilities

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
play so just going over his abilities

going to be that any critical strike
that<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:47.690> build<00:01:47.930> any<00:01:48.140> crit<00:01:48.409> you<00:01:48.560> build<00:01:48.770> is

critical strike it's actually going to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.890 
critical strike it's actually going to
double<00:01:55.490> that<00:01:55.520> percentage<00:01:56.420> which<00:01:56.600> is<00:01:56.720> pretty

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
double that percentage which is pretty

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.969 
double that percentage which is pretty
awesome<00:01:57.110> because<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.470> can<00:01:57.650> get<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.860> all<00:01:57.950> the

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
awesome because you can get it all the

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.370 
awesome because you can get it all the
way<00:01:58.190> up<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:58.400> sixty<00:01:58.970> eighty<00:01:59.120> percent<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.960> then

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
way up to sixty eighty percent and then

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.690 
way up to sixty eighty percent and then
the<00:02:00.470> second<00:02:00.800> one<00:02:00.830> is<00:02:00.920> actually<00:02:01.130> as<00:02:01.430> he's

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
the second one is actually as he's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.719 
the second one is actually as he's
moving<00:02:02.090> around<00:02:02.210> he<00:02:02.810> actually<00:02:03.130> builds<00:02:04.130> up<00:02:04.310> a

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
moving around he actually builds up a

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.940 
moving around he actually builds up a
shield<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.600> it'll<00:02:05.870> shield<00:02:06.050> will<00:02:06.260> deflect

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
shield so that it'll shield will deflect

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.669 
shield so that it'll shield will deflect
a<00:02:07.220> basic<00:02:07.940> attack<00:02:08.209> or<00:02:08.390> an<00:02:08.450> ability<00:02:08.630> on<00:02:09.619> the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
first strike so at the more you move the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.400 
first strike so at the more you move the
more<00:02:13.640> your<00:02:13.820> shield<00:02:14.060> builds<00:02:14.330> his<00:02:14.870> cue<00:02:15.320> is

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410

up the vampiric scepter some people say
you<00:06:15.710> want<00:06:15.889> to<00:06:15.919> get<00:06:16.039> that<00:06:16.160> zeal<00:06:16.400> first<00:06:16.669> enable

a critical strike up as fast as you

a critical strike up as fast as you
possibly<00:06:20.780> can<00:06:21.260> so<00:06:21.440> that's<00:06:21.620> probably<00:06:21.800> the<00:06:22.010> best

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
possibly can so that's probably the best

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
way to do it if you need a little bit

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.909 
way to do it if you need a little bit
more<00:06:23.900> sustain<00:06:24.289> you<00:06:24.410> can<00:06:24.560> go<00:06:24.680> with<00:06:24.830> the

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
more sustain you can go with the

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.920 
more sustain you can go with the
vampiric<00:06:25.310> scepter<00:06:25.550> but<00:06:26.150> then<00:06:26.300> overall<00:06:26.599> your

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
vampiric scepter but then overall your

situationally so say you you build the

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.029 
situationally so say you you build the
static<00:06:41.479> ship<00:06:41.630> first<00:06:41.870> but<00:06:42.260> the<00:06:42.560> you<00:06:42.830> know<00:06:42.919> the

AP of the enemy laner is really bursting

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.719 
AP of the enemy laner is really bursting
you<00:06:45.800> down<00:06:45.949> you<00:06:46.099> can<00:06:46.220> pick<00:06:46.340> up<00:06:46.430> a<00:06:46.490> hexdrinker

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
you down you can pick up a hexdrinker

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.070 
you down you can pick up a hexdrinker
which<00:06:47.060> is<00:06:47.120> going<00:06:47.240> to<00:06:47.300> throw<00:06:47.479> in<00:06:47.720> that<00:06:47.870> attack

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.589 
which is going to throw in that attack
damage<00:06:48.260> but<00:06:48.680> add<00:06:48.889> magic<00:06:49.610> resist<00:06:50.150> as<00:06:50.300> well
