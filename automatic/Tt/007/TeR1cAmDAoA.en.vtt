rafter<00:00:04.529> layout<00:00:04.740> one<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.879> most

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
rafter layout one of the most

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.490 
rafter layout one of the most
interesting<00:00:07.319> parts<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.280> construction<00:00:09.500> I'm

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
interesting parts of construction I'm

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.410 
interesting parts of construction I'm
Robert<00:00:10.830> Markey<00:00:10.950> I've<00:00:11.370> been<00:00:11.550> doing

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
Robert Markey I've been doing

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.270 
Robert Markey I've been doing
instruction<00:00:12.929> especially<00:00:13.440> framing<00:00:14.130> and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
instruction especially framing and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.620 
instruction especially framing and
rafters<00:00:14.639> for<00:00:14.910> many<00:00:15.120> years

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
rafters for many years

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.099 
rafters for many years
I'm<00:00:16.230> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.410> talk<00:00:16.500> about<00:00:16.619> common<00:00:17.090> rafter

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
I'm going to talk about common rafter

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.550 
I'm going to talk about common rafter
layout<00:00:20.210> okay<00:00:21.240> we'll<00:00:21.539> assume<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.350> know

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
layout okay we'll assume that you know

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.700 
layout okay we'll assume that you know
your<00:00:22.980> roof<00:00:23.369> pitch<00:00:23.689> which<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.840> something<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.439> 12

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
your roof pitch which is something in 12

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.550 
your roof pitch which is something in 12
let's<00:00:26.010> say<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.400> nine<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.119> twelve<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:28.349> well

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
let's say it's nine and twelve and well

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.620 
let's say it's nine and twelve and well
I<00:00:28.619> assume<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.330> your<00:00:30.830> rafter<00:00:31.830> length

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
I assume you know your rafter length

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.120 
I assume you know your rafter length
okay<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.960> rafter<00:00:34.320> length<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.860> don't

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
okay and you rafter length if you don't

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190 
okay and you rafter length if you don't
have<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.790> just<00:00:36.000> know<00:00:36.210> your<00:00:36.660> height<00:00:36.899> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
have it you just know your height and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.229 
have it you just know your height and
your<00:00:37.620> horizontal<00:00:38.070> distance<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
your horizontal distance it's the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.690 
your horizontal distance it's the
Pythagorean<00:00:40.079> theorem<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.680> squared<00:00:40.950> plus<00:00:41.550> B

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
Pythagorean theorem a squared plus B

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.790 
Pythagorean theorem a squared plus B
squared<00:00:41.730> equals<00:00:42.059> C<00:00:42.300> squared<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:43.230> gives<00:00:43.559> you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
squared equals C squared it gives you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.590 
squared equals C squared it gives you
your<00:00:44.520> common<00:00:45.270> rafter<00:00:45.690> length<00:00:46.640> okay<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:48.329> order

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
your common rafter length okay in order

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.160 
your common rafter length okay in order
to<00:00:48.840> lay<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.320> oh<00:00:50.539> you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.960> use<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
to lay it out oh you can just use a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.869 
to lay it out oh you can just use a
framing<00:00:52.530> square<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.610> these

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
framing square but if you have these

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.810 
framing square but if you have these
nice<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.870> brass<00:00:55.550> thingies<00:00:58.309> it<00:00:59.309> makes<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
nice little brass thingies it makes it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.299 
nice little brass thingies it makes it
much<00:01:00.449> easier<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.500> we've<00:01:01.590> got<00:01:01.770> them<00:01:01.829> set<00:01:02.160> at

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
much easier so we've got them set at

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:16.929 
much easier so we've got them set at
nine<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.730> twelve<00:01:05.810> at<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> top<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.350> our<00:01:07.470> rafter

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.390 

it's<00:01:17.939> our<00:01:18.150> Ridge<00:01:21.290> actually<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.350> want<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> cut

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
it's our Ridge actually you want to cut

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.770 
it's our Ridge actually you want to cut
that<00:01:23.549> first<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.210> something<00:01:24.450> nice<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
that first so you get something nice to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.789 
that first so you get something nice to
hook<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.020> tape<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> measure

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
hook you tape on and then you measure

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.730 
hook you tape on and then you measure
your<00:01:29.600> rafter<00:01:30.600> length<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> outside<00:01:33.930> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
your rafter length to the outside of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
your rafter length to the outside of
your<00:01:35.130> top<00:01:35.400> plate<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.619> let's<00:01:37.700> assume<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.240> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
your top plate and let's assume it's a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.399 
your top plate and let's assume it's a
72<00:01:40.140> inch<00:01:41.150> rafter<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.490> make<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:45.409> mark

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
72 inch rafter so you know make a mark

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:55.590 
72 inch rafter so you know make a mark
there<00:01:47.930> from<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> top

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:09.850 

down<00:02:06.640> okay<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.360> this<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.440> your<00:02:09.560> length

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
down okay so this is this is your length

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.940 
down okay so this is this is your length
now<00:02:12.580> once<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:13.760> this<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:15.170> rafter<00:02:15.680> tail

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
now once you have this the rafter tail

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.100 
now once you have this the rafter tail
the<00:02:16.220> birds<00:02:16.459> mouth<00:02:16.760> needs<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.300> be<00:02:17.450> dealt<00:02:17.959> with

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
the birds mouth needs to be dealt with

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.590 
the birds mouth needs to be dealt with
if<00:02:18.500> you're<00:02:18.709> using<00:02:18.890> two<00:02:19.220> by<00:02:19.370> four<00:02:19.670> walls<00:02:20.000> say<00:02:20.390> or

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
if you're using two by four walls say or

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.300 
if you're using two by four walls say or
let's<00:02:20.810> say<00:02:20.900> two<00:02:20.959> by<00:02:21.230> six<00:02:21.500> because<00:02:21.740> we<00:02:22.160> want

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
let's say two by six because we want

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.120 
let's say two by six because we want
more<00:02:22.430> insulation<00:02:23.030> you<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:24.020> come<00:02:24.200> over<00:02:24.500> five

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
more insulation you can come over five

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.920 
more insulation you can come over five
and<00:02:25.160> a<00:02:25.370> half<00:02:25.520> inches<00:02:26.000> if<00:02:26.270> you<00:02:26.300> got<00:02:26.480> plywood<00:02:26.690> on

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
and a half inches if you got plywood on

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.570 
and a half inches if you got plywood on
the<00:02:26.959> outside<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.560> come<00:02:27.680> over<00:02:27.830> six<00:02:28.190> but<00:02:28.400> let's

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
the outside you come over six but let's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.430 
the outside you come over six but let's
just<00:02:28.820> work<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:29.930> way

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
just work it this way

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.460 
just work it this way
here's<00:02:30.950> your<00:02:31.100> bird's<00:02:31.280> mouth<00:02:31.810> right<00:02:32.810> there<00:02:33.230> so

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
here's your bird's mouth right there so

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.810 
here's your bird's mouth right there so
the<00:02:33.590> rafter<00:02:33.980> sits<00:02:36.160> rafters<00:02:37.160> gonna<00:02:37.400> sit<00:02:37.730> like

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
the rafter sits rafters gonna sit like

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.490 
the rafter sits rafters gonna sit like
this<00:02:42.850> for<00:02:43.850> your<00:02:43.970> rafter<00:02:44.390> tail<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.110> then<00:02:45.320> it

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
this for your rafter tail and then it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.310 
this for your rafter tail and then it
depends<00:02:45.920> very<00:02:46.040> much<00:02:46.310> on<00:02:46.730> what<00:02:47.120> your<00:02:47.330> which

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
depends very much on what your which

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.720 
depends very much on what your which
your<00:02:48.470> trim<00:02:48.680> work<00:02:48.830> which<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.070> corners<00:02:49.370> work<00:02:49.519> is

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
your trim work which the corners work is

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.060 
your trim work which the corners work is
like<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.570> you<00:02:50.959> may<00:02:50.989> come<00:02:51.290> over<00:02:51.410> here<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:51.950> may

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
like and you may come over here you may

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.650 
like and you may come over here you may
cut<00:02:52.340> this<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:52.760> way<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.030> may<00:02:53.330> cut<00:02:53.540> it

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
cut this this way you may cut it

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.660 
cut this this way you may cut it
straight<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.320> may<00:02:54.500> come<00:02:54.709> back<00:02:54.739> here<00:02:55.550> and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
straight you may come back here and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.110 
straight you may come back here and
