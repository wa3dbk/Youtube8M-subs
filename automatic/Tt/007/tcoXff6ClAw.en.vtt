00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.480
 efe 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.250
 hello how about friends and are welcome 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.290
 today we come to share with you the 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.760
 last chapter of this great game that 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.640
 I really liked the way they were 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.170
 I shared on the facebook page then to 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.990
 then let's play the last 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.140
 three levels to end this game 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.390
 and see what happens so let's see 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.390
 this has to be here 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.840
 I have to grab this house safely 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.380
 and from now on I let you know that I have not 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.380
 played 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.149
 and then I told them that I have never 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.149
 played these levels 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.820
 let's see let's jump here 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.220
 and well after playing a little 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.170
 I already discovered how I have to pass this 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.810
 part I have to jump here I have to 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.509
 give a touch here after I have to 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.530
 jump up here I have to push 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.880
 this box and then wait once it 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.960
 end then if I go down 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.470
 I activate it again and pushed again 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.250
 box as much as I can and I'm running from 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.780
 again to do the same thing where we have 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.479
 I return to give a touch again to raise the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.070
 box as I tell you I had never played 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.739
 these levels until now that I'm 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.100
 recording and now let's see if 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.390
 I can reach if uy 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.390
 no no no 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.990
 I do not know if I'm going to have to repeat everything 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.820
 new and well apparently if I play 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.520
 repeat everything again so let's 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.730
 try to jump today in time to give a 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.730
 I touched 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.410
 and here a big jump 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.420
 let's see let's see 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.060
 today 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.280
 Well, I also discovered how 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.510
 pass this level here because we do not have 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.590
 what to jump 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.379
 I did it wrong 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.379
 let's see right now I have to jump 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.050
 active that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:24.190
 and today I have to do this well and 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.110
 I have to jump before he crushes me 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.470
 and here I'm not sure where all that 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.470
 skip 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.810
 I can not get hold of that 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.629
 yes 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.590
 and also I could find out how to spend 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.040
 this part I have to jump here we go 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.600
 come on let's go good today I have to jump 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.070
 quickly and stay here 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.070
 and me and today 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.560
 do not 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.569
 come on and let's jump 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.640
 today we have to wait here not 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.560
 let's see if we are at the level 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.840
 number 49 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.360
 and here I 'm not sure if I have to 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.930
 here or if we keep walking we will try 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.710
 here 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.570
 do not 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.120
 it was an option had to approve what 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.150
 I feel sorry there so let's go 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.150
 wait 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.550
 We hope a little more and today we will 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.550
 run to run 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.190
 do not 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.190
 and as I saw how 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.139
 I'm not sure if I have to press that 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.370
 here let's stay I think that yes this is 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.370
 the key let's wait 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.490
 yes I think it's there but well I did not 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.490
 all right 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.050
 beautiful today 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.050
 do not 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:34.330
 we already know and when it comes down 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.330
 And if we go, come on let's go 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:43.330
 what's happening wow level number 49 I 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.330
 It cost me a lot and what will happen 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.770
 what graphics what is going to happen 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.470
 we left the limbo we found our 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.470
 sister according to history 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:04.710
 this level number 49 was intensive 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.630
 it was intense better said 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.010
 I remember you friends while we see this 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.320
 in slow motion that you can subscribe 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:14.660

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.660

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:24.730
 it will happen that will happen 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.730
 what happened to level 50 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.600
 what suspense 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.340
 we see at level 1 what happened 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:02.320
 that was it, so let's continue 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.320
 it is not the drama that brought us 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.000
 as you see friends, this is a game 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.000
 that is very, very good 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:19.700
 we still follow 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.700
 and what happens because it does not move 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.590
 I do not control it anymore 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.820
 wow what is happening 

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:46.089
 it's over the game friends are watching 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:50.169
 the credits so apparently there was no 

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:51.309
 a level 50 or I was wrong then 

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.649
 so friends I hope you liked it 

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:57.149
 we're done with this game and we 

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:57.149
 we see until the next
