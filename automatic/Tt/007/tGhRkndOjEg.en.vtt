00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
if you find that your nutmeg kind of

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.319 
if you find that your nutmeg kind of
maybe<00:01:43.770> clumps<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> little<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
maybe clumps up on you a little bit you

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.420 
maybe clumps up on you a little bit you
can<00:01:45.450> also<00:01:45.720> go<00:01:46.020> ahead<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.290> use<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> whisk<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.310> go

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
can also go ahead and use a whisk to go

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.280 
can also go ahead and use a whisk to go
ahead<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.850> break<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.600> there<00:01:48.780> now

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
ahead and break that up in there now

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.740 
ahead and break that up in there now
remember<00:01:49.770> you're<00:01:50.009> working<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.790> raw<00:01:51.360> eggs

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
remember you're working with raw eggs

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
remember you're working with raw eggs
here<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.439> need<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.920> make<00:01:53.070> sure<00:01:53.100> that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
here so you need to make sure that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490 
here so you need to make sure that
everything<00:01:53.970> stays<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.229> right

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
everything stays at the right

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.260 
everything stays at the right
temperature<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.399> stays<00:01:56.640> cold<00:01:56.909> because

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
temperature and it stays cold because

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.690 
temperature and it stays cold because
you<00:01:57.509> run<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> risk<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.439> salmonella<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.369> other

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you run the risk of salmonella and other

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.760 
you run the risk of salmonella and other
bacteria<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.299> can<00:02:00.570> develop<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.020> these<00:02:01.590> so

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
bacteria that can develop in these so

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.230 
bacteria that can develop in these so
that's<00:02:02.009> why<00:02:02.189> every<00:02:02.579> time<00:02:02.610> you're<00:02:02.909> done<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that's why every time you're done with a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.120 
that's why every time you're done with a
step<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.960> need<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.229> put<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.560> mixture<00:02:04.680> back

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
step you need to put your mixture back

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.530 
step you need to put your mixture back
into<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.520> fridge<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.790> make<00:02:06.119> sure<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.420> it

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
into the fridge to make sure that it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.169 
into the fridge to make sure that it
stays<00:02:06.750> cool<00:02:07.020> my<00:02:07.380> next<00:02:07.799> two<00:02:07.979> steps<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.640> I'm

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
stays cool my next two steps is I'm

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.089 
stays cool my next two steps is I'm
going<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> go<00:02:09.780> ahead<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.379> whip<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.860> cream

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
going to go ahead and whip the cream

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.130 
going to go ahead and whip the cream
until<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.730> forms<00:02:12.060> stiff<00:02:12.270> white

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
until it forms stiff white

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.200 
until it forms stiff white
and<00:02:13.560> I'm<00:02:13.710> also<00:02:13.950> going<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.640> beat<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.180> egg

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
and I'm also going to beat the egg

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.320 
and I'm also going to beat the egg
whites<00:02:15.840> until<00:02:16.140> they<00:02:16.620> do<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.800> same<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.430> then

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
whites until they do the same and then

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.170 
whites until they do the same and then
we'll<00:02:18.570> incorporate<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.380> into<00:02:19.680> our<00:02:19.920> mixture

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.410 

alright<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.020> can<00:02:25.200> see<00:02:25.470> I've<00:02:25.710> got<00:02:25.980> my
