00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello to you with a flashlight and today you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.059
 I'll tell you about the android game gives effect 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.230
 this is a first person shooter game 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.750
 Here is made on the unity engine, the engine is very 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.080
 cool we have for its time 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.100
 long he got a good 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.210
 reputation in terms of graphics for 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:30.949
 android devices here shooter is about 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.850
 zombies in space that is, it seems to me 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.910
 it looks like a dps computer game 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.790
 only truth from the first person 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.590
 let's see what's in the settings 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.710
 that is, the settings can be changed 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.399
 control 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:58.850
 for yourself to set up save save 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:02.850
 base jug that is free greenwood 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.239
 Well, that is, sensory build and all 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.479
 such a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:12.720
 so advanced overall i have graphics 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.520
 can be customized not at high costs by 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.409
 started as soon as the game downloaded she still 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.840
 was poorly optimized and stood on 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.450
 medium settings at high hour lair 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:29.430
 developers more than we optimized 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:36.150
 the game and on not so much lags so 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:42.780
 well fuck i will show the level the game 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:48.030
 show so here that is, it is possible to improve 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.280
 weapon you yourself can choose 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:57.900
 character start the game 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:59.610
 i.e. woman or man red 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:12.780
 it costs a little 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:18.950
 on such continue fear miss teen 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.950
 let's start it sounds smooth 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.220
 the toy is very cool it is in the play market 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:32.760
 free that's just 300 megabytes 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:37.950
 it pretty little weighs in for 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:42.420
 games with such graphics seem to be very necessary 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:46.050
 and the trigger might scare or it is worth 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:51.890
 course trigger added zombies in space 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.890
 until there was green blood on earth 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.329
 dozhma shotgun 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.230
 we take a zombie that's a zombie lying around 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.230
 they must be killed 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.069
 because then they will be you can 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.209
 it is not to see 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:37.730
 and a bunch of zombies will beat you 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:40.850
 the tournament was taking advantage of this one 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.690
 best to kill so with a shotgun not with 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:50.350
 first attempts are killed 20 ok 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.350
 killed by conscripts no 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.680
 so go 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.990
 change the part not on the shotgun she 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.940
 stun kill first time 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.300
 glow beautiful figure turnout on 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.979
 maximum stands at low there is no reflection 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.710
 here's a cool interaction with different 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.380
 subjects i like it a lot in this 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.340
 the game is really when the express here 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.800
 this is from dead space 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.139
 done because i remember on android 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.350
 on the tablet played DPS there too, you can 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:12.910
 was so doing an example in to the third person 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:12.910
 all the zombies will prepare Affairs 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:28.110
 they are coming 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:32.069
 oh I do not know what we discuss in advance 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.310

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.310
 beat 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.499
 against her 

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:01.989
 eat 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.120
 yes how many of these zombies are that when i 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:12.470
 I played them less I think I hope everything 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.330
 Well, here is such a game 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.840
 the level here is interesting that it is possible yes 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.819
 one more level here again their guns can 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.400
