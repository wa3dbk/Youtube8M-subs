this is the hardest part of this whole
deal<00:03:33.570> is<00:03:33.750> getting<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.530> same<00:03:34.770> lineup

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.860 

alright<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.840> looks<00:03:40.870> good

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.420 

ok<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.709> next<00:03:44.739> step<00:03:45.159> is<00:03:47.069> once<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.159> got<00:03:48.250> it<00:03:48.340> all

you play it to the meeting service of

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:08.009 
you play it to the meeting service of
that<00:03:59.940> adapter<00:04:00.940> like<00:04:01.480> I'm<00:04:01.629> doing<00:04:01.870> here<00:04:05.190> ok<00:04:07.019> like

step<00:06:34.240> is<00:06:36.450> this<00:06:37.450> is<00:06:37.660> a<00:06:38.040> gear<00:06:39.040> up<00:06:39.160> gunner<00:06:39.370> it

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
step is this is a gear up gunner it

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.670
