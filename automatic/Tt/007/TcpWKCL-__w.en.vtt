00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
number 65 that is one half of this

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.340 
number 65 that is one half of this
structure<00:02:31.730> known<00:02:32.000> as<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.180> Trigon<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.110> again

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
structure known as the Trigon and again

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.590 
structure known as the Trigon and again
you<00:02:33.890> can<00:02:34.070> see<00:02:34.220> at<00:02:34.310> one<00:02:34.550> apex<00:02:34.910> right<00:02:35.060> over<00:02:35.270> here

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
you can see at one apex right over here

you can see at one apex right over here
which<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.140> numbered<00:02:36.590> number<00:02:37.280> 66<00:02:37.880> on<00:02:38.120> this

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
which is numbered number 66 on this

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.690 
which is numbered number 66 on this
model<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.810> have<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.500> opening<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.370> ureter
