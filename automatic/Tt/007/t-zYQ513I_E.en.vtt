00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
pretty obvious but I got a haircut and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.830 
pretty obvious but I got a haircut and

permanent markers but you can also use

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.510

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.790 
like pencil crayons or crayons and I'm
just<00:05:13.759> drawing<00:05:13.940> on<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.509> flower<00:05:15.110> design<00:05:15.379> and

just drawing on a flower design and
basically<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.729> idea<00:05:17.090> is<00:05:17.180> just<00:05:17.360> to<00:05:17.720> use<00:05:17.900> cups

as<00:05:18.500> organizers<00:05:19.250> it<00:05:19.490> doesn't<00:05:19.729> have<00:05:19.819> to<00:05:19.970> be<00:05:20.090> like

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
as organizers it doesn't have to be like

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:27.399 
as organizers it doesn't have to be like
Starbucks<00:05:20.780> cups<00:05:21.110> or<00:05:21.319> anything<00:05:25.990> but<00:05:26.990> that<00:05:27.259> is

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409
