00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
green and the goal of the program is to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.750 
green and the goal of the program is to
reduce<00:00:54.899> your<00:00:55.289> red<00:00:55.410> lights<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:56.070> taught<00:00:56.430> me

eating<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.530> unhealthy<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.460> bought<00:01:02.820> me

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
eating really unhealthy and bought me

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.579

anymore<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.820> kids<00:01:06.090> will<00:01:06.180> set<00:01:06.510> goals<00:01:06.780> around

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
anymore so kids will set goals around

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.170 
anymore so kids will set goals around
how<00:01:08.189> many<00:01:08.400> red<00:01:08.549> lights<00:01:08.580> are<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> eat

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
how many red lights are going to eat

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
how many red lights are going to eat
each<00:01:09.299> week<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.930> as<00:01:10.619> they<00:01:10.799> meet<00:01:10.950> their<00:01:11.100> goals

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
each week and as they meet their goals

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.789 
each week and as they meet their goals
they<00:01:11.580> slowly<00:01:11.970> reduce<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.900> over<00:01:13.590> time

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
they slowly reduce them over time

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.700 
they slowly reduce them over time
because<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.760> kids<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.630> involved<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.439> in

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
because the kids are so involved in in

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.890 
because the kids are so involved in in
tracking<00:01:17.130> their<00:01:17.430> own<00:01:17.700> eating<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.479> exercise

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and setting their own goals they kind of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.980 
and setting their own goals they kind of
the<00:01:20.729> program<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.299> takes<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the program kind of takes it out of the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
the program kind of takes it out of the
parents<00:01:22.380> hands<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.700> huge<00:01:24.119> relief

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
parents hands and that's a huge relief

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.550 
parents hands and that's a huge relief
and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:24.930> start<00:01:25.140> talking<00:01:25.259> about

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
