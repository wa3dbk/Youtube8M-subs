00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730 
okay here's my Red Machine that I just

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.509 
okay here's my Red Machine that I just
made<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.000> started<00:00:06.390> using<00:00:07.099> it's<00:00:08.099> gonna<00:00:08.309> be<00:00:08.490> a

goes that way now you can kind of see
down<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:30.199> this<00:00:31.199> rope<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:34.550> I'm<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.760> using

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
down here this rope is I'm just using

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.569 
down here this rope is I'm just using
yarn<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.579> also<00:00:38.579> included<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.180> mylar

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
yarn for this and also included a mylar

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.040 
yarn for this and also included a mylar
filament<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.239> tell<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:42.960> the

filament and I tell you can see the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.200 
filament and I tell you can see the
silver<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.649> there<00:00:44.809> that's<00:00:47.000> you<00:00:48.000> know<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
silver right there that's you know to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.680 
silver right there that's you know to
make<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.510> conduct<00:00:49.350> electricity<00:00:50.360> you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.510> see

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
make it conduct electricity you can see

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.000 
make it conduct electricity you can see
down<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.620> spacer<00:00:53.930> you<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
down here is the spacer you use this to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.170 
down here is the spacer you use this to
keep<00:00:56.219> all<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.920> rope<00:00:58.920> from<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:02.940> from

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
keep all the rope from you know from

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.120 
keep all the rope from you know from
gathering<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.409> us<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.119> as<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.780> go<00:01:07.619> down<00:01:07.860> once

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
gathering on us and as you go down once

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.060 
gathering on us and as you go down once
it's<00:01:08.310> twisted<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.900> slide<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.040> down

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
it's twisted you just slide it down

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.270 
it's twisted you just slide it down
slowly<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.939> it'll<00:01:12.270> start<00:01:12.510> twisting<00:01:12.990> together

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.030 

here's<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.610> swivel<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.570> let<00:01:18.750> me<00:01:18.840> isn't<00:01:19.170> this

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
here's the swivel the let me isn't this

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.780 
here's the swivel the let me isn't this
is<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:22.400> just<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.580> toggle<00:01:24.200> swim<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.400> way<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
is a just a toggle swim and that way it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.890 
is a just a toggle swim and that way it
can<00:01:26.820> rotate<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.960> little<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:29.450> doesn't<00:01:30.450> write<00:01:30.750> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
can rotate a little bit doesn't write a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.950 
can rotate a little bit doesn't write a
whole<00:01:31.170> lot<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:32.210> it<00:01:33.210> doesn't<00:01:33.570> need<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.810> rotate

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
whole lot but it doesn't need to rotate

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.429 
whole lot but it doesn't need to rotate
a<00:01:34.200> whole<00:01:34.409> lot<00:01:35.210> I'm<00:01:36.210> also<00:01:36.390> using<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.810> pulley<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
a whole lot I'm also using a pulley to

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.660 
a whole lot I'm also using a pulley to
keep<00:01:37.680> tension<00:01:38.659> correct<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
keep tension correct on it and the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.660 
keep tension correct on it and the
pulleys<00:01:42.030> waited<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.229> case<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:44.100> waiting

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
pulleys waited in this case I'm waiting

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.800 
pulleys waited in this case I'm waiting
it<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> steel<00:01:45.630> pipe<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.570> use<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
it with a steel pipe and you can use a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.810 
it with a steel pipe and you can use a
sandbag<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.250> don't<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.790> right

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
sandbag but I just don't have one right

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.130 
sandbag but I just don't have one right
now<00:01:55.430> posted<00:01:56.430> another<00:01:56.670> video<00:01:57.000> later<00:01:57.240> about<00:01:57.630> how

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
now posted another video later about how

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.219 
now posted another video later about how
to<00:01:59.130> twist<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.790> once<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.240> have<00:02:00.450> somebody<00:02:01.049> who

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
to twist it up once I have somebody who

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.540 
to twist it up once I have somebody who
can<00:02:01.409> help<00:02:01.530> me<00:02:01.740> twist<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.700> up<00:02:02.820> thanks
