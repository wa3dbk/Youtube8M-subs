comments if you want me to do a video on
how<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.680> suppose<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:25.920> embroidery<00:01:26.640> but

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
how to suppose it's like embroidery but

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240 
how to suppose it's like embroidery but
not<00:01:26.970> really<00:01:27.200> but<00:01:28.200> yeah<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.530> some<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
not really but yeah I think some of you

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.649 
not really but yeah I think some of you
or<00:01:29.490> most<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> should<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.240> able<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> do

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
or most of you should be able to do

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.359 
or most of you should be able to do
anyway<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.140> make<00:01:31.350> sure<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.680> tell<00:01:31.920> me<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.220> you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
anyway but make sure to tell me if you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.870 
anyway but make sure to tell me if you
want<00:01:32.460> me<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.150> tutorial<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:35.340> here's<00:01:35.700> what

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
want me to do a tutorial so here's what

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.390 
want me to do a tutorial so here's what
it<00:01:35.909> looks<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.560> made<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> G<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> little

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it looks like and I made the G a little

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.999 
it looks like and I made the G a little
bit<00:01:38.520> small<00:01:38.759> but<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.329> okay<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.770> are

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
bit small but that's okay so now we are

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.249 
bit small but that's okay so now we are
going<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.400> use<00:01:41.640> all<00:01:41.939> these<00:01:42.299> color<00:01:42.630> felts<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
going to use all these color felts to

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.679 
going to use all these color felts to
cut<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> pieces<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.310> rainbow<00:01:44.689> then

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
cut out the pieces for the rainbow then

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.800 
cut out the pieces for the rainbow then
I<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.990> cut<00:01:46.259> out<00:01:46.290> some<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:47.490> London's<00:01:48.180> wiggly

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
I just cut out some like London's wiggly

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.289 
I just cut out some like London's wiggly
line<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.610> looks<00:01:50.700> better<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
line and I think it looks better if you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.440 
line and I think it looks better if you
