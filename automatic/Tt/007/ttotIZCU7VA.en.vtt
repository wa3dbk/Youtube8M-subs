00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.640
 hello drivers I'm stopping at one 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.439
 parking from a supermarket 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.809
 I see here how my car has the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.960
 parked cars 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:41.350
 Good, I'll tell you about it today. 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.350
 quina do capo concept of quina do bon 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.370
 I refer here in the hood are the tips 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.309
 the car here is the front or dive a 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.290
 Little there to see the hood of my flesh 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.750
 here is a machine there is another machine 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.629
 When I say that in the field, you 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:06.610
 have to stretch their necks almost to beat the 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:10.270
 head in life to look at the corner of the hood 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:16.210
 Look right here, the carriage column is 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.340
 here is the front glass windscreen 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.310
 so when I tell you, corner of the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.979
 hood is where your car starts and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.179
 where it ends there in the front where the hood 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:35.140
 starts and where the hood ends the here is 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:37.659
 one tip and there is another tip is not that the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.530
 People need to stretch their necks here. 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.340
 the glass to be able to see the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.399
 hood is for you to have a notion 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.829
 mentally develop the notion of where 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.999
 begins and ends the hood of your 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.420
 car 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:58.499
 so in my case it is a compact car is 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.569
 a small car and I already have 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:04.810
 built and developed the notion of 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.549
 where it begins and where it ends 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.910
 When I say here you have to 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.450
 abut the cowl 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.120
 look here in the hood i say the most 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.970
 close to an obstacle only defending 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.970
 not to hit that's what I'm there for 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.040
 Telling you, he almost pressed the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.569
 wall only defended not to hit understand 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.640
 so it slopes down on the corner of the hood 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.250
 on the obstacle wall 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:42.100
 just going down so I do not hit I'm 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:44.860
 Referring to study, I'm going to leave here. 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.450
 disengage the belt because even when I 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.550
 I'm waiting in the parking lot, I'm 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.060
 clinging to a belt 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.200
 you only have an exact notion of what I 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.200
 I'm talking to you. 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:09.060
 the quina of the caco is this one approaches the 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.060
 You're just defending not to knock. 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.500
 here is what i say 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.489
 for you here, you do not have to justify 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.909
 my neck is all that you can not imagine 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:38.450
 fia to be able to see the edge of the hood 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:41.870
 is a mental construction of so much that the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:46.970
 driver drives his car so much that the 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:49.640
 driver becomes familiar with it 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.140
 driving you mind developmental 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.659
 a construction where it ends and where 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.940
 The hood starts off, you know. 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.340
 exactly whether or not it will hit 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.319
 an okay maneuver 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.459
 I hope you have understood 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:11.780
 when I say mentally hood edge 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:14.599
 see where it ends where to the lighthouse of your 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.799
 car and approaching the maximum slot only 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:22.070
 not to beat that everything works fine and 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.259
 As for the wall here, it frightens not only the 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.349
 people have pedal control put a 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:30.500
 in catarrÃ© right not letting die 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:34.539
 who is not going there in the wall not ok staff 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.539
 We came back with more videos then
