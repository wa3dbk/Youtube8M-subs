one<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> best<00:01:10.979> controllers<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.909> have<00:01:12.030> ever

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
one of the best controllers I have ever

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.440 
one of the best controllers I have ever
used<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.979> when<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> comes<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.549> being<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.030> no<00:01:15.210> SLO

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
used up when it comes to being a no SLO

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.370 
used up when it comes to being a no SLO
controller<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.680> sensitivity<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
controller if the sensitivity on it is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.510 
controller if the sensitivity on it is
absolutely<00:01:19.380> unreal<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.340> also

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
absolutely unreal but it's also

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.609 
absolutely unreal but it's also
partially<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.990> no<00:01:22.200> slopes<00:01:22.500> in

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
partially because there is no slopes in

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
partially because there is no slopes in
any<00:01:22.920> direction<00:01:23.070> whatsoever<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.939> used<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
any direction whatsoever so I used to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.969 
any direction whatsoever so I used to
play<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.689> three<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.049> four<00:01:25.080> sensitivity<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:25.920> I

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
play on three or four sensitivity but I

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.210 
play on three or four sensitivity but I
had<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.189> drop<00:01:26.369> down<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.820> two<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.450> three

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
had to drop down to two and three

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.890 
had to drop down to two and three
occasionally<00:01:29.220> because<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.640> how<00:01:29.729> fast<00:01:30.030> how

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
occasionally because of how fast how

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.609 
occasionally because of how fast how
fast<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.350> reaction<00:01:31.740> time<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:33.590> tried<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
fast the reaction time is I tried I

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.050 
fast the reaction time is I tried I
thought<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.340> was<00:01:35.490> playing<00:01:35.670> bad<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.000> this

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
thought I was playing bad with this

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
thought I was playing bad with this
controller<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.470> tried<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> play<00:01:38.009> with<00:01:38.159> my

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
controller and I tried to play with my

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.490 
controller and I tried to play with my
my<00:01:38.909> new<00:01:39.090> custom<00:01:39.299> controller<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.049> received

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
my new custom controller that I received

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
my new custom controller that I received
and<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.759> couldn't<00:01:42.329> play<00:01:42.479> with<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.750> there

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and it's a I couldn't play with it there

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.179 
and it's a I couldn't play with it there
was<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.960> slow<00:01:43.229> turning<00:01:43.619> almost<00:01:43.860> every<00:01:44.040> single

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
was a slow turning almost every single

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.740 
was a slow turning almost every single
direction<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.820> noticed<00:01:45.210> after<00:01:45.390> playing

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
direction that I noticed after playing

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.240 
direction that I noticed after playing
with<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.049> controller<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.009> middle

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
with this controller and in the middle
