four<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.720> wheels<00:01:37.430> now<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
four of the wheels now I'm just going to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310

leave<00:01:39.060> i'm<00:01:39.210> setting<00:01:39.509> there<00:01:39.659> because<00:01:39.990> there's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
leave i'm setting there because there's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.690

nothing<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.430> them<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
nothing really I can do with them at the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
nothing really I can do with them at the
moment<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:43.220> then<00:01:44.220> we<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.869> this<00:01:45.869> other

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
moment and then we have this other

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.320 
moment and then we have this other
little<00:01:47.060> build<00:01:48.060> here

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.140 

here<00:01:55.330> we<00:01:55.450> go<00:01:56.100> that's<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.400> other<00:01:57.550> part<00:01:57.880> of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
here we go that's the other part of

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.100 
here we go that's the other part of
today<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.790> I<00:02:02.940> don't<00:02:03.940> know<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.210> think<00:02:04.330> today's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
today so I don't know I think today's

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.830 
today so I don't know I think today's
advent<00:02:06.070> calendar<00:02:06.370> was<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.550> little<00:02:06.850> boring<00:02:07.090> so

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
advent calendar was a little boring so

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.780 
advent calendar was a little boring so

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.570 
hopefully tomorrow will be more
interesting<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.630> we<00:02:11.350> can<00:02:11.560> actually<00:02:11.800> build<00:02:12.310> a

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
interesting and we can actually build a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.080 
interesting and we can actually build a
little<00:02:12.850> car<00:02:13.150> hopefully<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:14.280> don't<00:02:15.280> know<00:02:15.340> anyway

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
little car hopefully I don't know anyway

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.910 
little car hopefully I don't know anyway
come<00:02:16.690> back<00:02:16.870> tomorrow<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.460> see<00:02:18.460> what<00:02:18.580> happens
