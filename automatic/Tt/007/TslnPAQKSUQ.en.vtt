get unboxing him I guess um let's take a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.889 
get unboxing him I guess um let's take a
look<00:00:37.440> at<00:00:37.590> all<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.100> stuff<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.489> its<00:00:38.640> box<00:00:38.850> okay<00:00:39.840> so

look at all the stuff on its box okay so

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.569 
look at all the stuff on its box okay so
let's<00:00:40.200> start<00:00:40.410> out<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.770> type<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.460> day

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
let's start out with the type of the day

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.420 
let's start out with the type of the day
it<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> defense<00:00:42.690> side<00:00:42.899> slick<00:00:43.350> well<00:00:44.160> just

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it is a defense side slick well just

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.270 
it is a defense side slick well just
like<00:00:44.610> um<00:00:44.850> gravity<00:00:45.570> destroyer<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:47.100> have

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
like um gravity destroyer and we have

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.060 
like um gravity destroyer and we have
twisted<00:00:47.760> tempos<00:00:48.149> code<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.890> have

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
twisted tempos code here then we have

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.380 
twisted tempos code here then we have
the<00:00:50.219> date<00:00:50.399> sends<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.800> transparent<00:00:52.800> up<00:00:53.390> track

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
the date sends a transparent up track

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.729 
the date sends a transparent up track
and<00:00:54.660> bottom<00:00:55.199> forget<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.890> twisted<00:00:56.399> tempo

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
and bottom forget the so twisted tempo

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.029 
and bottom forget the so twisted tempo
then<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.190> the<00:01:00.180> vac<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.829> read

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
then we have the vac and you can read

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.529 
then we have the vac and you can read
the<00:01:02.219> stats<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.760> want<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.149> think<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.449> should

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the stats if you want I think it should

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
the stats if you want I think it should
given<00:01:03.840> him<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.650> bit<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:04.949> defense<00:01:05.309> stat

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
given him a little bit more defense stat

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.179 
given him a little bit more defense stat
since<00:01:05.939> result<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> heaviest<00:01:07.560> metal<00:01:08.040> wheel

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
since result is the heaviest metal wheel

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.420 
since result is the heaviest metal wheel
out<00:01:08.400> right<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.090> believe<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.590> believe<00:01:10.979> it's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
out right now I believe I believe it's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.350 
out right now I believe I believe it's
still<00:01:11.580> currently<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> highest<00:01:12.750> weight<00:01:13.409> for

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
still currently the highest weight for

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.499 
still currently the highest weight for
for<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> fusion<00:01:16.950> wheel<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> metal

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
for for a fusion wheel to be or a metal

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.740 
for for a fusion wheel to be or a metal
meal<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.409> yeah<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.390> only<00:01:21.479> spend

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
meal to be so yeah you can only spend

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.920 
meal to be so yeah you can only spend
right<00:01:21.990> unlike<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.820> ratty<00:01:23.820> destroyer<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.750> let's

what they did with Tucker told me so I
guess<00:02:11.989> that<00:02:12.019> last<00:02:12.440> what<00:02:12.560> has<00:02:12.680> was<00:02:12.920> going<00:02:13.190> to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
guess that last what has was going to

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.720 
guess that last what has was going to
then<00:02:14.060> we<00:02:14.300> have<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.930> then<00:02:15.769> we<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.400> my<00:02:16.489> camera

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
then we have the then we and my camera

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.360 
then we have the then we and my camera
growing<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.180> battery<00:02:17.510> again<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.890> have<00:02:19.069> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
growing and battery again so we have the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.910 
growing and battery again so we have the
right<00:02:19.880> speed<00:02:20.090> launcher<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:21.620> have<00:02:21.769> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
right speed launcher and we have the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.740 
right speed launcher and we have the
regular<00:02:22.069> record<00:02:22.849> which<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.150> probably<00:02:23.360> not<00:02:23.630> be

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
regular record which I probably not be

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.720 
regular record which I probably not be
taking<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:24.950> probably<00:02:25.190> won't<00:02:25.370> take<00:02:25.700> it

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
taking out so I probably won't take it

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
taking out so I probably won't take it
out<00:02:26.200> right<00:02:27.200> now<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.790> let's<00:02:29.120> get<00:02:29.209> started<00:02:29.360> with

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
heavy then we have a clock looking like

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.599 
heavy then we have a clock looking like
clear<00:03:38.120> wheel<00:03:38.739> let<00:03:39.739> me<00:03:39.829> get<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.010> closer<00:03:40.220> look<00:03:40.459> at

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
clear wheel let me get a closer look at

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.330 
clear wheel let me get a closer look at
those<00:03:41.410> okay<00:03:42.410> now<00:03:42.560> you<00:03:42.620> should<00:03:42.889> be<00:03:42.920> able<00:03:43.010> to

those okay now you should be able to
really<00:03:44.090> look<00:03:44.239> at<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.480> detail<00:03:44.889> so<00:03:45.889> here<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.250> the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
really look at the detail so here is the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.740 
really look at the detail so here is the
clock<00:03:47.540> size<00:03:47.870> stuff<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:48.739> says<00:03:49.100> something<00:03:49.750> for

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
clock size stuff and says something for

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.949 
clock size stuff and says something for
the<00:03:51.290> four<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.340> don't<00:03:52.459> like<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.959> whatever

stuff so yeah then we have the clocks

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.910 
stuff so yeah then we have the clocks
thought<00:04:04.700> numbers

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
thought numbers

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.390 
thought numbers
let's<00:04:06.280> get<00:04:06.520> you<00:04:07.620> awesome<00:04:08.620> art<00:04:08.830> oh<00:04:09.040> my<00:04:09.190> gosh

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
let's get you awesome art oh my gosh

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.290 
let's get you awesome art oh my gosh
this<00:04:09.550> is<00:04:09.610> heavy<00:04:10.260> so<00:04:11.260> we<00:04:11.500> have<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:12.640> twisted<00:04:13.090> or

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
this is heavy so we have the twisted or

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.740 
this is heavy so we have the twisted or
basalt<00:04:13.750> it's<00:04:14.200> really<00:04:14.560> heavy<00:04:14.709> actually

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
basalt it's really heavy actually

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.440 
basalt it's really heavy actually
heaviest<00:04:16.750> metal<00:04:17.200> wheel<00:04:17.320> out<00:04:17.590> i<00:04:18.280> believe<00:04:18.639> so

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
heaviest metal wheel out i believe so

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.479 
heaviest metal wheel out i believe so
far<00:04:19.720> I<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:19.959> still<00:04:20.560> think<00:04:20.769> it's<00:04:20.859> currently<00:04:21.280> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
far I I still think it's currently the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.580 
far I I still think it's currently the
highest<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:23.380> I'm<00:04:23.500> not<00:04:23.620> sure<00:04:25.110> so<00:04:26.110> yeah<00:04:26.290> the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
highest so I'm not sure so yeah the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.220 
highest so I'm not sure so yeah the
round<00:04:26.860> edges<00:04:27.130> really<00:04:27.610> help<00:04:27.820> with<00:04:27.940> defense<00:04:28.389> but

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
round edges really help with defense but

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.850 
round edges really help with defense but
in<00:04:29.380> some<00:04:29.620> tourneys<00:04:29.940> basalt<00:04:30.940> or<00:04:31.180> twisted<00:04:31.660> is

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
in some tourneys basalt or twisted is

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.379 
in some tourneys basalt or twisted is
illegal<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.070> you<00:04:33.160> can't<00:04:33.490> use<00:04:33.669> them<00:04:33.880> I<00:04:34.030> believe

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
illegal and you can't use them I believe

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.530 
illegal and you can't use them I believe
that's<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:35.530> in<00:04:35.710> like<00:04:35.919> hash<00:04:36.160> bro<00:04:36.430> or<00:04:36.669> wbba

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
that's so in like hash bro or wbba

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:44.520 
that's so in like hash bro or wbba
tournaments<00:04:38.850> ladies<00:04:42.120> so<00:04:43.120> and<00:04:43.479> i<00:04:43.990> have<00:04:44.229> the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
cool looking clear and we have the piece

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.930 
cool looking clear and we have the piece
that<00:04:55.330> i<00:04:55.600> do<00:04:55.750> not<00:04:56.080> want<00:04:56.380> to<00:04:56.470> be<00:04:56.680> wanted<00:04:57.639> to<00:04:57.820> be

broken nope it's not broken it's just
the<00:05:00.550> way<00:05:00.610> it's<00:05:00.820> designed<00:05:00.940> because<00:05:01.360> it's

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
the way it's designed because it's

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.750 
the way it's designed because it's
transparent<00:05:02.970> so<00:05:04.200> yeah<00:05:05.200> if<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.220> barely<00:05:06.490> see

the w/d my second one fall this is my
second<00:05:10.479> w/d<00:05:12.240> because<00:05:13.240> of<00:05:13.419> gravity<00:05:13.810> destroyer

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
second w/d because of gravity destroyer

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.529 
second w/d because of gravity destroyer
so<00:05:14.770> now<00:05:14.919> let's<00:05:15.100> get<00:05:15.280> now<00:05:15.640> let's<00:05:15.910> put<00:05:16.270> together

hell kerbecs and all the other good
stuff<00:06:35.460> that<00:06:35.670> happened<00:06:35.940> in<00:06:36.000> the<00:06:36.120> TV<00:06:36.420> show<00:06:36.450> so

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
stuff that happened in the TV show so

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.700 
stuff that happened in the TV show so
yeah<00:06:37.680> I<00:06:37.980> saw<00:06:38.700> CS<00:06:39.060> later<00:06:39.300> and<00:06:39.570> that<00:06:40.230> was<00:06:40.530> my

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
yeah I saw CS later and that was my

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.420 
yeah I saw CS later and that was my
twisted<00:06:41.220> tempo<00:06:41.490> unboxing<00:06:42.500> so<00:06:43.500> I<00:06:43.770> guess<00:06:43.830> I<00:06:44.100> will

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
twisted tempo unboxing so I guess I will

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.110 
twisted tempo unboxing so I guess I will
see<00:06:44.460> us<00:06:44.850> there<00:06:45.060> and<00:06:45.270> buy
