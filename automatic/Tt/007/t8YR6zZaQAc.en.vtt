00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.870 

when<00:00:06.470> I<00:00:06.500> when<00:00:06.740> I<00:00:06.800> first<00:00:06.950> got<00:00:07.130> the<00:00:07.279> project<00:00:07.700> it

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
when I when I first got the project it

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.370 
when I when I first got the project it
was<00:00:08.120> obvious<00:00:08.510> that<00:00:08.540> it<00:00:08.750> was<00:00:08.840> going<00:00:08.930> to<00:00:08.990> be<00:00:09.170> red

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
was obvious that it was going to be red

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.799 
was obvious that it was going to be red
and<00:00:10.309> then<00:00:10.790> it<00:00:10.910> had<00:00:11.000> to<00:00:11.120> be<00:00:11.150> a<00:00:11.270> very<00:00:11.540> specific

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
and then it had to be a very specific

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.379 
and then it had to be a very specific
right<00:00:12.230> it<00:00:12.350> couldn't<00:00:12.559> just<00:00:12.590> be<00:00:12.710> any<00:00:12.950> red<00:00:13.219> and<00:00:13.460> we

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
right it couldn't just be any red and we

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.840 
right it couldn't just be any red and we
did<00:00:14.510> a<00:00:14.539> little<00:00:14.719> research<00:00:14.930> in<00:00:15.550> Ferrari<00:00:16.550> red

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
did a little research in Ferrari red

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.200 
did a little research in Ferrari red
actually<00:00:17.600> is<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.800> italian<00:00:19.100> national<00:00:19.490> racing

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
actually is the italian national racing

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.150 
actually is the italian national racing
color<00:00:20.390> it's<00:00:20.660> rosso<00:00:21.080> corsa<00:00:21.110> which<00:00:21.679> means<00:00:21.920> race

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
color it's rosso corsa which means race

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.929 
color it's rosso corsa which means race
red<00:00:22.429> and<00:00:23.019> back<00:00:24.019> starting<00:00:24.529> in<00:00:24.619> the<00:00:24.650> 20s<00:00:25.160> while

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
red and back starting in the 20s while

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.960 
red and back starting in the 20s while
any<00:00:26.390> race<00:00:27.050> car<00:00:27.320> that<00:00:27.650> came<00:00:27.830> from<00:00:28.009> Italy<00:00:28.339> was

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
any race car that came from Italy was

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.060 
any race car that came from Italy was
that<00:00:29.179> color<00:00:29.419> just<00:00:30.140> like<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:30.619> French<00:00:30.830> cars

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
that color just like the French cars

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.210 
that color just like the French cars
were<00:00:31.220> blue<00:00:31.429> the<00:00:31.820> American<00:00:32.630> cars<00:00:32.810> were<00:00:32.930> white

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
were blue the American cars were white

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.530 
were blue the American cars were white
so<00:00:34.220> it's<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.430> Italian<00:00:34.790> national<00:00:34.940> racing

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
so it's the Italian national racing

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.120 
so it's the Italian national racing
color<00:00:35.720> so<00:00:35.900> that<00:00:35.930> was<00:00:36.140> obvious<00:00:36.829> from<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.100> start

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
color so that was obvious from the start

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.720 
color so that was obvious from the start
that<00:00:37.400> we<00:00:37.579> had<00:00:37.730> it<00:00:38.000> had<00:00:38.239> had<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.510> be<00:00:38.629> red

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.010 

yeah<00:00:42.730> when<00:00:42.880> we<00:00:42.970> did<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.180> sketches<00:00:43.540> most<00:00:43.750> of<00:00:43.930> it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
yeah when we did the sketches most of it

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
yeah when we did the sketches most of it
made<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.290> there<00:00:44.470> but<00:00:44.590> there's<00:00:44.740> a<00:00:44.830> couple

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
made it there but there's a couple

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.820 
made it there but there's a couple
things<00:00:45.400> that<00:00:45.580> were<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:47.230> know<00:00:47.260> look<00:00:47.530> good<00:00:47.650> in<00:00:47.770> a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
things that were you know look good in a

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.170 
things that were you know look good in a
sketch<00:00:48.100> doesn't<00:00:48.460> always<00:00:48.640> mean<00:00:48.760> it<00:00:48.910> looks<00:00:49.030> good

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
sketch doesn't always mean it looks good

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.510 
sketch doesn't always mean it looks good
in<00:00:49.240> real<00:00:49.390> life<00:00:49.540> so<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.920> of<00:00:51.040> those<00:00:51.130> things<00:00:51.310> was

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.520 
in real life so one of those things was

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.190 
in real life so one of those things was
the<00:00:51.640> grill<00:00:51.820> we<00:00:52.270> knew<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.570> flat<00:00:52.780> black<00:00:52.960> would

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
the grill we knew the flat black would

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.780 
the grill we knew the flat black would
look<00:00:53.230> good<00:00:53.440> but<00:00:53.710> we<00:00:53.770> weren't<00:00:53.890> sure<00:00:54.100> if<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.370> the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
look good but we weren't sure if the the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.550 
look good but we weren't sure if the the
red<00:00:54.970> inserts<00:00:55.330> would<00:00:55.810> be<00:00:55.930> too<00:00:56.110> much<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.500> then

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
red inserts would be too much and then

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.750 
red inserts would be too much and then
if<00:00:56.740> you<00:00:56.860> notice<00:00:57.130> where<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.310> stripe<00:00:57.580> goes

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
if you notice where the stripe goes

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.970 
if you notice where the stripe goes
through<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.060> grill<00:00:58.239> that<00:00:58.960> insert<00:00:59.620> is<00:00:59.770> black

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
through the grill that insert is black

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.190 
through the grill that insert is black
to<00:01:00.400> continue<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:00.940> stripe<00:01:01.180> through<00:01:01.420> so<00:01:01.660> we

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
to continue the stripe through so we

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
to continue the stripe through so we
thought<00:01:02.380> that<00:01:02.440> that<00:01:02.650> was<00:01:02.770> a<00:01:02.830> really<00:01:03.010> neat

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
thought that that was a really neat

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.520 
thought that that was a really neat
detail<00:01:03.550> but<00:01:03.700> might<00:01:04.300> be<00:01:04.540> kind<00:01:04.900> of<00:01:04.989> looks<00:01:05.380> good

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
detail but might be kind of looks good

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.960 
detail but might be kind of looks good
in<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.680> sketch<00:01:05.920> but<00:01:06.220> not<00:01:06.460> so<00:01:06.610> much<00:01:06.700> in<00:01:06.760> real

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
in the sketch but not so much in real

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.130 
in the sketch but not so much in real
life<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.270> we<00:01:07.330> were<00:01:07.420> surprised<00:01:07.750> i<00:01:07.870> mean<00:01:08.020> we

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
life and we were surprised i mean we

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.210 
life and we were surprised i mean we
thought<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.410> looked<00:01:08.470> great<00:01:08.620> we<00:01:08.890> saw<00:01:09.070> it

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
thought it looked great we saw it

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.990 
thought it looked great we saw it
painted<00:01:09.640> on<00:01:09.760> the<00:01:09.880> car<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.720> looked<00:01:11.020> awesome

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
painted on the car and it looked awesome

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.930 
painted on the car and it looked awesome
and<00:01:13.000> if<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:13.869> look<00:01:14.020> at<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.200> badging<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:15.729> all

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
and if you look at the badging it's all

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.450 
and if you look at the badging it's all
gloss<00:01:16.240> black<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.750> match<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.080> stripe<00:01:17.290> and<00:01:17.530> we

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
gloss black to match the stripe and we

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.240 
gloss black to match the stripe and we
did<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.759> because<00:01:19.030> we<00:01:19.180> we<00:01:19.960> wanted<00:01:20.229> to<00:01:20.259> take<00:01:20.500> as

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
did that because we we wanted to take as

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.580 
did that because we we wanted to take as
much<00:01:21.880> chrome<00:01:22.210> off<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.540> car<00:01:22.720> as<00:01:22.840> we<00:01:22.960> could<00:01:23.140> so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
much chrome off the car as we could so

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.740 
much chrome off the car as we could so
it<00:01:23.710> was<00:01:23.830> even<00:01:24.100> you<00:01:24.550> know<00:01:24.670> even<00:01:24.880> sporty-er<00:01:25.570> than

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
twenty two years or something go on then

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.930 
twenty two years or something go on then
we<00:02:57.420> did<00:02:57.540> down<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.930> true<00:02:58.380> Ferrari<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.190> home<00:02:59.430> so

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.530 
yeah to like the traditional beige
interior<00:03:03.330> when<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.930> have<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.290> read<00:03:04.470> exterior

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
interior when you have to read exterior

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.380 
interior when you have to read exterior
the<00:03:06.540> first<00:03:06.810> reaction<00:03:06.990> was<00:03:07.320> like<00:03:07.470> oh<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.160> then

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
the first reaction was like oh and then

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.180 
the first reaction was like oh and then
but<00:03:09.390> people<00:03:09.780> started<00:03:10.080> liking<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.800> because<00:03:11.100> the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
but people started liking it because the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.260 
but people started liking it because the
exterior<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.030> crazy<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:12.930> we<00:03:13.170> had<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:14.270> find

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
exterior is so crazy so we had to find

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.150 
exterior is so crazy so we had to find
something<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.810> kind<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.260> matched

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.410 

I think<00:03:19.430> that<00:03:19.610> bringing<00:03:19.820> those<00:03:20.030> two<00:03:20.240> together

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
I think that bringing those two together

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.130 
I think that bringing those two together
is<00:03:21.110> something<00:03:21.670> really<00:03:22.670> special<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.180> I<00:03:23.900> think

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
is something really special and I think

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.500 
is something really special and I think
it's<00:03:24.290> something<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:25.090> now<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.330> we're<00:03:26.480> all

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
it's something that now that we're all

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.020 
it's something that now that we're all
part<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.110> same<00:03:27.260> group<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:28.640> makes<00:03:28.850> it

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
part of the same group that it makes it

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.320 
part of the same group that it makes it
just<00:03:29.060> makes<00:03:29.360> sense<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.920> I<00:03:31.700> think<00:03:31.790> if<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.180> look

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
just makes sense and I think if you look

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
just makes sense and I think if you look
at<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.570> grand<00:03:32.810> cherokee<00:03:33.200> srt8<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:35.180> a<00:03:35.420> very

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
at the grand cherokee srt8 it's a very

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.040 
at the grand cherokee srt8 it's a very
unique<00:03:36.680> product<00:03:37.130> it's<00:03:38.090> something<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:39.020> you

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
unique product it's something that you

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.410 
unique product it's something that you
can't<00:03:39.320> find<00:03:39.530> anywhere<00:03:39.830> else<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.700> it's<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:44.180> can

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
can't find anywhere else and it's it can

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.140 
can't find anywhere else and it's it can
be<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:45.290> know<00:03:45.320> your<00:03:45.620> sports<00:03:45.980> car<00:03:46.220> all<00:03:46.520> year

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
be you know your sports car all year

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.940 
be you know your sports car all year
round<00:03:47.180> you<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.080> have<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.230> foot<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:48.530> snow<00:03:48.560> and

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
round you can have a foot of snow and

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.850 
round you can have a foot of snow and
you<00:03:49.310> can<00:03:49.430> still<00:03:49.610> drive<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:49.820> car<00:03:50.710> so<00:03:51.710> I<00:03:51.740> think

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860
