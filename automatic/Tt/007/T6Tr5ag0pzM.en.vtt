00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the training program it is very

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.440 
the training program it is very
competitive<00:00:30.420> yeah<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:31.140> very<00:00:32.450> other

competitive yeah it's very other

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.000 
competitive yeah it's very other
surgical<00:00:33.780> programs<00:00:34.200> are<00:00:34.350> very<00:00:34.500> competitive

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
surgical programs are very competitive

surgical programs are very competitive
as<00:00:35.100> well<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.750> although<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.960> know<00:00:37.079> numbers

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
as well and although you know numbers

as well and although you know numbers
isn't<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.739> great<00:00:37.950> guide<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> think<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.120> know

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
isn't a great guide but I think you know

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.869 
isn't a great guide but I think you know
it<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:40.020> each<00:00:40.170> year<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.280> level<00:00:41.520> which<00:00:41.760> is

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it is in each year at my level which is

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.010 
it is in each year at my level which is
a<00:00:41.910> junior<00:00:42.210> must<00:00:42.360> level<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> get<00:00:42.809> into

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
a junior must level to get into

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.840 
a junior must level to get into
neurosurgery<00:00:43.379> looking<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.340> 13<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
neurosurgery looking at you know 13 to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090 
neurosurgery looking at you know 13 to
14<00:00:44.969> places<00:00:45.570> which<00:00:45.750> are<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> whole<00:00:46.649> country

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
14 places which are in the whole country

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.970 
14 places which are in the whole country
in<00:00:47.309> terms<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.000> full<00:00:48.690> training<00:00:48.989> pathway<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
in terms of a full training pathway and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.590 
in terms of a full training pathway and
then<00:00:50.129> at<00:00:50.250> other<00:00:50.370> levels<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> number<00:00:51.030> say<00:00:51.360> even

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
then at other levels the number say even

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.389 
then at other levels the number say even
less<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> knowledge<00:00:53.100> it's

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
less it's not just the knowledge it's

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.389 
less it's not just the knowledge it's
also<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.850> ability<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.539> be<00:00:54.660> able<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.280> you<00:00:56.280> know

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
also your ability to be able to you know

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.270 
also your ability to be able to you know
to<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.730> able<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.500> do<00:00:58.500> procedures<00:00:58.829> under

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to be able to do procedures under

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.680 
to be able to do procedures under
pressure<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> supervision<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.539> other

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
pressure and a supervision of other

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.319 
pressure and a supervision of other
people<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:01.770> lots<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.329> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
people you know there are lots of you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.369 
people you know there are lots of you
know<00:01:03.359> some<00:01:03.600> people<00:01:03.750> come<00:01:04.110> under<00:01:04.350> pressure

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
know some people come under pressure

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.010 
know some people come under pressure
don't<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.580> performance<00:01:05.820> anxiety<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.869> know

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
don't get performance anxiety you know

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.980 
don't get performance anxiety you know
they're<00:01:07.290> also<00:01:07.409> things<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:08.479> in<00:01:09.479> high

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
they're also things about in high

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.510 
they're also things about in high
pressure<00:01:10.170> situations<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.979> theatres<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> have

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
pressure situations in theatres you have

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.130 
pressure situations in theatres you have
to<00:01:11.640> stay<00:01:11.820> calm<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.659> definitely<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> step

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
to stay calm so it is definitely a step

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.600 
to stay calm so it is definitely a step
up<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.830> how<00:01:13.950> procedures<00:01:14.369> being<00:01:14.520> done

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
up you see how procedures being done

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.760 
up you see how procedures being done
then<00:01:15.000> gradually<00:01:15.420> go<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> stage<00:01:16.500> where

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
then gradually go on to a stage where

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.679 
then gradually go on to a stage where
you<00:01:17.070> know<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.210> pass<00:01:18.420> through<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
you know you do pass through the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
you know you do pass through the
procedure<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.320> then<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.920> go<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> be

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
procedure and then then you go on to be

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.160 
procedure and then then you go on to be
able<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.909> do<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.450> whole<00:01:21.630> procedure<00:01:21.960> under

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
able to do the whole procedure under

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.840 
able to do the whole procedure under
supervision<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.040> finally<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.820> know

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
supervision and then finally you know

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.310 
supervision and then finally you know
you<00:01:24.180> get<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> stage<00:01:24.780> where<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.200> them

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you get to a stage where you can do them

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.929 
you get to a stage where you can do them
independently<00:01:25.860> when<00:01:26.159> you're<00:01:26.310> building<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
independently when you're building up to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.850 
independently when you're building up to
it<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:28.020> things<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.710> can

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it you can do things you know you can

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.890 
it you can do things you know you can
build<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.280> CV<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.810> know

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
