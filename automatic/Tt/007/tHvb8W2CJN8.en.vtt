00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.230
 for the wind 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.630
 what pastables here in general I 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.369
 I bring a trick to the call of duty 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.560
 black ops 2 for the monsoon mis in the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.360
 map origins and for that trick we're going to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.340
 necessarily need the gramophone 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.349
 and the music disc to be able to enter 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.259
 in this room the hall of the gods like 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.820
 I call him the room where the 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.220
 four statues to build the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.590
 sticks with this trick we're going to 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.420
 get the panzer to stay 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.730
 blocked as you see envious 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.200
 completely frozen and all the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.480
 provisions behind him are left 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.190
 stuck from treat the a to that is a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.560
 very good trick is worth then we have 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.480
 to go down here after the 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.910
 long runs to the left some 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.100
 And look chiquitas falls on the floor 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.650
 white stripe that soil that is a failure of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.420
 textures then you have to put yourself right to a 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.430
 millimeter to the left just like today in 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.170
 the video is to come here right 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.090
 when we see the white area just 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.170
 you have to stick to the wall while 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.450
 crouched 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.090
 what we are going to with this trick is how 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.250
 You see that the panzer remains 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.130
 blocked all while throwing us game 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.210
 but a game that will never give us 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.740
 and all those who come for 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.420
 behind the 6 van they will be left 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.190
 hooked in the back as 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.680
 you are seeing in the video some other 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.930
 zombie escapes just like I've seen and 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.729
 it can also be that they come to us 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.799
 back it's worth but it's always going to be a 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.020
 minimal part of all the others are going to 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.880
 be behind the panzer this trick not 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.580
 it is far from it to make rounds 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.679
 infinite but let's go, much less is 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.509
 simply for when the 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.819
 panzer in case we want to reserve it for 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.970
 anything we can go killing 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.710
 zombies and and without him bothering us okay 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.289
 because the rules that he appears usually 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.940
 always bother and it is already has no more 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.380
 the bonuses can also be 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.509
 catch is to go fast towards 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.950
 bonuses and return to the site fast 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.770
 if we do everything fast the panzer ni 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.740
 is going to move but if we go and we 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.020
 we return unfortunately the barracks we 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.020
 will continue so nothing is a very very trick 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.209
 simple simply place 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.229
 where I said and it is already has no more 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.300
 So nothing 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.500
 trick dislike favorites subscribe to my 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.500
