the lake is here because about 7,700
years<00:00:40.320> ago<00:00:40.650> the<00:00:41.460> volcano<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.300> stood<00:00:42.600> here

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
years ago the volcano that stood here

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.160 
years ago the volcano that stood here
had<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> cataclysmic<00:00:44.040> eruption<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.900> as<00:00:45.900> the

magma<00:00:46.410> chamber<00:00:46.590> deflated<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:48.240> like<00:00:48.390> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
magma chamber deflated is just like a

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
big hole so the top of the mountain fell

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.570 
big hole so the top of the mountain fell
down<00:00:54.570> thousands<00:00:55.560> and<00:00:55.710> thousands<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.160> feet<00:00:56.370> to

bigger of the two islands it's a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.520 
bigger of the two islands it's a
relatively<00:01:05.280> new<00:01:05.460> cinder<00:01:06.030> cone<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.600> grew<00:01:07.380> up

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
relatively new cinder cone that grew up

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890 
relatively new cinder cone that grew up
in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> caldera<00:01:08.369> after<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> collapse<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.750> the

in the caldera after the collapse of the
volcano<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:11.640> our<00:01:11.790> second<00:01:12.240> island<00:01:12.510> on

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
volcano and then our second island on

volcano and then our second island on
the<00:01:12.630> east<00:01:12.720> side<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.260> phantom<00:01:13.710> ship<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.220> that's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the east side is phantom ship and that's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.250 
the east side is phantom ship and that's
actually<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.360> remnants<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.020> of<00:01:16.170> the

actually the remnants of one of the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.130 
actually the remnants of one of the
earliest<00:01:16.710> volcanoes<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.570> made<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
earliest volcanoes here that made up the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.320 
earliest volcanoes here that made up the
mountain<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.590> phantom<00:01:19.920> cone<00:01:23.030> right<00:01:24.030> now

the<00:01:41.930> phantom<00:01:42.440> ship<00:01:42.680> is<00:01:42.920> actually<00:01:43.490> more<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.450> a

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
the phantom ship is actually more of a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.630 
the phantom ship is actually more of a
submarine<00:01:45.230> most<00:01:45.560> of<00:01:45.740> its<00:01:45.860> underwater<00:01:46.280> and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
submarine most of its underwater and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.840 
submarine most of its underwater and
high<00:01:47.450> up<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.930> middle<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:49.100> phantom<00:01:49.640> ship

high up in the middle the phantom ship

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.730 
high up in the middle the phantom ship
even<00:01:50.120> has<00:01:50.480> its<00:01:50.750> own<00:01:50.870> portholes

the<00:01:55.250> Crater<00:01:55.550> Lake<00:01:55.640> Lodge<00:01:56.150> was<00:01:56.480> originally

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
the Crater Lake Lodge was originally

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.280 
the Crater Lake Lodge was originally
opened<00:01:57.410> in<00:01:57.700> 1915<00:01:58.700> even<00:01:59.600> from<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.900> beginning

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
opened in 1915 even from the beginning

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.860 
opened in 1915 even from the beginning
it<00:02:00.650> was<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.190> building<00:02:01.970> that<00:02:02.120> struggled<00:02:02.660> with

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
it was a building that struggled with

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.600 
it was a building that struggled with
the<00:02:03.020> heavy<00:02:03.200> snows<00:02:03.620> that<00:02:03.650> we<00:02:03.980> get<00:02:04.190> here<00:02:04.370> every

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
the heavy snows that we get here every

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.520 
the heavy snows that we get here every
year<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:05.690> that<00:02:05.720> led<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.290> problems

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
year and so that led to problems

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.620 
year and so that led to problems
throughout<00:02:07.040> most<00:02:07.280> of<00:02:07.490> its<00:02:07.580> 85<00:02:08.060> year<00:02:08.390> history

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
in 1991 they actually started tearing

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.830 
in 1991 they actually started tearing
apart<00:02:12.320> our<00:02:12.650> Lodge<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.310> they<00:02:13.760> redesigned<00:02:14.630> it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
apart our Lodge and they redesigned it

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.750 
apart our Lodge and they redesigned it
