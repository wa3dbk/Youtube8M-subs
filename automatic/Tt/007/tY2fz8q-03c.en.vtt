00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
so I'm researching a research that I

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.570 
so I'm researching a research that I
came<00:02:17.970> across<00:02:18.150> how<00:02:18.600> these<00:02:18.780> curls<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.770> I've

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
came across how these curls and I've

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.990 
came across how these curls and I've
ranked<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.480> good<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.170> bad<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.410> ugly<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.850> I

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000

bought<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:04.230> closure<00:03:04.560> piece<00:03:05.450> now<00:03:06.450> it's<00:03:07.230> a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
bought the closure piece now it's a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.390 
bought the closure piece now it's a
little<00:03:07.560> wet<00:03:07.800> because<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:10.250> caught<00:03:11.250> myself

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
little wet because I caught myself

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.980 
little wet because I caught myself
trying<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:11.940> dye<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.330> Scout<00:03:14.630> I'm<00:03:15.630> not<00:03:15.810> really

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
trying to dye the Scout I'm not really

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.050 
trying to dye the Scout I'm not really
sure<00:03:16.260> if<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.530> did<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:16.800> good<00:03:16.950> job<00:03:17.010> or<00:03:17.490> not<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.850> think

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
sure if I did a good job or not I think

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.810 
sure if I did a good job or not I think
that's<00:03:18.270> pretty<00:03:18.480> close<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.200> my<00:03:19.350> skin<00:03:19.709> might<00:03:20.670> be

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
that's pretty close to my skin might be

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.570 
that's pretty close to my skin might be
a<00:03:20.850> little<00:03:21.120> darker<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:21.660> it's<00:03:21.780> still<00:03:21.989> wet<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.580> I

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
a little darker but it's still wet so I

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.260 
a little darker but it's still wet so I
bought<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> small<00:03:24.360> because<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.970> figured<00:03:26.970> I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
bought the small because I figured I

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.360
