00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
big big controversy is that Ubisoft has

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.160 
big big controversy is that Ubisoft has
actually<00:00:08.370> downgraded<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.330> graphics<00:00:09.360> from

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
product

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.759 
product
now<00:00:23.490> Ubisoft<00:00:24.210> even<00:00:24.600> stated<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.109> oh<00:00:25.170> no<00:00:25.320> we

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
now Ubisoft even stated that oh no we

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.650 
now Ubisoft even stated that oh no we
guarantee<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> graphics<00:00:27.150> are<00:00:27.330> still

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
guarantee that the graphics are still

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
guarantee that the graphics are still
the<00:00:27.810> same<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> what<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.500> were<00:00:28.560> back<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.550> e3

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the same of what they were back at e3

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.770 
the same of what they were back at e3
but<00:00:30.750> surely<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.920> isn't<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.270> I've<00:00:33.420> been<00:00:33.510> doing<00:00:33.630> a

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
but surely it isn't so I've been doing a

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.120 
but surely it isn't so I've been doing a
little<00:00:33.899> bit<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.110> digging<00:00:34.469> around<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.890> try<00:00:35.100> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
little bit of digging around to try and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.740 
little bit of digging around to try and
see<00:00:35.340> if<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.579> find<00:00:35.730> some<00:00:36.000> graphical<00:00:36.510> mods

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
see if I can find some graphical mods

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.040 
see if I can find some graphical mods
for<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.680> game<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.239> surely<00:00:39.239> enough<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.719> found

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
for this game and surely enough I found

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.799 
for this game and surely enough I found
this<00:00:40.260> program<00:00:40.500> called<00:00:40.920> sweet<00:00:41.309> FX<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:42.450> sweet

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
this program called sweet FX now sweet

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.740 
this program called sweet FX now sweet
FX<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.440> exactly<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.980> full-on<00:00:44.910> mod<00:00:45.239> because

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
FX is not exactly a full-on mod because

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.420 
FX is not exactly a full-on mod because
it's<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.230> something<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.559> replaces<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
it's not something that replaces the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.420 
it's not something that replaces the
game<00:00:47.670> files<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.530> pretty<00:00:49.530> much<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.739> injects

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
game files it's pretty much just injects

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.200 
game files it's pretty much just injects
a<00:00:50.640> filter<00:00:51.120> into<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> dot<00:00:52.110> exe<00:00:52.350> file<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
a filter into the dot exe file so it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.660 
a filter into the dot exe file so it
it's<00:00:54.690> more<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.489> something<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.610> you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it's more of like a something that you

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.369 
it's more of like a something that you
can<00:00:56.820> see<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.149> more<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> color<00:00:57.870> effect

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
can see it's more like a color effect

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.770 
can see it's more like a color effect
that's<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.920> opposed<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.489> like<00:00:59.780> texture

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that's as opposed to like texture

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.049 
that's as opposed to like texture
effects<00:01:01.140> or<00:01:01.489> modifications<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.789> sense

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
effects or modifications in that sense

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.910 
effects or modifications in that sense
so<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.690> pretty<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.049> adding<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.680> filter

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
so it's pretty much like adding a filter

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.100 
so it's pretty much like adding a filter
on<00:01:05.220> top<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.790> make<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.000> look<00:01:06.360> better<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.080> I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
on top of it to make it look better so I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.929 
on top of it to make it look better so I
was<00:01:07.500> playing<00:01:07.740> around<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.189> sweet<00:01:08.520> effects<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
was playing around with sweet effects a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.760 
was playing around with sweet effects a
bit<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.270> looked<00:01:09.540> online<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.900> found<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.229> tutorial

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
bit I looked online I found a tutorial

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.370 
bit I looked online I found a tutorial
on<00:01:10.920> how<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.610> install<00:01:12.360> sweet<00:01:12.840> effects<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> use

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
on how to install sweet effects and use

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260 
on how to install sweet effects and use
it<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.590> watchdogs<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.939> also<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
it with watchdogs and there is also a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.499 
it with watchdogs and there is also a
guy<00:01:15.509> who<00:01:15.830> uploaded<00:01:16.830> his<00:01:17.159> preset<00:01:17.729> for

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
guy who uploaded his preset for

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.230 
guy who uploaded his preset for
watchdogs<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.680> try<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> use<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.700> also

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
watchdogs and I try to use it I also

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.990 
watchdogs and I try to use it I also
bumped<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.020> brightness<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.890> 100%<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
bumped up the brightness to 100% and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
bumped up the brightness to 100% and
surely<00:01:24.780> enough<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.229> looks<00:01:25.500> beautiful<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.189> my

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
surely enough it looks beautiful in my

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.550 
surely enough it looks beautiful in my
opinion<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.790> think<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.930> actually<00:01:28.140> how<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
opinion I think this is actually how the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.810 
opinion I think this is actually how the
game<00:01:28.860> should<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.159> looked<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> first

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
game should have looked in the first

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850 
game should have looked in the first
place<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:30.960> think<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.380> how<00:01:31.680> it

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
place and I really think this is how it

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.190 
place and I really think this is how it
looked<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.220> e3<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.670> think<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.079> how

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
looked at e3 I think that this is how

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
looked at e3 I think that this is how
the<00:01:34.259> game<00:01:34.560> should<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:35.070> came<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
the game should have came out in the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.910 
the game should have came out in the
first<00:01:35.939> place<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.420> since<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.530> more<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
first place and since it's more of a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.319

stay<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> same<00:01:45.630> I've<00:01:46.380> actually<00:01:46.649> noticed<00:01:46.950> that

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
stay the same I've actually noticed that

1<00:01:48.820> FPS<00:01:49.480> 1<00:01:50.410> but<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.160> believe<00:01:51.580> one<00:01:52.000> FPS<00:01:52.150> is<00:01:52.690> worth
