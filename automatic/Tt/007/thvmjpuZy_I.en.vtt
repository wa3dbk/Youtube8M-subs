00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the fact that he's on TV every week

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.920 
the fact that he's on TV every week
whether<00:01:44.100> he's<00:01:44.280> wrestling<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:44.930> certainly

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
whether he's wrestling or not certainly

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.170 
whether he's wrestling or not certainly
diminishes<00:01:46.439> his<00:01:46.470> value<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.460> bright<00:01:47.729> side<00:01:48.000> of

for<00:02:58.860> one<00:02:59.220> match<00:02:59.430> if<00:02:59.700> they<00:02:59.820> laid<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.060> out<00:03:00.240> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
for one match if they laid it out and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.270

passable<00:03:09.420> match<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:10.020> put<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
passable match you put that with the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.840

pumped up to see both maybe just maybe

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.840 
pumped up to see both maybe just maybe
it<00:03:16.170> could<00:03:16.560> be<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> classic<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.610> could<00:03:17.730> also
