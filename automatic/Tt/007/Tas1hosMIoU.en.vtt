00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
work and they were soaking all day

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.960 
work and they were soaking all day
drained<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:20.360> off<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:21.650> basically<00:02:22.070> makes<00:02:22.820> the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
drained it off that basically makes the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.050 
drained it off that basically makes the
cashew<00:02:23.480> softer<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:24.140> helps<00:02:24.500> with<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.060> lighting

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
cashew softer it helps with the lighting

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:37.600 
cashew softer it helps with the lighting
up<00:02:26.210> most<00:02:26.690> agenda<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.890> basically<00:02:37.370> what<00:02:37.520> I'm

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
up most agenda so basically what I'm

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.060 
up most agenda so basically what I'm
doing<00:02:37.670> right<00:02:37.970> now<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.390> chopping<00:02:38.660> up<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.950> I

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
doing right now is chopping up and I

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.590 
doing right now is chopping up and I
don't<00:02:40.280> really<00:02:40.430> even<00:02:40.610> have<00:02:40.820> to<00:02:40.940> talk<00:02:41.210> a<00:02:41.270> ton

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
don't really even have to talk a ton

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.240 
don't really even have to talk a ton
because<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:42.050> will<00:02:42.170> go<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.680> pulse<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.220> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
because it will go in pulse in the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.240 
because it will go in pulse in the
blender<00:02:43.520> 1<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.330> 2<00:02:44.480> chopped<00:02:45.050> right<00:02:45.650> teaspoons

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
blender 1 and 2 chopped right teaspoons

of<00:02:46.400> fresh<00:02:46.640> chopped<00:02:47.240> rosemary<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:48.500> usually<00:02:48.680> I

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
of fresh chopped rosemary so usually I

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.520 
of fresh chopped rosemary so usually I
just<00:02:49.040> stick<00:02:49.400> my<00:02:49.430> together<00:02:49.970> here<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:52.250> then<00:02:52.520> I<00:02:52.790> I

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
just stick my together here and then I I

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.930 
just stick my together here and then I I
usually<00:02:54.530> just<00:02:54.560> kind<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:54.950> talk<00:02:55.190> quickly<00:02:55.580> like

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
usually just kind of talk quickly like

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.280 
usually just kind of talk quickly like
this<00:02:56.210> and<00:02:56.570> around<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.770> around<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:59.110> don't<00:03:00.110> have

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
this and around and around I don't have

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.130 
this and around and around I don't have
the<00:03:00.350> greatest<00:03:00.920> names<00:03:01.340> but<00:03:01.730> they<00:03:01.940> they<00:03:02.810> do<00:03:03.020> the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
job so I'm just going to do these a

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.530 
job so I'm just going to do these a
little<00:03:05.959> bit<00:03:06.230> just<00:03:07.100> coarsely<00:03:07.580> chopped<00:03:10.540> so

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
little bit just coarsely chopped so

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.410 
little bit just coarsely chopped so
that's<00:03:11.750> kind<00:03:12.020> of<00:03:12.050> coarsely<00:03:12.670> any<00:03:13.670> time<00:03:14.030> spent
