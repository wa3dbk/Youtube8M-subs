00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.610 
on him we then managed to pick up a
marvel<00:03:19.150> win<00:03:19.300> I<00:03:19.510> think<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.930> guys<00:03:20.110> might<00:03:20.410> be

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
marvel win I think you guys might be

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.080 
marvel win I think you guys might be
able<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.800> catch<00:03:20.980> on<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.430> pattern<00:03:21.880> here

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
able to catch on to a pattern here

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.590 
able to catch on to a pattern here
basically<00:03:22.680> Pacey<00:03:23.680> Silver's<00:03:24.220> go<00:03:24.700> for<00:03:25.000> a<00:03:25.030> crazy

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
basically Pacey Silver's go for a crazy

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.200 
basically Pacey Silver's go for a crazy
amount<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.620> coins<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.130> hopefully<00:03:27.460> we<00:03:27.880> can<00:03:28.060> make

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
amount of coins so hopefully we can make

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.210 
amount of coins so hopefully we can make
a<00:03:28.390> couple<00:03:28.720> of<00:03:28.990> pay<00:03:29.290> on<00:03:29.560> Marvel<00:03:29.950> win<00:03:30.070> that

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
a couple of pay on Marvel win that

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.950 
a couple of pay on Marvel win that
brilliant<00:03:30.670> what<00:03:31.090> we're<00:03:31.240> trying<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.540> do<00:03:31.720> is

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
brilliant what we're trying to do is

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.260 
brilliant what we're trying to do is
basically<00:03:32.260> get<00:03:32.740> enough<00:03:33.070> queens<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.910> make<00:03:34.090> a

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
basically get enough queens to make a

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.690 
basically get enough queens to make a
fairly<00:03:34.960> solid<00:03:35.260> silver<00:03:35.710> team<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.100> reckon<00:03:36.460> for<00:03:36.490> a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
fairly solid silver team I reckon for a

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.610 
fairly solid silver team I reckon for a
silver<00:03:37.060> team<00:03:37.270> we're<00:03:37.930> probably<00:03:38.200> gonna<00:03:38.530> need

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
silver team we're probably gonna need

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.010 
silver team we're probably gonna need
around<00:03:39.280> forty-five<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.300> fifty<00:03:40.450> thousand

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
around forty-five to fifty thousand

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.150 
around forty-five to fifty thousand
coins<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.380> make<00:03:41.530> something<00:03:41.830> that's<00:03:41.950> actually

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
coins to make something that's actually

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.240 
coins to make something that's actually
good<00:03:42.640> competitive<00:03:43.270> and<00:03:43.510> we'll<00:03:43.930> hopefully<00:03:44.250> win

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
good competitive and we'll hopefully win

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.030 
good competitive and we'll hopefully win
us<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.790> silver<00:03:46.209> torment<00:03:46.720> but<00:03:46.959> if<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.860> wanted

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
us the silver torment but if you wanted

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.650

to<00:03:48.160> carry<00:03:48.310> on<00:03:48.490> trading<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.180> perhaps<00:03:49.300> make

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
to carry on trading and perhaps make

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.790 
to carry on trading and perhaps make
something<00:03:50.080> a<00:03:50.110> little<00:03:50.260> bit<00:03:50.410> more<00:03:50.530> expensive

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
something a little bit more expensive

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.520 
something a little bit more expensive
perhaps<00:03:51.280> 100<00:03:51.850> k<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.270> might<00:03:52.959> be<00:03:52.990> able<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.290> do<00:03:53.410> that

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
perhaps 100 k I might be able to do that

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.680 
perhaps 100 k I might be able to do that
it<00:03:53.680> might<00:03:53.800> take<00:03:53.980> me<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.250> couple<00:03:54.310> more<00:03:55.090> episodes

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
it might take me a couple more episodes

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.840 
it might take me a couple more episodes
maybe<00:03:55.930> two<00:03:56.140> or<00:03:56.170> three<00:03:56.320> more<00:03:56.620> episodes<00:03:56.770> to<00:03:57.340> get

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
maybe two or three more episodes to get

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.940 
maybe two or three more episodes to get
to<00:03:58.090> 100<00:03:58.270> k<00:03:58.690> we'll<00:03:58.870> have<00:03:58.990> to<00:03:59.140> see<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.560> managed<00:03:59.890> to

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
to 100 k we'll have to see I managed to

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.280 
to 100 k we'll have to see I managed to
do<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.190> in<00:04:00.459> my<00:04:00.940> loan<00:04:01.209> sharks<00:04:01.600> theories<00:04:01.930> within

a date six or seven episodes so I could

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.230 
a date six or seven episodes so I could
do<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.740> if<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.040> want<00:04:06.220> me<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.459> if<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:07.060> want<00:04:07.180> me

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
to build something that's a little bit

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.990 
to build something that's a little bit
more<00:04:08.230> expensive<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:08.830> let<00:04:09.130> me<00:04:09.160> know<00:04:09.250> down<00:04:09.940> in
