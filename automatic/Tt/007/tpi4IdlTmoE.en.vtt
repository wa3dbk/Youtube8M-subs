get some help and then you evolved over

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.910 
get some help and then you evolved over
time<00:00:43.910> you<00:00:44.150> you<00:00:44.450> do<00:00:44.660> things<00:00:44.930> for<00:00:45.080> customers

they ask you for more to ask you about

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.500 
they ask you for more to ask you about
different<00:00:48.440> things<00:00:48.860> different<00:00:49.610> projects<00:00:50.420> that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
different things different projects that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.840 
different things different projects that
you<00:00:50.600> could<00:00:50.750> handle<00:00:51.110> for<00:00:51.350> them<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:52.010> that's<00:00:52.370> how

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
you could handle for them and that's how

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.479 
you could handle for them and that's how
it<00:00:52.970> evolved<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:53.600> slowly<00:00:54.110> but<00:00:54.230> surely<00:00:54.489> learning

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
it evolved so slowly but surely learning

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.580 
it evolved so slowly but surely learning
one<00:00:55.670> phase<00:00:56.000> of<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.300> industry<00:00:56.870> then<00:00:57.140> building

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
one phase of the industry then building

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.960 
one phase of the industry then building
it<00:00:57.710> with<00:00:57.830> another<00:00:58.070> phase<00:00:58.309> of<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.550> industry

it with another phase of the industry

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.970 
it with another phase of the industry
then<00:00:59.180> just<00:00:59.360> keep<00:00:59.540> adding<00:01:00.170> on<00:01:00.290> to<00:01:00.559> it

is it that you want to functionally use

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.070 
is it that you want to functionally use
it<00:01:25.440> for<00:01:25.760> once<00:01:26.760> we<00:01:26.940> figure<00:01:27.300> those<00:01:27.510> things<00:01:27.540> out

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
it for once we figure those things out

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.930 
it for once we figure those things out
then<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.800> our<00:01:28.860> designers<00:01:29.370> will<00:01:29.550> come<00:01:29.700> in

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
then one of our designers will come in

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.700 
then one of our designers will come in
and<00:01:30.150> start<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.930> look<00:01:31.140> at<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.470> from<00:01:31.620> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and start to look at it from that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.160 
and start to look at it from that
perspective<00:01:32.160> what<00:01:32.940> elements<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.750> they<00:01:33.900> really

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
perspective what elements do they really

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.700 
perspective what elements do they really
want<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:34.830> can<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.310> add<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.780> cosmetics<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
want how can we add in the cosmetics of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.370 
want how can we add in the cosmetics of
it<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.370> also<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.850> importance<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:40.080> guts

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it but also the importance that the guts

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.070 
it but also the importance that the guts
of<00:01:40.620> it<00:01:40.830> actually<00:01:40.980> build<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.760> properly<00:01:42.270> build

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
of it actually build it properly build

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.200 
of it actually build it properly build
it<00:01:43.260> so<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.740> make<00:01:43.920> we're<00:01:44.490> there<00:01:44.670> once<00:01:44.940> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
it so that we make we're there once and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.940 
it so that we make we're there once and
then<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:45.810> don't<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> come<00:01:46.500> back<00:01:46.680> because

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
then we don't have to come back because

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.920 
then we don't have to come back because
it's<00:01:47.250> been<00:01:47.430> done<00:01:47.460> properly<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.660> to<00:01:48.780> fit

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
it's been done properly you have to fit

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.390 
it's been done properly you have to fit
everything<00:01:49.170> into<00:01:49.500> an<00:01:49.590> envelope<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.280> that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
everything into an envelope and that

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.980 
everything into an envelope and that
envelope<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.060> different<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.600> each<00:01:51.630> customer

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
envelope is different for each customer

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.920 
envelope is different for each customer
some<00:01:52.830> want<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.130> spend<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.730> thousand<00:01:54.480> dollars<00:01:54.720> to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
some want to spend a thousand dollars to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.290 
some want to spend a thousand dollars to
do<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.050> small<00:01:55.380> upgrade<00:01:55.830> some<00:01:56.610> people<00:01:56.910> want<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
do a small upgrade some people want to

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.820 
do a small upgrade some people want to
do<00:01:57.450> things<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.870> you<00:01:58.080> know<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> hundred<00:01:58.500> thousand

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
do things as you know a hundred thousand

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.190 
do things as you know a hundred thousand
dollar<00:01:58.980> jobs<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.670> those<00:02:00.180> are<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.840> doesn't

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
dollar jobs and those are it doesn't

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.610 
dollar jobs and those are it doesn't
matter

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
matter

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.170 
matter
it's<00:02:02.220> what's<00:02:02.460> comfortable<00:02:02.730> for<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.150> client

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
it's what's comfortable for the client

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.780 
it's what's comfortable for the client
and<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> biggest<00:02:05.280> thing<00:02:05.580> we've

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
and I think the biggest thing we've

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.090 
and I think the biggest thing we've
learned<00:02:06.120> is<00:02:06.360> once<00:02:06.990> they're<00:02:07.200> comfortable<00:02:07.530> it's

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
learned is once they're comfortable it's

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.830 
learned is once they're comfortable it's
really<00:02:08.429> easy<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.760> fit<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.240> envelope<00:02:09.660> know

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
really easy to fit in the envelope know

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.270 
really easy to fit in the envelope know
we<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.200> something<00:02:10.470> that's<00:02:10.709> as<00:02:10.830> quick<00:02:11.010> is

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
we can do something that's as quick is

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.770 
we can do something that's as quick is
going<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.850> repairing<00:02:12.270> something<00:02:12.480> for

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
going in and repairing something for

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.170 
going in and repairing something for
somebody<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.260> takes<00:02:13.860> an<00:02:14.070> hour<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:15.030> could

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
somebody that takes an hour we could

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.270 
somebody that takes an hour we could
also<00:02:15.390> go<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:15.900> do<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> build<00:02:16.590> such<00:02:17.040> as<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
also go in and do a build such as the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.880
