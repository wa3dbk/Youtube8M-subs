00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.980
 or not 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.490
 and hey it 's all here sergio in a new 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.480
 video tutorial in which today I'm going to 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.850
 teach how to put a disk quota 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.670
 for the different users of your 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.059
 Windows Xp 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.339
 at the tip of disks is basically 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.339
 limit hard drive resources to 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:52.540
 the users for it we go here to 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.440
 team 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.680
 local disk if we right click 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.610
 properties 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.990
 we go here to the quota tab 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.990
 we show the quota configuration 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.479
 and here we leave the enable 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.390
 we mark the first option and the same 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.360
 Once also the second mark for 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.610
 that users do not exceed the limit 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.770
 that we are going to establish since 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.640
 we will set a limit for each of the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.030
 good users in this option for 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.869
 here 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.120
 is to put a limitation together 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.750
 to everything 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.900
 that is, some predetermined values 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.970
 but we do not want that since we 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.950
 we are advanced administrators and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.930
 we will do it to the pro 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.020
 we click on account values and we 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.369
 will open this entry this fee for 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.830
 add new records to the quota 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.700
 we will click here on the blank sheet 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.280
 we will write what is the name of each 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.140
 user must do it one by one the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.660
 first you know what I'm going to add will be 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.910
 user we check the name that is 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.710
 in all correct tells us that it is in 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:13.140
 sergio pc user we accept we give you the 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.080
 type of limitation that we want and you 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.880
 let's say then have a maximum 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.740
 of a gig and have a warning to 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.200
 the 700 megabytes we accept and we already have 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.100
 Here our first user with a fee 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.310
 disk we add a second user that is 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.010
 a user space 2 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.989
 we check that it exists in our team 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.010
 we accept again and we limit the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:52.010
 space on the disc because this one we're going 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.010
 to put 4 gb 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.379
 of maximum size and that at 3 gigas 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.739
 leave a notice that you have little left 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.739
 space 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.240
 ok it has already come off me user 2 and 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.010
 now we can also add those that 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.210
 even ourselves is 10 mi User 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:22.300
 we check we accept but I eat 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.420
 administrator and I will not limit newson 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.720
 discuss 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.310
 and as we see here, the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.540
 pota 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.340
 and he says that I do not have a good limit 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.739
 simply with this we will have 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.620
 configured what is the with the share of 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.160
 disk on our hard drive and we just 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.959
 what remains is to close the window is 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.530
 we can close the one here or with the 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.530
 cross 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.630
 we apply the values 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.360
 we accept here in the window 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.780
 we accept again and accept 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.240
 we will have the quota on our hard drive 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.130
 so easy to enter the 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.020
 different users that we have and 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:16.930
 we will see that more appears on the hard disk 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.090
 more reduced and when 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.710
 they are reaching the limit because they 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:26.830
 the messages will come out that they will not be able to 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.180
 have more space with good this 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.330
 It has been everything I hope you liked it 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.690
 this little tutorial has been very very 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.259
 fast I ask and see you next time 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.259
