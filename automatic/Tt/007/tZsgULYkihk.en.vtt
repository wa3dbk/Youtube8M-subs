arms like this to stand on one leg now
for<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.360> first<00:00:50.629> time<00:00:50.930> without<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.559> magic

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
for the first time without the magic

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.850 
for the first time without the magic
device<00:00:52.640> when<00:00:53.570> I<00:00:53.600> press<00:00:53.989> down<00:00:54.019> I'm<00:00:54.589> going<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.800> be

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
device when I press down I'm going to be

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.560 
device when I press down I'm going to be
pressing<00:00:55.070> more<00:00:55.430> or<00:00:55.519> less<00:00:55.640> straight<00:00:55.970> down<00:00:56.269> and

pressing more or less straight down and
slightly<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.769> side<00:00:58.989> naturally<00:00:59.989> he<00:01:00.290> falls

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
slightly to the side naturally he falls

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.649 
slightly to the side naturally he falls
off<00:01:00.800> balance<00:01:01.280> very<00:01:01.579> little<00:01:01.940> pressure<00:01:02.180> is<00:01:02.449> used

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
off balance very little pressure is used

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.499 
off balance very little pressure is used
let's<00:01:03.620> try<00:01:03.860> it<00:01:03.920> again<00:01:04.059> now<00:01:05.059> getting<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.420> hold

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
let's try it again now getting to hold

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.260 
let's try it again now getting to hold
this<00:01:05.690> little<00:01:05.869> long<00:01:06.140> back<00:01:07.000> gives<00:01:08.000> him<00:01:08.149> the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
this little long back gives him the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.450 
this little long back gives him the
magic<00:01:08.600> power<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:08.990> see<00:01:09.140> let's<00:01:09.680> try<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:09.979> again

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
magic power you see let's try it again

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.139 
magic power you see let's try it again
thumbs<00:01:11.360> up<00:01:11.600> leg<00:01:12.140> up<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:12.860> time<00:01:13.220> I'm<00:01:13.880> going<00:01:14.060> to

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
the body and slightly with the center of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.010 
the body and slightly with the center of
gravity<00:01:18.460> so<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.490> can<00:01:19.880> press<00:01:20.119> down<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:20.690> the

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
actually anchored to the spot but it

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.480 
actually anchored to the spot but it
looks<00:01:26.450> impressive<00:01:26.840> because<00:01:27.710> I<00:01:28.009> was<00:01:28.160> straining

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
looks impressive because I was straining

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.639 
looks impressive because I was straining
and<00:01:28.850> going<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:29.420> putting<00:01:29.810> all<00:01:29.990> my<00:01:30.140> power<00:01:30.440> into

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
and going and putting all my power into

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
it and yet he's still standing very

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.899 
it and yet he's still standing very
subtle<00:01:33.200> trick<00:01:33.530> let's<00:01:34.130> try<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.429> second

example so I'll get you to cover your

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.029 
example so I'll get you to cover your
hand<00:01:37.789> like<00:01:37.910> that<00:01:38.149> that's<00:01:38.599> right<00:01:38.810> again<00:01:39.709> I'm

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
hand like that that's right again I'm

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.339 
hand like that that's right again I'm
gonna<00:01:40.250> press<00:01:40.520> down<00:01:40.810> Laureles<00:01:41.810> straight<00:01:42.140> down

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
gonna press down Laureles straight down

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.350 
gonna press down Laureles straight down
and<00:01:42.649> slightly<00:01:43.190> out<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.819> away<00:01:44.090> from<00:01:44.119> the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
and slightly out and away from the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.520 
and slightly out and away from the
center<00:01:44.660> of<00:01:44.750> gravity<00:01:44.869> so<00:01:46.810> over<00:01:47.810> he<00:01:47.899> falls<00:01:48.170> quite

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
center of gravity so over he falls quite

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.800 
center of gravity so over he falls quite
easy<00:01:48.789> we'll<00:01:49.789> give<00:01:49.970> him<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.149> little<00:01:50.390> device

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.990 
find when they turn their body around
for<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.040> first<00:02:31.280> time<00:02:31.550> they'll<00:02:31.730> reach<00:02:31.910> a

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
for the first time they'll reach a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.720 
for the first time they'll reach a
certain<00:02:32.209> limit<00:02:32.950> give<00:02:33.950> them<00:02:34.099> two<00:02:34.489> or<00:02:34.519> three
