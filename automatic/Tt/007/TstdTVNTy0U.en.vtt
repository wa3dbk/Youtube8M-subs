00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
can't store them right away because you

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.099 
can't store them right away because you
don't<00:00:57.340> want<00:00:57.550> to<00:00:57.609> burn<00:00:57.789> your<00:00:58.059> shelf<00:00:58.300> up<00:00:58.510> or<00:00:58.989> your

don't want to burn your shelf up or your
drawer<00:00:59.410> rather<00:00:59.859> because<00:01:00.850> they're<00:01:01.000> hot<00:01:01.179> and

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
drawer rather because they're hot and

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:02.700 
drawer rather because they're hot and
you<00:01:01.629> need<00:01:01.780> a<00:01:01.809> place<00:01:02.019> to<00:01:02.050> store<00:01:02.289> them<00:01:02.500> let<00:01:02.679> them

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710

problem<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.260> we<00:01:05.680> came<00:01:05.860> up<00:01:05.920> with<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.130> solution

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
problem and we came up with the solution

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.510

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
it all started at a hardware store we

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.040 
it all started at a hardware store we
needed<00:01:12.790> something<00:01:12.970> that<00:01:13.270> wouldn't<00:01:13.510> burn<00:01:13.720> and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
needed something that wouldn't burn and

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.590 
needed something that wouldn't burn and
wouldn't<00:01:14.620> melt<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.310> Grayson<00:01:15.880> headed<00:01:16.300> straight

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
wouldn't melt so Grayson headed straight

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.460 
wouldn't melt so Grayson headed straight
for<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.840> metal<00:01:17.110> ducting<00:01:17.470> section<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:20.200> found

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
for the metal ducting section we found

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.230 
for the metal ducting section we found
these<00:01:20.620> three<00:01:20.680> inch<00:01:21.160> adjustable<00:01:21.370> ducting

these three inch adjustable ducting

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.240 
these three inch adjustable ducting
elbows<00:01:22.570> that<00:01:23.080> seemed<00:01:23.350> perfect<00:01:23.890> for<00:01:23.950> what<00:01:24.160> we

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
elbows that seemed perfect for what we

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.360 
elbows that seemed perfect for what we
needed<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.900> came<00:01:26.110> up<00:01:26.200> with<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.410> plan<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.920> headed

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
needed we came up with a plan and headed

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.190 
needed we came up with a plan and headed
back<00:01:30.330> now<00:01:31.330> here<00:01:31.510> you<00:01:31.630> can<00:01:31.750> see<00:01:31.810> I've<00:01:32.110> already

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
back now here you can see I've already

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.870 
back now here you can see I've already
screwed<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.800> ducting<00:01:33.250> elbows<00:01:33.520> together

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
screwed to the ducting elbows together

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.880 
screwed to the ducting elbows together
now<00:01:34.660> I<00:01:34.690> just<00:01:34.780> have<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.080> drill<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.500> holes<00:01:35.680> but

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
now I just have to drill the holes but

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.640 
now I just have to drill the holes but
the<00:01:36.010> third<00:01:36.190> one<00:01:36.370> I<00:01:37.200> mark<00:01:38.200> where<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:38.380> need<00:01:38.530> the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
the third one I mark where I need the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.510 
the third one I mark where I need the
hole<00:01:38.800> with<00:01:38.980> an<00:01:39.100> awl<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.730> drilled<00:01:40.300> the<00:01:40.390> hole

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
hole with an awl and drilled the hole

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.740 
hole with an awl and drilled the hole
then<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.550> do<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.880> same<00:01:43.150> thing<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.720> other

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
then I do the same thing to the other

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.640 
then I do the same thing to the other
side<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.530> screw<00:01:45.010> it<00:01:45.070> together

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.660 

unfortunately<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.860> screw<00:01:50.070> point<00:01:50.280> sticks<00:01:50.520> out

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
unfortunately the screw point sticks out

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.190 
unfortunately the screw point sticks out
a<00:01:50.700> little<00:01:50.910> bit<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.270> could<00:01:51.480> scratch<00:01:51.870> up<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
a little bit and could scratch up the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.930 
a little bit and could scratch up the
hairdryer<00:01:52.800> so<00:01:53.160> I'm<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.520> cut<00:01:53.730> some

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
hairdryer so I'm going to cut some

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.850 
hairdryer so I'm going to cut some
strips<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.390> metal<00:01:54.630> ducting<00:01:55.140> tape<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.650> cover

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
strips of metal ducting tape to cover

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.280 
strips of metal ducting tape to cover
over<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.160> screws<00:01:56.900> now<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:57.930> would<00:01:58.170> recommend

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
over the screws now I would recommend

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.320 
over the screws now I would recommend
using<00:01:58.710> rivets<00:01:59.010> or<00:01:59.310> even<00:01:59.730> little<00:02:00.000> nuts<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
using rivets or even little nuts and
