with<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.570> whole<00:00:39.780> new<00:00:39.960> multitasking<00:00:40.739> feature

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
with this whole new multitasking feature

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.299 
with this whole new multitasking feature
apple<00:00:41.850> also<00:00:41.969> noted<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.989> does<00:00:43.260> have

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
apple also noted that it does have

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.920 
apple also noted that it does have
intelligent<00:00:44.309> scheduled<00:00:44.850> updates<00:00:45.300> this

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
intelligent scheduled updates this

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020 
intelligent scheduled updates this
meaning<00:00:46.350> iOS<00:00:46.739> schedules<00:00:47.250> updates<00:00:47.700> during

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
meaning iOS schedules updates during

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.540 
meaning iOS schedules updates during
power<00:00:48.420> efficient<00:00:49.050> times<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:50.100> when<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.370> have

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
power efficient times like when you have

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.060 
power efficient times like when you have
your<00:00:50.670> device<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.510> connected<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> Wi-Fi<00:00:52.170> so

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
your device on and connected to Wi-Fi so

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.369 
your device on and connected to Wi-Fi so
the<00:00:53.190> battery<00:00:53.489> doesn't<00:00:53.699> drain<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.329> much<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.930> you

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
the battery doesn't drain as much if you

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.920 
the battery doesn't drain as much if you
have<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.770> these<00:00:55.949> apps<00:00:56.219> open<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.719> type<00:00:57.899> of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
have all these apps open so this type of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
have all these apps open so this type of
multitasking<00:00:58.440> was<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> long-awaited<00:00:59.250> feature

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
multitasking was a long-awaited feature

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.779 
multitasking was a long-awaited feature
for<00:01:00.149> many<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:01.410> jailbreak<00:01:01.980> tweak<00:01:02.250> was

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
for many and a jailbreak tweak was

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.369 
for many and a jailbreak tweak was
actually<00:01:03.180> already<00:01:03.329> available<00:01:03.750> allowing<00:01:04.170> you

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
