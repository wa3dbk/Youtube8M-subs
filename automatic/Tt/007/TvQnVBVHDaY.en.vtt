many<00:00:49.140> rotations<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.430> we're<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:50.879> here

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
many rotations so we're going to do here

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.939 
many rotations so we're going to do here
it's<00:00:53.940> go<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> start<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.960> go<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.260> Start<00:00:55.530> menu

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
it's go to start we go to the Start menu

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.689 
it's go to start we go to the Start menu
then<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.640> go<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.020> CMD<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.829> before<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.309> execute

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
then we go to CMD now before we execute

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.630 
then we go to CMD now before we execute
the<00:01:00.600> command<00:01:00.960> console<00:01:01.620> which<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.489> this

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the command console which is what this

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.230 
the command console which is what this
is<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.780> don't<00:01:04.049> want<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.890> run<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.880> straight

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
is we don't want to run it just straight

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.210 
is we don't want to run it just straight

press Enter and what's telling you that
it<00:01:32.280> can't<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.729> because<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.329> use

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it can't do it because it's in use

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
it can't do it because it's in use
obviously<00:01:33.869> when<00:01:34.229> Windows<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> can't<00:01:35.280> do

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
obviously when Windows is on I can't do

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.359 
obviously when Windows is on I can't do
this<00:01:35.700> type<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.909> thing<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.079> say<00:01:37.290> yes<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.979> want

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this type of thing so we say yes we want

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.190 
this type of thing so we say yes we want
to<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.729> when<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> system<00:01:39.509> restarts<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
to do this when the system restarts the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.480 
to do this when the system restarts the
volume<00:01:43.200> will<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.439> checked<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> next<00:01:44.040> time<00:01:44.310> the

volume will be checked the next time the
system<00:01:44.790> restarts<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.530> ahead<00:01:46.729> we<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:48.240> not

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
system restarts so we go ahead we do not

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.569 
system restarts so we go ahead we do not
go<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.540> shutdown<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.369> tab

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
go to shutdown but we do go to the tab

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.950 
go to shutdown but we do go to the tab
here<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.149> click<00:01:52.020> restart<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.970> then<00:01:54.780> we're

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
here and click restart and then we're

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.749 
here and click restart and then we're
off<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.290> races<00:01:55.500> will<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.100> restart<00:01:56.399> the

off to the races will now restart the
system<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.390> you'll<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.689> how<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.070> file

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.580 
system and you'll see how the file
checking<00:01:59.640> takes<00:02:00.570> place<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.200> we'll<00:02:01.439> go

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
checking takes place and we'll go

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.039 
checking takes place and we'll go
through<00:02:01.860> each<00:02:02.100> step<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.939> method

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.860 

as<00:02:11.049> you<00:02:11.200> can<00:02:11.319> see<00:02:11.530> windows<00:02:11.829> is<00:02:12.040> starting<00:02:12.459> up

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
as you can see windows is starting up

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
Windows did find problems with the hard

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.490 
Windows did find problems with the hard
drive<00:04:32.660> specifically<00:04:33.410> with<00:04:33.890> the<00:04:34.100> bad<00:04:34.850> sectors

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
drive specifically with the bad sectors

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.140 
drive specifically with the bad sectors
it<00:04:36.500> would<00:04:36.650> actually<00:04:36.980> go<00:04:37.130> ahead<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.490> cordon

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
it would actually go ahead and cordon

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.060 
it would actually go ahead and cordon
off<00:04:38.300> those<00:04:38.570> bad<00:04:38.780> sectors<00:04:39.230> so<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.770> Windows

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
off those bad sectors so that Windows

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.310 
off those bad sectors so that Windows
went<00:04:40.400> right<00:04:40.730> to<00:04:40.940> that<00:04:40.970> area<00:04:41.420> of<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.630> hard<00:04:41.810> disk

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
went right to that area of the hard disk

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.800 
went right to that area of the hard disk
it<00:04:42.530> would<00:04:42.680> also<00:04:42.910> repair<00:04:43.910> any<00:04:44.180> kind<00:04:44.480> of<00:04:44.630> file

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
it would also repair any kind of file

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.100 
it would also repair any kind of file
system<00:04:45.320> problems<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:45.890> were<00:04:45.980> very<00:04:46.160> extensive

system problems that were very extensive

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.720 
system problems that were very extensive
and<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.200> would<00:04:48.320> probably<00:04:48.590> prolong<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.580> life

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
and it would probably prolong the life

of<00:04:49.880> your<00:04:49.940> disk<00:04:50.270> for<00:04:50.510> some<00:04:50.690> time<00:04:50.960> but<00:04:51.260> as<00:04:52.040> soon
