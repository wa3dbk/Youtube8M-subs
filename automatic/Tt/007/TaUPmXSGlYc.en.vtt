00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 tells crowd beauty that matheus 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.060
 cantelli and I'm going to say one today 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.880
 Bit about Analog Shape Echo 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.620
 this pedal is one of them is analog and the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.440
 main characteristic of it 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.170
 differs from it 's analog delay 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.710
 digital is that it repeats not 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.020
 come back exactly as the original signal 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.480
 it is as if every repetition the sound 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.609
 lose a little of the pedal brightness of the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 A round on the doorbell is what gives 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.640
 that hot thing plus one more footprint 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.469
 26 at the right time this staff he has 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 three buttons it will have a button that is the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.090
 of feedback or feedback will control 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.020
 how much repetition do you want in your 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.540
 sound 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.520
 it will also have the time button that goes 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.410
 control the replay time if you 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.129
 want a very quick repetition one more 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.840
 long and finally a mix that is how much 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.699
 effect you want on your own then the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.920
 pedal very simple to use and with 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.360
 very nice personal results 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.420
 I will now move on to you some 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.250
 adjustments that I think is really cool 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.250
 I hope you like it there. 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.030
 this first adjustment is a beck slap 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.250
 of law that we call is a regulation 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.050
 a very fast repetition 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.090
 soon after you play come to 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.760
 repetition and there are few repetitions 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.290
 many are very common and rockabilly 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.390
 Find it and it 's cool, I'll show it to you. 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.910
 you how it is the sound without effect 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.900
 then with effect and then they will show 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.900
 let's go regulating 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.170
 O 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.860
 this regulation now has a repetition 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.960
 longer and are more repetitions serves 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.910
 to give an ambience in the sound for you 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.030
 to make a melodic solo a line 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.580
 slower, it's cool, come on, I 'll go. 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.760
 again without the effect and with the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.760
 It is made 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:27.630
 an is 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.080
 is 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.349
 and this 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.870
 this regulation I am going to pass now is a 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.569
 trick of law that is used by 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.610
 guitarists like albertille, you can 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.819
 you notice this effect on the soil of the 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.650
 music road runner any idea we 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.240
 let's play a few notes will give the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.940
 impression that we are touching several 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.280
 notes is a very interesting effect for 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.500
 you get that adjustment you go 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.690
 do the following 'you will try to leave 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.370
 is the rhythm of the delay as follows 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:34.980
 knows that base of blues that people 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:34.980
 play twice every note I play 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.640
 You 'll leave his at the rate you 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.919
 that you touch one of the notes and the 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:57.990
 other the delay plays to you in this rhythm 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:57.990
 Let's take a look at this. 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.220
 It's giving me the second note. 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:11.290
 after you've regulated milk to give 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:16.800
 This time you'll play now in a 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.800
 rhythm is full then it will stay like this 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.800
 that will happen every two notes you 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.290
 playing the delay goes-goes by a repetition 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.720
 in the middle you 're playing four notes 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.910
 and the repetition will drop after the second 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.190
 and so on will give an effect 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.770
 interesting enough I 'm going to play a 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.660
 time without the effect then with effect to 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.660
 you notice the difference 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.800
 so this is it , guys, I hope you 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.199
 have enjoyed 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.419
 It is a very cool pedal and it is 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.849
 Feather for you who is a fan of a sound 2010 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.479
 Got a pedal of fame, that 's it. 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.479
 galley thanks
