 form phiala it can be said so 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.610
 a replica of the very vessel of the game 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.829
 who wear our knights from the order and 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.989
 within which the substance is contained 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.790
 called black water which 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.410
 allows the knight to live for centuries 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.810
 to heal the wounds received and 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.310
 use unique abilities yourself 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.010
 pendant made well 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.530
 he hangs on a metal chain with 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.049
 and suspension c are made of metal on 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.120
 chain to the word even have a tag on the very 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.970
 pendant depicts the symbol of the order and 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.530
 various patterns unfortunately the pendant is sealed 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.140
 so you can only open it 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.600
 grinder circular saw and other 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.400
 tools of everyday life but I would 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.040
 advised not to spend so much energy and 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.900
 just hang it somewhere fans can 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.130
 even on myself 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.610
 actually it was all the content 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.390
 collectible edition of the game Order 1886 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.330
 called black water 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.730
 I personally liked it very much though 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.870
 miniature but rich in buns in style 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.300
 small and nice 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.030
 although the current price of the publication is 5 thousand 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.959
 rubles is a natural building 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.730
 not worth so much 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.680
 considering that assassin's collectibles 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.540
 creed unity far cry 4 stand exactly 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.790
 the same amount for all that one can not 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.310
 advise to purchase this edition 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.650
 This is not a frail blow to the budget but at the same 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.630
 time is another good quality and 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.760
 well done and the publication of moms in 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.860
