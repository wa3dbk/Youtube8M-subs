okay<00:04:22.860> for<00:04:23.040> some<00:04:23.220> reason<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.640> chunk<00:04:23.850> starting

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
okay for some reason that chunk starting

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:38.189

that's<00:04:25.290> on<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:25.800> one<00:04:26.480> we

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.100 

so<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.830> don't<00:04:39.279> it's<00:04:40.090> really<00:04:40.330> not<00:04:40.479> much<00:04:40.689> to<00:04:40.900> say

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
so I don't it's really not much to say

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.749 
so I don't it's really not much to say
on<00:04:41.229> this<00:04:41.349> one<00:04:41.409> it's<00:04:41.740> fine<00:04:42.009> there's<00:04:42.430> nothing

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
on this one it's fine there's nothing

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.670 
on this one it's fine there's nothing
wrong<00:04:42.939> with<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.389> I<00:04:43.479> don't<00:04:43.689> think<00:04:43.990> it's<00:04:44.349> just

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
wrong with it I don't think it's just

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.980 
wrong with it I don't think it's just
different

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.890 

so<00:04:49.990> hopefully<00:04:50.979> before<00:04:51.490> this<00:04:52.120> you<00:04:52.629> saw<00:04:52.840> the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
so hopefully before this you saw the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.719 
so hopefully before this you saw the
other<00:04:53.139> one<00:04:53.349> so<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:53.710> can<00:04:53.979> make<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:54.340> comparison

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
other one so you can make the comparison

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.230 
other one so you can make the comparison
and<00:04:56.340> like<00:04:57.340> I<00:04:57.460> had<00:04:57.580> said<00:04:57.789> before<00:04:57.909> in<00:04:58.150> another

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
and like I had said before in another

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.580 
and like I had said before in another
video<00:04:58.689> I've<00:04:58.810> never<00:04:58.990> actually<00:04:59.169> been<00:04:59.439> to

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
video I've never actually been to

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.890 
video I've never actually been to
Disneyworld<00:04:59.949> so<00:05:00.310> I<00:05:00.340> can't<00:05:00.699> really<00:05:01.150> compare<00:05:01.840> it

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
Disneyworld so I can't really compare it

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.309 
Disneyworld so I can't really compare it
for<00:05:02.340> you<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:04.120> that<00:05:04.300> like<00:05:04.689> which<00:05:04.840> one<00:05:05.020> is<00:05:05.139> more

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
for you to that like which one is more

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.129 
for you to that like which one is more
realistic<00:05:05.800> have<00:05:06.759> no<00:05:06.939> idea<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.539> know<00:05:07.749> that<00:05:08.110> I

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
realistic have no idea I know that I

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.619 
realistic have no idea I know that I
probably<00:05:08.849> would<00:05:09.849> pick<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.240> other<00:05:10.389> one<00:05:10.599> just

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:10.629 
probably would pick the other one just

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:12.689 
probably would pick the other one just
because<00:05:10.990> they<00:05:11.319> have<00:05:11.529> the<00:05:12.009> details<00:05:12.370> of<00:05:12.550> like

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
because they have the details of like

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.239 
because they have the details of like
Buzz<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.509> I<00:05:13.599> can<00:05:13.810> tell<00:05:14.080> where<00:05:14.349> they<00:05:14.499> put<00:05:14.770> Buzz

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:15.249 
Buzz and I can tell where they put Buzz

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.239 
Buzz and I can tell where they put Buzz
in<00:05:15.610> it<00:05:16.050> this<00:05:17.050> one<00:05:17.319> I<00:05:17.349> can't<00:05:17.710> really<00:05:17.860> tell<00:05:18.189> what

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:18.249 
in it this one I can't really tell what

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:19.950 
in it this one I can't really tell what
the<00:05:18.550> things<00:05:18.789> are<00:05:18.999> is<00:05:19.150> just<00:05:19.270> a<00:05:19.449> lot<00:05:19.599> of<00:05:19.689> colored

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
the things are is just a lot of colored

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.980 
the things are is just a lot of colored
blocks<00:05:20.259> so<00:05:20.469> if<00:05:20.589> I<00:05:20.710> hadn't<00:05:21.009> been<00:05:21.159> there<00:05:21.749> to<00:05:22.749> see

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
blocks so if I hadn't been there to see

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.889 
blocks so if I hadn't been there to see
it<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.939> wouldn't<00:05:24.939> have<00:05:25.029> known<00:05:25.889> so
