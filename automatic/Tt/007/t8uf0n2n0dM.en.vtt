brought here is coming from out of state
which<00:04:45.740> I<00:04:45.860> guess<00:04:46.010> they're<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.370> scientists

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
which I guess they're the scientists

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.940 
which I guess they're the scientists
saying<00:04:47.540> believe<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:48.410> don't<00:04:48.650> know<00:04:48.710> if<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:48.830> was<00:04:48.890> a

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
saying believe I don't know if it was a

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.530 
saying believe I don't know if it was a
signed<00:04:49.160> geologist<00:04:49.610> I<00:04:49.700> think<00:04:49.880> was<00:04:49.970> saying<00:04:50.150> that

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
signed geologist I think was saying that

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.660

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
it took something like 80 plus leaders

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.860 
it took something like 80 plus leaders
of<00:06:18.470> yeah<00:06:18.830> of<00:06:19.040> oil<00:06:19.340> and<00:06:19.790> multiple<00:06:20.270> liters<00:06:20.660> of

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870

of yeah of oil and multiple liters of
water<00:06:21.110> which<00:06:22.040> I've<00:06:22.580> totally<00:06:23.240> bought<00:06:23.420> into<00:06:23.600> the

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
water which I've totally bought into the

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.690 
water which I've totally bought into the
whole<00:06:23.870> thing<00:06:23.930> of<00:06:24.320> having<00:06:24.620> bottled<00:06:25.190> water<00:06:25.370> you

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
whole thing of having bottled water you

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.770 
whole thing of having bottled water you
know<00:06:25.820> when<00:06:26.000> you<00:06:26.090> go<00:06:26.210> somewhere<00:06:26.540> you<00:06:26.600> want<00:06:26.690> to

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
know when you go somewhere you want to

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.480 
know when you go somewhere you want to
have<00:06:26.900> bottled<00:06:27.170> water<00:06:27.350> but<00:06:27.590> it<00:06:28.040> does<00:06:28.280> seem

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
have bottled water but it does seem

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.130 
have bottled water but it does seem
incredibly<00:06:28.970> inefficient<00:06:29.330> still<00:06:29.780> after<00:06:30.020> all

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
incredibly inefficient still after all

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.350 
incredibly inefficient still after all
this<00:06:30.380> time<00:06:30.650> and<00:06:30.830> perhaps<00:06:31.010> it<00:06:31.730> isn't<00:06:31.970> necessary

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
this time and perhaps it isn't necessary

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.570 
this time and perhaps it isn't necessary
in<00:06:32.450> every<00:06:32.750> situation<00:06:32.990> I<00:06:33.500> wouldn't<00:06:34.130> invest<00:06:34.370> in

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
in every situation I wouldn't invest in

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:35.110 
in every situation I wouldn't invest in
our<00:06:34.669> the<00:06:34.790> point

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
our the point

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.850 
our the point
it<00:06:35.990> would<00:06:36.080> have<00:06:36.169> been<00:06:36.260> a<00:06:36.290> better<00:06:36.410> point<00:06:36.770> if

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
it would have been a better point if

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.570 
it would have been a better point if
they<00:06:36.949> hadn't<00:06:37.190> used<00:06:37.280> the<00:06:37.430> metric<00:06:37.610> system<00:06:38.090> no

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.740 

but<00:06:43.580> I'm<00:06:43.729> pointing<00:06:44.150> my<00:06:44.330> money<00:06:44.600> in

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
but I'm pointing my money in

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.950 
but I'm pointing my money in
desalination<00:06:45.760> because<00:06:46.760> that<00:06:46.910> is<00:06:47.240> a<00:06:47.389> big<00:06:47.870> one

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
desalination because that is a big one

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.540 
desalination because that is a big one
happening<00:06:48.470> and<00:06:48.650> then<00:06:48.889> that's<00:06:49.100> what's<00:06:49.280> that's

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
happening and then that's what's that's

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.129 
happening and then that's what's that's
the<00:06:49.760> future<00:06:50.150> I<00:06:50.300> think<00:06:50.360> that's<00:06:50.870> you're<00:06:51.050> gonna

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
the future I think that's you're gonna

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.510 
the future I think that's you're gonna
get<00:06:51.320> there's<00:06:51.530> a<00:06:51.590> lot<00:06:51.710> of<00:06:51.800> water<00:06:51.979> out<00:06:52.100> there

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
get there's a lot of water out there

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.820 
get there's a lot of water out there
just<00:06:52.729> gotta<00:06:52.910> consult<00:06:53.810> that<00:06:53.870> okay<00:06:54.410> and<00:06:54.680> then

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
just gotta consult that okay and then

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.409 
just gotta consult that okay and then
getting<00:06:55.070> water<00:06:55.340> out<00:06:55.430> of<00:06:55.669> air<00:06:55.910> is<00:06:56.120> another

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
getting water out of air is another

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:57.879 
getting water out of air is another
thing<00:06:56.600> that<00:06:56.660> people<00:06:56.900> are<00:06:57.050> doing<00:06:57.110> oh<00:06:57.470> there's<00:06:57.800> a

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
thing that people are doing oh there's a

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.100 
thing that people are doing oh there's a

that well muscular on Tatooine I don't

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.520 
that well muscular on Tatooine I don't
know<00:07:01.850> if<00:07:01.970> it's<00:07:02.090> spread<00:07:02.780> to<00:07:02.900> California<00:07:03.410> much

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 
know if it's spread to California much
