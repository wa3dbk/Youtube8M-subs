a few minutes it's going to thicken up

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.220 
a few minutes it's going to thicken up
just<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:44.080> bit<00:02:44.880> now<00:02:45.880> what<00:02:46.120> I'm<00:02:46.210> going<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.600> do<00:02:46.930> is

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
just a bit now what I'm going to do is

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.160 
just a bit now what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:47.410> going<00:02:47.620> before<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.370> rate<00:02:48.970> back<00:02:49.450> into<00:02:50.050> my

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
I'm going before this rate back into my

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.280 
I'm going before this rate back into my
measuring<00:02:50.620> cup<00:02:51.420> it's<00:02:52.420> not<00:02:52.600> all<00:02:52.870> going<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.230> fit

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
measuring cup it's not all going to fit

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.890 
measuring cup it's not all going to fit
but<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.160> good<00:02:54.430> portion<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.120> roof<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.690> and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
but a good portion of the roof it and

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.460 
but a good portion of the roof it and
the<00:02:56.530> reason<00:02:56.709> I'm<00:02:57.040> doing<00:02:57.070> this<00:02:57.520> is<00:02:58.470> because

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
the reason I'm doing this is because

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.180 
the reason I'm doing this is because
it's<00:03:00.040> going<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.459> make<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.209> whole<00:03:01.510> lot<00:03:01.540> easier

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
it's going to make it a whole lot easier

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.560 
it's going to make it a whole lot easier
