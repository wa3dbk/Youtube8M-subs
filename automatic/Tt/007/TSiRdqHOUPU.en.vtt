00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Yesterday we already talked about the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.990
 talked about new sims 4 trailer and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.400
 That's why it becomes the highest railway 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.500
 we finally with the general 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.210
 gameplay deal because 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.280
 electronic arts now has a video 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.929
 brought out where a little in the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.660
 creative in the mode can sniff 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.160
 as well in the new house extension 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.710
 or the tools to do so 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.189
 and where you can see the emotions the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.949
 14 prevail yes and that is there 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.500
 that's the creative in the mode here you can 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.200
 you really absolutely your fantasy 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.110
 let free rein and your sims still 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.000
 create more individual than before 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.920
 you have no more sliders like that 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.540
 general matters such as that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.489
 weight or so but you can 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.489
 really individual body parts such as 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.390
 example, the lower leg or the 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.520
 thigh or what I know everything 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.980
 model and shape as you do 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.980
 I want and I think that's great 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.930
 feature west what da electronic arts resp 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.600
 the sims are simply built in 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 Because then everyone can have teams 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.660
 just do it again a piece far different 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.339
 For example, the arms can look like that 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.960
 be really fat but legs thin 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.400
 like a match and this one 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.020
 Individuality is one of those things 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.170
 little in sims 3 was missing 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.840
 many of you are complaining 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.970
 the graphics of sims 4 so far 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.729
 These are a bit global 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.350
 I heard a lot from that but 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.030
 but dear friends what you seem 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.820
 always to forget is the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.310
 fact that this whole game is 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.780
 we are not final yet so there are 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 the graphics are clear that is now the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.979
 first impressions but the graphics will be 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.780
 I may be and as am 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.820
 I'm sure it will change a bit 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.680
 because they still have a good half 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.119
 year i would appreciate time for me 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.159
 do not think that there is much im immediately 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.979
 january or february , i calculate 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.009
 so with the second quarter of 2014 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.240
 but I just think you can 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.220
 then do not judge too hastily 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.649
 look at it first 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.140
 so far, the graphics are a bit clumsy 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.869
 jasid does not so nice animated part 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.390
 like 13 but I think just easy 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.030
 this comic graphics acts among other things 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.950
 Just stop for a while 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.720
 unrealistic as it were, because it's 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.319
 still just a game and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.349
 We want to play this game 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.030
 have a little fun and if you are 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.049
 then into the killing he wanted has 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.939
 maybe oh god i think so 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.889
 real people killed accordingly 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.989
 I think that's completely it 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.879
 okay that there is still a little humor 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.170
 funny murderer has less impact 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.480
 we also wrote many of you that 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.180
 It looks comic moderately I think we 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.439
 We'll just get there in the near future 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.260
 Let's surprise us there 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:38.349
 is expecting another little update 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.269
 in 54 are the new running animations 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.669
 that will give it I think that's pretty 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.950
 cool because right in the creative city mode 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:47.349
 can you choose now again are newer 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.810
 should wait through the streets if he 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.819
 cool if he is cocky or arrogant 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.430
 little canted position you are allowed to you all 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.689
 choose individually like your sims 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.209
 to go through life 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.609
 okay how the creative look in the mode 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.650
 is and the graphics because wood in the 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.480
 we know that's about natural 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.579
 Not many like that yet 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.980
 will go animation vonstatten the 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.629
 We now know, too 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.040
 it will be exciting to come to the new 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.079
 Building tools to houses 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.609
 and that's where electronic arts came in 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.709
 I have given incredibly much effort and 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.519
 I find what you can see so far 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.439
 Pretty cool 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.180
 because we do not have a single turn 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.250
 pull more and that is very expensive 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.069
 but really have one 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.169
 we sediment what we like in all times 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.329
 can change directions that you see 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:33.699
 here we just put a sediment 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.019
 then just pull it to the side and 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:36.579
 city ​​now somehow still a wall too 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.859
 we just need to pull it 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.109
 further down directly and I think so 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.699
 just pretty cool as I said last year 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.709
 I found the house partially 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.810
 little effort but so we can 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.099
 just more individual our whole 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.989
 create things here looks the 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.400
 the terrace is in the middle of nowhere 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.500
 they have been placed immediately 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.449
 there is not much with exhausting 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.269
 back and forth and see if the turn also 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:00.549
 fit and this renovation we graz 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.259
 i feel spectacularly great i have to 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.900
 honestly admit so there really can 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:07.030
 individually with the different rooms 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.099
 Whole stuff what we can do 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.359
 really say hey trauma is standing 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.459
 now a little stupid we ask 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.060
 give them where room b4 was of course 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.280
 it will also be new 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.630
 give furnishings and that 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.969
 I think so too cool 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.150
 that automatically adjusts everything differently 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:22.009
 then it is already 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.199
 completely tiled and everything around 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.850
 You really do not need that much anymore 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.669
 As was the case in the past to build a house 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.039
 and I think that's unbelievable 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.930
 great and is one of the best for me 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.690
 reasons around are hard to buy 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.820
 and another good reason to be sims 4 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.240
 to buy are among other things 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.699
 emotions and feelings of her now 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.169
 so highly priced in it 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.300
 sims should give a lot 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.580
 yes what that is exactly that is actually 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.620
 only that we talk or 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.720
 conversations as below in the left 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.000
 screen edge just shown how 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.830
 our sims feels only for example 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.570
 here just totally self-assured because he 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.910
 is flirting with madame and it is her 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.370
 apparently like but you can also 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.260
 of objects clothes or other interest 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.539
 as I said totally influenced 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.789
 and depending on what they all tell 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.340
 the 1 bored with their stories 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.930
 or if they are totally happy 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.970
 make is our sims in everyone else 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.560
 mood and even if we are alone 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.050
 Hang out somewhere and do nothing 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.479
 Of course, bored is like 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.949
 the whole then later final look 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.729
 I just can not do that right now 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.590
 imagine 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.780
 Of course we can of course influence 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.120
 we can take on our feelings 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.729
 then use our mind to deal with it 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.470
 not boring anymore is that though 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.240
 really such an extreme influence 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.750
 I will not quite know yet 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.460
 exactly 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.960
 So far, it really looks like that 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.490
 if the sims are depressed too 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.169
 really depressed and nothing 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.970
 want to do something else and 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.470
 Accordingly, we stop him first 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.449
 have to cheer up and I think so 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.669
 actually pretty cool when we look at it 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.960
 hope to have to pay attention to that too 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.860
 comes again a bit of the 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.320
 reality 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.400
 and yes I like that in itself 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.220
 actually quite good 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.020
 if that is ultimately in the long run 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.220
 motivation is the interest then always 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.889
 to make happy again 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.270
 yes I do not know exactly 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.110
 I can not be sure yet 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.060
 imagine 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.820
 because at some point you might be 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.199
 easy somehow always one 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.479
 to have a depressed seat or something like that 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.370
 i think according to these feelings 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.620
 and emotions it will be completely 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.930
 a lot of new features give then 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.789
 be installed and yes I am up 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.550
 in any case curious what else is 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:28.620
 give 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.840
 I hope this little info video or 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.910
 actually my comment is to the 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.950
 Innovations that have been shown have you 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.960
 you've fallen so far you can now 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.930
 Write what do you think of creatives 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.490
 not well discussed in the mode again 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.230
 About the graphic as I said it is still 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.000
 not final love people there you can still 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.320
 do not really say much I think something 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 do you think of the new run 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.830
 animations this directly from the start 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.400
 Personally, I think that's going to be pretty 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.920
 cool 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.230
 what do you think of the new house construction 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.090
 tools definitely makes a lot of difference 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.160
 easier to build the houses 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.020
 and what do you think of them 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.780
 Feelings and emotions now in sims 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.940
 4 come in, write me yours 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.440
 opinions down in the comments I
