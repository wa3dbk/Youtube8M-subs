okay<00:00:01.920> guys<00:00:02.159> I've<00:00:02.370> got<00:00:02.399> another<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:03.000> real

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
okay guys I've got another a real

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.710 
okay guys I've got another a real
interesting<00:00:04.490> thing<00:00:05.490> I'm<00:00:05.670> playing<00:00:06.000> with<00:00:06.270> this

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
interesting thing I'm playing with this

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.240 
interesting thing I'm playing with this
is<00:00:06.960> Johnny<00:00:07.259> Davos<00:00:07.830> idea<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:09.139> he<00:00:10.160> figured<00:00:11.160> out

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
is Johnny Davos idea and he figured out

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.749 
is Johnny Davos idea and he figured out
that<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.490> could<00:00:11.670> take<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> jewel<00:00:12.179> thief<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
that you could take a jewel thief and

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.570 
that you could take a jewel thief and
make<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.940> run<00:00:15.089> Abedini<00:00:15.660> SSG<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> set<00:00:17.340> up<00:00:17.430> a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
make it run Abedini SSG so I set up a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.890 
make it run Abedini SSG so I set up a
little<00:00:17.820> different<00:00:18.180> circuit<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:18.690> I've<00:00:18.810> been

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
little different circuit but I've been

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.710 
little different circuit but I've been
playing<00:00:19.140> around<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.529> using<00:00:19.920> super<00:00:20.250> caps

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
playing around with using super caps

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.560 
playing around with using super caps
yeah<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.890> circuit<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:23.760> batteries<00:00:24.359> in

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
yeah in the circuit with batteries in

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.519 
yeah in the circuit with batteries in
combination<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.680> using<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> jewel<00:00:27.090> thief

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
combination and using the jewel thief

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.980 
combination and using the jewel thief
charging<00:00:28.529> circuit<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.880> SSG<00:00:30.510> charting

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
charging circuit and the SSG charting

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.950 
charging circuit and the SSG charting
circuit<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.149> making<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.270> whole<00:00:33.480> thing<00:00:33.540> work

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
circuit and making this whole thing work

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.260 
circuit and making this whole thing work
together<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.770> here's<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> setup<00:00:35.520> there's<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
together so here's the setup there's the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.209 
together so here's the setup there's the
SSG<00:00:36.960> running<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:39.469> there's<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.680> jewel<00:00:40.920> thief

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
SSG running and there's the jewel thief

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.760 
SSG running and there's the jewel thief
running<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.410> way<00:00:43.559> this

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
running right there and the way this

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.029 
running right there and the way this
works<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.969> jewel<00:00:45.210> thief<00:00:45.539> up<00:00:46.039> produces

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
works is the jewel thief up produces

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.299 
works is the jewel thief up produces
light<00:00:47.750> with<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.460> LEDs<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.140> effort<00:00:53.100> goes

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
light with the LEDs but then effort goes

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.360 
light with the LEDs but then effort goes
to<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> LEDs<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.539> charges<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.680> what<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:55.949> did<00:00:56.219> on

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
to the LEDs it charges so what I did on

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.470 
to the LEDs it charges so what I did on
this<00:00:56.550> circuit<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.559> put<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> big<00:00:59.480> 53rd

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this circuit was put it into a big 53rd

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.240 
this circuit was put it into a big 53rd
two<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> half<00:01:01.469> volt<00:01:02.390> capacitor<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.250> nickel

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
two and a half volt capacitor and nickel

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.840 
two and a half volt capacitor and nickel
metal<00:01:05.400> hydride<00:01:05.549> batteries<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.310> I<00:01:08.310> thought

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
metal hydride batteries and I thought

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.429 
metal hydride batteries and I thought
this<00:01:09.030> might<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.450> an<00:01:09.540> interesting<00:01:09.750> way<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.170> do

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
this might be an interesting way to do

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.969 
this might be an interesting way to do
this<00:01:11.450> experiment<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.930> using<00:01:13.619> both<00:01:13.770> in

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
this experiment was using both in

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.670 
this experiment was using both in
combination<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.600> that's<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> waveform

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
combination and that's what the waveform

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.380 
combination and that's what the waveform
looks<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.479> now<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.960> waveform<00:01:20.060> i'm<00:01:21.060> hella

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
looks like now this waveform i'm hella

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
looks like now this waveform i'm hella
loud<00:01:21.630> role<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.080> my<00:01:22.200> oscilloscope<00:01:22.560> figuring

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
loud role of my oscilloscope figuring

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.719 
loud role of my oscilloscope figuring
out<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> best<00:01:23.549> way<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> use<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.470> but<00:01:25.470> i<00:01:25.890> found

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
out the best way to use it but i found

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.030 
out the best way to use it but i found
out<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.240> i<00:01:27.299> had<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.659> upside<00:01:27.780> down<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.890> hit

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
out that i had it upside down if you hit

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.620 
out that i had it upside down if you hit
this<00:01:29.189> button<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.880> invert<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
this button here you invert it and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
this button here you invert it and
that's<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.799> i<00:01:31.829> was<00:01:32.009> doing<00:01:32.280> along<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.700> had<00:01:32.880> an

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that's what i was doing along I had an

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.429 
that's what i was doing along I had an
inverted<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:33.750> that's<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.200> way<00:01:34.290> it's

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
inverted but that's the way it's

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.630 
inverted but that's the way it's
supposed<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.400> quite

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
supposed to be but I don't quite

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.910 
supposed to be but I don't quite
understand<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.540> looks<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.770> what

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
understand what it looks like and what

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.319 
understand what it looks like and what
it's<00:01:38.070> supposed<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.460> look<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.119> whole

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
it's supposed to look like in the whole

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.870 
it's supposed to look like in the whole
dynamic<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:40.110> that's<00:01:40.320> what<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:41.100> just

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
dynamic but that's what it is I just

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
dynamic but that's what it is I just
haven't<00:01:42.180> studied<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.659> manual<00:01:43.079> enough<00:01:43.350> but

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
haven't studied the manual enough but

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.480 
haven't studied the manual enough but
this<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> waveform<00:01:44.549> between<00:01:44.939> the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
this is the waveform between the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.160 
this is the waveform between the
collector<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.090> base<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.930> transistor

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
collector and the base of the transistor

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.810 
collector and the base of the transistor
this<00:01:49.829> run<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> jewel<00:01:50.430> thief<00:01:50.729> right<00:01:51.000> there<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
this run the jewel thief right there and

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.350 
this run the jewel thief right there and
the<00:01:54.649> voltage<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> capacitor<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the voltage on the capacitor and the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.380 
the voltage on the capacitor and the
drive<00:01:57.750> battery<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.409> right<00:01:58.680> there<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.180> can

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
drive battery is right there and I can

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.270 
drive battery is right there and I can
take<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.810> battery<00:02:01.200> off<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.950> take<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
take the battery off I can take the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.789 
take the battery off I can take the
capacitor<00:02:02.969> off<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.960> runs<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.320> either<00:02:04.500> one

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
capacitor off and it runs on either one

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249 
capacitor off and it runs on either one
obviously<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:06.390> energy<00:02:06.750> stored<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:07.170> a

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
obviously the energy stored in a

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.290 
obviously the energy stored in a
capacitor<00:02:07.439> course<00:02:08.129> drains<00:02:08.459> down<00:02:08.729> much<00:02:09.270> faster

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
capacitor course drains down much faster

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.330 
capacitor course drains down much faster
than<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> energy<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.649> battery<00:02:11.039> there's

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
than the energy of a battery there's

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.220

more<00:02:11.550> jewels<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> battery<00:02:12.629> in<00:02:12.780> there

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
more jewels in the battery in there

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.710 
more jewels in the battery in there
we'll<00:02:13.379> stored<00:02:13.680> up<00:02:13.800> in<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.040> capacitor<00:02:14.760> but

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
we'll stored up in that capacitor but

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.600 
we'll stored up in that capacitor but
what<00:02:15.989> I'm<00:02:16.140> doing<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.530> I'm<00:02:16.709> shooting<00:02:17.159> it<00:02:17.280> over

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
what I'm doing is I'm shooting it over

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.860 
what I'm doing is I'm shooting it over
to<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.299> Bedini<00:02:18.659> SSG<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:20.489> Bedini<00:02:20.879> SSG<00:02:21.659> is

to the Bedini SSG the Bedini SSG is

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.110 
to the Bedini SSG the Bedini SSG is
charging<00:02:22.409> up<00:02:22.560> another<00:02:23.220> battery<00:02:23.760> that's<00:02:23.940> a

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
battery in the back and that's voltage

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.270 
battery in the back and that's voltage
on<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.940> battery<00:02:27.360> charging<00:02:27.989> up<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
it back and forth but I've had a lot of

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.890 
it back and forth but I've had a lot of
fun<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.220> also<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.760> scratching<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.420> my<00:03:00.599> head

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
fun and also a scratching of my head

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.569 
fun and also a scratching of my head
about<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.379> dynamic<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:03.269> reason<00:03:03.780> that

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
about the dynamic and the reason that

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.130 
about the dynamic and the reason that
this<00:03:05.579> is<00:03:05.819> kind<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.120> stopped<00:03:06.450> me<00:03:06.629> in<00:03:06.720> my<00:03:06.959> tracks

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
this is kind of stopped me in my tracks

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.960 
this is kind of stopped me in my tracks
is<00:03:08.359> between<00:03:09.359> these<00:03:09.629> two<00:03:09.900> circuits<00:03:10.970> this

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
is between these two circuits this

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.990 
is between these two circuits this
doesn't<00:03:12.299> seem<00:03:12.629> to<00:03:12.810> use<00:03:13.079> very<00:03:13.410> much<00:03:13.650> energy<00:03:14.010> in

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
doesn't seem to use very much energy in

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.910 
doesn't seem to use very much energy in
fact<00:03:15.359> when<00:03:15.569> i<00:03:15.629> get<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.049> tuned<00:03:16.410> up<00:03:16.590> about

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
fact when i get this tuned up about

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.940 
fact when i get this tuned up about
right<00:03:17.269> doesn't<00:03:18.269> seem<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.750> use<00:03:18.900> any<00:03:19.109> energy<00:03:19.440> and

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
right doesn't seem to use any energy and

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.470 
right doesn't seem to use any energy and
i<00:03:22.130> really<00:03:23.130> don't<00:03:23.340> know<00:03:23.400> what's<00:03:23.669> going<00:03:24.000> on<00:03:24.150> here

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
i really don't know what's going on here

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.659 
i really don't know what's going on here
but<00:03:24.690> i've<00:03:24.959> been<00:03:25.200> running<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.769> all<00:03:26.040> day<00:03:26.310> and

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
but i've been running this all day and

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.280 
but i've been running this all day and
the<00:03:27.269> voltage<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.940> battery<00:03:29.940> right<00:03:30.180> here

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
the voltage on this battery right here

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.220 
the voltage on this battery right here
hasn't<00:03:31.290> gone<00:03:31.590> down<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.359> I<00:03:33.510> tune<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.989> up

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
hasn't gone down and if I tune this up

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.800 
hasn't gone down and if I tune this up
just<00:03:34.260> right<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.859> actually<00:03:35.190> goes<00:03:35.340> back<00:03:35.370> up<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:36.780> I

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
just right it actually goes back up so I

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.780 
just right it actually goes back up so I
don't<00:03:37.200> know<00:03:37.319> I<00:03:37.560> don't<00:03:37.680> know<00:03:37.829> what<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.549> story

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
don't know I don't know what the story

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.879 
don't know I don't know what the story
is<00:03:38.970> why<00:03:39.269> this<00:03:39.329> is<00:03:39.569> doing<00:03:39.989> what<00:03:40.169> it's<00:03:40.319> doing<00:03:40.410> but

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
is why this is doing what it's doing but

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.159 
is why this is doing what it's doing but
I<00:03:41.069> know<00:03:41.250> on<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.519> jewel<00:03:41.849> thief<00:03:41.900> they<00:03:42.900> don't

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
I know on a jewel thief they don't

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.830 
I know on a jewel thief they don't
require<00:03:43.380> much<00:03:43.709> energy<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.790> then<00:03:45.389> they<00:03:45.540> bump

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
require much energy and then they bump

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.050 
require much energy and then they bump
up<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.349> voltage<00:03:46.739> quite<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.280> bit<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.819> back

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
up the voltage quite a bit to the back

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.670 
up the voltage quite a bit to the back
end<00:03:48.359> and<00:03:48.599> that's<00:03:48.660> what<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.079> is<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.590> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
end and that's what this is this is the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.220 
end and that's what this is this is the
back<00:03:49.859> end<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.280> circuit<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.910> took<00:03:51.389> back<00:03:51.900> in

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
back end of the circuit I took back in

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.949 
back end of the circuit I took back in
and<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.549> shoved<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.030> around<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.419> front<00:03:54.660> end

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
and I shoved it around to the front end

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.770 
and I shoved it around to the front end
then<00:03:55.829> I<00:03:55.889> went<00:03:56.040> over<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.549> Bedini<00:03:56.849> SSG<00:03:57.569> with

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
then I went over to the Bedini SSG with

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.020 
then I went over to the Bedini SSG with
it<00:03:57.900> let<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.650> do<00:03:58.919> its<00:03:59.069> thing<00:03:59.160> over<00:03:59.579> here<00:03:59.609> with

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
it let it do its thing over here with

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.569 
it let it do its thing over here with
super<00:04:00.560> capacitors<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.829> charge<00:04:02.099> battery

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
super capacitors and the charge battery

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.860 
super capacitors and the charge battery
and<00:04:03.500> anyway<00:04:04.500> i<00:04:04.530> just<00:04:04.769> thought<00:04:05.129> i<00:04:05.160> would<00:04:05.870> clear

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
and anyway i just thought i would clear

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.119 
and anyway i just thought i would clear
out<00:04:06.900> something<00:04:07.410> different<00:04:07.440> this<00:04:07.799> is<00:04:07.859> what<00:04:08.069> it

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
out something different this is what it

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.309 
out something different this is what it
sounds<00:04:08.340> like<00:04:08.549> here

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
sounds like here

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:18.110 
sounds like here
here<00:04:11.129> run<00:04:11.400> away<00:04:14.780> it's<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.989> waveform<00:04:16.560> here<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:17.190> can

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
here run away it's a waveform here I can

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:30.670 
here run away it's a waveform here I can
vary<00:04:18.389> that<00:04:18.660> with<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:19.489> potentiometer

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.740 

I<00:04:30.770> don't<00:04:31.669> know<00:04:31.759> I<00:04:32.030> don't<00:04:32.090> know<00:04:32.270> it's<00:04:32.479> like<00:04:32.690> I

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
I don't know I don't know it's like I

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.140 
I don't know I don't know it's like I
say<00:04:33.020> if<00:04:33.080> anybody<00:04:33.500> has<00:04:33.710> any<00:04:33.740> ideas<00:04:34.400> on<00:04:34.580> what's

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
say if anybody has any ideas on what's

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.939 
say if anybody has any ideas on what's
happening<00:04:35.570> here<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:35.930> why<00:04:36.110> it's<00:04:36.320> happening<00:04:36.530> I

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
happening here and why it's happening I

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.189 
happening here and why it's happening I
don't<00:04:37.160> know<00:04:37.310> but<00:04:37.669> I<00:04:37.880> could<00:04:38.840> say<00:04:38.960> I've<00:04:39.050> been

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
don't know but I could say I've been

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:46.689 
don't know but I could say I've been
running<00:04:39.410> this<00:04:39.590> thing<00:04:41.380> all<00:04:42.380> day<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:45.699> battery

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
running this thing all day and battery

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.670 
running this thing all day and battery
doesn't<00:04:46.970> seem<00:04:47.210> to<00:04:47.330> go<00:04:47.479> up<00:04:47.630> or<00:04:47.810> down<00:04:47.840> or<00:04:48.050> just<00:04:48.289> of

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
doesn't seem to go up or down or just of

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.499 
doesn't seem to go up or down or just of
course<00:04:48.889> as<00:04:49.039> a<00:04:49.070> voltage<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.759> voltage<00:04:49.789> doesn't

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
course as a voltage the voltage doesn't

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.029 
course as a voltage the voltage doesn't
tell<00:04:50.660> you<00:04:50.780> a<00:04:50.810> whole<00:04:50.930> lot<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.350> just<00:04:51.380> tells<00:04:51.830> just

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
tell you a whole lot it just tells just

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.279 
tell you a whole lot it just tells just
some<00:04:52.430> of<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.610> story<00:04:52.910> but<00:04:53.300> that<00:04:53.509> is<00:04:54.110> one

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
some of the story but that is one

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.650 
some of the story but that is one
indication<00:04:54.830> of<00:04:55.220> what's<00:04:55.490> happening<00:04:56.150> inside<00:04:56.479> of

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
indication of what's happening inside of

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.570 
indication of what's happening inside of
rechargeable<00:04:57.500> batteries<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.190> look<00:04:58.340> at<00:04:58.460> the

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
rechargeable batteries you look at the

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.430 
rechargeable batteries you look at the
voltage<00:04:59.000> on<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.479> see<00:04:59.660> if<00:04:59.750> it<00:04:59.870> drops<00:05:00.080> her

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
voltage on it and see if it drops her

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.029 
voltage on it and see if it drops her
what<00:05:01.190> happens<00:05:01.639> to<00:05:01.820> it<00:05:01.850> but<00:05:02.590> very<00:05:03.590> interesting

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
what happens to it but very interesting

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.560 
what happens to it but very interesting
experiment<00:05:04.669> I've<00:05:04.759> had<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:04.970> lot<00:05:05.090> of<00:05:05.150> fun<00:05:05.389> with

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
experiment I've had a lot of fun with

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.510 
experiment I've had a lot of fun with
this<00:05:05.599> one<00:05:05.780> yeah<00:05:06.410> this<00:05:06.650> is<00:05:06.830> like<00:05:06.949> I<00:05:07.009> say<00:05:07.220> Johnny

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
this one yeah this is like I say Johnny

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.300 
this one yeah this is like I say Johnny
Darwin's<00:05:08.030> idea<00:05:08.449> was<00:05:09.169> to<00:05:09.289> take<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.680> jewel

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
Darwin's idea was to take the jewel

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
Darwin's idea was to take the jewel
thief<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:11.419> let<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:11.750> jewel<00:05:11.960> thief<00:05:13.180> run<00:05:14.180> the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
thief and let the jewel thief run the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.420 
thief and let the jewel thief run the
SSG<00:05:14.900> he's<00:05:15.199> done<00:05:15.440> it<00:05:15.590> differently<00:05:16.039> than<00:05:16.280> I've

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
SSG he's done it differently than I've

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.680 
SSG he's done it differently than I've
done<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.880> I<00:05:17.169> just<00:05:18.759> came<00:05:19.759> across<00:05:19.940> this<00:05:20.419> way<00:05:20.630> to

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
done it I just came across this way to

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.029 
done it I just came across this way to
do<00:05:20.960> it<00:05:21.080> and<00:05:21.259> I've<00:05:21.320> had<00:05:21.530> a<00:05:21.560> lot<00:05:21.710> of<00:05:21.770> fun<00:05:22.009> playing

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
do it and I've had a lot of fun playing

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.460 
do it and I've had a lot of fun playing
with<00:05:22.340> this<00:05:22.520> one<00:05:22.729> today<00:05:22.940> so<00:05:23.090> yeah<00:05:24.050> that's<00:05:24.259> the

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
with this one today so yeah that's the

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.349 
with this one today so yeah that's the
latest<00:05:24.650> on<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:26.270> Bedini<00:05:26.630> jewel<00:05:27.020> thief
