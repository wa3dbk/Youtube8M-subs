00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello and welcome to be handy at 3d 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.600
 today we show them 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.700
 How to use our Lakic 1 A lot of fun and little effort a unique 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.769
 memento 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.769
 or create a very personal gift 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.630
 first of all, it will work together 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.590
 what they get from us 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.590
 to be able to work with the Cayenne s 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.520
 The marquee gives a first feel to the material and handling when it does 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:33.210
 are so far 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.890
 they only need the right one 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.150
 changed from the cup 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.820
 or for flow 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.280
 off the powder for creating the mold 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.420
 This Bull will be for her later model 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.430
 as can some aids to stirring 8 from the sample and then GIS measures 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.430
 it also starts 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.620
 first of all, you search seven from the computer 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.160
 and then refer to the instruction quantity samples shot ratio of 8 from 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.160
 Pol Pot and water 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.010
 Now take the bag with the pumping and fill it 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.800
 determined amount in the MeÃŸkircher 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.640
 Then add the lukewarm water 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.840
 ideally it is at 23 degrees 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 in exceptional cases, it can be up to 30 degrees 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.470
 Start immediately with careful order 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.600
 By breaking the beating heart, they release the last bubbles 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 on 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.759
 After stirring for about 30 seconds, fill the 8 4 mass into the abyss echo 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.030
 and immediately dip your hand or foot into the water as well 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.810
 Landab forms of hands scored the best result 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.670
 when the hand is formed into a fist 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.680
 but slightly spread fingers 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.929
 otherwise it can lead to nice results at later casting 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.240
 because the fingertips are not 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.250
 Rinse out with Miep Gies water 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.259
 Please also pay attention to the hand or frings the band or the bottom of the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.259
 Bitkom I decided not to look 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.489
 After about 30 to 45 seconds, the mass has hardened 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.339
 and they can be hand or foot 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.339
 easy in shape 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.199
 pay attention 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.269
 to stick to the hand virtually no residue of the App for Mass 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:48.619
 By pouring the mold, first fill it to the brim with water 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.489
 this serves on the one hand the agreement 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.249
 On the other hand, they determine on the basis of the amount of water 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.629
 and with the help of the manual the required GIS material 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.739
 there they have to be the GIS mass and a bit more generous 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.059
 Now fill the determined amount of water into the local resident shots 

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.859
 and then have to 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.859
 the determined amount of this powder 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.669
 Now carefully send the GIS Bull was in the water and at once 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.669
 Start immediately with the customer 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.259
 Book until a smooth mass 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.259
 created without flowers 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:04:00.239
 Check briefly if there is no liquid left in the mold 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.679
 and start immediately with the filling 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.409
 repeated application of the mold prevented 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.409
 that air bubbles form in this class 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.840
 feel the shape to the edge 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.840
 this is to be excluded 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.969
 the process of informal 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.969
 is very simple 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.199
 because depending on the size of the model this can be 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.360
 one to three hours 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.009
 cured, they remove first 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.620
 the shape of the cup 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.930
 Carefully cut the app from the ACE on one side 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.460
 Make sure that they do not damage the model 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.110
 Now remove the app for Mass to determine white break away carefully 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.110
 from her model 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.260
 each form is usually used only once 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.240
 usually no post-processing is required 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.169
 not infrequently residues the GIS mass 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.059
 can be carefully bent 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:19.559
 Brother be removed with a knife 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:20.559
 this is going on 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.249
 Smaller bumps can also be smoothed with fine sandpaper 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.210
 Kartika is the model 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.210
 the leftovers can be safely disposed of with household waste 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.120
 already mentioned at the beginning 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.909
 you can also make feet off with Lakic 1 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.050
 all processes for such a model 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.939
 just described 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:50.379
 only in the choice of the agreement receives east they must take the form of 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.029
 Take account of foot 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:54.630
 here in shape we just 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.630
 a very nice footnote 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.650
 also on the foot can make minor corrections 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.539
 be made with a commercial knife 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:05.770
 for all models 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.499
 is a seal with Akon lay meaningful 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:09.379
 the pores from dust 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:11.749
 to protect 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:13.290
 interesting accessories 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.289
 You can also find it on our homepage 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.289
 www 3 the hand going his way 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.599
 is now this book about beautiful model 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.089
 that was it 

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:32.450
 so short and simple device with Laki Henze to wonderful memory 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.409
 or for a personal gift 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.930
 We wish him a lot of fun with Abbot Forming the pleasure of looking at it 

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:40.319
 or given away 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.770
 a3 to be like his hand
