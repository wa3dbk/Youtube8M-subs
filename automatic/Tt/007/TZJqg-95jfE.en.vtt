in<00:00:11.339> this<00:00:12.339> video<00:00:12.519> tutorial<00:00:12.820> I'm<00:00:13.360> going<00:00:13.570> to

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
in this video tutorial I'm going to

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.509 
in this video tutorial I'm going to
cover<00:00:13.959> how<00:00:14.230> to<00:00:14.259> run<00:00:14.530> Windows<00:00:14.980> metro

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
cover how to run Windows metro

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.730 
cover how to run Windows metro
applications<00:00:16.150> on<00:00:16.529> unsupported<00:00:17.529> low

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
applications on unsupported low

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.400 
applications on unsupported low
resolution<00:00:18.460> displays<00:00:18.910> now<00:00:19.630> if<00:00:19.840> you<00:00:20.140> haven't

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
resolution displays now if you haven't

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.890 
resolution displays now if you haven't
realized<00:00:20.740> yet<00:00:21.720> Microsoft<00:00:22.720> is<00:00:22.960> not<00:00:22.990> supporting

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
realized yet Microsoft is not supporting

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.880 
realized yet Microsoft is not supporting
resolution<00:00:25.900> displays<00:00:26.199> which<00:00:26.380> I<00:00:26.470> really<00:00:26.710> think

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
resolution displays which I really think

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.999 
resolution displays which I really think
they<00:00:26.980> should<00:00:27.009> support<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:28.689> the<00:00:29.009> resolution

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
they should support the the resolution

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.280 
they should support the the resolution
required<00:00:30.430> to<00:00:31.029> run<00:00:31.360> Windows<00:00:31.840> Metro

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
required to run Windows Metro

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.639 
required to run Windows Metro
applications<00:00:32.410> is<00:00:33.270> 1024<00:00:34.270> by<00:00:34.660> 768

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
applications is 1024 by 768

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.529 
applications is 1024 by 768
but<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.129> problem<00:00:36.460> is<00:00:36.579> many<00:00:36.760> ultrabooks<00:00:37.360> and

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
but the problem is many ultrabooks and

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.950 
but the problem is many ultrabooks and
netbooks<00:00:37.930> run<00:00:38.320> at<00:00:38.590> a<00:00:38.649> resolution<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.539> 1024<00:00:40.539> by

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
netbooks run at a resolution of 1024 by

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.649 
netbooks run at a resolution of 1024 by
600<00:00:41.379> so<00:00:42.280> in<00:00:42.430> this<00:00:42.550> tutorial<00:00:42.730> I'm<00:00:43.239> going<00:00:43.420> to

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
600 so in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.049 
600 so in this tutorial I'm going to
cover<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.289> particular<00:00:44.589> registry<00:00:45.429> hack<00:00:45.609> that

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
cover a particular registry hack that

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.569 
cover a particular registry hack that
can<00:00:46.239> be<00:00:46.359> used<00:00:46.600> to<00:00:46.719> enable<00:00:46.989> dynamic<00:00:47.579> resolution

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
can be used to enable dynamic resolution

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.119 
can be used to enable dynamic resolution
scaling<00:00:49.269> so<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:49.960> we<00:00:50.109> can<00:00:50.319> change<00:00:50.890> our

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
scaling so that we can change our

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.419 
scaling so that we can change our
resolution<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.999> 1024<00:00:52.749> by<00:00:52.870> 768<00:00:53.199> and<00:00:53.649> run<00:00:54.010> metro

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
resolution to 1024 by 768 and run metro

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.430 
resolution to 1024 by 768 and run metro
applications<00:00:55.149> so<00:00:55.659> what<00:00:55.870> we're<00:00:56.019> going<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.260> do

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
applications so what we're going to do

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.279 
applications so what we're going to do
is<00:00:56.649> launch<00:00:57.100> regedit<00:00:57.760> which<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.809> registry

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
is launch regedit which is the registry

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.329 
is launch regedit which is the registry
editing<00:00:59.649> program<00:01:00.069> and<00:01:01.379> once<00:01:02.379> we've<00:01:02.589> launched

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
editing program and once we've launched

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.000 
editing program and once we've launched
regedit<00:01:04.180> we're<00:01:04.390> going<00:01:04.570> to<00:01:04.690> go<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:04.960> edit<00:01:05.290> fine

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
regedit we're going to go to edit fine

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.850 
regedit we're going to go to edit fine
and<00:01:06.310> we're<00:01:07.270> going<00:01:07.510> to<00:01:07.570> look<00:01:08.229> for<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.680> key

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
and we're going to look for the key

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.010 
and we're going to look for the key
display<00:01:09.370> one<00:01:09.640> underscore<00:01:10.210> downscaling

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
display one underscore downscaling

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.110 
display one underscore downscaling
supported<00:01:11.710> now<00:01:12.040> there<00:01:12.250> are<00:01:12.400> multiple<00:01:12.970> entries

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
supported now there are multiple entries

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.940 
supported now there are multiple entries
of<00:01:13.570> this<00:01:13.990> key<00:01:14.229> all<00:01:14.260> over<00:01:14.680> through<00:01:14.860> the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
of this key all over through the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.560 
of this key all over through the
registry<00:01:15.430> so<00:01:15.460> you're<00:01:15.730> going<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.060> have<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.300> find

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
registry so you're going to have to find

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.500 
registry so you're going to have to find
every<00:01:17.320> single<00:01:17.710> one<00:01:17.800> of<00:01:17.950> them<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.880> won't<00:01:19.300> take

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
every single one of them it won't take

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.210 
every single one of them it won't take
very<00:01:19.570> long<00:01:19.750> my<00:01:20.020> computer<00:01:20.440> there<00:01:20.560> was<00:01:20.650> around<00:01:20.920> 5

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
very long my computer there was around 5

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.340 
very long my computer there was around 5
but<00:01:22.120> you're<00:01:22.270> going<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.540> double<00:01:22.840> click<00:01:22.930> on<00:01:23.110> each

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
but you're going to double click on each

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.790 
but you're going to double click on each
entry<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.250> if<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.270> value<00:01:25.660> data<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.200> 0<00:01:26.590> you're

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
entry and if the value data is 0 you're

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.340 
entry and if the value data is 0 you're
going<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.130> change<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:28.120> 1<00:01:28.480> and<00:01:28.780> then<00:01:29.110> just

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
going to change that to 1 and then just

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.560 
going to change that to 1 and then just
click<00:01:29.560> OK<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.100> then<00:01:30.610> you're<00:01:30.790> going<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.150> repeat

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
click OK and then you're going to repeat

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.660 
click OK and then you're going to repeat
the<00:01:31.750> process<00:01:31.780> for<00:01:32.470> every<00:01:32.650> single<00:01:32.830> entry<00:01:35.670> now

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
the process for every single entry now

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.210 
the process for every single entry now
once<00:01:37.030> all<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.720> entries<00:01:38.170> have<00:01:38.590> been<00:01:38.770> changed

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
once all the entries have been changed

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.490

but we're going to go ahead and restart

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:52.170 
but we're going to go ahead and restart
the<00:01:41.710> computer<00:01:41.920> now<00:01:50.430> once<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.580> computer<00:01:52.000> has

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
the computer now once the computer has

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.510 
the computer now once the computer has
been<00:01:52.390> restarted<00:01:52.870> we're<00:01:53.560> going<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.920> proceed<00:01:54.250> to

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
been restarted we're going to proceed to

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.000 
been restarted we're going to proceed to
go<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:54.820> desktop<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.840> then<00:01:56.260> right<00:01:56.500> click<00:01:56.800> and

select screen resolution once we're here

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.950 
select screen resolution once we're here
we're<00:01:59.800> now<00:01:59.920> going<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.490> change<00:02:00.910> our<00:02:01.270> resolution

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
we're now going to change our resolution

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.949 
we're now going to change our resolution
to<00:02:02.110> 1024<00:02:03.010> by<00:02:03.340> 768<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:09.239> then<00:02:10.239> once<00:02:10.539> we've<00:02:10.780> done

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
to 1024 by 768 and then once we've done

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.350 
to 1024 by 768 and then once we've done
this<00:02:11.170> you'll<00:02:11.680> see<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.310> now<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:13.120> can

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
this you'll see that now that you can

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.770 
this you'll see that now that you can
run<00:02:14.080> Windows<00:02:14.560> metro<00:02:15.190> applications<00:02:15.909> and<00:02:16.120> they

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
run Windows metro applications and they

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.600 
run Windows metro applications and they
work<00:02:16.959> great<00:02:16.989> on<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.860> lower<00:02:18.040> resolution

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
work great on the lower resolution

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.970 
work great on the lower resolution
