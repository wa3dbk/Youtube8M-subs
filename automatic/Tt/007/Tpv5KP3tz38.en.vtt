00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
bit faster it won't be like super speed

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.440 
bit faster it won't be like super speed
them<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.770> haven't<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.700> figured<00:01:42.000> out<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
them I haven't really figured out how to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.310

make<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.930> super<00:01:43.170> speed<00:01:43.759> but<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:46.140> go<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
make it like super speed but you go to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:02:00.219 
make it like super speed but you go to
lake<00:01:46.590> arenal<00:01:50.060> DG<00:01:52.790> crap<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.000> put<00:01:54.030> dot<00:01:54.360> com<00:01:54.540> twice

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229

it's<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.380> little<00:02:01.799> bit<00:02:01.890> faster<00:02:02.040> for<00:02:02.399> me<00:02:02.430> it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it's a little bit faster for me it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.780 
it's a little bit faster for me it
should<00:02:03.479> work<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.810> guys<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.280> I
