00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.270
 hello everyone with you spoon and today we 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.879
 We will consider really very 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.150
 good mod and even useful because 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:19.270
 he adds one progress okay let's 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.570
 let's start this mod for beer and wine like you 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.820
 already see we have such a bed where 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.619
 barley grown yes it's barley of course 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.960
 It looks like wheat but probably the author does not 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.789
 came up with another texture when we 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.500
 we generate a new world we have 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.449
 actually here is such a blade of grass 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.400
 which is orange it grows 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.220
 own all biomes even as you can see 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.199
 in the winter, and if we knock out some of her 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.739
 the seeds actually fall out but she 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.769
 It does not always fall out that is a random like 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.750
 wheat seed itself here you are up to 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.269
 such a barrel is also added 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.570
 which we will discuss later but a 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.479
 for now we collect barley pop to us 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.650
 whole barley stuff and as well as 5 grains we 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:04.540
 of course we will plant again and discard all 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.250
 the remaining also we have grapes like 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.860
 I have already said you can make grape 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.560
 wine, of course, we will collect vines 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.740
 how many seven flies you just give me 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.980
 just lucky also if we have hunger 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.110
 and we run and run but we have in 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.000
 hands and awards then we can eat it but 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.340
 since i am now this i am just on 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.560
 just I do not want this and we grapes 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.330
 we can simply remake in 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.910
 seeds which we can then later 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.010
 put here on these grids which you 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.530
 See how to craft on the site 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.650
 Well, in general, we collected barley and 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.670
 harvested wine grapes more precisely yes yes yes 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.520
 grapes then we put a bucket in the barrel 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.770
 with water I put two barrels and because 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.580
 what are we going to cook and barley that is 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.090
 beer and wine let's actually cook 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:59.200
 At first, wine can be cooked immediately and 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.320
 beer is brewed she speak immediately enough 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.500
 long so i probably skip well it but 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.619
 actually after cooking wine and beer with us 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.930
 it turns out a bucket of wine and actually with 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.000
 beer but we just can not drink them 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.909
 as you can see but it is illogical from the bucket 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.280
 drink wine or beer so we first 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.310
 go to the workbench and make mugs for beer 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.930
 the deed of their 8 pieces is necessarily made 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.760
 they are actually very simple for this 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.560
 we will need to cut down only two 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.069
 log I think or how many there are three 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.889
 logs oh well think there and 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.090
 Of course, the glasses that are needed for 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.519
 the blame 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.099
 oh actually it's not a glass but I don't 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.290
 I know what they are called to the same four to f 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.939
 in short, they are actually called now 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.489
 when we screamed it 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.459
 we put off for example skirts but i 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.139
 I will call them a glass sorry 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.889
 handbags lay the whole table 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.489
 crafting 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:57.590
 and in the middle we put a pork bucket 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.290
 now we actually have 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.919
 a glass of wine yes we can drink them but 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.219
 for starters, we surely scrape beer 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:09.200
 yes this is the most standard i think and 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:11.150
 actually we get this 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.579
 here's a little beer with beer that we can 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.310
 its time to have a drink when we drink we 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:20.389
 let's not blame us 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:25.010
 the screen will float but we will have a mouse 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:27.439
 move well look very bad now 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.709
 we will try to move the mouse ok i 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:31.990
 drank too little need to get drunk yet 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.930
 have a drink 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.030
 about everything and drunk now look like 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.600
 the mouse moves smoothly 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.720
 Well, of course smoothly but still uncomfortable 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:48.160
 that if we drink even more then of course 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.470
 bench we fall into more like say 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.630
 overstated intoxication I will this 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.630
 so to speak I call everyone 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.270
 in its own way well, and actually today 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.770
 this mod is too alcoholic mod but 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.810
 if he did he like it then 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.360
 Of course, I download, of course I forgot 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.820
 say about the wine but speak immediately from the wine 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.470
 the effect is exactly the same ie mouse 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.110
 you will just simply swim by 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.940
 the screen, well, in general, here I am like 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.770
 already said mod and if you liked it 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.410

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.450
