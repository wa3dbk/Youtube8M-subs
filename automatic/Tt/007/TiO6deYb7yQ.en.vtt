00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 the under 13 team of the soccer club 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.330
 Port thick sa last weekend 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.030
 district champion in the championship 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.610
 played by sub 14 teams to play 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.469
 in a step above age and the team 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.260
 integrated where the team trained by 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.330
 Israel has some players who give a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.160
 example out of the field when making some 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.890
 sacrifices to wear the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:29.760
 dragons saint but forehead between the trips 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:34.140
 or central floor dropped to the extreme or 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.210
 side and has 300 fell then how 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.350
 was this year to be champion as was the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.239
 sensation 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.530
 We worked there as a prince. 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.770
 we achieved the goal 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.219
 ferron fesh fesh which was a walk 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.969
 long and difficult but we managed to 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.770
 surprise that they participate in the championship 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.500
 with 14 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.640
 is something that is part of the culture of the club 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.539
 to win is not to say that it was a year more 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.850
 positive for development 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.030
 individual who is one of the players and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.909
 so it is obvious that she took away 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.610
 photos of these rooms in that respect I 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.700
 I can say that was good for a sound 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.250
 of all young people at night 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.869
 say that a first phase of the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.020
 process in which they came and went with 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.750
 dynamics of 7 soccer 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.659
 they could not make the bridge 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.049
 because this year alone there has been inclusion 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.409
 from the championship to the new one and then I can 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.020
 divide is this time into two parts one 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.020
 part of the adaptation and then a part of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.930
 improve from game to game number like 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.420
 we all have we have references 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.700
 I have one that played a very 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.610
 important in the formation of the club was miss 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.979
 dakota suite 5 to 4 to 4 pillars inside 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.210
 globe that we have to follow that 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.100
 are 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.899
 we have to follow is that we are in serial 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.759
 our president is not a figure of our 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.759
 President, in which I have to be 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.860
 associated with supporting your port and 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.429
 I consider a person the port is and a god 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:17.180
 it is competence 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:20.269
 a lot of strength and dedication to working 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.689
 a lot and I tried to do my best 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.090
 training and every year going 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:28.280
 I'm going to do this moment, I have the last 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.680
 level is the coach or it's my own 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.200
 also a sector is important in training 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.859
 and now I'm going to take an 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.829
 also provide, let's always say up-to-date 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.700
 to update on what is the face training 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.439
 common 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.760
 I think when we have to be 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:47.720
 concentrates the game in concentration on 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.919
 connect play play 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.409
 our players have to have passion 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:53.599
 by the game that is most important after 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:57.469
 the passion for the globe that always tries 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:59.599
 inside it ambition has to be very 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:01.790
 ambitious to spend on growing 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.430
 more and so I have to go because 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.109
 I'm also very ambitious that I can 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.030
 stay like this and we have to work many 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:13.189
 Days suffered from another truck 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.629
 tomorrow the same thing happens and has 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.299
 we have to be very strict in the 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.609
 work we do and do not try 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.000
 to transmit all these four 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:25.489
 of these four pillars is to bring together 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.189
 The word that so many people say it is 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.129
 to be a port and for them to have a 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.109
 great evolution in the club and have 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.560
 in mind as the landing is the team 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:39.590
 because all the players who are each 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.659
 come from focusing on a single objective that is 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.659
 to reach something that is the biggest club that is 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.780
 equip liked to be national champion 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:51.109
 and in Chechnya 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.930
 I think it's always good to be champion either 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.359
 equip or I think I stayed 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.430
 the happier they are to one day look at 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.879
 equip and vice versa maybe a player 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.209
 I I in this case is the mobile 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.879
 spent a year or two or three per 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.550
 Menem and then yes I'll feel 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.280
 held for over a year 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.709
 So explain Carla, how is it? 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.690
 your day in the dragon's house how did it go? 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.590
 their adaptation to the gains of the 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.380
 morning 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.200
 the silence of the house is gonna sting 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.280
 to school when the girl came back 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.610
 In the afternoon I can work on my cell phone and 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.960
 Night your new moms and mommy 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.560
 to train right? 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.190
 Yes, I found the team's choice at home. 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.500
 contiguous 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.810
 I'm not younger, maybe it 'll be easy to 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.950
 make the taste to normal 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.730
 School is clean key and went to 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:59.490
 end the embargo train already in the car arrives 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:04.250
 at home late when the time it takes 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.250
 of the club in a room and me every day 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:12.030
 and that we can say that in a hurry we have 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.760
 to attend classes at school as the 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.550
 notes and behavior 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:22.260
 that's all I demand thus prevent 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.840
 reflect as they say when 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.570
 You really want to get something 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.120
 always a dish beyond sure there is 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.460
 time to study and the certainty that there is 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.890
 time for Syria to pay because it arrives 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.440
 Here's the training time. 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.200
 sure there is a way to 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.240
 food because when you get home 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.190
 If I have to wait for the departure time of the 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.550
 workout for dinner when you get home 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.460
 will have sure shapes that will help in the 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.520
 sure also that trip tomorrow 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.240
 runs is sleepy but that does everything 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.430
 part of me grow and grow and evolve 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.480
 as a player in wanting to achieve a 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:06.510
 which is the service and always went 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.060
 always arrange with a way of being 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:15.800
 always with me never think about the 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.800
 trip of a stakeout theft
