unlikely that any record to be breaking

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.490 
unlikely that any record to be breaking
but<00:02:36.120> around<00:02:37.120> about<00:02:37.330> four<00:02:37.630> hours<00:02:37.840> perhaps<00:02:38.170> we

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
but around about four hours perhaps we

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.890 
but around about four hours perhaps we
can<00:02:38.590> expect<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.100> leaders<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.750> horizon
