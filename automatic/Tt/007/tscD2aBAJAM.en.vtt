00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:09.029
 but the referee was the most disastrous 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.029
 that I saw in the last ten years 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.750
 in number 5 of Brazil 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.120
 He went to look for Jaime Rodriguez 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.550
 minute 1 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:26.110
 until the 20th minute the agro has committed 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:30.400
 five or six faults and no and no and I do not say 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:35.050
 that to go were strong but for 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.630
 reiteration of faults if referring and the 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.660
 regulation is taken as a list 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.310
 you do not have to be james when you 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.400
 they showed the yellow card made him 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:51.260
 who did 1 2 3 4 5 to me and I the first 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.390
 yellow because using the second half 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.680
 already in the second time 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.680
 another thing 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.809
 the criminal 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 what do I do if you play them with 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:10.070
 with germany with germany 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.070
 the criminal d 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:20.329
 July Caesar a cow is criminal and expulsion 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.590
 and it did not happen to stop without thiago 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.300
 silva and being aimar 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.159
 Brazil loses 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.690
 spinal column 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.060
 who has the equipment 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.540
 and I think that even in that weight the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.940
 referee when when he took the penalty 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.700
 because when the penalty can first 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.420
 what he did was look for the yellow card 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.260
 because it's direct red 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:56.730
 but this unintentionally without wanting 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:01.670
 discuss the supremacy that Brazil had 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.390
 in many moments of the match on 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.060
 in colombia yes it seems to me that the goal 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.989
 canceled to colombia would also have to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.550
 observe it with magnifying glass if in the position in 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.150
 line the mark when the ball is 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.610
 traveling does not know who is going to touch her and 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.620
 indeed, it is not the one who 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.900
 it was on its side it will arrive but where is it 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.239
 does not arrive and then three or 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.590
 four plays if it will always be one of the 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.050
 that was ahead like it was like the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.330
 fourth play in which shoves 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.430
 ball on it because yes because there are three or 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.040
 four robots and in front that the goal 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.530
 important was a tie in a moment 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.989
 in which Colombia had 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.220
 grown to the rising aggression and 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:49.640
 they had taken the reins of the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.230
 party until until the young acid 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.239
 but it is more serious that they have not thrown 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.530
 July Caesar because that's subjective that 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.830
 it's like that if it's because of the element of 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.830
 lugo 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:06.720
 and I coming to the channel I find out 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.020
 that the fifa congratulate the referee 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.989
 because he had a great performance now I 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.870
 I think he had to match they saw or 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.989
 they went to see baseball or went to 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.000
 bulls because they did not go to today's game 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.250
 football security fall asleep 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.519
 heather truth let's clarify that it is the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.190
 the brand that counted this novelty 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.500
 is that the fifa had congratulated the 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.209
 today's match referee now is that 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.489
 what we saw and was only on the court 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.069
 the interior there were more than 60 faults diego 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.709
 they know which charge showed the first 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.010
 yellow in the number 42 fault but not 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.670
 I'm going says then that number 5 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.370
 from Brazil 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.860
 well 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:57.140
 systematically to hit him 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.880
 of the 777 kicks followed by Jaime 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:05.950
 Rodriguez and the Spanish referee was 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:10.030
 disastrous was horrifying it was disgusting 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.959
 I do not know what else to tell him why 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:17.250
 did not enforce the regulation not all 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.739
 all all all contrasts 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.300
 that allow me the church of 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.430
 fifa administrator say a 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.530
 fish manager and refereeing the match 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.970
 to take it out more or less but 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.630
 no not trying to do justice 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.570
 justice I think that I believe that 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.169
 they chose the referee right in the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.930
 moment 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.279
 where Colombia had more possibilities 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.279
 to beat brazil that never 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.669
 then it was the reverse first fault 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.460
 second foul the referee has to 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.620
 show what the way is 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.969
 because if the party of 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.939
 hands how did it go 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:04.519
 later after I could not do it anymore 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:08.119
 could backtrack could no longer 

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:12.229
 get back on track because there is a play that 

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:14.020
 that the ball is outside and cover 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.139
 for Brazil 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.720
 with a shoe that touches him with what he plays with 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.479
 the shoulder and then take it out to do the 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.500
 3 the cob in favor of Brazil 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:29.889
 the madness 11 a total disaster yes I 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.490
 I think it has had negative gravitation 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:36.009
 and I come to comfort but without 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.400
 no doubt in each on each ball 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.259
 divided to vÃ­ctor hugo 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.360
 in each divided ball of reason 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.360
 proceed was era was from Brazil
