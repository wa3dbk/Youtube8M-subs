probably boring you to tears with us but

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.819 
probably boring you to tears with us but
that's<00:02:22.560> most<00:02:23.099> important<00:02:23.700> from<00:02:24.510> here<00:02:24.829> focusing

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
that's most important from here focusing

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.149 
that's most important from here focusing
on<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> contraction<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.879> a<00:02:27.060> PEC<00:02:27.269> muscle<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
on a contraction of a PEC muscle and

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.339 
on a contraction of a PEC muscle and
absolute<00:02:29.159> complete<00:02:29.720> maximal<00:02:30.720> squeeze<00:02:31.109> at<00:02:31.319> the

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
absolute complete maximal squeeze at the

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.490 
absolute complete maximal squeeze at the
top<00:02:32.269> this<00:02:33.269> is<00:02:33.420> another<00:02:33.599> little<00:02:33.840> trick<00:02:34.109> it's

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
top this is another little trick it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.550 
top this is another little trick it's
not<00:02:34.650> only<00:02:35.030> squeezing<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.720> squeezing<00:02:37.230> as

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
not only squeezing it's squeezing as

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.979 
not only squeezing it's squeezing as
hard<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.340> can<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:39.030> each<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.540> every<00:02:39.780> rep

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
hard as we can in each and every rep

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.440 
hard as we can in each and every rep
there's<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.010> contraction<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.849> there<00:02:42.359> is

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
there's a contraction and there is

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.869 
there's a contraction and there is
maximal<00:02:42.930> contraction<00:02:43.500> so<00:02:44.069> even<00:02:44.400> though<00:02:44.430> this

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
maximal contraction so even though this

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.319 
maximal contraction so even though this
wake<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.690> easy<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.409> light<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:47.099> Marcella<00:02:47.489> by

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
wake is easy and light for Marcella by

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.910 
wake is easy and light for Marcella by
squeezing<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.840> chest<00:02:49.200> hundred<00:02:49.560> percent<00:02:49.859> of

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
squeezing the chest hundred percent of

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.979 
squeezing the chest hundred percent of
the<00:02:50.010> top<00:02:50.250> he<00:02:50.849> is<00:02:50.909> exhausting<00:02:51.540> his<00:02:51.659> muscle

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
the top he is exhausting his muscle

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.690 
the top he is exhausting his muscle
fibers<00:02:52.319> just<00:02:52.650> like<00:02:52.829> if<00:02:52.980> he<00:02:53.129> would<00:02:53.250> do<00:02:53.370> double

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
fibers just like if he would do double

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.800 
fibers just like if he would do double
the<00:02:53.819> way<00:02:53.959> so<00:02:54.959> don't<00:02:55.319> chamber<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.099> ego<00:02:56.629> if<00:02:57.629> you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the way so don't chamber the ego if you

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.330 
the way so don't chamber the ego if you
want<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.019> establish<00:02:58.139> my<00:02:58.530> master<00:02:58.859> connection

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
want to establish my master connection

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.460 
want to establish my master connection
lower<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.939> weight<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.329> do<00:03:00.870> exactly<00:03:00.989> like

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
lower the weight and do exactly like

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.429 
lower the weight and do exactly like
this<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:02.459> he's<00:03:02.760> going<00:03:02.939> to<00:03:03.030> go<00:03:03.689> another<00:03:04.170> three

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
this so he's going to go another three

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.780 
this so he's going to go another three
reps<00:03:05.209> chest<00:03:06.209> up<00:03:06.450> slowly<00:03:07.230> open<00:03:07.859> up<00:03:08.010> this

is<00:07:00.830> going<00:07:01.009> to<00:07:01.129> get<00:07:01.279> during<00:07:02.029> the<00:07:02.240> machine<00:07:02.689> so

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:03.589 
is going to get during the machine so

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.649 
is going to get during the machine so
I'm<00:07:04.189> not<00:07:04.399> saying<00:07:04.669> that<00:07:04.759> machines<00:07:05.270> the<00:07:05.419> better

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:05.659 
I'm not saying that machines the better

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:08.679 
I'm not saying that machines the better
but<00:07:06.529> there<00:07:06.800> just<00:07:06.830> is<00:07:07.189> important<00:07:07.699> so<00:07:08.300> when<00:07:08.569> you

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:08.689 
but there just is important so when you

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:11.619 
but there just is important so when you
do<00:07:09.529> some<00:07:09.770> training<00:07:10.399> concept<00:07:10.909> for<00:07:11.059> a<00:07:11.089> chest<00:07:11.389> I

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:11.629 
do some training concept for a chest I

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:13.269 
do some training concept for a chest I
would<00:07:12.080> encourage<00:07:12.229> you<00:07:12.469> to<00:07:12.620> do<00:07:12.740> some<00:07:13.039> free

00:07:13.269 --> 00:07:13.279 
would encourage you to do some free

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:15.429 
would encourage you to do some free
weight<00:07:13.460> moves<00:07:13.729> and<00:07:14.029> some<00:07:14.870> machine<00:07:15.199> moves

00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:15.439 
weight moves and some machine moves

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:18.339 
weight moves and some machine moves
maybe<00:07:16.370> a<00:07:16.490> couple<00:07:16.669> of<00:07:16.879> pressing<00:07:17.330> moves<00:07:17.539> sample

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:18.349 
maybe a couple of pressing moves sample

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:21.579 
maybe a couple of pressing moves sample
of<00:07:18.469> flying<00:07:18.800> moves<00:07:19.069> so<00:07:19.969> if<00:07:20.209> we<00:07:20.389> analyze<00:07:21.229> the

00:07:21.579 --> 00:07:21.589 
of flying moves so if we analyze the

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:24.969 
of flying moves so if we analyze the
chest<00:07:21.979> and<00:07:22.159> lucio<00:07:22.490> cave<00:07:22.759> in
