Metal<00:02:04.280> Gear<00:02:04.310> Solid<00:02:04.790> 5<00:02:04.970> now<00:02:05.240> I'm<00:02:05.330> assuming<00:02:05.450> that

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
Metal Gear Solid 5 now I'm assuming that

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.169 
Metal Gear Solid 5 now I'm assuming that
since<00:02:06.440> fans<00:02:06.800> have<00:02:07.070> played<00:02:07.370> this<00:02:07.640> now<00:02:07.909> that

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
since fans have played this now that

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.759 
since fans have played this now that
when<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.390> actually<00:02:08.540> get<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.140> phantom<00:02:09.590> pain

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
when you actually get the phantom pain

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:10.990 
when you actually get the phantom pain
you're<00:02:09.980> not<00:02:10.100> going<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.280> have<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.489> play<00:02:10.730> it<00:02:10.880> all

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
you're not going to have to play it all

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.250 
you're not going to have to play it all
again<00:02:11.390> there's<00:02:11.630> probably<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:11.989> way<00:02:12.050> that

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
again there's probably a way that

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.420 
again there's probably a way that
they're<00:02:12.350> going<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.500> tie<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:12.920> all<00:02:13.010> in<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.310> each

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
they're going to tie it all in to each

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.280 
they're going to tie it all in to each
other<00:02:13.610> but<00:02:13.820> basically<00:02:14.209> what<00:02:14.510> Hideo<00:02:14.810> Kojima

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
other but basically what Hideo Kojima

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
the creator of the franchise said is

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.390 
the creator of the franchise said is
that<00:02:17.000> he<00:02:17.060> wanted<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.390> give<00:02:17.630> fans<00:02:18.400> an

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
that he wanted to give fans an

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.759 
that he wanted to give fans an
opportunity<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.239> play<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.810> lot<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.500> game

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
opportunity to play a lot of this game

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.740 
opportunity to play a lot of this game
because<00:02:22.130> we're<00:02:22.310> all<00:02:22.489> salivating<00:02:23.269> for<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.600> and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
because we're all salivating for it and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.330 
because we're all salivating for it and
so<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.019> that<00:02:24.110> reason<00:02:24.170> your<00:02:24.709> person<00:02:25.010> who<00:02:25.070> isn't

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
so for that reason your person who isn't

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.770 
so for that reason your person who isn't
really<00:02:25.430> into<00:02:25.790> Metal<00:02:26.000> Gear<00:02:26.030> Solid<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.540> going<00:02:26.720> to

really really cool the codec seems to be
gone<00:04:45.099> as<00:04:45.310> well<00:04:45.340> it's<00:04:45.760> like<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.910> radio

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
gone as well it's like a radio

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.879 
gone as well it's like a radio
transmission<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.080> just<00:04:47.260> get<00:04:47.530> as<00:04:47.740> you

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
run around so that simplifies things a

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.210 
run around so that simplifies things a
bit<00:04:49.960> too<00:04:49.990> there's<00:04:50.410> not<00:04:50.530> much<00:04:50.710> else<00:04:50.889> to<00:04:50.979> say

system you don't quite get into it as

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.690 
system you don't quite get into it as
much<00:05:40.750> yet<00:05:41.050> you're<00:05:41.230> like<00:05:41.380> I<00:05:41.560> almost<00:05:41.920> got<00:05:42.370> into

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
much yet you're like I almost got into

much yet you're like I almost got into
the<00:05:42.820> emotional<00:05:43.270> thing<00:05:43.480> and<00:05:43.510> then<00:05:43.720> it<00:05:43.810> ends<00:05:44.110> you

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
the emotional thing and then it ends you

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.870

know<00:05:44.230> what<00:05:44.410> I<00:05:44.470> mean<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:44.770> so<00:05:44.830> for<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:45.460> reason

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
know what I mean and so for that reason

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.550 
know what I mean and so for that reason
it's<00:05:46.030> not<00:05:46.120> really<00:05:46.690> like<00:05:46.810> a<00:05:46.840> perfect<00:05:47.290> game<00:05:47.380> at

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
it's not really like a perfect game at

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.960 
it's not really like a perfect game at
all<00:05:47.680> in<00:05:47.770> fact<00:05:47.920> it's<00:05:48.130> not<00:05:48.250> a<00:05:48.310> full<00:05:48.580> game<00:05:48.760> so<00:05:48.940> I

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970 
all in fact it's not a full game so I

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.550 
all in fact it's not a full game so I
can't<00:05:49.210> give<00:05:49.390> it<00:05:49.420> a<00:05:49.540> full<00:05:49.750> rating<00:05:50.170> I<00:05:50.260> did<00:05:50.410> have

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
can't give it a full rating I did have

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.110 
can't give it a full rating I did have
one<00:05:50.860> glitch<00:05:51.220> while<00:05:51.460> I<00:05:51.490> played<00:05:51.820> it<00:05:51.940> and<00:05:52.060> it

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
one glitch while I played it and it

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.520 
one glitch while I played it and it
wasn't<00:05:52.420> because<00:05:52.510> of<00:05:52.660> the<00:05:52.810> system<00:05:53.200> because

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
wasn't because of the system because

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.230 
wasn't because of the system because
when<00:05:53.740> I<00:05:53.770> turned<00:05:54.160> off<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.370> game<00:05:54.790> the<00:05:55.030> system

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
when I turned off the game the system

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.850 
when I turned off the game the system
and<00:05:55.630> the<00:05:55.690> menu<00:05:55.960> and<00:05:56.080> everything<00:05:56.170> worked<00:05:56.560> fine

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
and the menu and everything worked fine

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.590 
and the menu and everything worked fine
and<00:05:56.890> I<00:05:57.100> actually<00:05:57.220> recorded<00:05:57.970> that<00:05:58.120> glitch<00:05:58.390> and

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
and I actually recorded that glitch and

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:07.640 
and I actually recorded that glitch and
I'll<00:05:58.870> show<00:05:59.080> it<00:05:59.110> to<00:05:59.200> you<00:05:59.350> now

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.680 

I<00:06:07.740> don't<00:06:08.370> know<00:06:08.430> what<00:06:08.580> that<00:06:08.729> was<00:06:08.970> but<00:06:09.270> I<00:06:09.330> had<00:06:09.570> to

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
I don't know what that was but I had to

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.540 
I don't know what that was but I had to
actually<00:06:09.960> reset<00:06:10.440> the<00:06:10.560> game<00:06:10.770> that<00:06:11.370> only

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
actually reset the game that only

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.950 
actually reset the game that only
happened<00:06:11.910> one<00:06:12.060> time<00:06:12.090> but<00:06:12.479> for<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.720> most<00:06:12.840> part

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
happened one time but for the most part

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.570 
happened one time but for the most part
I<00:06:13.320> really<00:06:13.500> enjoyed<00:06:13.860> playing<00:06:13.889> this<00:06:14.280> because<00:06:14.550> I
