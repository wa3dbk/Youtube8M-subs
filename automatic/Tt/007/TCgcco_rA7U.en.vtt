00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 a cough all forewarned to review the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.750
 episode 11 of rain art 5 this has been 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.450
 a splendid chapter the truth is that 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.460
 we see a totally defensive concept 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.590
 with his monsters they serve for him 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 says to stand firm not to hold 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.180
 with internal defense we have the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.380
 another super aggressive like he uses xx 6 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.210
 non-stop board is for pissing 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.250
 monsters one after another one after another 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.140
 without stopping to synchronize leaving all the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.689
 while the field full of monsters 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 it's like the opposite parts 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.740
 once very fast and very aggressive against 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.110
 one of very defensive and slow so 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.430
 saying it has been very handsome all the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.110
 truth speaking a little about the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.420
 duel has surprised me a lot this 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.399
 monster that he used with zinc to this 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.140
 monster which had 3500 defense and 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.550
 to invoke the xolos you needed two 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.710
 artifices already created an invocation 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.030
 advanced and the best thing about this monster is 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.860
 that the son of a bitch ends up with the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.079
 defense is to say what you put in defense 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.640
 face up they have 3500 defense and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.250
 some of the fifth defense serves you for 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 attack mostly the final play he 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 has done with tape that initially 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.340
 I hope this asshole says that is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.199
 we are talking about that this duel is going to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.390
 be decisive to know if the school of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.400
 which is composed 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.320
 rain and all these are going to have to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.060
 be part of the posh school and 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.430
 we are risking all of this to this 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.890
 combat and the guy leave here a kart says 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.960
 do not start from cooperation 'cars is that 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.640
 I believe in my heart of letters one 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.650
 here I fit in his fucking mother but 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.450
 then you think about it the bastard what 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.910
 had everything planned from the beginning 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.040
 that is , all udec has no letters 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.570
 magical or traps are all monsters 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.670
 to activate the effects of certain 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.110
 serious monsters one of very interesting 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.940
 it left me very surprised to have 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.910
 defeated one of as good as that of 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.130
 the xx safework that is bestial already 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.470
 you have seen not with south with the other one 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.110
 3.100 with the synchro with the chameleon 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.880
 started to invoke pim pam pim pam toma 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.539
 lacasitos and there you see everything full of 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.100
 monsters 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.560
 the question is what I liked 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.030
 very much this time I guess he will take it out 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.679
 in real life it's not since it's the ones that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.810
 leave the series as a rule the 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.600
 they usually take out either by envelopes or 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.940
 before a reconstructed deck in order the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.890
 question is that the bastard is active on 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.690
 effect of the monsters that the other 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.640
 he had sent this course to the cemetery 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.080
 xx war he had done to this 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.570
 discard cards and monsters 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.260
 they work when they are in the cemetery 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.409
 since we feel 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.390
 that is, it inflicts damage since we saw that 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.879
 this energy monster I do not know how much damage 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.150
 to the xx 6 board and then the other 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.040
 took advantage and reflected it pim pim pim and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.989
 then he took advantage of the other and activated 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.269
 the other card which denied the attack 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.340
 reflected and above it took away both 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.049
 for each star well I think it was what 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.049
 which this duel has been totally 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.020
 in a tie I'm surprised that given the 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.450
 tie after a hundred points remain 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.760
 of life but with 100 points that bitch 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.560
 filly with 100 points gets tie the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.330
 combat and if it does not come by the letter 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.370
 that he throws the xx he sure would have won 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.860
 since what it removes I think 3300 of 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.000
 hit and pim pim pim good at that 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.190
 practically you have to comment 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.990
 about this great duel and talking about 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.550
 another thing from the chapter in the end has 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.020
 also left impacted or is it 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.510
 supposes that I believe that it really has 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.640
 reason that of the school of 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.560
 The boss is supposed to be 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.720
 combat was the best of three but yes to 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.890
 be a tie is supposed to have no 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.380
 than having won nobody but us 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.970
 he says to see if he sneaks to see if he sneaks 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.470
 I'm going to say that he had already told me that 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.210
 it has to be the best of three ie 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.220
 that if they win two or three matches 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.440
 that school becomes part of the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.180
 I'm going to tell him that and if he comes in 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.770
 Sneak and morgan to us if we 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.720
 we are like an independent school 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.030
 but it has not and is not cast says jeff 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.040
 here there has not been any winner this has 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.050
 left the tie breaker created the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.150
 two who have won are going to fight and here 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.220
 It was pretty clear, not that if we fight 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.650
 the game night of the merger against the 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.010
 rain law or it is very clear that 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.690
 will win longer 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.060
 and they arrive at the combat after it appears 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.310
 it's brought by the dragon hood the bastard 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.590
 controls everything and says and solve my 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.989
 son of a bitch seriously there's not too much 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.209
 difference of playability levels by 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.800
 so to say that is that of gray hair or 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.599
 of white hair is who much more 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.640
 strong you see him in the face I have not seen 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.050
 your block decorum we can see in the 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.870
 title the next chapter that 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.180
 called diddy or something like that I think it 's from 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.769
 which is what is to banish but yes 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.540
 the one of this reason to of quite powerful 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.580
 but what happens is that of course 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.350
 this one must control everything and that 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.299
 control the issue and when he gave 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.100
 advice to this one who used those 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.320
 techniques that he stole as if it were a 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.419
 candy to juiÃ  because it was seen that the 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.550
 see uncle she knew then play the fact 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.930
 that face this against you because I 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.310
 I think it's very unbalanced but 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.200
 well we'll see in the next 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.240
 chapter to see who comes out winner to see 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.530
 if there is a tie to see what the hell is going on 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.780
 but I have done a very good 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.310
 chapter is that it has been shown how 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.050
 can turn the fight around with 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.370
 letters of these disgusting begins a 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.120
 similar tag now I like it if you 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.710
 he liked the time he left 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.210
 very much and good and says goodbye to those 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.210
 traps and more kids subscribe
