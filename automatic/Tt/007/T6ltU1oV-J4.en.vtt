00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
our bobbling if you guys by any Marvel

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.180 
our bobbling if you guys by any Marvel
or<00:02:16.520> DC<00:02:16.910> pops<00:02:17.630> ways<00:02:17.840> they<00:02:17.989> usually<00:02:18.410> are<00:02:18.590> bobble

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190

or DC pops ways they usually are bobble
so<00:02:19.599> that's<00:02:20.599> just<00:02:20.900> how<00:02:21.020> they<00:02:21.140> do<00:02:21.349> it<00:02:21.500> i<00:02:21.560> guess<00:02:21.770> i

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
so that's just how they do it i guess i

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.949 
so that's just how they do it i guess i
don't<00:02:22.130> know<00:02:22.220> Marvel<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.790> DC<00:02:22.880> like<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.810> make

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
don't know Marvel and DC like to make

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.600 
don't know Marvel and DC like to make
their<00:02:24.110> pop<00:02:24.290> toys<00:02:24.500> bobble<00:02:24.860> but<00:02:25.250> he's<00:02:25.400> got<00:02:25.580> a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
their pop toys bobble but he's got a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.400 
their pop toys bobble but he's got a
huge<00:02:25.880> bubble<00:02:26.390> swivel<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.959> does<00:02:27.110> make<00:02:27.260> him

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
huge bubble swivel and it does make him

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.140 
huge bubble swivel and it does make him
look<00:02:27.530> like<00:02:27.709> he's<00:02:27.890> dancing<00:02:28.340> now<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:28.760> really<00:02:29.060> do

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
look like he's dancing now I really do

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.940 
look like he's dancing now I really do
wish<00:02:29.330> maybe<00:02:29.569> his<00:02:29.810> arms<00:02:30.200> would<00:02:30.319> Bible<00:02:30.650> as<00:02:30.769> well

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
wish maybe his arms would Bible as well

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.229 
wish maybe his arms would Bible as well
but<00:02:31.099> i<00:02:31.160> guess<00:02:31.340> i<00:02:31.489> would<00:02:31.550> be<00:02:31.700> really<00:02:31.880> intricate

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
but i guess i would be really intricate

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.240 
but i guess i would be really intricate
and<00:02:32.599> probably<00:02:33.110> cost<00:02:33.349> more<00:02:33.590> money<00:02:33.650> than<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.130> was

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
and probably cost more money than it was

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.130 
and probably cost more money than it was
