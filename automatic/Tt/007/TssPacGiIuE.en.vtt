would<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.320> wanting<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.650> do<00:01:52.800> is<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
would what we're wanting to do is to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.660 
would what we're wanting to do is to
expose<00:01:53.910> the<00:01:53.970> interior<00:01:54.900> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.620> grain<00:01:55.860> where

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
expose the interior of the grain where

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.060 
expose the interior of the grain where
the<00:01:56.880> food<00:01:57.330> source<00:01:57.660> is<00:01:57.840> stored<00:01:58.140> what<00:01:58.950> we're

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the food source is stored what we're

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.000 
the food source is stored what we're
wanting<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.400> do<00:01:59.550> is<00:02:00.150> take<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.630> starches

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
wanting to do is take the starches

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.500 
wanting to do is take the starches
convert<00:02:02.010> them<00:02:02.160> into<00:02:02.220> sugars<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.270> sugar

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
convert them into sugars and that sugar

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.660 
convert them into sugars and that sugar
then<00:02:03.720> becomes<00:02:04.050> available<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.680> yeast<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
then becomes available to yeast and the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.150 
then becomes available to yeast and the
yeast<00:02:05.910> creates<00:02:06.300> alcohol<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.380> carbon<00:02:07.530> dioxide

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
yeast creates alcohol and carbon dioxide

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.639 
yeast creates alcohol and carbon dioxide
and<00:02:08.670> other<00:02:09.270> things<00:02:09.570> we<00:02:09.720> want<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.140> there<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
and other things we want in there and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.120 
and other things we want in there and
the<00:02:11.610> residuals<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.360> leftover<00:02:13.010> give<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
the residuals that leftover give the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.940 
the residuals that leftover give the
body<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.730> malt<00:02:15.209> sweetness<00:02:15.860> are<00:02:16.860> you

body and the malt sweetness are you
haven't<00:02:17.220> been<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.980> moving<00:02:20.280> through<00:02:20.520> we're

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
haven't been so moving through we're

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.040 
haven't been so moving through we're
going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> go<00:02:21.209> through<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.690> brew<00:02:21.840> house

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
going to go through to the brew house

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.960 
going to go through to the brew house
and<00:02:22.880> look<00:02:23.880> at<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.030> vessels<00:02:24.420> we've<00:02:24.540> got<00:02:24.750> there

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
and look at the vessels we've got there

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.550 
and look at the vessels we've got there
so<00:02:26.970> after<00:02:27.239> we've<00:02:27.360> cracked<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.750> grains<00:02:28.020> in<00:02:28.380> the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
so after we've cracked the grains in the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.130 
so after we've cracked the grains in the
mill<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.220> flour<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.910> husks<00:02:30.360> fall<00:02:30.720> into

which is a great growing term is just

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.610 
which is a great growing term is just

are<00:03:39.600> residual<00:03:40.170> sugars<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.770> you<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:41.100> drain

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
are residual sugars and you just drain

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.830 
are residual sugars and you just drain
that<00:03:41.489> off<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.819> you're<00:03:41.910> just<00:03:42.030> just<00:03:42.390> splashing

part of the process after about four or
five<00:04:39.000> weeks<00:04:39.300> we'll<00:04:40.020> put<00:04:40.169> it<00:04:40.260> through<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.440> filter

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
five weeks we'll put it through a filter

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.650 
five weeks we'll put it through a filter
that<00:04:41.700> way<00:04:41.850> it<00:04:41.970> takes<00:04:42.150> out<00:04:42.330> into<00:04:42.510> yeast

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
that way it takes out into yeast

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.210 
that way it takes out into yeast
particles<00:04:43.200> of<00:04:43.320> protein<00:04:43.710> that<00:04:43.830> may<00:04:43.979> cause<00:04:44.190> a

particles of protein that may cause a
haze<00:04:44.520> makes<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.330> bit<00:04:45.479> bright<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.050> then<00:04:46.890> it'll

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
haze makes the bit bright and then it'll

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.409 
haze makes the bit bright and then it'll
go<00:04:47.250> on<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.850> being<00:04:48.180> kicked<00:04:48.710> bottled<00:04:49.710> or<00:04:50.060> cast<00:04:51.060> a

go on to being kicked bottled or cast a

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.690 
go on to being kicked bottled or cast a

lot of the big Brewers these days they
don't<00:04:53.880> really<00:04:54.000> like<00:04:54.180> using<00:04:54.390> a<00:04:54.570> lot<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.750> them<00:04:54.930> as

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
don't really like using a lot of them as

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.719 
don't really like using a lot of them as
an<00:04:55.500> example<00:04:55.860> in<00:04:56.789> a<00:04:57.510> pint

used to because beer for a lot of most
people<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.259> about<00:05:09.860> being<00:05:10.490> cold<00:05:10.699> and<00:05:10.849> physique

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
people is about being cold and physique

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.110 
people is about being cold and physique
which<00:05:12.259> for<00:05:13.069> me<00:05:13.189> is<00:05:13.219> quite<00:05:13.460> disappointing<00:05:13.939> if<00:05:14.029> I

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
which for me is quite disappointing if I

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.420 
which for me is quite disappointing if I
have<00:05:14.210> a<00:05:14.270> cold<00:05:14.419> fizzy<00:05:14.719> beer<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:15.050> want<00:05:15.469> flavor<00:05:15.710> so

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
have a cold fizzy beer I want flavor so

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.839 
have a cold fizzy beer I want flavor so
I<00:05:16.460> may<00:05:16.639> give<00:05:16.819> it<00:05:16.969> as<00:05:17.659> an<00:05:17.900> example<00:05:18.669> this<00:05:19.669> is<00:05:19.759> how

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
I may give it as an example this is how

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.769 
I may give it as an example this is how
many<00:05:19.999> hot<00:05:20.180> so<00:05:20.330> use<00:05:20.479> an<00:05:20.599> epic<00:05:22.089> equivalent<00:05:23.089> that

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:23.779 
many hot so use an epic equivalent that

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:28.989 
many hot so use an epic equivalent that
is<00:05:24.020> 25<00:05:24.529> hops<00:05:24.860> per<00:05:25.669> pint<00:05:26.499> so<00:05:27.499> you<00:05:28.460> can<00:05:28.610> see<00:05:28.789> them

00:05:28.989 --> 00:05:28.999 
is 25 hops per pint so you can see them

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:31.480 
is 25 hops per pint so you can see them
I<00:05:29.210> prefer<00:05:29.809> flavor<00:05:30.229> and<00:05:31.009> a<00:05:31.099> lot<00:05:31.279> of<00:05:31.309> other

I prefer flavor and a lot of other

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.010 
I prefer flavor and a lot of other
people<00:05:31.639> out<00:05:31.879> there<00:05:32.059> do<00:05:32.180> too<00:05:32.360> because<00:05:32.539> a<00:05:32.719> lot<00:05:32.990> of

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
people out there do too because a lot of

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.179 
people out there do too because a lot of
people<00:05:33.110> have<00:05:33.349> stopped<00:05:33.559> drinking<00:05:33.860> beer<00:05:34.039> and

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
people have stopped drinking beer and

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:37.209 
people have stopped drinking beer and
they<00:05:34.370> drink<00:05:34.610> wine<00:05:34.639> because<00:05:35.409> they're<00:05:36.409> pretty

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219 
they drink wine because they're pretty

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:39.429 
they drink wine because they're pretty
much<00:05:37.249> wrong<00:05:37.490> place<00:05:37.639> the<00:05:37.789> same<00:05:38.020> if<00:05:39.020> you<00:05:39.169> look<00:05:39.319> at

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:39.439 
much wrong place the same if you look at

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.260 
much wrong place the same if you look at
what's<00:05:39.680> on<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.889> shelf<00:05:40.069> so<00:05:40.789> after<00:05:41.029> a<00:05:41.089> day<00:05:41.210> is

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
what's on the shelf so after a day is

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.829 
what's on the shelf so after a day is
brewing<00:05:41.599> I'm<00:05:42.110> turning<00:05:42.620> malted<00:05:43.399> barley<00:05:43.839> taking

00:05:44.829 --> 00:05:44.839 
brewing I'm turning malted barley taking

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.230 
brewing I'm turning malted barley taking
pops<00:05:45.080> bringing<00:05:45.740> them<00:05:45.860> together<00:05:46.059> making<00:05:47.059> the

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
pops bringing them together making the

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.360 
pops bringing them together making the
marriage<00:05:47.509> of<00:05:47.689> that<00:05:47.870> flavor<00:05:48.189> boiling<00:05:49.189> it<00:05:49.279> up

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
marriage of that flavor boiling it up

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.389 
marriage of that flavor boiling it up
cooling<00:05:49.879> it<00:05:49.969> down<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:51.080> then<00:05:51.319> take<00:05:51.919> it<00:05:52.069> to<00:05:52.159> its

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:52.399 
cooling it down and then take it to its

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.670 
cooling it down and then take it to its
most<00:05:52.580> important<00:05:53.089> part<00:05:53.300> which<00:05:53.599> is<00:05:54.139> putting<00:05:54.589> it

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
most important part which is putting it

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.889 
most important part which is putting it
into<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:54.979> fermenter<00:05:55.389> this<00:05:56.389> is<00:05:56.509> where<00:05:56.629> you<00:05:56.719> add

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:56.899 
into the fermenter this is where you add

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.450 
into the fermenter this is where you add
the<00:05:57.050> yeast<00:05:57.229> and<00:05:57.529> without<00:05:57.710> yeast<00:05:58.069> you<00:05:58.249> don't

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
the yeast and without yeast you don't

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.309 
the yeast and without yeast you don't
make<00:05:58.610> beer<00:05:58.879> this<00:05:59.240> is<00:05:59.449> a<00:05:59.479> really<00:05:59.809> unique<00:05:59.960> thing

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 
make beer this is a really unique thing

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.469 
make beer this is a really unique thing
it's<00:06:00.710> a<00:06:00.830> living<00:06:01.039> cell<00:06:01.430> and<00:06:01.699> it's<00:06:02.059> really<00:06:02.300> hard

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
it's a living cell and it's really hard

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.329 
it's a living cell and it's really hard
for<00:06:02.569> me<00:06:02.689> to<00:06:02.870> go<00:06:03.020> this<00:06:03.620> is<00:06:03.740> what<00:06:03.860> a<00:06:03.889> use<00:06:04.069> looks

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:04.339 
for me to go this is what a use looks

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:05.439 
for me to go this is what a use looks
like<00:06:04.550> got<00:06:04.789> to<00:06:04.879> look<00:06:04.969> at<00:06:05.060> it<00:06:05.120> under<00:06:05.300> a

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
like got to look at it under a

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.040 
like got to look at it under a
microscope<00:06:06.939> for<00:06:07.939> one<00:06:08.089> of<00:06:08.180> those<00:06:08.300> big<00:06:08.509> tanks

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
microscope for one of those big tanks

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.719 
microscope for one of those big tanks
there's<00:06:09.379> billions<00:06:09.680> and<00:06:10.039> billions<00:06:10.189> of<00:06:10.490> cells

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
there's billions and billions of cells

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.189 
there's billions and billions of cells
and<00:06:11.180> they're<00:06:11.300> eating<00:06:11.539> up<00:06:11.629> the<00:06:11.659> sugar<00:06:11.930> and

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 
and they're eating up the sugar and

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:13.869 
and they're eating up the sugar and
they're<00:06:12.289> making<00:06:12.529> carbon<00:06:12.770> dioxide<00:06:13.310> and<00:06:13.789> then

00:06:13.869 --> 00:06:13.879 
they're making carbon dioxide and then

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:17.309 
they're making carbon dioxide and then
making<00:06:14.060> alcohol<00:06:14.360> but<00:06:15.349> here<00:06:15.800> is<00:06:16.370> an<00:06:16.520> example<00:06:16.610> of

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
making alcohol but here is an example of

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:23.230 
making alcohol but here is an example of
and<00:06:18.319> there<00:06:19.009> there's<00:06:19.599> 125<00:06:20.599> mils<00:06:20.930> of<00:06:21.319> yeast<00:06:22.249> but

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
and there there's 125 mils of yeast but

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.139 
and there there's 125 mils of yeast but
it<00:06:23.389> has<00:06:23.569> a<00:06:23.899> hundred<00:06:24.770> billion<00:06:25.009> cells<00:06:25.459> so

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:26.149 
it has a hundred billion cells so

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:28.420 
it has a hundred billion cells so
basically<00:06:26.419> we<00:06:26.539> take<00:06:26.779> this<00:06:26.959> which<00:06:27.439> is<00:06:27.620> 125

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
basically we take this which is 125

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.429 
basically we take this which is 125
mills<00:06:28.729> which<00:06:29.449> isn't<00:06:29.779> like<00:06:29.930> this<00:06:30.080> pack<00:06:30.289> this

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:30.439 
mills which isn't like this pack this

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:31.959 
mills which isn't like this pack this
Packard<00:06:30.680> started<00:06:31.129> fermenting<00:06:31.610> in<00:06:31.699> here<00:06:31.849> the

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:31.969 
Packard started fermenting in here the

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:34.269 
Packard started fermenting in here the
yeast<00:06:32.149> has<00:06:32.270> been<00:06:32.509> given<00:06:32.809> nutrients<00:06:33.709> and<00:06:33.949> it

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
yeast has been given nutrients and it

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.209 
yeast has been given nutrients and it
started<00:06:34.610> doing<00:06:34.789> its<00:06:34.909> job<00:06:35.029> it's<00:06:35.240> making<00:06:35.569> beer

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
started doing its job it's making beer

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.249 
started doing its job it's making beer
this<00:06:37.219> is<00:06:37.399> then<00:06:37.580> tipped<00:06:38.059> into

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
this is then tipped into

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:43.580 
this is then tipped into
20<00:06:40.259> liters<00:06:41.870> and<00:06:42.870> then<00:06:43.020> that<00:06:43.169> starts<00:06:43.470> for

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
20 liters and then that starts for

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.140 
20 liters and then that starts for
meeting<00:06:43.889> that<00:06:43.979> takes<00:06:44.130> about<00:06:44.400> two<00:06:44.850> or<00:06:44.970> three

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
meeting that takes about two or three

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.740 
meeting that takes about two or three
days<00:06:45.320> in<00:06:46.320> this<00:06:46.560> is<00:06:47.460> added<00:06:47.910> to<00:06:48.060> this<00:06:48.330> vessel

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
days in this is added to this vessel

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.249 
days in this is added to this vessel
here<00:06:48.930> this<00:06:49.110> is<00:06:49.229> about<00:06:49.970> 500<00:06:50.970> liters<00:06:51.300> that

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 
here this is about 500 liters that

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:54.370 
here this is about 500 liters that
starts<00:06:52.650> many<00:06:52.889> this<00:06:53.070> is<00:06:53.160> we<00:06:53.430> call<00:06:53.610> a<00:06:53.639> propagator

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
starts many this is we call a propagator

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.020 
starts many this is we call a propagator
from<00:06:55.380> there<00:06:55.620> the<00:06:56.009> yeast<00:06:56.250> is<00:06:56.460> growing<00:06:56.729> its

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
from there the yeast is growing its

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.420 
from there the yeast is growing its
growing<00:06:57.090> us<00:06:57.479> I<00:06:57.919> don't<00:06:58.919> even<00:06:58.979> know<00:06:59.190> what<00:06:59.340> the

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
growing us I don't even know what the

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.270 
growing us I don't even know what the
number<00:06:59.699> is<00:06:59.729> once<00:07:00.060> you<00:07:00.180> get<00:07:00.300> past<00:07:00.330> 100<00:07:00.960> billion

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
number is once you get past 100 billion

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.710 
number is once you get past 100 billion
but<00:07:02.280> this<00:07:02.699> has<00:07:02.880> been<00:07:03.000> added<00:07:03.210> to<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:03.419> beer

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
but this has been added to the beer

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.620 
but this has been added to the beer
after<00:07:04.050> it's<00:07:04.169> called<00:07:04.440> and<00:07:04.740> line<00:07:05.729> so<00:07:06.060> that<00:07:06.090> the

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
after it's called and line so that the

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.540 
after it's called and line so that the
yeast<00:07:07.110> is<00:07:07.350> being<00:07:07.560> mixed<00:07:07.740> with<00:07:07.979> the<00:07:08.039> beer<00:07:08.250> as<00:07:08.430> it

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
yeast is being mixed with the beer as it

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.060 
yeast is being mixed with the beer as it
goes<00:07:08.729> into<00:07:08.940> the<00:07:09.060> fermenters<00:07:09.770> so<00:07:10.770> once<00:07:10.919> you've

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.070 
goes into the fermenters so once you've

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.150 
goes into the fermenters so once you've
added<00:07:11.160> the<00:07:11.340> yeast<00:07:11.610> it'll<00:07:12.270> ferment<00:07:12.500> take<00:07:13.500> five

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 
added the yeast it'll ferment take five

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.129 
added the yeast it'll ferment take five
to<00:07:14.190> ten<00:07:14.520> days<00:07:14.550> to<00:07:14.970> do<00:07:15.090> its<00:07:15.210> thing<00:07:15.270> and<00:07:15.690> then

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 
to ten days to do its thing and then

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:17.689 
to ten days to do its thing and then
it'll<00:07:16.320> sit<00:07:16.530> there<00:07:16.710> for<00:07:16.949> two<00:07:17.099> four<00:07:17.430> to<00:07:17.520> five

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 
it'll sit there for two four to five

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:20.480
