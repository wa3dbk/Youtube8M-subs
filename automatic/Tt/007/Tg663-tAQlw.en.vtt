00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.639 
easy to focus on the negative things
especially<00:01:51.630> when<00:01:52.020> they<00:01:52.110> escalate<00:01:52.500> out<00:01:52.619> of

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
especially when they escalate out of

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.440 
especially when they escalate out of
proportion<00:01:53.280> about<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.880> years

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
proportion about it years

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:27.140 
proportion about it years

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
because from what I've heard this can

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.860 
because from what I've heard this can
actually<00:03:41.709> have<00:03:42.100> a<00:03:42.130> massive<00:03:42.459> impact<00:03:42.760> on<00:03:43.269> how

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
some people feel and I'm a little bit

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.699 
some people feel and I'm a little bit
curious<00:03:46.510> about<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:47.019> because<00:03:47.320> when<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.560> comes

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
curious about it because when it comes

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.039 
curious about it because when it comes
to<00:03:48.030> psychological<00:03:49.030> effects<00:03:49.359> like<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.630> for
