00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
of 12 volts at 2 X at UC and also you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.650 
of 12 volts at 2 X at UC and also you
have<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.160> remote<00:00:32.520> control<00:00:32.579> here<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.420> quite

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
have the remote control here it's quite

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.190 
have the remote control here it's quite
of<00:00:33.989> nicely<00:00:34.410> designed<00:00:34.920> remote<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.840> also<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> set

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
of nicely designed remote and also a set

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.910 
of nicely designed remote and also a set
to<00:00:37.290> travel<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.680> batteries<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:39.600> M<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.680> look<00:00:40.829> at

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
to travel a batteries so M so we look at

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.470 
to travel a batteries so M so we look at
the<00:00:40.980> box<00:00:41.160> itself<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:41.790> let's<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.120> took<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the box itself here let's just took the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.090 
the box itself here let's just took the
key<00:00:42.629> features<00:00:43.020> here<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.620> first<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
key features here so the first thing to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
key features here so the first thing to
know<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.910> compact<00:00:45.360> boxes<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.110> if

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
know here is have compact boxes and if

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.799 
know here is have compact boxes and if
we<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.190> rotate<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> box<00:00:48.090> around<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.600> style

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
we just rotate the box around in style

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
we just rotate the box around in style
here<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
here we just know here that we have a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.330 
here we just know here that we have a
USB<00:00:51.420> port<00:00:51.600> here<00:00:51.960> which<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.739> use<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
USB port here which you can use for the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670 
USB port here which you can use for the
media<00:00:53.820> player<00:00:54.030> functionality<00:00:54.840> PVR<00:00:55.469> any

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
functionality and also of course your

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.299 
functionality and also of course your
programming<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> box<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.680> continue<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
programming the box and I continue the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.430 
programming the box and I continue the
rotation<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.390> Box<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:00.960> point<00:01:01.230> here

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
rotation of the Box to this point here

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.619 
rotation of the Box to this point here
and<00:01:01.649> I'll<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.160> point<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:03.090> has<00:01:03.359> an

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and I'll just point out that it has an

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.890 
and I'll just point out that it has an
input<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.820> satellites<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:06.030> sports<00:01:06.360> s2

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
input here and satellites are sports s2

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.609 
input here and satellites are sports s2
and<00:01:07.400> in<00:01:08.400> terms<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.240> threshing<00:01:09.720> import<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and in terms of threshing import it's a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.609 
and in terms of threshing import it's a
TT<00:01:11.159> 2<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.180> support<00:01:12.570> both<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.439> own

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
TT 2 so it support both it's very own

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.140 
TT 2 so it support both it's very own
also<00:01:14.010> high-definition<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.939> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
also high-definition for you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.870 
also high-definition for you
transmissions<00:01:16.140> from<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> UK<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
transmissions from the UK we have a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.510 
transmissions from the UK we have a
digital<00:01:18.540> optical<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.369> an

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
digital optical out here we have an

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.760 
digital optical out here we have an
output<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.060> HDMI<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.350> also<00:01:22.500> have<00:01:22.650> an

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
output here is HDMI we also have an

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.230 
output here is HDMI we also have an
Ethernet<00:01:23.130> port<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.119> it's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
Ethernet port on it here so it's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.690 
Ethernet port on it here so it's
possible<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.630> set<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.549> connect<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
possible to set it up and connect to it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.539 
possible to set it up and connect to it
an<00:01:27.119> Internet<00:01:27.720> I'm<00:01:27.900> also<00:01:28.619> naming<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.130> report

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
an Internet I'm also naming the report

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.810 
an Internet I'm also naming the report
here<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> rs-232<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.250> AV<00:01:32.610> out

here like for the rs-232 and the AV out

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.140 
here like for the rs-232 and the AV out
and<00:01:33.240> also<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.049> IR<00:01:34.380> sensor<00:01:34.939> now<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.060> we

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and also for the IR sensor now if we

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.800 
and also for the IR sensor now if we
take<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.689> box<00:01:36.720> over<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.210> come<00:01:39.210> along<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
take the box over here and come along to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.990 
take the box over here and come along to
think<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.140> we'll<00:01:40.290> note<00:01:40.470> here<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
think that we'll note here is that and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.600 
think that we'll note here is that and
the<00:01:42.150> first<00:01:42.360> thing<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.110> there's<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.610> sticky

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the first thing is that there's a sticky

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.249 
the first thing is that there's a sticky
pads<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.689> actually<00:01:45.810> come<00:01:46.020> along

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
pads here so you can actually come along

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
pads here so you can actually come along
