00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
and it took us a while to get back in

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.610 
and it took us a while to get back in
the<00:00:12.090> game<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.509> get<00:00:12.750> some<00:00:12.929> clarity<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.500> what

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
the game and get some clarity and what

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.799 
the game and get some clarity and what
we<00:00:13.740> were<00:00:13.799> doing<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:15.030> even<00:00:15.299> then<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.690> know

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
we were doing and but even then you know

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.390 
we were doing and but even then you know
we<00:00:16.080> gave<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.410> tie<00:00:16.590> way<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:16.949> after<00:00:17.220> halftime

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
we gave that tie way just after halftime

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.150 
we gave that tie way just after halftime
one<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.090> before<00:00:18.240> one<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.840> after<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:20.039> that

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
one just before one just after and that

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.710 
one just before one just after and that
made<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.400> difficult<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:21.000> his<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.449> thought

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
made it difficult for his but I thought

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.420 
made it difficult for his but I thought
the<00:00:21.779> resilience<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.619> character<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> team

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
the resilience and character in the team

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.970 
the resilience and character in the team
was<00:00:23.670> was<00:00:24.000> excellent<00:00:24.449> tonight<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.170> although

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
was was excellent tonight and although

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.710 
was was excellent tonight and although
we<00:00:26.010> clearly<00:00:26.820> enough<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.269> play<00:00:27.420> better<00:00:27.689> than

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
we clearly enough to play better than

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.640 
we clearly enough to play better than
that<00:00:28.460> I'll<00:00:29.460> always<00:00:30.269> had<00:00:30.960> aspired<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
that I'll always had aspired with the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.220 
that I'll always had aspired with the
star<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.250> thought<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.579> were<00:00:32.669> being<00:00:32.960> we<00:00:33.960> were

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
star and I thought we were being we were

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.750 
star and I thought we were being we were
lacking<00:00:34.469> intelligence<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.430> way<00:00:35.610> that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
lacking intelligence in the way that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.010 
lacking intelligence in the way that
we're<00:00:35.940> playing<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.360> thought<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.660> obviously

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
we're playing I thought that obviously

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.280 
we're playing I thought that obviously
the<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.649> stat<00:00:37.890> rattle<00:00:38.250> does<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.360> there

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the the stat rattle does but then there

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.850 
the the stat rattle does but then there
wasn't<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.770> real<00:00:41.040> semblance<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.239> we

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
wasn't a real semblance of what we

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.779 
wasn't a real semblance of what we
talked<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.190> way<00:00:44.280> we've<00:00:44.430> talked<00:00:44.640> about

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
talked to it the way we've talked about

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.119 
talked to it the way we've talked about
playing<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.800> just<00:00:46.800> thought<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.039> got

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
playing and I just thought we got

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.580 
playing and I just thought we got
rattled<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.670> much<00:00:47.850> by<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.239> 12<00:00:48.780> nil<00:00:49.020> sckarline

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
rattled so much by that 12 nil sckarline

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.380 
rattled so much by that 12 nil sckarline
that<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.160> were<00:00:50.280> feeding<00:00:50.520> off<00:00:50.760> scraps<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.210> get

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that we were feeding off scraps to get

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.790 
that we were feeding off scraps to get
back<00:00:51.539> into<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.899> game<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.469> did<00:00:52.620> really

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
back into the game which we did really

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.010 
back into the game which we did really
well<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.250> that's<00:00:53.370> yaad<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> character<00:00:54.239> but

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
well and that's yaad the character but

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.260 
well and that's yaad the character but
yeah<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:55.590> disappointed<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.640> with

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
yeah I was really disappointed with with

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.049 
yeah I was really disappointed with with
our<00:00:57.710> intelligence<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> relay<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.670> him<00:00:59.940> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
our intelligence as a relay to him I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.439 
our intelligence as a relay to him I
think<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.660> bitter<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:02.910> go<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.149> sit<00:01:03.300> down

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
think that bitter and to go and sit down

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.539 
think that bitter and to go and sit down
for<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.719> while<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.229> calm<00:01:04.439> down<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
for a while just to calm down and and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.300 
for a while just to calm down and and
try<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.119> give<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> message<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.130> that<00:01:08.130> could

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
try and give a message that that could

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
try and give a message that that could
help<00:01:08.400> us<00:01:08.580> win<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> game<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.479> thought<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
help us win the game and I thought the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.390 
help us win the game and I thought the
players<00:01:10.409> were<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.860> thought<00:01:11.100> we<00:01:11.250> were<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
players were I thought we were the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.890 
players were I thought we were the
dominant<00:01:11.580> team<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.240> most<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> second

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
dominant team for most of the second

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.679 
dominant team for most of the second
half<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.549> there<00:01:14.549> was<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> much<00:01:14.909> better<00:01:15.240> effort

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
half and there was a much better effort

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.810 
half and there was a much better effort
although<00:01:15.900> still<00:01:16.530> some<00:01:16.830> things<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.549> say

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
yeah defensive structure we worked all

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.249 
yeah defensive structure we worked all
over<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.220> place<00:01:23.450> yeah<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.600> were<00:01:24.689> defending<00:01:24.840> us

plays<00:01:46.439> when<00:01:46.680> they<00:01:46.829> got<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.399> good<00:01:47.610> field

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
plays when they got in in good field

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.760 
plays when they got in in good field
position<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:49.079> we<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.320> give<00:01:49.470> them<00:01:49.560> too<00:01:49.740> much

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
position and we just give them too much

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.260 
position and we just give them too much
we're<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.340> give<00:01:50.549> him<00:01:50.640> too<00:01:50.790> much<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.030> then

we're just give him too much and then

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270 
we're just give him too much and then
defended<00:01:51.689> poorly<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.259> yeah<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.890> thought<00:01:53.070> Benny

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
defended poorly but yeah I thought Benny

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.889 
defended poorly but yeah I thought Benny
Roberts<00:01:53.640> was<00:01:53.759> really<00:01:54.090> good<00:01:54.240> at<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.750> back

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
Roberts was really good at the back

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.289 
Roberts was really good at the back
tonight<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.189> obviously<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.700> key

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
tonight and that was obviously a key

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.370 
tonight and that was obviously a key
moment<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.960> early<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.469> oh<00:01:59.270> yeah<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:01.049> until

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
moment and early on oh yeah it's until

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.679 
moment and early on oh yeah it's until
full<00:02:01.560> Anika<00:02:01.890> sit<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.280> Justin<00:02:03.210> goes<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
full Anika sit and Justin goes for the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.050 
full Anika sit and Justin goes for the
ball<00:02:03.869> he's<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.829> bit<00:02:05.070> too<00:02:05.520> far<00:02:05.759> away<00:02:05.909> from

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
ball he's a little bit too far away from

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.880 
ball he's a little bit too far away from
it<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.390> don't<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:06.719> he<00:02:06.930> has<00:02:07.079> any<00:02:07.290> impact<00:02:07.500> on

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
it I don't think he has any impact on

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.979 
it I don't think he has any impact on
what<00:02:08.099> happens<00:02:08.129> after<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.479> fair<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:09.899> I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
what happens after that to be fair but I

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.090 
what happens after that to be fair but I
can<00:02:10.140> see<00:02:10.319> why<00:02:10.560> where<00:02:11.039> he<00:02:11.129> gave<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.459> penalty

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
can see why where he gave the penalty

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.680 
can see why where he gave the penalty
and<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.700> one<00:02:12.820> thing<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:13.060> will<00:02:13.120> say<00:02:13.270> is<00:02:13.480> I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
and the one thing I will say is I

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.930 
and the one thing I will say is I
thought<00:02:13.900> his<00:02:14.050> leadership<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.940> performance

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
thought his leadership and performance

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.080 
thought his leadership and performance
tonight<00:02:16.210> was<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.660> was<00:02:17.020> standing<00:02:17.410> alongside

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
tonight was I was standing alongside

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.460 
tonight was I was standing alongside
Justin<00:02:19.090> Kearney<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.540> thought<00:02:19.900> that's<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.230> best

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
Justin Kearney I thought that's the best

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.870 
Justin Kearney I thought that's the best
I've<00:02:20.650> seen<00:02:20.680> him<00:02:20.920> play<00:02:21.100> for<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> very<00:02:21.640> long<00:02:21.820> time

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
I've seen him play for a very long time

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.200 
I've seen him play for a very long time
thought<00:02:22.330> he<00:02:22.480> was<00:02:22.630> sensational<00:02:23.470> tonight<00:02:24.210> and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
thought he was sensational tonight and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.940 
thought he was sensational tonight and
it<00:02:25.330> wasn't<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:25.780> was<00:02:25.960> just<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.350> little<00:02:26.620> bits<00:02:26.800> of

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
it wasn't it was just the little bits of

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.160 
it wasn't it was just the little bits of
things<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.430> he<00:02:27.880> did<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.300> get<00:02:28.450> us<00:02:28.600> back<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:29.050> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
things that he did to get us back in the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.520 
things that he did to get us back in the
game<00:02:29.200> winning<00:02:29.620> penalties<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:31.260> that<00:02:32.260> chase

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
game winning penalties and that chase

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.400 
game winning penalties and that chase
fart<00:02:33.040> like<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.790> try<00:02:34.060> in<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.690> first<00:02:34.720> half<00:02:35.200> you

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
fart like that try in the first half you

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.630 
fart like that try in the first half you
know<00:02:35.470> some<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.890> things<00:02:36.130> like<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.460> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
know some of the things like that the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.790 
know some of the things like that the
game<00:02:36.910> turning<00:02:37.720> moments<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.350> I<00:02:38.410> thought<00:02:38.620> I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
game turning moments and I thought I

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.340 
game turning moments and I thought I
left<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.340> those<00:02:40.180> two<00:02:40.450> players<00:02:40.720> would<00:02:41.050> was

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
left and those two players would was

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.440 
left and those two players would was
superb<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.550> thought<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.880> most<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.300> our

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
superb and I thought that most of our

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.360 
superb and I thought that most of our
players<00:02:43.660> are<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:44.170> good<00:02:44.350> moments<00:02:44.860> what

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
players are really good moments what

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.130 
players are really good moments what
those<00:02:45.550> two<00:02:45.790> will<00:02:45.970> consistently<00:02:46.570> right<00:02:46.870> at<00:02:46.990> top

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
those two will consistently right at top

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.180 
those two will consistently right at top
of<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.350> game<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:47.980> was<00:02:48.040> right<00:02:49.170> yeah

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
of the game so I was right yeah

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.650 
of the game so I was right yeah
sometimes<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.340> started<00:02:51.760> passing<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.210> ball<00:02:52.420> in

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
sometimes I started passing the ball in

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.350 
sometimes I started passing the ball in
the<00:02:53.260> in<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.650> second<00:02:54.070> half<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.180> didn't

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
the in the second half and and I didn't

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.520 
the in the second half and and I didn't
think<00:02:55.420> he<00:02:55.540> needed<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.900> be<00:02:55.930> doing<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.350> at<00:02:56.500> that

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
think he needed to be doing that at that

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.490 
think he needed to be doing that at that
particular<00:02:56.770> point<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.900> him<00:02:58.900> carrying<00:02:59.350> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
particular point and him carrying the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.350 
particular point and him carrying the
bar<00:02:59.710> was<00:02:59.980> was<00:03:00.640> all<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.940> threat<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.210> we

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
bar was was all the threat that we

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.870 
bar was was all the threat that we
needed<00:03:02.130> but<00:03:03.130> yeah<00:03:03.280> he's<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.460> little<00:03:03.550> bit<00:03:03.760> like

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880
