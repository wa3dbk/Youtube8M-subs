kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.759> dislike<00:01:17.970> venus<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:19.009> she<00:01:20.009> has

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
kind of dislike venus is because she has

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.929 
kind of dislike venus is because she has
to<00:01:21.560> you<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.070> her<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.280> terrence<00:01:23.640> back

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to you have to get her in terrence back

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.200 
to you have to get her in terrence back
and<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.950> problem<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.430> her<00:01:26.580> though<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.180> that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
and the problem with her though is that

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.990 
and the problem with her though is that
if<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.720> use<00:01:28.080> her<00:01:28.350> effect<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.610> other<00:01:29.790> one

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
if you use her effect one the other one

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.760 
if you use her effect one the other one
becomes<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.360> useless<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.780> three<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.110> fine<00:01:31.320> foggy

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
becomes a useless so three is fine foggy

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.190 
becomes a useless so three is fine foggy
that's<00:01:32.040> why<00:01:32.130> i<00:01:32.159> only<00:01:32.280> played<00:01:32.549> two<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.930> along

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that's why i only played two and along

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
that's why i only played two and along
with<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.500> play<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:34.890> least<00:01:35.490> favorite

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.920 
fixed but this is my current feel for it
it<00:07:13.560> worked<00:07:13.830> really<00:07:14.160> well<00:07:14.310> and<00:07:14.820> I'm<00:07:15.570> gonna<00:07:15.690> add

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
it worked really well and I'm gonna add

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.930 
it worked really well and I'm gonna add
a<00:07:15.960> little<00:07:16.080> discussion<00:07:16.470> right<00:07:16.890> now<00:07:16.950> whether<00:07:17.790> I

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
a little discussion right now whether I

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.610 
a little discussion right now whether I
what<00:07:18.450> I<00:07:18.480> think<00:07:18.810> of<00:07:18.900> this<00:07:18.990> car<00:07:19.200> whether<00:07:19.410> it's

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
what I think of this car whether it's

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.820 
what I think of this car whether it's
underpowered<00:07:20.060> overpowered<00:07:21.060> or<00:07:21.390> vows<00:07:22.110> and<00:07:22.500> a

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
underpowered overpowered or vows and a

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.430 
underpowered overpowered or vows and a
my<00:07:23.010> palate<00:07:23.400> in<00:07:23.550> my<00:07:23.850> opinion<00:07:24.330> it's<00:07:24.540> balanced

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 
my palate in my opinion it's balanced

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.020 
my palate in my opinion it's balanced
people<00:07:26.160> have<00:07:26.250> been<00:07:26.340> arguing<00:07:26.520> this<00:07:26.880> guy's

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.030 
people have been arguing this guy's

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.240 
people have been arguing this guy's
really<00:07:27.300> ope<00:07:27.810> but<00:07:28.470> the<00:07:28.770> thing<00:07:28.920> about<00:07:28.980> this<00:07:29.190> car

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.250 
really ope but the thing about this car

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.880 
really ope but the thing about this car
is<00:07:29.370> its<00:07:29.700> level<00:07:30.000> 5<00:07:30.390> so<00:07:30.840> if<00:07:30.990> you<00:07:31.050> don't<00:07:31.350> have<00:07:31.560> a

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:31.890 
is its level 5 so if you don't have a

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.230 
is its level 5 so if you don't have a
char<00:07:32.310> on<00:07:32.340> the<00:07:32.460> field<00:07:32.640> either<00:07:32.850> here<00:07:33.060> and<00:07:33.150> had

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 
char on the field either here and had

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.460 
char on the field either here and had
the<00:07:33.270> tribute<00:07:33.570> it<00:07:33.960> and<00:07:34.140> that's<00:07:34.260> really

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:34.470 
the tribute it and that's really

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.340 
the tribute it and that's really
problematic<00:07:35.000> and<00:07:36.000> I've<00:07:36.390> actually<00:07:36.720> I<00:07:37.110> was

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.350 
problematic and I've actually I was

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.980 
problematic and I've actually I was
testing<00:07:37.770> this<00:07:37.860> guy<00:07:38.070> with<00:07:38.460> my<00:07:38.610> sister<00:07:39.000> and<00:07:39.300> I

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:39.990 
testing this guy with my sister and I

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.500 
testing this guy with my sister and I
drew<00:07:40.470> into<00:07:40.740> three<00:07:41.130> of<00:07:41.160> these<00:07:41.460> and<00:07:41.820> I<00:07:41.880> had<00:07:42.090> no

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:42.510 
drew into three of these and I had no

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.180 
drew into three of these and I had no
sanctuary<00:07:42.960> these<00:07:43.350> guys<00:07:43.530> were<00:07:43.680> dead<00:07:43.980> in<00:07:44.100> my

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.190 
sanctuary these guys were dead in my

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.950 
sanctuary these guys were dead in my
hand<00:07:44.430> to<00:07:44.550> hold<00:07:44.700> her<00:07:44.880> dual<00:07:45.090> it<00:07:45.270> was<00:07:45.360> terrible

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 
hand to hold her dual it was terrible

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.110 
hand to hold her dual it was terrible
you<00:07:46.200> may<00:07:46.770> just<00:07:46.950> say<00:07:47.070> my<00:07:47.250> decks<00:07:47.460> inconsistent

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 
you may just say my decks inconsistent

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.690 
you may just say my decks inconsistent
and<00:07:48.270> all<00:07:49.260> decks<00:07:49.680> have<00:07:49.920> these<00:07:50.160> kind<00:07:50.460> of<00:07:50.490> times

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.700 
and all decks have these kind of times

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.880 
and all decks have these kind of times
but<00:07:51.030> that's<00:07:51.690> a<00:07:51.810> problem<00:07:52.020> entropy<00:07:52.620> if<00:07:52.800> you

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:52.890 
but that's a problem entropy if you

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.800 
but that's a problem entropy if you
don't<00:07:53.190> draw<00:07:53.370> in<00:07:53.430> just<00:07:53.610> century<00:07:53.940> or<00:07:54.450> your<00:07:54.660> house

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:54.810 
don't draw in just century or your house

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.740 
don't draw in just century or your house
radius<00:07:55.260> you're<00:07:55.470> doomed<00:07:55.830> cousin<00:07:56.400> Oh<00:07:56.610> dad<00:07:57.600> if

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:57.750 
radius you're doomed cousin Oh dad if

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.480 
radius you're doomed cousin Oh dad if
you<00:07:57.870> had<00:07:57.960> nothing<00:07:58.320> there<00:07:58.500> but<00:07:59.100> in<00:07:59.280> my<00:07:59.400> opinion

00:07:59.480 --> 00:07:59.490 
you had nothing there but in my opinion

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.470 
you had nothing there but in my opinion
it's<00:07:59.970> pretty<00:08:00.210> good<00:08:00.360> and<00:08:01.310> balanced<00:08:02.310> so<00:08:02.550> I<00:08:03.180> hope

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:03.480 
it's pretty good and balanced so I hope

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.270 
it's pretty good and balanced so I hope
you<00:08:03.570> guys<00:08:03.690> enjoy<00:08:03.990> this<00:08:04.170> dragon<00:08:04.440> coma<00:08:04.680> signing
