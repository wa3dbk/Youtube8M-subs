00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
first put the cauliflower on its side

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.109

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.010 

place<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.619> down<00:01:28.770> again<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.490> cut<00:01:30.479> those<00:01:30.689> halves

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.249 
place it down again and cut those halves
in<00:01:31.439> half<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.280> you're<00:01:32.430> quartering<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.240> okay<00:01:33.990> now

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
in half so you're quartering it okay now

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.640 
in half so you're quartering it okay now
you<00:01:35.040> can<00:01:35.070> see<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.939> stem<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.470> want

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you can see the stem and you just want

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.230 
you can see the stem and you just want
to<00:01:37.710> cut<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.040> off<00:01:40.220> now<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.700> should<00:01:42.030> break

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to cut that off now it should break

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.480 
to cut that off now it should break
apart<00:01:42.630> easily<00:01:45.200> for<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.320> recipe<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.890> want<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
apart easily for this recipe we want the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.539 
apart easily for this recipe we want the
pieces<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.149> rather<00:01:48.659> small<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.340> have

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
pieces to be rather small so if you have

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.600 
pieces to be rather small so if you have
a<00:01:50.729> big<00:01:51.079> floret<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:53.490> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
a big floret that's like this then you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.410 
a big floret that's like this then you
just<00:01:53.820> want<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.030> cut<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.479> down<00:01:59.210> until<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.360> a

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
just want to cut that down until it's a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.600 
just want to cut that down until it's a
small<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:02.040> continue<00:02:02.579> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
small one like this so just continue to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.719 
small one like this so just continue to
do<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.090> with<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.020> rest<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> head<00:02:04.740> take

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
do that with the rest of the head take

discard the Sam and then break your

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.680 
discard the Sam and then break your
florets<00:02:14.800> apart<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.460> if<00:02:15.730> there<00:02:15.970> are<00:02:16.150> some<00:02:16.510> that

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690
