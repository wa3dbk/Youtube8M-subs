staying secure as you should probably

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.470 
staying secure as you should probably
just<00:00:22.350> go<00:00:22.560> an<00:00:22.710> update<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.550> newer<00:00:23.910> version<00:00:24.150> of

just go an update to a newer version of

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
on my Windows Embedded POS ready video

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.360 
on my Windows Embedded POS ready video
and<00:00:47.399> he<00:00:48.120> basically<00:00:48.420> says<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.950> he<00:00:49.950> found<00:00:50.219> this

site<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.140> there's<00:00:52.140> another<00:00:52.440> way<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:53.699> this

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
site and there's another way to do this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.610 
site and there's another way to do this
and<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.390> might<00:00:54.629> actually<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.960> better<00:00:55.260> for

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and this might actually be better for

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.560

you<00:02:02.820> cannot<00:02:03.380> install<00:02:04.380> them<00:02:04.590> because

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
you cannot install them because

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.560 
you cannot install them because
obviously<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.460> don't<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.790> any<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.180> install

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
obviously we don't have any to install

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.650 
obviously we don't have any to install
so<00:02:07.259> basically<00:02:07.740> Windows<00:02:08.340> XP<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.090> not<00:02:09.360> going<00:02:09.599> to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
so basically Windows XP is not going to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.400 
so basically Windows XP is not going to
get<00:02:09.780> any<00:02:09.929> more

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.380 
through your computer and as you can see
here<00:03:36.930> now<00:03:36.959> we<00:03:37.170> have<00:03:37.640> four<00:03:38.640> high-priority

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
here now we have four high-priority

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.830 
here now we have four high-priority
updates<00:03:40.050> now<00:03:40.980> none<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.700> them<00:03:41.820> is<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:42.000> Windows<00:03:42.420> XP

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
updates now none of them is a Windows XP

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.070 
updates now none of them is a Windows XP
but<00:03:43.020> we<00:03:43.170> do<00:03:43.290> have<00:03:43.470> some<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:43.830> here<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.280> a

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
but we do have some in here like a

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.360 
but we do have some in here like a
security<00:03:46.080> update<00:03:46.350> for<00:03:46.739> Windows<00:03:46.860> Internet

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
security update for Windows Internet

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.729 
security update for Windows Internet
Explorer<00:03:47.730> 8<00:03:47.940> for<00:03:48.930> W<00:03:49.530> POS<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.280> POS<00:03:50.640> for<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.850> 2009

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
Explorer 8 for W POS and POS for a 2009

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.140 
Explorer 8 for W POS and POS for a 2009
so<00:03:52.739> something<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.070> Windows<00:03:53.430> XP<00:03:53.550> wouldn't

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
so something that Windows XP wouldn't

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.350 
so something that Windows XP wouldn't
get<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:55.730> security<00:03:56.730> update<00:03:57.000> for

comment he says that you should not use
automatic<00:04:04.950> updates<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.700> you<00:04:05.790> must<00:04:05.940> manually

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
automatic updates and you must manually

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.910 
automatic updates and you must manually
install<00:04:06.840> them<00:04:07.020> because<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.260> couple<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.770> these

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
install them because a couple of these

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.560 
install them because a couple of these
were<00:04:08.160> not<00:04:08.280> made<00:04:08.700> for<00:04:08.970> Windows<00:04:09.300> XP<00:04:10.130> and<00:04:11.360> he<00:04:12.360> says

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
were not made for Windows XP and he says

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.330 
were not made for Windows XP and he says
that<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.810> might<00:04:13.050> be<00:04:13.230> able<00:04:13.320> to<00:04:13.860> download<00:04:14.010> them

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
that you might be able to download them

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.550 
that you might be able to download them
but<00:04:14.520> I'm<00:04:14.670> mean<00:04:15.390> I<00:04:15.570> wouldn't<00:04:16.020> really<00:04:16.140> take<00:04:16.380> that

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
but I'm mean I wouldn't really take that

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.060 
but I'm mean I wouldn't really take that
risk<00:04:16.890> so<00:04:17.190> updates<00:04:18.150> like<00:04:18.330> these<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.750> say<00:04:19.070> like

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
risk so updates like these that say like

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.159 
risk so updates like these that say like
security<00:04:20.729> updates<00:04:21.120> I<00:04:21.270> mean<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.690> guess<00:04:21.989> you

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
security updates I mean I guess you

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.650 
security updates I mean I guess you
could<00:04:22.350> try<00:04:22.500> download<00:04:22.979> them<00:04:23.130> but<00:04:23.280> I'm

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
could try download them but I'm

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.440 
could try download them but I'm
really<00:04:23.840> sure<00:04:24.080> if<00:04:24.290> it<00:04:24.640> would<00:04:25.640> work<00:04:25.700> with

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
really sure if it would work with

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.150 
really sure if it would work with
Windows<00:04:26.870> XP<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.590> might<00:04:27.740> just<00:04:27.860> want<00:04:28.100> to

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
Windows XP so you might just want to

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.020 
Windows XP so you might just want to
uncheck<00:04:28.610> this<00:04:29.060> as<00:04:29.300> well<00:04:29.950> but<00:04:30.950> you<00:04:31.400> can<00:04:31.460> see<00:04:31.700> we

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
uncheck this as well but you can see we

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.480 
uncheck this as well but you can see we
can<00:04:32.150> get<00:04:32.270> these<00:04:32.480> updates<00:04:32.690> here<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:33.490> just

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
can get these updates here and just

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.720 
can get these updates here and just
click<00:04:34.640> on<00:04:34.730> install<00:04:34.910> updates<00:04:35.890> and<00:04:36.890> they<00:04:37.640> are

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
click on install updates and they are

click on install updates and they are
going<00:04:38.000> to<00:04:38.120> download<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.660> if<00:04:38.720> you<00:04:38.810> want<00:04:39.020> to

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
going to download and if you want to

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.490 
going to download and if you want to
disable<00:04:40.310> automatic<00:04:40.670> updating<00:04:41.330> because<00:04:42.110> you

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
disable automatic updating because you

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.350 
disable automatic updating because you
do<00:04:42.890> not<00:04:43.070> want<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.370> get<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.820> updates<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.330> are

mistaken and then automatic updates and

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.400 
mistaken and then automatic updates and
then<00:05:04.700> you<00:05:05.000> want<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.270> turn<00:05:05.510> off<00:05:05.810> automatic

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
then you want to turn off automatic

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.220 
then you want to turn off automatic
updates<00:05:06.770> apply<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.580> ok<00:05:07.940> and<00:05:08.180> it's<00:05:09.080> going<00:05:09.170> to

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
updates apply it ok and it's going to

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.020 
updates apply it ok and it's going to
say<00:05:09.410> that<00:05:09.680> your<00:05:10.040> computer<00:05:10.400> might<00:05:10.580> be<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.730> risk

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
say that your computer might be a risk

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.250 
say that your computer might be a risk
but<00:05:11.360> of<00:05:11.480> course<00:05:11.690> you're<00:05:11.870> going<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.080> ignore

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
but of course you're going to ignore

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.810 
but of course you're going to ignore
that<00:05:12.530> because<00:05:12.590> you<00:05:12.830> know<00:05:12.980> you're<00:05:13.490> still<00:05:13.670> going

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
that because you know you're still going

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.020 
that because you know you're still going
to<00:05:13.850> be<00:05:13.910> having<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.810> check<00:05:15.050> for<00:05:15.730> updates<00:05:16.730> but<00:05:16.910> as

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
to be having to check for updates but as

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.600 
to be having to check for updates but as
you<00:05:17.210> can<00:05:17.360> see<00:05:17.540> it<00:05:17.690> is<00:05:18.280> installing<00:05:19.280> these

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
you can see it is installing these

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.940 
you can see it is installing these
updates<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.450> once<00:05:21.020> it<00:05:21.170> does<00:05:21.350> I'm<00:05:21.650> going<00:05:21.830> to

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
updates and once it does I'm going to

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.580 
updates and once it does I'm going to
let<00:05:22.940> it<00:05:23.060> install<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.660> then<00:05:23.750> restart<00:05:24.380> the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
let it install and then restart the

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.930 
let it install and then restart the
computer<00:05:24.890> to<00:05:25.280> show<00:05:25.460> you<00:05:25.550> that<00:05:25.700> it<00:05:25.790> does

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
computer to show you that it does

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
actually work so we're just going to

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.640 
actually work so we're just going to
wait<00:05:28.730> for<00:05:28.910> that<00:05:28.970> here<00:05:29.290> alright<00:05:30.290> so<00:05:30.350> the

wait for that here alright so the

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.500 
wait for that here alright so the
installation<00:05:31.010> has<00:05:31.400> been<00:05:31.430> completed<00:05:32.150> so<00:05:32.420> we're

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
installation has been completed so we're

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.610
