brush<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.790> used<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.270> blush<00:01:36.810> it's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
brush and used it for blush it's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.830 
brush and used it for blush it's
definitely<00:01:37.680> larger<00:01:38.280> than<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.150> kind<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.570> brush

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
definitely larger than the kind of brush

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.260 
definitely larger than the kind of brush
I<00:01:40.110> might<00:01:40.409> typically<00:01:40.950> use<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.579> blush<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.210> I'll

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
I might typically use for blush and I'll

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.120 
I might typically use for blush and I'll
show<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:42.930> size<00:01:43.259> comparison<00:01:43.290> here's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
show you a little size comparison here's

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.569 
show you a little size comparison here's
an<00:01:44.250> angled<00:01:44.640> brush<00:01:44.850> my<00:01:45.840> Sigma<00:01:46.229> f10<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.460> can

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
an angled brush my Sigma f10 and you can

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.609 
an angled brush my Sigma f10 and you can
see<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> much<00:01:48.420> larger<00:01:48.960> brush<00:01:49.259> so

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
see this is a much larger brush so

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.710 
see this is a much larger brush so
you've<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.280> pretty<00:01:50.729> careful<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.390> it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
you've got to be pretty careful with it

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.030 
you've got to be pretty careful with it
I<00:01:51.869> think<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.170> you're<00:01:52.290> going<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> use<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> for

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
I think if you're going to use it for

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.010 
I think if you're going to use it for
blood<00:01:53.250> other<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.850> brushes<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.509> all<00:01:54.720> about

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
blood other for brushes are all about

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.389 
blood other for brushes are all about
the<00:01:55.200> eyes<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.770> you've<00:01:55.920> got<00:01:56.070> an<00:01:56.189> all-over

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the eyes so you've got an all-over

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.359 
the eyes so you've got an all-over
shadow<00:01:57.090> brush<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.200> little<00:01:58.469> more<00:01:58.680> full<00:01:59.070> at

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
shadow brush it's a little more full at

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.249 
shadow brush it's a little more full at
the<00:01:59.610> tip<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.210> opposed<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.750> being<00:02:00.990> really

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the tip as opposed to being really

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.160 
the tip as opposed to being really
tapered<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.340> sides<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.810> me<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:03.990> don't

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
tapered up the sides and for me I don't

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.770 
tapered up the sides and for me I don't
love<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.219> quality<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.479> feel

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
love that quality in it because I feel

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.230 
love that quality in it because I feel
like<00:02:06.979> we're

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
like we're

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.350 
like we're
you<00:02:08.450> are<00:02:08.750> getting<00:02:09.590> ends<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.310> bristles<00:02:11.000> that's

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
you are getting ends of bristles that's

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.270 
you are getting ends of bristles that's
where<00:02:11.540> you're<00:02:11.690> picking<00:02:12.050> up<00:02:12.170> product<00:02:12.770> I

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
where you're picking up product I

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.160 
where you're picking up product I
noticed<00:02:13.760> with<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.180> brush<00:02:14.390> from<00:02:14.510> Sigma<00:02:14.900> or<00:02:15.050> my

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
noticed with a brush from Sigma or my

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.710 
noticed with a brush from Sigma or my
Sonia<00:02:15.410> Kashuk<00:02:15.710> it's<00:02:16.430> tapered<00:02:17.000> pretty<00:02:17.360> far

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
Sonia Kashuk it's tapered pretty far

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.620 
Sonia Kashuk it's tapered pretty far
down<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.140> side<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:18.710> when<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:18.920> lay<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.580> down<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:20.240> a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
down the side so when I lay it down in a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.600 
down the side so when I lay it down in a
shadow<00:02:20.930> kind<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.410> flat<00:02:21.740> like<00:02:22.070> that<00:02:22.430> I'm

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
shadow kind of flat like that I'm

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.000 
shadow kind of flat like that I'm
picking<00:02:23.180> up<00:02:23.360> product<00:02:23.960> down<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.530> Sun<00:02:24.740> whole

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
picking up product down the Sun whole

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.860 
picking up product down the Sun whole
side<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.490> brush<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.060> then<00:02:26.210> applying<00:02:26.570> it

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
side of the brush and then applying it

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.530 
side of the brush and then applying it
here<00:02:27.080> because<00:02:27.770> your<00:02:28.400> tips<00:02:28.730> are<00:02:29.060> pretty<00:02:29.120> much

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
here because your tips are pretty much

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.560 
here because your tips are pretty much
just<00:02:29.960> at<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.470> end<00:02:30.680> you're<00:02:31.490> really<00:02:32.330> only

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
just at the end you're really only

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.870 
just at the end you're really only
picking<00:02:32.870> up<00:02:33.170> product<00:02:33.860> at<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.220> tail<00:02:34.520> think

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
picking up product at the tail think

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.340 
picking up product at the tail think
that<00:02:35.030> makes<00:02:35.300> for<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.570> most<00:02:35.810> efficient

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
that makes for the most efficient

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.780 
that makes for the most efficient
application<00:02:36.950> because<00:02:37.190> you're<00:02:37.310> really<00:02:37.490> trying

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
application because you're really trying

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.190 
application because you're really trying
to<00:02:37.850> get<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.120> off<00:02:38.210> the<00:02:38.240> end<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.690> bridge<00:02:38.960> next

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
to get it off the end of the bridge next

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.710 
to get it off the end of the bridge next
brush<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.710> labeled<00:02:40.130> contour<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.480> brush

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
brush is labeled contour and this brush

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.210 
brush is labeled contour and this brush
is<00:02:41.900> actually<00:02:42.260> grown<00:02:42.500> on<00:02:42.710> me<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.920> little<00:02:43.070> bit

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
is actually grown on me a little bit

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.310 
is actually grown on me a little bit
when<00:02:43.460> I<00:02:43.490> first<00:02:43.790> saw<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.330> thought<00:02:44.360> oh<00:02:44.810> no<00:02:44.840> it's

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
when I first saw it I thought oh no it's

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.800 
when I first saw it I thought oh no it's
another<00:02:45.530> one<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.830> those<00:02:46.270> brushes<00:02:47.270> cut

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
another one of those brushes cut

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.830 
another one of those brushes cut
diagonally<00:02:48.760> not<00:02:49.760> tapered<00:02:50.270> down<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.600> sides

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
diagonally not tapered down the sides

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.190 
diagonally not tapered down the sides
the<00:02:51.500> more<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:51.770> use<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:52.460> really<00:02:52.940> do<00:02:53.240> like<00:02:53.750> how

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
the more I use it I really do like how

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.260 
the more I use it I really do like how
this<00:02:54.440> wedges<00:02:55.070> right<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.490> my<00:02:55.640> crease<00:02:55.940> it's

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
this wedges right in my crease it's

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.330 
this wedges right in my crease it's
different<00:02:56.870> from<00:02:57.140> several<00:02:57.920> other<00:02:58.100> brushes

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
different from several other brushes

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.730 
different from several other brushes
that<00:02:58.640> I<00:02:58.700> have<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.330> style<00:02:59.660> because<00:03:00.500> it's

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
that I have in this style because it's

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.070 
that I have in this style because it's
smaller<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.550> it's<00:03:01.700> much<00:03:01.940> softer<00:03:02.660> the

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
smaller and it's much softer the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.010 
smaller and it's much softer the
bristles<00:03:03.530> really<00:03:03.950> do<00:03:04.190> move<00:03:04.700> around<00:03:05.210> a<00:03:05.540> lot<00:03:05.720> so

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
bristles really do move around a lot so

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.450 
bristles really do move around a lot so
I<00:03:06.170> think<00:03:06.350> you<00:03:06.620> can<00:03:06.800> get<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:06.980> little<00:03:07.190> more

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
I think you can get a little more

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.550 
I think you can get a little more
blending<00:03:08.060> action<00:03:08.540> with<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:08.840> rug<00:03:09.110> even<00:03:09.470> if

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
blending action with this rug even if

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.530 
blending action with this rug even if
you<00:03:09.650> have<00:03:09.800> smaller<00:03:10.250> eyes<00:03:10.610> this<00:03:11.240> can<00:03:11.420> do<00:03:11.510> a

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
you have smaller eyes this can do a

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.750 
you have smaller eyes this can do a
pretty<00:03:11.780> good<00:03:11.870> job<00:03:12.050> of<00:03:12.560> just<00:03:12.770> using<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.430> shape

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
pretty good job of just using that shape

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.090 
pretty good job of just using that shape
wedging<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:14.750> right<00:03:15.080> into<00:03:15.260> your<00:03:15.440> crease<00:03:15.770> going

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
wedging it right into your crease going

right where the bristles are coming out

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.590 
right where the bristles are coming out
and<00:03:48.680> then<00:03:49.130> it<00:03:49.220> comes<00:03:49.460> to<00:03:49.550> quite<00:03:49.880> a<00:03:49.910> point<00:03:50.330> and

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
and then it comes to quite a point and

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.320 
and then it comes to quite a point and
it<00:03:50.810> is<00:03:50.840> definitely<00:03:51.440> tapered<00:03:52.400> up<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:53.060> that

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
it is definitely tapered up to that

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.970 
it is definitely tapered up to that
point<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.990> use<00:03:54.170> this<00:03:54.350> with<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.560> little<00:03:54.830> bit<00:03:54.950> of

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
point I use this with a little bit of

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.160 
point I use this with a little bit of
powder<00:03:55.250> shadow<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.880> develop<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.570> bit<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:56.870> line

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
powder shadow to develop a bit of a line

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.710 
powder shadow to develop a bit of a line
on<00:03:57.530> my<00:03:57.740> lower<00:03:58.010> lash<00:03:58.430> lines<00:03:58.850> can<00:03:59.240> work<00:03:59.480> with<00:03:59.690> a

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
on my lower lash lines can work with a

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.720 
on my lower lash lines can work with a
cream<00:03:59.990> or<00:04:00.020> gel<00:04:00.380> liner<00:04:00.710> as<00:04:01.040> well<00:04:01.340> but<00:04:01.610> it

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
cream or gel liner as well but it

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.730 
cream or gel liner as well but it
doesn't<00:04:01.910> give<00:04:02.120> me<00:04:02.240> quite<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.660> fine<00:04:02.990> line<00:04:03.320> that

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
doesn't give me quite the fine line that

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.560 
doesn't give me quite the fine line that
I've<00:04:03.860> become<00:04:04.100> accustomed<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:04.940> with<00:04:05.209> like<00:04:05.330> my

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
I've become accustomed to with like my

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.660 
I've become accustomed to with like my
Real<00:04:05.780> Techniques<00:04:05.810> fine<00:04:06.500> liner<00:04:06.860> brush<00:04:07.010> overall

Real Techniques fine liner brush overall

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.190 
Real Techniques fine liner brush overall
thought<00:04:07.910> on<00:04:08.060> this<00:04:08.209> brush<00:04:08.510> set<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:08.990> that<00:04:09.140> I

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
thought on this brush set is that I

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.620 
thought on this brush set is that I
don't<00:04:09.320> like<00:04:09.830> each<00:04:10.160> individual<00:04:10.940> brush<00:04:11.240> well

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
don't like each individual brush well

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.310 
don't like each individual brush well
enough<00:04:12.050> to<00:04:12.650> put<00:04:13.510> $65<00:04:14.510> into<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:14.990> I<00:04:15.050> could<00:04:15.110> have

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
enough to put $65 into it I could have

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.740 
enough to put $65 into it I could have
thrown<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:15.890> maybe<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.370> separate<00:04:16.940> slightly

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
thrown in maybe a separate slightly

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.260 
thrown in maybe a separate slightly
smaller<00:04:18.140> brush<00:04:18.530> for<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.890> face<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:19.430> think<00:04:19.790> maybe

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
smaller brush for the face I think maybe

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.720 
smaller brush for the face I think maybe
it<00:04:20.450> could<00:04:20.570> be

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
it could be

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.310 
it could be
a little<00:04:20.940> more<00:04:21.090> worthwhile<00:04:21.630> as<00:04:21.870> far<00:04:22.050> as<00:04:22.170> the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
a little more worthwhile as far as the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.080 
a little more worthwhile as far as the
eye<00:04:22.350> brushes<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:23.340> mean<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.520> think<00:04:23.610> this<00:04:23.880> little

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
eye brushes I mean I think this little

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.060 
eye brushes I mean I think this little
crease<00:04:24.510> guy<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:24.840> pretty<00:04:25.380> handy

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
crease guy is pretty handy

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.800 
crease guy is pretty handy
I<00:04:26.100> like<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.670> blender<00:04:27.060> brush<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.570> are<00:04:27.690> they

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
I like the blender brush that are they

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.840 
I like the blender brush that are they
really<00:04:28.080> unique<00:04:28.470> enough<00:04:28.740> to<00:04:29.010> be<00:04:29.220> head<00:04:29.820> and

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
really unique enough to be head and

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.180 
really unique enough to be head and
shoulders<00:04:30.390> above<00:04:30.660> cheaper<00:04:31.530> brushes<00:04:31.980> that

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
shoulders above cheaper brushes that

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.160 
shoulders above cheaper brushes that
could<00:04:32.340> have<00:04:32.490> similar<00:04:32.880> functions<00:04:33.450> I<00:04:33.690> don't

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
could have similar functions I don't

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.990 
could have similar functions I don't
really<00:04:34.350> think<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.190> then<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.460> flat<00:04:35.700> brush

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
really think so and then the flat brush

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.850 
really think so and then the flat brush
and<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.330> liner<00:04:36.570> brush<00:04:36.900> were<00:04:37.110> not<00:04:37.380> really<00:04:37.710> my

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
and the liner brush were not really my

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.260 
and the liner brush were not really my
cup<00:04:38.070> of<00:04:38.100> tea<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:38.430> despite<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.910> fact<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.180> I

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
cup of tea so despite the fact that I

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.120 
cup of tea so despite the fact that I
think<00:04:39.510> these<00:04:39.630> brushes<00:04:39.900> are<00:04:40.200> really<00:04:40.230> well<00:04:40.830> made

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
think these brushes are really well made

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.430 
think these brushes are really well made
I<00:04:41.160> think<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.730> price<00:04:42.000> tags<00:04:42.360> really<00:04:42.870> high<00:04:43.080> for

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
I think the price tags really high for

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.540 
I think the price tags really high for
