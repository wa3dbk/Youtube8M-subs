00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:22.220
 Here we present the new four-wheel drive 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:26.540
 from fuso the sextet can be 18 4 x 4 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:29.000
 fuso is a brand of daimler and can 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.660
 because the can as it is now since 1963 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.739
 speak now for 50 years 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.850
 the central council has its big advantages 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.850
 the one switchable four-wheel drive 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.270
 has one for example here 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.530
 change system from the company mitec can 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.170
 one very varied different construction 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.120
 representing industry solutions whether in 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.760
 vehicle with a trough with one 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.379
 british trough or a tax with 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.269
 a company winter service use with 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.499
 a plate from the company schmidt 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.810
 The vehicle has a total weight of 65 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:09.140
 tons and with this appell systems 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.909
 mitec has a payload of 25 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.620
 tons and we can then 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.270
 for example, a 1 1 copy spreader 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.430
 do it and then have the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.060
 possibility to add a plate 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:27.560
 flight with a roll width of 240 to 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.180
 to 270 and the whole system 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.740
 is very fast changeable that is 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.950
 we can also under circumstances 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.140
 go out in the morning scatter and go 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.770
 then also any everyday work 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.920
 that concerns the yard or the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.500
 gardening at short notice 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.830
 do more benefits from ours 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.880
 Vehicle are the very compact design 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.470
 for example, drivers only out of holders 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.770
 a width of two meters 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.170
 we have very short wheelbases that is 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.600
 great agility on tight paths 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.880
 cemeteries are very much approached 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.490
 Vehicle is very much sold in the 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.680
 Stonemason area under construction garden 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.819
 Landscaping where also close ways 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.110
 Again and again the workers are facing problems 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.599
 I can even get to the 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.170
 Construction site then I can turn in it 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.700
 Can I go there ? 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.010
 it gets very much with our vehicle 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.530
 well solved i would like to continue this 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.980
 introduce broken system here in the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:32.280
 current case mounted on the fuso 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.590
 canter 75 the device mitec a 11 55 was 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.239
 especially determined by that we have one 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.360
 very high payload on this device 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.489
 have the device has a very low 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.870
 own weight 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.080
 I also want to point out that 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.660
 the device also without further monitoring 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.530
 electronics comes out everything is ready 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.920
 Hydraulically controlled what in operation 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.709
 especially in winterdienst extremely high 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.080
 Safety comes with it 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.160
 system allows you to do that 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.959
 These containers also with smaller ones 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.540
 they can transport vehicles 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.950
 are compatible 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.620
 also two vehicles the driving license 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.739
 great b and there is one more 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.860
 fitting trailer system what then that 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.970
 Flexibility of the farm in the big and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.970
 all good
