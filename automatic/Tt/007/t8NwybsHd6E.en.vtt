00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
helps when you're fighting like the pack

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.580 
helps when you're fighting like the pack
of<00:03:38.280> wolves<00:03:38.910> or<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.420> bunch<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:39.900> tentacles<00:03:40.380> and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
of wolves or a bunch of tentacles and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.650 
of wolves or a bunch of tentacles and
this<00:03:41.070> one's<00:03:41.250> worth<00:03:41.459> one<00:03:41.670> prestige<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.450> every

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
this one's worth one prestige and every

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.840 
this one's worth one prestige and every
but<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.260> can<00:03:43.440> sacrifice<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.310> avoid<00:03:44.579> all

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
but you can sacrifice it to avoid all

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.180 
but you can sacrifice it to avoid all
damage<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.630> such<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.590> there's<00:03:46.799> lots<00:03:47.070> of

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190

work then a firey dreadknot is just a
nasty<00:04:05.250> beast<00:04:05.820> because<00:04:06.269> if<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:06.900> don't<00:04:07.110> do<00:04:07.230> a

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
nasty beast because if you don't do a

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.539 
nasty beast because if you don't do a
certain<00:04:07.500> amount<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.799> damage<00:04:08.010> to<00:04:08.190> him<00:04:08.430> each

in<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.209> game<00:04:15.590> mercury<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.680> really<00:04:17.130> like

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
in the game mercury I really like

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.069 
in the game mercury I really like
mercury<00:04:17.760> because<00:04:18.090> when<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.359> mercury<00:04:18.539> attacks

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
mercury because when the mercury attacks

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.810 
mercury because when the mercury attacks
it's<00:04:19.560> kinda<00:04:19.769> like<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.010> old<00:04:20.160> video<00:04:20.310> game<00:04:20.669> we

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
it's kinda like that old video game we

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.790 
it's kinda like that old video game we
have<00:04:20.970> this<00:04:21.060> blob<00:04:21.419> and<00:04:21.720> once<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.080> kill<00:04:22.620> the

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
have this blob and once you kill the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.010 
have this blob and once you kill the
blob<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.280> splits<00:04:23.640> into<00:04:23.820> two<00:04:24.060> small<00:04:24.450> blobs<00:04:24.750> and

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
blob it splits into two small blobs and

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.090 
blob it splits into two small blobs and
once<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.289> kill<00:04:25.500> those<00:04:25.710> they<00:04:26.190> each<00:04:26.370> witness

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
once you kill those they each witness

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.430 
once you kill those they each witness
and<00:04:27.760> if<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.210> don't<00:04:28.390> kill<00:04:28.630> these<00:04:28.810> blobs<00:04:29.050> fast

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
and if you don't kill these blobs fast

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.380 
and if you don't kill these blobs fast
enough<00:04:29.710> they<00:04:29.860> reform<00:04:30.430> into<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.820> next<00:04:31.060> largest

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
enough they reform into the next largest

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.440 
enough they reform into the next largest
