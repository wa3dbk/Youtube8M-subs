00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.190 
music it caused my whole desk to shake
but<00:04:02.189> it<00:04:02.310> also<00:04:02.549> effectively<00:04:03.269> sets<00:04:03.659> a<00:04:03.750> daunting

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
but it also effectively sets a daunting

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.149 
but it also effectively sets a daunting
tone<00:04:04.439> in<00:04:04.859> peace<00:04:05.250> for<00:04:05.549> them<00:04:05.879> on<00:04:06.560> it's<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:07.859> hard

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
tone in peace for them on it's so hard

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.339 
tone in peace for them on it's so hard
to<00:04:08.219> miss<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.609> entire<00:04:08.879> voice<00:04:09.269> activity<00:04:09.900> they

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
to miss the entire voice activity they

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.770 
to miss the entire voice activity they
were<00:04:10.409> all<00:04:10.680> just<00:04:10.980> great<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.579> think<00:04:12.180> some<00:04:12.329> purist

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
were all just great I think some purist

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.599 
were all just great I think some purist
or<00:04:12.930> perfectionist<00:04:13.620> might<00:04:13.829> have<00:04:14.010> issues<00:04:14.430> with

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
or perfectionist might have issues with

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.550 
or perfectionist might have issues with
some<00:04:14.790> of<00:04:14.909> the<00:04:14.969> voiceovers<00:04:15.510> but<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.169> think

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
some of the voiceovers but I think

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.630 
some of the voiceovers but I think
everyone<00:04:16.919> did<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.130> wonderful<00:04:17.400> job
