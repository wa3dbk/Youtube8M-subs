here is your on this is what your
machine<00:00:17.100> sits<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.029> then<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.490> your

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
machine sits on and then in here is your

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.000 
machine sits on and then in here is your
swing<00:00:21.000> gear<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.539> then<00:00:22.320> these<00:00:22.470> ear<00:00:22.650> helps<00:00:22.890> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
swing gear and then these ear helps to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.150 
swing gear and then these ear helps to
lift<00:00:23.160> your<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> carriage<00:00:24.769> your<00:00:25.769> tracks

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
lift your on the carriage your tracks

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.330 
lift your on the carriage your tracks
are<00:00:27.830> are<00:00:28.830> they<00:00:29.010> heads<00:00:29.429> though<00:00:30.800> they're<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
are are they heads though they're the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.940 
are are they heads though they're the
one<00:00:33.210> link<00:00:33.510> meaning<00:00:33.960> they<00:00:34.110> don't<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.350> pads<00:00:34.680> on

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
one link meaning they don't have pads on

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.080 
one link meaning they don't have pads on
them<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.420> guess<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:36.899> welded<00:00:37.320> them<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:38.090> not

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
them I guess they welded them on not

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.920 
them I guess they welded them on not
their<00:00:39.570> pads<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.530> machinist<00:00:40.980> shot

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
their pads it's just a machinist shot

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.200 
their pads it's just a machinist shot
and<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.800> can't<00:00:44.070> really<00:00:44.190> tell<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and you can't really tell but this is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.270 
and you can't really tell but this is
your<00:00:45.329> counterweight<00:00:45.809> right<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.950> then

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
your counterweight right here and then

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.220 
your counterweight right here and then
that's<00:00:47.550> your<00:00:48.090> cat<00:00:48.390> Walker<00:00:48.690> there

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.470 

and<00:00:53.560> then<00:00:54.010> back<00:00:54.340> there<00:00:54.610> that's<00:00:54.940> how<00:00:55.090> they<00:00:55.210> park

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
and then back there that's how they park

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.250 
and then back there that's how they park
the<00:00:55.600> machine

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.609 

there<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:00.980> can<00:01:01.129> tell<00:01:01.250> how<00:01:01.370> they<00:01:01.489> parked<00:01:01.850> it

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.180 

right<00:01:06.189> on

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
right on

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.140 
right on
they

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
they

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.140 
they
way<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.660> point<00:01:10.930> goes<00:01:11.200> by

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.060 

they<00:01:15.690> parked<00:01:16.050> it<00:01:16.140> right<00:01:16.380> against<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> fence

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
they parked it right against the fence

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.240 
they parked it right against the fence
so<00:01:17.940> I<00:01:18.240> mean<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.620> cab<00:01:19.800> almost

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
so I mean to get in the cab almost

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.320 
so I mean to get in the cab almost
impossible<00:01:20.940> but<00:01:22.490> here's<00:01:23.490> your<00:01:23.640> motor<00:01:23.820> over

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
impossible but here's your motor over

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.820 
impossible but here's your motor over
here<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.050> could<00:01:25.320> find<00:01:26.160> C<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:27.660> then<00:01:28.320> that's

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
here you could find C and then that's

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.720 
here you could find C and then that's
useful<00:01:29.160> year<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.800> your<00:01:32.040> tracks<00:01:32.400> which

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
useful year and then your tracks which

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.140 
useful year and then your tracks which
are<00:01:32.880> full<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.480> all<00:01:33.540> stopping<00:01:34.730> and<00:01:35.730> then

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
are full of we're all stopping and then

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.470 
are full of we're all stopping and then
that's<00:01:36.330> how<00:01:36.480> you<00:01:36.540> get<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.870> on<00:01:37.050> it<00:01:37.080> up<00:01:37.350> there<00:01:38.480> and

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
that's how you get up on it up there and

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.100 
that's how you get up on it up there and
then<00:01:39.690> we'll<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.170> over<00:01:40.230> here<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.700> bucket

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
then we'll go over here to the bucket

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.310 
then we'll go over here to the bucket
now<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:44.030> this<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.750> found<00:01:45.990> really

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
now what this is what I found really

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.480 
now what this is what I found really
unique<00:01:46.830> about<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:48.570> move<00:01:48.750> your<00:01:49.080> bucket

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
unique about it is a to move your bucket

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.280 
unique about it is a to move your bucket
there's<00:01:50.940> no<00:01:51.119> cylinders<00:01:51.630> outside<00:01:52.050> it's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
there's no cylinders outside it's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.840 
there's no cylinders outside it's
actually<00:01:52.830> in<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.220> stick<00:01:53.460> which<00:01:53.610> we're<00:01:53.760> going

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
actually in the stick which we're going

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.359 
actually in the stick which we're going
to<00:01:53.910> go<00:01:54.000> take<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> look<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:56.220> move

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
to go take a look at and then to move

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.210 
to go take a look at and then to move
your<00:01:56.520> stick<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.000> single<00:01:57.780> cylinder<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.440> this

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
your stick is a single cylinder and this

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.830 
your stick is a single cylinder and this
thick<00:01:59.490> design<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.000> something<00:02:00.180> that's<00:02:00.570> really

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
thick design is something that's really

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.950 
thick design is something that's really
I've<00:02:01.530> seen<00:02:01.970> not<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.119> many<00:02:03.270> front<00:02:03.540> rolls<00:02:03.750> but

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
I've seen not that many front rolls but

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.390 
I've seen not that many front rolls but
I<00:02:04.020> seen<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> couple<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.190> first

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and now the bucket and the bucket is

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.280 
and now the bucket and the bucket is
also<00:02:10.800> real<00:02:11.010> cool<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.510> doesn't<00:02:12.870> open<00:02:12.990> like

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
also real cool it's it doesn't open like

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.860 
also real cool it's it doesn't open like
a<00:02:13.320> bowl<00:02:13.530> clam<00:02:13.770> that's<00:02:14.760> that's<00:02:15.300> how<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.600> don't

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
there it is right there the cylinders in

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.179 
there it is right there the cylinders in
this<00:03:06.090> stick<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.420> it's<00:03:06.750> attached<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.409> right

this stick and it's attached to right
there<00:03:08.459> which<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.750> found<00:03:10.260> real<00:03:10.469> cool<00:03:10.709> about<00:03:10.739> that

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
there which I found real cool about that

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.030 
there which I found real cool about that
first<00:03:12.750> one<00:03:12.959> I've<00:03:13.109> seen<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.709> even<00:03:13.859> in

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
first one I've seen like that even in

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.130 
first one I've seen like that even in
pictures<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:15.390> piece<00:03:15.719> right<00:03:15.900> there<00:03:15.959> is

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
pictures and that piece right there is

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.780 
pictures and that piece right there is
your<00:03:16.260> linkage<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.769> move<00:03:16.890> your<00:03:17.040> bucket<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
your linkage to move your bucket the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.580 
your linkage to move your bucket the
bucket<00:03:17.969> is<00:03:18.209> pretty<00:03:18.390> big<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:18.629> my<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.260> made<00:03:19.469> me

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
bucket is pretty big and my it made me

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.599 
bucket is pretty big and my it made me
like<00:03:19.769> seven<00:03:20.099> or<00:03:20.159> ten<00:03:20.400> yards<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:21.030> would<00:03:21.719> say<00:03:22.609> and

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
like seven or ten yards I would say and

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.369 
like seven or ten yards I would say and
then<00:03:23.819> there's<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.209> stick<00:03:24.569> and<00:03:24.840> right<00:03:25.139> there

then there's you stick and right there

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.280 
then there's you stick and right there
is<00:03:25.590> your<00:03:25.799> cylinder<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:29.090> move<00:03:30.090> your<00:03:30.659> stick<00:03:30.959> and

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
is your cylinder to move your stick and

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.309 
is your cylinder to move your stick and
in<00:03:32.189> there<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.670> your<00:03:33.329> cylinders<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:33.959> stuff<00:03:34.139> and

in there is your cylinders and stuff and
there<00:03:34.409> must<00:03:34.500> be<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> lostness<00:03:35.159> there's

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
there must be a lostness there's

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.759 
there must be a lostness there's
something<00:03:36.060> because<00:03:36.389> there<00:03:37.109> are<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.379> lot<00:03:37.560> of

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
something because there are a lot of

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.320

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
and then those lines right there are to

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.850 
and then those lines right there are to
move<00:03:46.600> your<00:03:46.870> motors<00:03:47.320> to<00:03:47.710> drive<00:03:47.740> your<00:03:48.100> tracks

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
again but uh like those ones to move

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.550 
again but uh like those ones to move
your<00:04:00.130> track<00:04:00.370> motors<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:02.200> would<00:04:02.320> be<00:04:02.410> your

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
your track motors that would be your

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.860 
your track motors that would be your
stick<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:02.950> no<00:04:03.340> cylinders<00:04:03.910> right<00:04:04.120> there<00:04:04.360> move

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
stick and no cylinders right there move

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.990 
stick and no cylinders right there move
your<00:04:05.020> stick<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.470> up<00:04:05.860> pull<00:04:06.580> up<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.360> down<00:04:07.540> and

maybe<00:04:10.000> if<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.300> got<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.480> shot<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.840> camper

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
maybe if you got a shot of the camper

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:24.640 
maybe if you got a shot of the camper
over<00:04:11.410> here<00:04:20.610> there's<00:04:21.610> the<00:04:21.760> cab<00:04:22.230> shot

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
over here there's the cab shot

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.370 
over here there's the cab shot
as<00:04:25.070> parked<00:04:25.490> against<00:04:25.700> the<00:04:25.850> fence<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.380> then

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
as parked against the fence and then

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.950 
as parked against the fence and then
here's<00:04:27.650> this<00:04:27.860> side

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.460 

but<00:04:31.960> I'm<00:04:32.110> pretty<00:04:32.740> sure<00:04:32.860> it's<00:04:33.159> in<00:04:33.220> each<00:04:33.340> 101<00:04:33.819> I

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
but I'm pretty sure it's in each 101 I

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.629 
but I'm pretty sure it's in each 101 I
don't<00:04:35.470> think<00:04:35.680> it's<00:04:35.830> an<00:04:35.979> H<00:04:36.099> triple<00:04:36.789> 1h<00:04:37.360> or<00:04:37.720> 111

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
don't think it's an H triple 1h or 111

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.200 
don't think it's an H triple 1h or 111
but<00:04:39.639> uh<00:04:39.810> that's<00:04:40.810> what<00:04:41.469> I<00:04:41.500> believe<00:04:41.770> is<00:04:41.949> a<00:04:42.210> damag

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
but uh that's what I believe is a damag

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.080 
but uh that's what I believe is a damag
H<00:04:43.449> 101
