00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 hailed welcome to a new round 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.040
 in Los Battlefield 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:11.880
 Yesterday we have 355 swords 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.980
 reached and yes let's see if the patch 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.900
 has worked or not or how 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.660
 Whatever we definitely have to do now 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.369
 in the second league of the alleys reset and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.680
 let's see if we are in book form 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.779
 Get this ten percent bonus here 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.240
 or if that still does not work 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.109
 we will see today 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.640
 otherwise we are from the placement 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:37.940
 538 place one with 485 points 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.520
 So neat air before us up 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.100
 we want quiet times the first and 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.180
 have one here with 480 points 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.950
 the good again that envy there remain 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.719
 we proceed with our standard 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.550
 does not speak necessarily to ice 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.930
 whether she cut pixie there 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.090
 I could also control myself here 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.879
 imagine 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:04.809
 but you can say that badly though 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.369
 fight is over super 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.329
 so now we have you all gone 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.049
 be exact but not now 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:16.060
 set up that means we need 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.890
 at first but should our magician 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.090
 The whole thing for us is wonderful 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.750
 40 points plus and here I see 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.759
 in fact the ten percent one 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.689
 part of the bug fix seems to work 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.189
 have 44 points here instead of 40 he knows 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:40.509
 exactly ten percent corresponds 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:42.640
 well so 527 points fits great too 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.880
 but already so many points have it real 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.159
 hard to arrive remote app with front 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.890
 I do not speak for sarah 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.799
 times appreciate perfect but a similar one 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.500
 posing like virus with it though 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.420
 our of her acting younger talent like 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.920
 only then what our center or his 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.979
 no matter we blew everything away now 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.229
 ares v series will come with exactly abi 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.840
 I'm curious we have hacker with 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.769
 at first we need that then 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.670
 our course at the front in the fashion active yes 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.319
 that speaks again for well and well 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.480
 we get our nice bonus here 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.200
 Now with it on of machines further 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.000
 Forward 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.500
 511 we should not want 100 anymore 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.959
 points we think we had yesterday 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.590
 some with 480 already you can once 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.550
 to repeat 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.480
 yes, 537 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.280
 will fit so far probably 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.690
 Really build tomorrow until we get that 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.330
 first day of the probable 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.239
 so hopefully have balanced out now 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.709
 grab and destroyer first near the 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.239
 but not destroyer point first 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.319
 We three fly one for the case 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.650
 The number is wonderful for us 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.599
 perfect here is good good behind 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.110
 starting positions no 5 was quick 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:10.900
 marius now our heroes should 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:14.530
 Rest your local edinger probably 8 30 and 40 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.690
 okay, let's move forward 415 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.870
 Points 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.769
 there we need more and more important is always 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.769
 not to lose a fight 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.409
 508 are more points than we have 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.409
 repeat ourselves twice 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.939
 548 again a bit more points 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.620
 which we can dust but already 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:47.659
 suspicions will be so many points 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.810
 v spd speaks for escada is about to 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.810
 to have 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.200
 Now we need a lot of luck and that 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.280
 we need the box we do not 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.810
 got and we would have 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.000
 used to blow away the aries 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.260
 annoying okay but now it has to go 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.510
 second we should certainly win with it 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.730
 and to be present is his 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.349
 weakest team of the three occurs 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.870
 our strongest team went to that is 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.430
 but now comes our weakest team 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.840
 against his middle team 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.090
 I have already lost a lot of his time 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.610
 Exactly I see space behind and 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.990
 Place without threat here we have 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.520
 only the mine we have thunder god there 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.320
 here all times and now need 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.570
 we actually my brock from the age 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.699
 hopefully the arius perfectly serious 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.389
 he can as far as to slay the BAFTA 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:39.530
 probably brought again 36 points were 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.720
 important finally from the ok 510 wants can 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.139
 Once we want to get over 30 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.139
 Points 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.570
 willing was already sitting here 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.600
 we have again luck really 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.360
 even stronger was already 552 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.950
 Points aries in the first team make one 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.060
 other tactics our weakest team 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.550
 in the front then comes our second system 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.840
 is actually our stand so 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.890
 You should fight the first one a lot 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.960
 Do not even lose to the aries 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.520
 in five acts maybe ours stood 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.250
 him or near and there he is confessed 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.930
 yes we still come on 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.290
 comes already comes everything 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.630
 what a damn that will be damned 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.670
 just her but it was cool if this 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.670
 team that beats here okay now 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.620
 beaten with a weakest team 1 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:46.670
 and so a high score of buzz 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.260
 later with 130 heroes here with it 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:57.720
 ok so there you can really out and a lot 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:59.100
 on the first day x 34 swords to 544 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.030
 not even the score is enough 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:07.840
 from our against there 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:09.420
 let's see 538 55 points almost 200 points 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.550
 today made good yield 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.050
 Of course, goal is hopefully now 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.790
 today the jump in the top 100 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.300
 but that will happen 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.810
 Of course, Tomorrow morning, John will show you 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.810
 teams we do not change much now 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.680
 or discussing it so far from me 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.680
 yours acts
