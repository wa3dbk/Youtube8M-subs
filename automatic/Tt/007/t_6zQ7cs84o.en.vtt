00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.520 
then this wouldn't be a bad buy for you
however<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.090> plastic<00:01:42.659> does<00:01:42.899> feel<00:01:43.200> kind<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
however the plastic does feel kind of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.350 
however the plastic does feel kind of
cheap<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.549> hear<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> sounds

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
cheap so you can hear that that sounds

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.649 
cheap so you can hear that that sounds
like<00:01:45.479> cheap<00:01:45.659> plastic<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.079> me<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:48.240> feels<00:01:48.509> like

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
like cheap plastic to me it feels like

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.359 
like cheap plastic to me it feels like
you<00:01:48.810> could<00:01:48.960> actually<00:01:49.079> break<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.220> half

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you could actually break this in half

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.080 
you could actually break this in half
just<00:01:50.759> squeeze<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.720> way<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.909> build

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
just squeeze it the right way the build

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.740 
just squeeze it the right way the build
quality<00:01:54.149> isn't<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.549> great<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.360> guess<00:01:57.570> it

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
quality isn't that great but I guess it

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.600 
quality isn't that great but I guess it
was<00:01:58.200> meant<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.520> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
was meant to be like that so it's a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.249 
was meant to be like that so it's a
little<00:01:59.790> lighter<00:02:00.770> then<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:02.310> were<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.640> use

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
little lighter then if they were to use

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.740 
little lighter then if they were to use
harder<00:02:04.259> tougher<00:02:05.070> plastic

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.450 

you<00:02:08.289> can<00:02:08.470> see<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:10.230> the<00:02:11.230> cup<00:02:11.470> twists<00:02:12.370> a

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
you can see that the the cup twists a

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.850 
you can see that the the cup twists a
little<00:02:12.670> bit<00:02:12.850> to<00:02:13.570> accommodate<00:02:13.600> most<00:02:14.530> head

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
little bit to accommodate most head

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.470 
little bit to accommodate most head
shapes<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.310> sizes<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:17.910> swivel<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.120> little

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
shapes and sizes and a swivel a little

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.500 
shapes and sizes and a swivel a little
as<00:02:19.720> well<00:02:19.960> so<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:21.280> fit<00:02:21.580> heads<00:02:22.830> better<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:24.790> cable

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
as well so it fit heads better the cable

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.850 
as well so it fit heads better the cable
for<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.050> thing<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.560> actually<00:02:26.950> we'd<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:29.770> you

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
for this thing is actually we'd can you

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.080 
for this thing is actually we'd can you
focus<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:31.290> come<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.440> come<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.520> focus

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.650 

it's<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.210> like<00:02:39.390> those<00:02:39.630> regular<00:02:41.660> insulated

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
it's not like those regular insulated

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.240 
it's not like those regular insulated
cables<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.920> also<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:45.030> input<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
cables and also it's the input is the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.850 
cables and also it's the input is the
3.5<00:02:47.600> millimeter<00:02:48.600> jack<00:02:49.280> which<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.460> great<00:02:50.610> for

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
3.5 millimeter jack which is great for

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.450 
3.5 millimeter jack which is great for
ps3<00:02:52.860> owners<00:02:53.280> who<00:02:53.700> don't<00:02:53.970> who<00:02:54.720> can't<00:02:54.990> afford
