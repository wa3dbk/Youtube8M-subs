00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
versions of this but this is divert

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.230 
versions of this but this is divert
version<00:00:18.960> 2<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.800> exactly<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.730> blue<00:00:20.939> one

but it has no border ok so let's get
into<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.990> front<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.320> has<00:00:25.439> artifice

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
into it on the front it has artifice

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.279

they're exactly the same this is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.600 
they're exactly the same this is
repeated<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> back<00:00:33.780> design<00:00:34.460> then<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
repeated on the back design then you

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.160 
repeated on the back design then you
have<00:00:35.760> artificial<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:36.660> always<00:00:36.780> quigley

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
have artificial these always quigley

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.750 
have artificial these always quigley
lines<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.620> then<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.010> Tiger<00:00:38.489> kind

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
of design that goes down ok then you

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.360 
of design that goes down ok then you
have<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.620> side<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> United<00:00:44.219> States

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
white border and it shows what the whole

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
white border and it shows what the whole
car<00:01:18.390> would<00:01:18.600> look<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:19.770> quite

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
car would look like and that's quite

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.130 
car would look like and that's quite
cool<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.580> as<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> little

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
cool and as you can see it's a little

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.510 
cool and as you can see it's a little
bit<00:01:22.229> different<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.920> these<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.280> doesn't

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
bit different not with these it doesn't

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
bit different not with these it doesn't
have<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.880> part<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.420> artwork<00:01:24.840> going

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
have this part this go artwork going

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.660 
have this part this go artwork going
around<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.770> little<00:01:26.040> line<00:01:26.189> go<00:01:26.430> round

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
around it like the little line go round

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.179 
around it like the little line go round
then<00:01:27.299> that's<00:01:27.509> quite<00:01:27.750> cool<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.229> yeah<00:01:28.770> let's<00:01:29.100> get

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
then that's quite cool so yeah let's get

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.740 
then that's quite cool so yeah let's get
into<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.520> deck<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.299> what<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.509> deck

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
into this deck and see what this deck

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.980 
into this deck and see what this deck
has<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.290> store<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.979> us<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:33.299> first<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.840> bit

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
has in store for us the first on bit

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.399 
has in store for us the first on bit
rubbish<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.380> opening<00:01:34.650> decks<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.189> because

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
and you have a look at this one it's a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.300 
and you have a look at this one it's a
blue<00:02:45.019> out<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.320> this<00:02:45.410> but<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.920> difference<00:02:46.220> with

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
and it should have a border because it's

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.350
