 it's something routine, we do not have to 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.479
 tell stories and you just hit a 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.480

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.080

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.860

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.660
 united and in that area we have not 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.670
 launched to the adventure to fight us 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.520
 like silly little princesses or mothers who 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.950
 We go to the cargo market 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.370
 the last to arrive is a genre that has 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.370
 arrived 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.720

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.760
 boat to buy a map of the world not 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.500
 I'm more bare than a field of 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.450
 carrots on the island of huevitos 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.420
 spent everything to buy you those rags 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:59.650
 that I called work clothes is not very 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.650
 elegant for a young lady 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.880

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.880

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.209
 and me 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.689

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.030

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.650
 tremble at the power of the black body 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.650
