 liberators the team arrives at morumbi and the precedents said perrella let the 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.400
 favoritism for the paulistas the paulo has a tradition is the favorite 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.500
 his at home 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.860
 but the right of your way is to qualify I hope that we can 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.939
 because being afraid of the moment of life 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.559
 the anatel however the fans were always once again attended 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.860
 so I did not have occasional problems like reliquary with the cruise 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.420
 the transfer of the money they secure can reach the end of the liberators and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.210
 best champion so 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.890
 in 2002 two key head-coaches who beat São Paulo this afternoon in the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.810
 scoreboard 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.739
 in the field 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.310
 the rudder has a balanced game 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.310
 I have a good chance 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.750
 we do not have a bid but são paulo has an eduardo costa for expulsion in 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.750
 first stage ended without a goal 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.399
 0 - 0 was the score after the first half. 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.699
 this is a kind of cnc window 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.950
 the balance between the two teams since the beginning of the second half 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.550
 The cruise was who sent the game 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.880
 the first goal of any game 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.760
 a great Henrique goal 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.760
 1 to 0 rapunzel 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.289
 there was still time for Kolber to leave his. 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.289
 from penalty shootout 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.890
 guess not the smell in the semifinals of the two liberators 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.049
 Sao Paulo closed many innocent people 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:09.429
 5 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.119
 even we are in recess 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:13.949
 - on here 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:17.259
 - Worries say over the past year 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.469
