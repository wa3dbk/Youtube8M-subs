00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
off by making a chevron print with some

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.450 
off by making a chevron print with some
tape<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.260> I'm<00:01:15.350> doing<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:15.710> inside<00:01:16.280> of<00:01:16.310> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460
