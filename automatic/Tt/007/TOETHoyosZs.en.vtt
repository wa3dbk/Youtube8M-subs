00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:10.160
 I was a tailor 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:13.370
 I started very very very early on 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.010
 take the needle thimble 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.860
 start sewing 17 18 years I have 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.210
 stew already to make the customized jump is 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.500
 one fine moment I started taking 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.470
 of the aurum series Pope has always put us 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.790
 the passion in trousers and we are 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.840
 arrived to make then a shed of 2000 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.870
 meters 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.030
 in the 70s we reached 3,000 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.180
 3,500 meters we are always a company 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.700
 family and currently invoice approx 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.190
 euro I did n't know if sold either 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.020
 abroad than in Italy the market 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.970
 Italian always remains a very market 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.890
 important because it is an important one 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.810
 showcase for the rest of the world 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.310
 especially for the made in Italy 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.440
 our major markets though 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.470
 abroad are Europe with France and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.559
 belgium of japan and the united states i 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.900
 our brands are the viganò brand 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.890
 new brand called dpa e 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.740
 we collaborate with other companies among 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 which dax of london we have in a 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 license agreement 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.640
 currently we have carried out a 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.830
 very distinctive project that we 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.220
 we called slow size is a patent 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.710
 that we have in use by a company 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.720
 English that allows you to elasticize 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.880
 we have any kind of fabric 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.580
 used for elasticity 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 the belt of the trousers 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.100
 main objectives are to strengthen the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.290
 sale 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.380
 foreigners give more impetus to this 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.159
 new brand that laughs and was not after 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.850
 more possible not only cut love 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.770
 making all the cartons was a disaster not 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.759
 it was possible to go on then 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.240
 we started taking in 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.560
 considering the cad with the plotter as well e 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.680
 then we took the first cut 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.380
 automatic second was he who has 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.620
 seen a 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.060
 and was fascinated by this at this 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.090
 project from this program understanding that 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.460
 the technology combined with 3d would have it 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.850
 greatly reduced the time of 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:27.069
 prototyping of samples and 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.549
 obviously 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.430
 times of model correction 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.620
 new and old in short of the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.840
 making a garment 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.569
 I saw yours yours 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.379
 I immediately took 3D into consideration 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:48.069
 because it will make the change to pgs saw it 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:50.049
 immediately we tried to do the 78 mm 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.569
 in more tip to the ordeal 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:56.139
 if I really owe the fold that was not 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.530
 right to their ideas from the PDS 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:02.739
 dress sees it and see it immediately 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.590
 perfect changes to ideas on the fly 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.709
 then he puts a belt on her zipper 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.560
 change her pocket and see it real on 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.530
 with how done the beautiful thing is really 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.829
 be able to combine the experience of one 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.980
 manual skills that he brings with him to that 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.000
 of an advanced technology like that 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.370
 of 13 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.739
 I've always typed the models from the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.230
 from the viganò that now having the 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.419
 3d I also make the biggest changes 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.669
 and I'm not going to re-digitize the 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.889
 carton because Mr. viganò mi 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:39.579
 always supports looking at the model e 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:42.729
 dressing the 3d mannequin succeeds in 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.859
 understand the flaw and fix it without 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:47.590
 having to go and revitalize 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.060
 having always worked gross 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.549
 we having 3d now we must 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.129
 work net I saw that 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.470
 working net is more real than I have 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.620
 found a benefit then the thing that 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.590
 you must do is remove the seams for 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.199
 example we inside the leg we have i 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.750
 two centimeters I give him the value of 2 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:10.449
 the extent to which I have to remove the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.269
 seam so I did also for the 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:15.579
 horse behind having the widening I removed 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.200
 the seam of the open space and me that does not 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.680
 I'm very into the 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.900
 to cad technologies I saw one 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.640
 development at a commercial level 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.000
 our client could see in 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.370
 preview our collections 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.820
 directly with the material fabrics that 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.820
 we propose
