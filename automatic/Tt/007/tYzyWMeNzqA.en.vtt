00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.920
 Hi people and good beauty first before 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.990
 I always want to thank you very much 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.510
 we reached the 10,000 registered 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:36.030
 week is season and today the video is about 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.370
 you know that I love zotti 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 and I saw you 're about to launch minions 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 here in Brazil only in truth and she 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.340
 years passed which eventually delayed the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.480
 launch will launch only in July 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.539
 2015 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.520
 also farther away - it's very cute 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.160
 so I decided to inspire myself to do it 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.899
 artistic morning that the boys are today 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.280
 a simpler way of doing 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.800
 I searched the internet for some ways 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.930
 to do but a lot of people use 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.070
 everything happens and things that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.990
 we do not have 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.640
 It's so easy at home so I 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.640
 I have decided to adapt and do in a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.439
 easier simple and how cute to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.610
 you stay with the lines inspired by the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.340
 minimum and the 'glue' I used this enamel 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.740
 out but you can also damage the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.070
 important is the team with white enamel 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.200
 and black be a little more group 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.200
 that's why I used the glaze 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:40.180
 I had to the first thing that you 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.800
 It will make clear to take the cuticle do 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.700
 what you do with your line normally 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.960
 then you will pass the blue enamel and 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.420
 then the yellow 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.900
 the yellow will pass where you are going to do 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.900
 the boys 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.310
 The third thing is to draw the eyes with 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.380
 gray enamel 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.330
 you can adapt I do not have that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.460
 precision brush I then adapted with 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.770
 this material but also with a toothpick 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.480
 tooth for this barbecue tapa 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.480
 adapt to make the drawing 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.129
 because if you do the little eyes with a 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.260
 With two eyes there, you'll do the 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.250
 eye and mouth contour with enamel 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.280
 black 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.080
 It is interesting that the minimum glasses 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.970
 be a little bit thick with enamel 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.580
 black so you can do well 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.680
 a thousand glasses of his and can already 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.920
 make the mouth you can make a little ball 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.860
 black and a red dot I do 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.870
 as simple as possible after the 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.200
 white enamel you will make the 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.200
 eye 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.340
 he went with the black enamel you go 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.120
 make a final dot in the middle of the year 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.120
 from minho 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.290
 What we would like in the video I hope 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.610
 much you have liked is 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.629
 understand and adapt in the best 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.700
 possible is one of the materials is for you 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.190
 who does not have so much skill to do 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.170
