and those interactive aspects where I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.609 
and those interactive aspects where I
have<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.970> kind<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.240> make<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> jump<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:19.590> I

have to kind of make a jump because I

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
have to go from live-fire on basically

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.590 
have to go from live-fire on basically
targets<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.100> standing<00:01:23.490> still<00:01:23.759> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
targets and I've looked for a long time

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.359 
targets and I've looked for a long time
for<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> way<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.290> take<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.500> live<00:01:31.950> fire

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
for a way to kind of take that live fire

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.960 
for a way to kind of take that live fire
to<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> moving<00:01:33.680> humanoid<00:01:34.680> target<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.820> know

to a moving humanoid target and you know

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.960 
to a moving humanoid target and you know
what<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.140> found<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.500> answer<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.250> it's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
for LE targets and as I used it I became

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.389 
for LE targets and as I used it I became
more<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.570> more<00:01:52.049> impressed<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:53.220> only

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.830 
system and after about five or six
minutes<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.850> found<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.659> was

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
minutes I found out that that was

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.589 
minutes I found out that that was
absolutely<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.829> case<00:02:08.160> now<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.539> see

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
absolutely the case now as you can see

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.199 
absolutely the case now as you can see
in<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.050> particular<00:02:10.229> case<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> three

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
in this particular case we have a three

on<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.459> but<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.060> know<00:02:14.180> what<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.569> could<00:02:14.930> put<00:02:15.110> a

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
on it but you know what I could put a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.620 
on it but you know what I could put a
paper<00:02:15.440> target<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.100> could<00:02:16.400> put<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> steel<00:02:17.030> target

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630

can<00:02:20.330> move<00:02:20.540> forward<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.560> turn<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.890> side<00:02:22.100> to

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
can move forward you can turn it side to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.790 
can move forward you can turn it side to
side<00:02:22.480> with<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.510> little<00:02:23.870> bit<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:23.990> practice<00:02:24.290> with

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
what's basically a remote control device

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.250 
what's basically a remote control device
as<00:02:27.770> like<00:02:28.160> used<00:02:28.430> on<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.610> toy<00:02:28.850> car<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.420> can<00:02:30.080> make

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
as like used on a toy car I can make

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
this thing move in a lot of human-like

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.710 
this thing move in a lot of human-like
movements<00:02:33.080> now<00:02:34.069> another<00:02:34.940> great<00:02:35.300> thing<00:02:35.540> about

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
movements now another great thing about

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.070 
movements now another great thing about
the<00:02:35.989> target<00:02:36.380> tracker<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:37.280> it's<00:02:37.610> very<00:02:38.080> robustly

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080

it the more I have used it this

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.259 
it the more I have used it this
literally<00:03:15.530> allows<00:03:15.920> me<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.459> bridge<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.030> gap

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
literally allows me to bridge the gap

that<00:03:24.440> moves<00:03:24.680> around<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.370> has<00:03:25.880> them<00:03:26.120> engage<00:03:26.720> it

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
that moves around and has them engage it

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.710 
that moves around and has them engage it
in<00:03:27.260> multiple<00:03:27.980> directions<00:03:28.160> which<00:03:28.790> is<00:03:28.940> much

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
in multiple directions which is much

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.940 
in multiple directions which is much
what<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.930> gunfights<00:03:30.440> likes
