00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 yes hello my love has always 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.839
 a little questioning hour that has me whole 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.240
 Many questions are sent on facebook and 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.679
 the first question comes from marina 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 she asks the camera one 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.190
 Take proper care of your diet 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 you should omit carbohydrates or 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.300
 maybe eat less of it 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.740
 So that's the question the relative 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.080
 is frequently asked and at a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 It's always like that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.710
 I have to think about it first 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.599
 I can really do that in mine 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.090
 everyday because then start and then 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.869
 ten days later to decide yet 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.850
 not my thing 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.140
 that just does not do anything 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.719
 frustration and bad mood 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.219
 So think carefully before it is the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.540
 right time i can do that now 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.690
 I really do and want to do that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.940
 if you want that there it goes slowly 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.950
 So do not change everything at once 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 but for example with the beginning must 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.149
 to take the breakfast to the chest and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.579
 let's see what he is actually there 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.190
 Can I improve that ? I am always 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.410
 Such a guy who likes to be in the moll because 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.850
 you can combine it very well then 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.100
 he can be super good already by fruits 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.049
 install so that would be for example times 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.630
 a first step you can but also 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.090
 still small-scale bird and say 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.500
 Start with it as the first time 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.159
 get used to more when I'm in the morning 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 for example, to get a battery to eat 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.780
 or a glass of fresh orange juice too 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.330
 drink and that makes a bit for now 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.640
 Give your body time to do so 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.560
 get used to and only if there is such a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.420
 So art routine sets that one 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 no longer thinking about it every day 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.960
 but that you just do it then 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.299
 you can take the next step 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.549
 then look at this for example 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.870
 for lunch or just think about it 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.370
 your drinks 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.290
 you can forget something there 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.600
 and so I want step by step 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.710
 always proceed one by one 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.080
 improve 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.000
 yes it's not all about it radically 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.820
 once to change but in small 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.610
 to improve and so on 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.430
 just to change so what the green 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.930
 As for today 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.190
 december to decrease the topic because he 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.930
 most have heard of today 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.850
 Carbohydrates are a problem if you are 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.560
 Of course you want to lose weight 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.070
 now distinguish there are so-called 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.480
 good carbohydrates and there are bad ones 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.280
 Communication rate that always works 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.130
 Beyond that, the body sugar 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.170
 but always has to digest a bit 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.110
 in which form I lead 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.820
 that too yes so the wholegrain bread or the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.220
 Of course, you do not have to potato that 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.800
 more classes but the sugar in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.200
 drinks in cola fanta sprite and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.960
 such things you should omit 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.880
 or limit it as far as possible 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.280
 All the sweets you should 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.100
 Restrict as possible and forget that 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.170
 many people all over 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.000
 white flour so white toast to 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.330
 for example, this policy in and 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.820
 Anywhere in the car can buy these 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.640
 whole things bright from ground 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.770
 white flour in it is those things that are 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.440
 you should leave out or so far it 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.510
 is going to reduce because those are doing in the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.489
 tactics forbid what he for example 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.000
 for breakfast first or for my sake 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.510
 being on the move is still an aspect 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.510
 that's not the problem 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.640
 the question of carbohydrates in the evening you have to 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.110
 with yes answer the body needs in 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.239
 No more carbohydrates during the night 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.310
 Accurate are what energy us 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.739
 We need it during the day at night 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.200
 we sleep as a percent on 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.290
 other metabolic processes there is the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.370
 to repair the body, building since 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.500
 we need 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.690
 so far nobody asks this 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.450
 answer it makes sense in the evening 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.099
 carbs down on me 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.250
 also to leave out and the body must 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.019
 admit it does not make sense 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.030
 on carbohydrates all day 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.480
 do without because that does not matter 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.480
 Bad mood
