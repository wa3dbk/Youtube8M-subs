can see that there's kind of a ridge

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.520 
can see that there's kind of a ridge
here<00:01:10.549> so<00:01:10.759> it<00:01:10.909> what<00:01:11.780> you're<00:01:11.929> putting<00:01:12.140> in<00:01:12.380> here

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.899 
there's still room for it at the top of
it<00:01:14.749> so<00:01:14.929> it's<00:01:15.740> not<00:01:15.890> like<00:01:16.100> when<00:01:16.249> you<00:01:16.340> put<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:16.700> lid

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:21.319 
the top when you put the lid on it

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:23.380 
the top when you put the lid on it
you're<00:01:21.499> not<00:01:21.590> gonna<00:01:21.770> lose<00:01:22.039> a<00:01:22.100> room<00:01:22.429> you<00:01:23.090> know<00:01:23.119> as

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
you're not gonna lose a room you know as

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.450 
you're not gonna lose a room you know as
if<00:01:23.569> the<00:01:23.960> lid<00:01:24.170> pushed<00:01:24.560> it<00:01:24.740> down<00:01:24.770> into<00:01:25.249> here

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
if the lid pushed it down into here

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.919 
if the lid pushed it down into here
which<00:01:25.609> is<00:01:25.789> really<00:01:26.090> nice<00:01:26.270> because<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.659> really

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
which is really nice because you really

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.219 
which is really nice because you really
get<00:01:27.079> the<00:01:27.259> full<00:01:27.469> capacity<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:28.219> these<00:01:28.960> so<00:01:29.960> again

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.430 

now<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.120> got<00:01:40.450> these<00:01:40.780> because<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:42.130> have<00:01:42.430> the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440

reusable bags the snack taxis and I

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.080 
reusable bags the snack taxis and I
really<00:01:47.680> like<00:01:47.920> those<00:01:48.130> but<00:01:48.369> sometimes<00:01:48.820> there

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
really like those but sometimes there

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.969 
really like those but sometimes there
was<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.240> time<00:01:49.600> like<00:01:49.869> when<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.050> wanted<00:01:50.409> to<00:01:50.470> get<00:01:50.650> oil

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
was a time like when I wanted to get oil

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.160 
was a time like when I wanted to get oil
to<00:01:51.310> something<00:01:51.790> a<00:01:52.000> lot<00:01:52.360> of<00:01:52.420> times<00:01:52.720> I'll<00:01:52.900> cut<00:01:53.140> up

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
to something a lot of times I'll cut up

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.469 
to something a lot of times I'll cut up
a<00:01:53.380> tomato<00:01:53.770> for<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.190> snack<00:01:54.549> and<00:01:54.759> put<00:01:54.940> some<00:01:55.119> olive

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
a tomato for a snack and put some olive

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.870 
a tomato for a snack and put some olive
oil<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.960> salt<00:01:56.200> on<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.500> but<00:01:57.220> that<00:01:57.460> doesn't

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
oil and salt on it but that doesn't

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.850 
oil and salt on it but that doesn't
really<00:01:58.060> work<00:01:58.600> that<00:01:58.659> well<00:01:59.110> in<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.320> bag<00:01:59.619> because

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
really work that well in the bag because

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.830 
really work that well in the bag because
although<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.520> bags<00:02:00.729> are<00:02:00.940> washable<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:01.659> just

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
although the bags are washable it's just

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.410 
although the bags are washable it's just
a<00:02:01.990> little<00:02:02.140> bit<00:02:02.350> difficult<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.920> clean<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:04.180> also

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
a little bit difficult to clean and also

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.109 
a little bit difficult to clean and also
just<00:02:04.570> for<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:04.869> little<00:02:05.140> protection<00:02:05.940> like<00:02:06.940> if<00:02:07.030> I

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
just for a little protection like if I

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.790 
just for a little protection like if I

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
don't want them getting all smashed in

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.560 
don't want them getting all smashed in
my<00:02:11.500> kids<00:02:12.070> lunch<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.989> also<00:02:14.170> I'm<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:16.209> only

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
my kids lunch and I also I'm the only

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.449 
my kids lunch and I also I'm the only
negative<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.320> see<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.739> these<00:02:17.830> which<00:02:18.040> isn't<00:02:18.250> even

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
negative I see to these which isn't even

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.009 
negative I see to these which isn't even
a<00:02:18.640> negative<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.239> me<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.810> they're

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
a negative to me is that they're

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.330 
a negative to me is that they're
stainless<00:02:20.320> steel<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.010> couldn't

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
stainless steel so you couldn't

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.370 
stainless steel so you couldn't
microwave<00:02:21.850> them<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.300> your<00:02:22.780> kid<00:02:22.989> isn't<00:02:23.230> really

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
microwave them but your kid isn't really

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.110 
microwave them but your kid isn't really
going<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.560> be<00:02:23.650> microwaving<00:02:24.010> things<00:02:24.580> at<00:02:24.790> school

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
and I don't even own a microwave so it's

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.880 
and I don't even own a microwave so it's
not<00:02:27.730> an<00:02:27.880> issue<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.239> me<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:29.410> I'm<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.560> going<00:02:29.800> to

they kind of push up just a little bit
but<00:03:53.920> that's<00:03:54.010> not<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.280> problem<00:03:54.609> because<00:03:55.000> we<00:03:55.480> have

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
but that's not a problem because we have

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.500 
but that's not a problem because we have
because<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.879> these<00:03:58.000> lids

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510

I wish lid had gone all the way down I

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.280 
I wish lid had gone all the way down I
never<00:04:00.940> would<00:04:01.209> have<00:04:01.299> been<00:04:01.389> able<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.690> put<00:04:01.959> four

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
never would have been able to put four

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.920 
never would have been able to put four
eggs<00:04:02.470> in<00:04:02.799> here<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.730> again<00:04:03.940> just<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.659> best
