00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
to the east and I think they think I'm

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.600 
to the east and I think they think I'm
going<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.900> feed<00:02:33.140> them<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:36.100> rocky<00:02:37.100> does<00:02:37.430> not

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
going to feed them and rocky does not

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.640

feed<00:02:37.940> them<00:02:38.120> by<00:02:38.300> hand<00:02:38.720> because<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.410> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
feed them by hand because of the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.060 
feed them by hand because of the
raccoons<00:02:40.160> in<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.400> area<00:02:41.410> if<00:02:42.410> they<00:02:42.590> put<00:02:42.920> their

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
raccoons in the area if they put their

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.800 
raccoons in the area if they put their
paws<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:43.730> there<00:02:43.910> he<00:02:44.030> doesn't<00:02:44.180> want<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.600> fish

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
paws in there he doesn't want the fish

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.390 
paws in there he doesn't want the fish
coming<00:02:45.230> through<00:02:45.410> them<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:45.950> but<00:02:46.760> they<00:02:47.060> see<00:02:47.120> me

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
coming through them so but they see me

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.220 
coming through them so but they see me
so<00:02:49.400> they<00:02:49.640> think<00:02:49.700> I'm<00:02:50.090> going<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.390> feed<00:02:50.690> them<00:02:50.930> and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
so they think I'm going to feed them and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.450 
so they think I'm going to feed them and
that's<00:02:51.980> not<00:02:52.190> going<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.580> happen<00:02:52.900> happen<00:02:54.460> and

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
that's not going to happen happen and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.210 
that's not going to happen happen and
you<00:02:56.330> might<00:02:56.510> see<00:02:56.810> some<00:02:57.080> little<00:02:57.440> mosquito<00:02:57.830> fish

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220
