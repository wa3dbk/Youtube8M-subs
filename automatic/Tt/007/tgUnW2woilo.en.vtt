been doing I was able to still hit some
heavy<00:00:21.640> weights<00:00:21.910> this<00:00:22.150> week<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:30.160> I<00:00:30.189> was<00:00:30.430> able<00:00:30.550> to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
heavy weights this week so I was able to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.299 
heavy weights this week so I was able to
keep<00:00:31.869> hitting<00:00:32.050> some<00:00:32.259> weights<00:00:32.439> this<00:00:32.649> week<00:00:32.860> and

keep hitting some weights this week and

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.130 
keep hitting some weights this week and
the<00:00:33.940> probably<00:00:34.180> plan<00:00:34.420> knocking<00:00:34.870> it<00:00:34.960> down<00:00:34.989> a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
the probably plan knocking it down a

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.260 
the probably plan knocking it down a
little<00:00:35.320> bit<00:00:35.530> next<00:00:35.739> week<00:00:36.010> this<00:00:36.309> is<00:00:36.370> my<00:00:36.640> third

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
deadlift session basically in a week

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.270 
deadlift session basically in a week
it's<00:00:40.600> my<00:00:40.780> first<00:00:41.050> time<00:00:41.260> first<00:00:41.800> week<00:00:42.070> really

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
it's my first time first week really

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.690 
it's my first time first week really
pulling<00:00:42.790> in<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.149> last<00:00:43.329> four<00:00:43.809> months<00:00:44.160> hit<00:00:45.160> 705

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
pulling in the last four months hit 705

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.209 
pulling in the last four months hit 705
for<00:00:45.969> six<00:00:46.180> reps<00:00:46.390> earlier<00:00:46.690> in<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.870> week<00:00:47.100> hit<00:00:48.100> it

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
for six reps earlier in the week hit it

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.389 
for six reps earlier in the week hit it
for<00:00:48.460> eight<00:00:48.969> this<00:00:49.929> time<00:00:50.199> I<00:00:50.499> think<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.249> day

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
for eight this time I think the day

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.910 
for eight this time I think the day
after<00:00:51.789> this<00:00:51.910> I<00:00:52.149> went<00:00:52.329> ahead<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.440> can<00:00:53.589> find<00:00:53.829> the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
after this I went ahead you can find the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.590 
after this I went ahead you can find the
exact<00:00:54.219> sequence<00:00:54.519> and<00:00:54.909> all<00:00:54.969> the<00:00:55.059> details<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.510> my

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
exact sequence and all the details of my

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.329 
exact sequence and all the details of my
training<00:00:55.899> on<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.019> lead<00:00:56.140> up<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.289> yes<00:00:56.499> but

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
training on the lead up to yes but

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.059 
training on the lead up to yes but
worked<00:00:57.730> up<00:00:57.879> to<00:00:58.030> a<00:00:58.059> heavy<00:00:58.269> squat<00:00:58.629> again<00:00:59.069> and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
worked up to a heavy squat again and

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:01.559 
worked up to a heavy squat again and
this<00:01:00.190> is<00:01:00.309> in<00:01:00.429> addition<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.059> daily<00:01:01.359> belt

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569 
this is in addition to the daily belt

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:05.850 
this is in addition to the daily belt
squats<00:01:02.429> so<00:01:03.429> we<00:01:03.550> went<00:01:03.699> up<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:03.930> basically<00:01:04.930> 8:15

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
squats so we went up to basically 8:15

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.610 
squats so we went up to basically 8:15
at<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.190> top<00:01:06.460> lockout<00:01:07.060> probably<00:01:07.450> 70<00:01:07.840> 50<00:01:08.200> ish<00:01:08.470> at

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
at the top lockout probably 70 50 ish at

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.960 
at the top lockout probably 70 50 ish at
the<00:01:08.710> bottom<00:01:09.040> I<00:01:09.100> didn't<00:01:09.340> measure<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.610> bottom

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
the bottom I didn't measure the bottom

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.760 
the bottom I didn't measure the bottom
band<00:01:10.120> tension<00:01:10.540> but<00:01:10.659> I'm<00:01:11.229> definitely<00:01:11.680> not

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
band tension but I'm definitely not

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.610 
band tension but I'm definitely not
getting<00:01:11.920> a<00:01:12.130> full<00:01:12.280> V<00:01:12.490> load<00:01:12.670> on<00:01:12.820> those<00:01:13.620> wearing

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
getting a full V load on those wearing

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.140 
getting a full V load on those wearing
the<00:01:14.860> sleeves<00:01:15.220> instead<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.610> knee<00:01:15.729> wraps<00:01:15.970> right

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
the sleeves instead the knee wraps right

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.170 
the sleeves instead the knee wraps right
now<00:01:16.360> which<00:01:17.080> makes<00:01:17.590> up<00:01:18.100> for<00:01:18.400> I<00:01:18.430> guess<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.820> the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
now which makes up for I guess the the

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.660 
now which makes up for I guess the the
band<00:01:19.509> tension<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:20.020> I'm<00:01:20.140> using<00:01:20.520> notice<00:01:21.520> that

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
band tension that I'm using notice that

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.719 
band tension that I'm using notice that
trick<00:01:21.939> I<00:01:23.100> guess<00:01:24.100> not

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
trick I guess not

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.760 
trick I guess not
super<00:01:25.090> trick<00:01:25.299> but<00:01:25.479> band<00:01:25.930> on<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.259> mono<00:01:26.469> there

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
super trick but band on the mono there

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.260 
super trick but band on the mono there
it<00:01:26.829> allows<00:01:27.009> me<00:01:27.219> to<00:01:27.340> operate<00:01:27.790> with<00:01:27.909> a<00:01:27.939> few<00:01:28.119> less

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
it allows me to operate with a few less

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.670 
it allows me to operate with a few less
people<00:01:28.329> because<00:01:28.930> I'm<00:01:29.049> in<00:01:29.170> training<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:29.619> the

little<00:02:14.480> bit<00:02:14.660> deeper<00:02:14.720> now<00:02:15.670> before<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.700> hit<00:02:16.819> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
little bit deeper now before I hit the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.390 
little bit deeper now before I hit the
bottom<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.450> pulley<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.560> that's<00:02:19.010> that's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
bottom of the pulley so that's that's

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.480 
bottom of the pulley so that's that's
good<00:02:19.700> news<00:02:20.650> makes<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.830> little<00:02:21.920> tougher<00:02:22.340> so

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
good news makes it a little tougher so

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.540 
good news makes it a little tougher so
the<00:02:22.580> weights<00:02:22.790> are<00:02:22.970> down<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.180> little<00:02:23.540> bit<00:02:23.720> for<00:02:24.020> me

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
the weights are down a little bit for me

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.000 
the weights are down a little bit for me
but<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:27.080> seems<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.410> be<00:02:27.500> working<00:02:27.620> quite<00:02:27.920> well

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
but it seems to be working quite well

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.600 
but it seems to be working quite well
definitely<00:02:29.230> gonna<00:02:30.230> hit<00:02:30.530> my<00:02:30.680> limits<00:02:31.040> here<00:02:31.250> and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
definitely gonna hit my limits here and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.949 
definitely gonna hit my limits here and
have<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.000> back<00:02:32.180> down<00:02:33.190> because<00:02:34.270> I'm<00:02:35.270> not<00:02:35.570> quite

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
have to back down because I'm not quite

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:44.650 
have to back down because I'm not quite
recovering<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.709> way<00:02:36.830> I'd<00:02:36.980> like<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:43.660> and

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
recovering the way I'd like to and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.449 
recovering the way I'd like to and
almost<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.320> think<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.560> still<00:02:45.739> had<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.890> PR<00:02:46.070> on<00:02:46.310> that

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
almost I think I still had a PR on that

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.509 
almost I think I still had a PR on that
set<00:02:46.700> with<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.209> weight<00:02:48.040> here<00:02:49.040> we've<00:02:49.160> got<00:02:49.310> some

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
set with that weight here we've got some

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.070 
set with that weight here we've got some
bottoms<00:02:49.850> up<00:02:50.030> kettlebell<00:02:50.450> presses<00:02:50.840> I'd<00:02:50.930> like

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
bottoms up kettlebell presses I'd like

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.710 
bottoms up kettlebell presses I'd like
to<00:02:51.200> do<00:02:51.320> these<00:02:51.500> while<00:02:51.709> walking<00:02:52.360> just<00:02:53.360> kind<00:02:53.570> of

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
to do these while walking just kind of

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.500 
to do these while walking just kind of
helps<00:02:54.709> establish<00:02:55.250> better<00:02:55.640> better<00:02:56.120> quality

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
helps establish better better quality

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.420 
helps establish better better quality
movement<00:02:56.900> better<00:02:56.989> positioning<00:02:57.620> makes<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.370> a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
movement better positioning makes it a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.100 
movement better positioning makes it a
lot<00:02:58.760> more<00:02:58.820> challenging<00:02:59.030> if<00:02:59.600> you've<00:02:59.750> ever<00:02:59.959> done

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
lot more challenging if you've ever done

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.860 
lot more challenging if you've ever done
these<00:03:00.290> before<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:01.239> usually<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:02.360> like<00:03:02.390> four

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
these before so usually do like four

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.390 
these before so usually do like four
sets<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.200> ten<00:03:03.260> you'll<00:03:03.709> find<00:03:03.890> that<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:04.130> my<00:03:04.220> log

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
sets of ten you'll find that in my log

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.080 
sets of ten you'll find that in my log
and<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.959> what<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:06.350> call<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.880> delete

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
and this is what we call the delete

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.210 
and this is what we call the delete
performance<00:03:08.480> we<00:03:08.570> call<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.870> pony<00:03:09.080> ride<00:03:09.380> but

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
performance we call it a pony ride but

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.949 
performance we call it a pony ride but
really<00:03:11.000> it's<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.390> standing<00:03:12.250> but<00:03:13.250> grounded<00:03:13.959> hip

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
really it's a standing but grounded hip

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.160 
really it's a standing but grounded hip
thruster<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:16.000> like<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.180> exchange<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.870> instead

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
thruster I like to exchange it instead

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.569 
thruster I like to exchange it instead
of<00:03:18.230> like<00:03:18.470> pull<00:03:18.709> through<00:03:18.920> z'<00:03:18.950> in<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.160> program

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
of like pull through z' in the program

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.750 
of like pull through z' in the program
so<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.600> improves<00:03:21.370> basically<00:03:22.370> puts<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:22.640> in

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
so it improves basically puts you in

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.210 
so it improves basically puts you in
less<00:03:22.910> flexion<00:03:23.480> hopefully<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.320> dr.<00:03:24.680> snow<00:03:24.920> here

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
less flexion hopefully a dr. snow here

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.680 
less flexion hopefully a dr. snow here
steps<00:03:25.459> out<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.850> way<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.329> can<00:03:26.480> see<00:03:26.660> a

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
steps out of the way so you can see a

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.319 
steps out of the way so you can see a
little<00:03:26.840> bit<00:03:27.019> more<00:03:27.079> there<00:03:27.620> we<00:03:27.769> go<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.430> allows

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
little bit more there we go and allows

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.270 
little bit more there we go and allows
you<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.570> stay<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.810> better<00:03:30.140> position<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:30.890> you

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
you to stay in better position and you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.910 
you to stay in better position and you
get<00:03:31.400> some<00:03:31.610> band<00:03:31.850> R&amp;T<00:03:32.390> on<00:03:32.750> both<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.440> driving

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
get some band R&amp;T on both the driving

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.120 
get some band R&amp;T on both the driving
back<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.610> firing<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.750> hips<00:03:35.930> through<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:36.920> do

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
back and firing the hips through so do

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.860 
back and firing the hips through so do
these<00:03:37.310> in<00:03:37.579> high<00:03:37.790> reps<00:03:38.060> usually<00:03:38.420> at<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.600> end<00:03:38.630> of
