00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.340
 hello and welcome to concocted v 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.609
 today the presentation of the pc 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.439
 portable 12 inches dell latitude at 72 40 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.779
 it is a rather oriented machine 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.750
 pro or multimedia our copy of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.600
 test is endowed with a dual core i5 4300 him 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.390
 clocked at alain vigneault force this of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.930
 4 gigas of ram ddr3 clocked at 1600 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.300
 megahertz a ssd liteon 128 giga a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.940
 1080p touch panel with processing 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 corning gorilla glass of machines and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:53.280
 guaranteed 3 years we attack the presentation 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.940
 of the laptop with to start the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.829
 bundle 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.070
 as you can see is rather 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.410
 minimized 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.680
 we have to start the traditional 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.659
 bricks with its cable provided with a led 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.460
 typical dell option that allows 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.080
 to find his way easily in the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.299
 black was provided with the laptop a 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.549
 windows installation cd 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.840
 but I remember that we do not have 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.060
 dvd player on the machine then three 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.900
 notice including one that will allow you to 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.720
 easily put into operation 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.930
 your 3g sim card reader that you 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.360
 we will see later the carton was 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.790
 very simple we continue the presentation 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.369
 of the machine by the back slice which 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.700
 that you can see is very very 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.540
 class since we have a port rj45 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.740
 two usb ports 3 a hdmi port and the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.600
 plug hole 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.390
 all with an aluminum plate 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.030
 very well finished his right side you 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.850
 find a mini display usb port 3 and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.890
 a 3 5 audio jack for headphones 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.269
 you see we are of course a 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.829
 ultraportable the machine is well done 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.560
 on the left side you will find the 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.799
 extraction grid as well as a button 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.680
 which will cut the wifi 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.120
 convenient to save battery 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.319
 the back of the machine is also 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.810
 rather sober well finished we start with 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.180
 docking port that will allow particular 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.459
 an addition of a battery 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.650
 you will find more explanations of 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.319
 our upcoming test or on the site of her 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.319
 a grid of a fresh air traction 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:51.730
 and two small openings for sound 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.830
 who on this model was pretty good you 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.530
 see it's solid it does not sink 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.780
 the battery is removable to withdraw 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.950
 very easily 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.420
 unfortunately it's a 4 cell and 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.250
 we found that it was a little 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.420
 just for the autonomy of the machine 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.070
 it comes with a professional dose 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.420
 windows 8 1 and the famous port that you 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.640
 will put your sim card 3g 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.560
 in order to have another possibility of 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.200
 connection when there is more wii fit 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.120
 in the sector that's what we could 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.830
 read on the outside of the machine on 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.830
 go right inside 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.680
 the opening of the machine is very 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.800
 easily the hinges we have appeared 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.050
 very very good quality 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.099
 it opens at 180 degrees which 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.410
 will make it easier to use the 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.790
 pc in tablet 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.790
 they are finished in aluminum 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.599
 the whole thing is very solid like you 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.819
 can see it does not move from 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.180
 very gas- intensive treatments 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.830
 appreciable on the part of the keyboard 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.530
 you will find soft touch on 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.500
 all is very nice there too 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.269
 the trackpad without being extraordinary is 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.140
 quite average of what this 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.560
 is slipping and is rather correct on 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.109
 windows 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.329
 the keyboard that dig a little here 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.840
 as you can see but nothing 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.600
 very mean 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.979
 the hit was pretty good for a 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.930
 membrane keyboard on the top you have 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.560
 a series of small buttons for sound 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.260
 left and right for starting 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.110
 pc 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:42.520
 it is fast enough since we have 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.850
 as a reminder a liteon ssd 128 go and 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.870
 windows 8 one that has the particularity of 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.870
 start earlier round 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.140
 we arrive on windows 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.550
 then a little tour through the menu 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.550
 to see that it slides well 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.880
 see no particular problem 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.390
 it's fluid 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:25.800
 we go back to the desk and we will do 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:28.569
 a quick tour on your favorite site 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.939
 see the bronze flowers is launched very 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:35.709
 quickly here it was firefox like 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:38.499
 for your mobile phone and you 

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:42.389
 will be possible to adjust the size of 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:47.279
 the display with your fingers like this 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:50.889
 always handy 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:55.619
 it's a touch screen 10 points 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:58.689
 contact nothing to report particular 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:01.270
 just corning gorilla treatment 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:04.289
 glass that brings real comfort is 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.759
 a real security for your screen 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:10.089

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:13.629
