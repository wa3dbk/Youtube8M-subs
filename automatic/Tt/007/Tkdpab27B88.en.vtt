hey<00:00:00.750> guys<00:00:00.960> so<00:00:01.260> I've<00:00:01.350> got<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.500> pretty<00:00:01.680> much

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
hey guys so I've got a pretty much

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.460 
hey guys so I've got a pretty much
finished<00:00:02.370> water<00:00:02.580> clock<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.060> show<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.470> it's

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
finished water clock to show you it's

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.390 
finished water clock to show you it's
almost<00:00:04.799> there<00:00:05.100> it's<00:00:05.720> a<00:00:06.720> little<00:00:06.839> bit<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.400> sort

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
almost there it's a little bit of sort

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.890 
almost there it's a little bit of sort
of<00:00:08.460> messing<00:00:08.790> around<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.179> do<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.570> some<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
of messing around to do with some of the

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.180 
of messing around to do with some of the
wiring<00:00:10.110> I'm<00:00:10.440> looking<00:00:10.740> at<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:10.980> know<00:00:11.130> you

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
wiring I'm looking at it I know you

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.430 
wiring I'm looking at it I know you
can't<00:00:11.460> see<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> picture<00:00:12.179> but<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.290> is

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
can't see in the picture but this is

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.220 
can't see in the picture but this is
what<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.679> looks<00:00:13.830> like<00:00:14.009> now<00:00:14.660> so<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.809> put<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
what it looks like now so I put it in a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.380 
what it looks like now so I put it in a
box<00:00:16.440> as<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.100> can<00:00:17.250> see<00:00:17.460> with<00:00:17.730> some<00:00:17.760> printed

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
box as you can see with some printed

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.370 
box as you can see with some printed
stuff<00:00:18.690> over<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> top<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:20.310> printed<00:00:21.090> on

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
stuff over the top it's printed on

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.220 
stuff over the top it's printed on
tracing<00:00:22.380> paper<00:00:22.730> it's<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> transparent<00:00:24.269> paper<00:00:24.750> I

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
tracing paper it's a transparent paper I

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.929 
tracing paper it's a transparent paper I
don't<00:00:25.859> want<00:00:26.010> anyone<00:00:26.310> else<00:00:26.369> would<00:00:26.580> call<00:00:26.789> it

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
don't want anyone else would call it

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.910 
don't want anyone else would call it
that<00:00:27.210> tracing<00:00:27.539> paper<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.900> good<00:00:28.050> enough

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that tracing paper is good enough

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.759 
that tracing paper is good enough
printed<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.490> laser<00:00:29.730> printers<00:00:30.300> oh<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:31.109> it's

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
printed on laser printers oh it's it's

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.150 
printed on laser printers oh it's it's
like<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> jewelry<00:00:32.399> box<00:00:32.579> type<00:00:33.510> thing<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.469> I

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
like a jewelry box type thing that I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.889 
like a jewelry box type thing that I
bought<00:00:35.399> off<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.610> internet<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.360> I've

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
bought off the internet and I've

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.660 
bought off the internet and I've
partitioned<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.860> out<00:00:38.010> not<00:00:38.280> very<00:00:38.489> well

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
partitioned it out not very well

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.110 
partitioned it out not very well
admittedly<00:00:39.059> there<00:00:40.050> are<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> lot<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:41.090> sort<00:00:42.090> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
admittedly there are a lot of sort of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.910 
admittedly there are a lot of sort of
angles<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.899> there<00:00:43.079> when<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.620> should<00:00:43.800> be

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
angles in there when really it should be

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.520 
angles in there when really it should be
straight

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.959 

-<00:00:50.530> dinosaur<00:00:51.129> there<00:00:51.309> I'm<00:00:51.489> just<00:00:51.640> going<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.789> close

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
- dinosaur there I'm just going to close

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.930 
- dinosaur there I'm just going to close
the<00:00:52.149> window

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.880 

the<00:00:57.940> LEDs<00:00:58.480> look<00:00:58.659> a<00:00:58.719> bit<00:00:58.839> funny<00:00:59.079> on<00:00:59.350> camera<00:00:59.769> they

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
the LEDs look a bit funny on camera they

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.229 
the LEDs look a bit funny on camera they
look<00:01:00.039> to<00:01:00.190> be<00:01:00.219> flickering<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.000> they<00:01:01.089> also

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
look to be flickering and they also

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.880 
look to be flickering and they also
quite<00:01:01.719> dim<00:01:02.050> but<00:01:02.320> I<00:01:02.350> think<00:01:02.589> that's<00:01:02.739> the

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
quite dim but I think that's the

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.859 
quite dim but I think that's the
exposure<00:01:03.280> on<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.609> camera<00:01:03.969> and<00:01:04.659> they<00:01:04.809> were

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
exposure on the camera and they were

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.719 
exposure on the camera and they were
quite<00:01:05.080> blue<00:01:05.409> as<00:01:05.560> well<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.890> child<00:01:06.130> it<00:01:06.430> makes<00:01:06.610> a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
quite blue as well the child it makes a

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.950 
quite blue as well the child it makes a
white<00:01:06.909> balance<00:01:07.299> on<00:01:07.479> camera<00:01:09.330> moving<00:01:10.330> on<00:01:10.509> we've

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
white balance on camera moving on we've

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.560 
white balance on camera moving on we've
got<00:01:11.229> how<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.039> connect<00:01:12.430> it<00:01:12.580> now<00:01:12.610> massive<00:01:13.270> amount

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
got how to connect it now massive amount

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.180 
got how to connect it now massive amount
of<00:01:13.600> wires<00:01:13.869> coming<00:01:14.320> out<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.560> this<00:01:14.770> thing<00:01:15.009> which

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
of wires coming out of this thing which

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.820 
of wires coming out of this thing which
I've<00:01:15.399> shortened<00:01:15.880> down<00:01:15.970> put<00:01:16.330> into<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.810> a<00:01:17.020> proper

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
I've shortened down put into it a proper

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.240 
I've shortened down put into it a proper
board

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
board

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.270 
board
it<00:01:19.180> all<00:01:19.390> goes<00:01:19.570> onto<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.020> breadboard<00:01:20.590> and<00:01:20.830> then

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
it all goes onto the breadboard and then

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.990 
it all goes onto the breadboard and then
it<00:01:21.670> goes<00:01:21.880> on<00:01:22.179> to<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.840> Arduino<00:01:23.440> now<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.190> RTC

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
it goes on to the Arduino now the RTC

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.430 
it goes on to the Arduino now the RTC
the<00:01:25.179> real<00:01:25.360> time<00:01:25.569> clock<00:01:25.720> still<00:01:26.050> attached<00:01:26.319> to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
the real time clock still attached to

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.230 
the real time clock still attached to
the<00:01:26.530> breadboard<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:27.220> so<00:01:27.550> are<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.789> resistors

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
the breadboard and so are the resistors

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.130 
the breadboard and so are the resistors
as<00:01:28.420> well

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
as well

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.529 
as well
they're<00:01:29.440> hundred<00:01:29.920> ohm<00:01:30.039> resistors<00:01:30.729> so<00:01:30.940> that's

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
they're hundred ohm resistors so that's

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.680 
they're hundred ohm resistors so that's
black<00:01:32.319> brown<00:01:32.800> brown<00:01:33.520> oh<00:01:33.909> no<00:01:34.179> it's<00:01:34.420> not

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
black brown brown oh no it's not

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.430 
black brown brown oh no it's not
brown<00:01:34.929> black<00:01:35.560> black<00:01:36.039> black<00:01:36.490> brown<00:01:36.970> then<00:01:37.479> you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
brown black black black brown then you

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.109 
brown black black black brown then you
can<00:01:39.069> see<00:01:39.250> them<00:01:39.369> there<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.789> blue

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
can see them there that the blue

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.510 
can see them there that the blue
resistors<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.799> they<00:01:41.920> were<00:01:41.979> all<00:01:42.100> connecting

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
resistors and they were all connecting

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.309 
resistors and they were all connecting
to<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.700> Arduino<00:01:43.119> using<00:01:43.509> an<00:01:43.780> ungodly<00:01:44.140> amount

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
to the Arduino using an ungodly amount

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.680 
to the Arduino using an ungodly amount
of<00:01:44.649> pennies<00:01:45.039> I'm<00:01:45.850> not<00:01:46.030> entirely<00:01:46.299> happy<00:01:46.479> about

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
of pennies I'm not entirely happy about

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.389 
of pennies I'm not entirely happy about
I'd<00:01:47.020> love<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.319> be<00:01:47.440> able<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.649> find<00:01:48.009> out<00:01:48.159> how<00:01:48.340> to

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
I'd love to be able to find out how to

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.100 
I'd love to be able to find out how to
do<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.700> without<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.209> many<00:01:49.420> things<00:01:49.630> I'm<00:01:49.929> sure

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
do it without that many things I'm sure

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.719 
do it without that many things I'm sure
it's<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.350> shift<00:01:50.619> register<00:01:50.830> or<00:01:51.280> something<00:01:51.640> like

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
it's a shift register or something like

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.270 
it's a shift register or something like
that<00:01:51.789> but<00:01:52.180> that's<00:01:52.899> a<00:01:53.110> bit<00:01:53.229> advanced<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.860> me<00:01:54.009> so

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
that but that's a bit advanced to me so

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.480 
that but that's a bit advanced to me so
I<00:01:54.490> don't<00:01:54.640> really<00:01:54.820> know<00:01:55.060> any<00:01:55.240> of<00:01:55.719> that<00:01:55.750> stuff

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
I don't really know any of that stuff

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.830 
I don't really know any of that stuff
let<00:01:57.490> me<00:01:57.579> just<00:01:57.759> grab<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.119> circuit<00:01:58.539> boards

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
let me just grab the circuit boards

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.389 
let me just grab the circuit boards
going<00:01:58.990> on<00:01:59.229> -<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.680> circuit<00:02:06.009> board

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
going on - so this is the circuit board

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.050 
going on - so this is the circuit board
it<00:02:06.700> will<00:02:06.880> be<00:02:07.000> going<00:02:07.180> on<00:02:07.359> -<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:08.549> put<00:02:09.549> a<00:02:09.579> couple<00:02:10.000> of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
it will be going on - I put a couple of

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.860 
it will be going on - I put a couple of
a<00:02:10.299> few<00:02:11.109> resistors<00:02:11.680> on<00:02:12.100> your<00:02:12.310> already<00:02:12.630> insert<00:02:13.630> a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
a few resistors on your already insert a

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.530 
a few resistors on your already insert a
strip<00:02:14.290> prototyping<00:02:15.100> board<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:15.760> down<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
strip prototyping board so down the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.069 
strip prototyping board so down the
racket<00:02:16.840> there<00:02:17.019> strips<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.590> copper<00:02:18.810> but<00:02:19.810> you

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
racket there strips of copper but you

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.099 
racket there strips of copper but you
can<00:02:20.320> cut<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:21.310> break<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.640> connections<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:22.450> I'll

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
can cut to break the connections so I'll

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.270 
can cut to break the connections so I'll
be<00:02:23.260> soldering<00:02:23.530> these<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.220> then

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
be soldering these on and then

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.740 
be soldering these on and then
connecting<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.760> wires<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.480> cutting

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
connecting the wires and cutting

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.479 
connecting the wires and cutting
interpretive<00:02:26.230> connection<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.739> also<00:02:27.130> put<00:02:27.459> the

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
interpretive connection I also put the

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.050 
interpretive connection I also put the
RTC<00:02:28.120> on<00:02:28.299> here<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:30.100> will<00:02:30.220> still<00:02:30.579> make<00:02:30.850> use

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
RTC on here and it will still make use

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.190 
RTC on here and it will still make use
of<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.329> art<00:02:31.450> of<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.690> know<00:02:31.810> because<00:02:32.079> I<00:02:32.140> don't

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
of the art of you know because I don't

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.050 
of the art of you know because I don't
know<00:02:32.470> how<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.650> break<00:02:32.859> that<00:02:33.040> out<00:02:33.070> onto<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.549> step

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
know how to break that out onto a step

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.789 
know how to break that out onto a step
report<00:02:34.510> I'm<00:02:34.810> sure<00:02:35.019> there<00:02:35.200> are<00:02:35.230> ways<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.620> doing

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
report I'm sure there are ways of doing

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.949 
report I'm sure there are ways of doing
it<00:02:36.010> I've<00:02:36.459> seen<00:02:36.519> kits<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.359> you<00:02:37.570> can<00:02:37.720> do<00:02:37.840> it

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
it I've seen kits that you can do it

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.110 
it I've seen kits that you can do it
with<00:02:38.170> but<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.160> don't<00:02:39.400> wanna<00:02:39.670> go<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.820> all<00:02:39.970> that

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
with but I don't wanna go to all that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.849 
with but I don't wanna go to all that
effort<00:02:40.299> and<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.750> also<00:02:40.900> want<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.260> program<00:02:41.560> the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
effort and I also want to program the

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.190 
effort and I also want to program the
Arduino<00:02:42.100> again<00:02:42.609> so<00:02:42.970> it's<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.690> easiest<00:02:43.959> way<00:02:44.140> is

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
Arduino again so it's the easiest way is

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.630 
Arduino again so it's the easiest way is
just<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.470> leave<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.709> on<00:02:44.859> the<00:02:44.980> other<00:02:45.069> we<00:02:45.250> can<00:02:45.489> use

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
just to leave it on the other we can use

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.430 
just to leave it on the other we can use
it<00:02:45.819> for<00:02:45.850> whatever

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
it for whatever

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.710 
it for whatever
in<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.680> future<00:02:47.310> there<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> there<00:02:48.420> are<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.570> few

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
in the future there is a there are a few

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.700 
in the future there is a there are a few
problems<00:02:48.960> with<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.980> RTC<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.820> moment<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
problems with the RTC in the moment the

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.930 
problems with the RTC in the moment the
programming<00:02:52.710> isn't<00:02:53.100> quite<00:02:53.280> working<00:02:53.460> so

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
programming isn't quite working so

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.810 
programming isn't quite working so
sometimes<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:55.440> fact<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.160> twice<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.610> year

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
sometimes in fact is it twice a year

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.780 
sometimes in fact is it twice a year
whenever<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.750> daylight<00:02:58.200> savings<00:02:58.650> time

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
whenever the daylight savings time

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.880 
whenever the daylight savings time
changes<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.360> RTC<00:03:00.990> won't<00:03:01.200> change<00:03:01.470> with<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.770> and

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
changes the RTC won't change with it and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.260 
changes the RTC won't change with it and
I<00:03:01.920> don't<00:03:01.980> know<00:03:02.340> how<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.490> program<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.090> yet<00:03:03.240> I

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
I don't know how to program it yet I

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.420 
I don't know how to program it yet I
haven't<00:03:03.480> thought<00:03:03.690> about<00:03:03.870> properly<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.280> can

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
haven't thought about properly but I can

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.920 
haven't thought about properly but I can
solve<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.790> just<00:03:06.120> by<00:03:06.210> plugging<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.600> back<00:03:06.630> into

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
solve that just by plugging it back into

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.490 
solve that just by plugging it back into
the<00:03:07.140> computer<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:08.540> reloading<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.630> sketch<00:03:09.960> to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
the computer and reloading the sketch to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.770 
the computer and reloading the sketch to
update<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.980> RTC<00:03:11.550> which<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.970> force<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.660> do

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
update the RTC which I force it to do

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.560 
update the RTC which I force it to do
every<00:03:13.020> time<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:14.460> sketch<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.850> uploaded<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.360> it

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
every time the sketch is uploaded to it

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.600 
every time the sketch is uploaded to it
set<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:17.040> upload<00:03:17.370> time<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.330> date<00:03:19.610> so

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
set it to the upload time and date so

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.160 
set it to the upload time and date so
that's<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.970> working<00:03:21.390> that's<00:03:21.570> that's<00:03:21.990> pretty

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
that's it working that's that's pretty

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.740 
that's it working that's that's pretty
much<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.470> all<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.710> need<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.010> do<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.550> transfer<00:03:24.510> all

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
much it all I need to do is transfer all

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.170 
much it all I need to do is transfer all
of<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.900> breadboard<00:03:25.440> onto<00:03:26.400> here<00:03:26.670> which<00:03:27.000> I

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
of that breadboard onto here which I

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.930 
of that breadboard onto here which I
will<00:03:27.330> try<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.630> do<00:03:27.840> soon<00:03:28.170> but<00:03:28.580> it's<00:03:29.580> difficult

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
will try and do soon but it's difficult

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.700 
will try and do soon but it's difficult
to<00:03:30.270> motivate<00:03:30.780> myself<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.200> do<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.530> now<00:03:31.650> the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
to motivate myself to do and now the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.210 
to motivate myself to do and now the
projects<00:03:32.160> almost<00:03:32.430> complete<00:03:33.830> well<00:03:34.830> that's<00:03:35.040> it

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
projects almost complete well that's it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.370 
projects almost complete well that's it
