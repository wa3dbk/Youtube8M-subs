00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
cable goes in in the bottom you get a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.770 
cable goes in in the bottom you get a
nice<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.700> switch<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
nice little switch here on the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
nice little switch here on the
right-hand<00:00:51.930> side<00:00:52.170> which<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.699> see

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
right-hand side which is the you can see

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.000 
right-hand side which is the you can see
that<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> padding<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.739> zero

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
that it's at the padding so you get zero

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.250 
that it's at the padding so you get zero
minus<00:00:56.370> 10<00:00:56.699> decibels<00:00:57.000> now<00:00:57.390> I'll<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.109> minus

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
minus 10 decibels now I'll use the minus

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.959 
minus 10 decibels now I'll use the minus
10<00:00:58.559> decibels<00:00:58.859> mainly<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.640> picks<00:00:59.820> up

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
10 decibels mainly because it picks up

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
10 decibels mainly because it picks up
my<00:01:00.120> computer's<00:01:00.570> noise<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.320> picks<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.859> much

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
my computer's noise it picks up so much

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.399 
my computer's noise it picks up so much
sound<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.480> must<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.719> aware<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
sound that you must be aware of that so

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.469 
sound that you must be aware of that so
minus<00:01:04.650> 10<00:01:04.890> dispel<00:01:05.220> padding<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.760> useful<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.240> me

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
minus 10 dispel padding is useful for me

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.899 
minus 10 dispel padding is useful for me
and<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:07.260> basically<00:01:07.560> changes<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> polar

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
and this basically changes the polar

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.120 
and this basically changes the polar
patterns<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> microphone<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.979> in

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
patterns on a microphone you have it in

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130 
patterns on a microphone you have it in
this<00:01:11.640> mode<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> pretty<00:01:12.960> much

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
this mode then you have to pretty much

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.770 
this mode then you have to pretty much
talk<00:01:13.799> into<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.490> microphone<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.689> have

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
talk into the microphone but if you have

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.780 
talk into the microphone but if you have
in<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.049> mode<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.560> omnidirectional<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.700> you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
in this mode is omnidirectional so you

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.340 
in this mode is omnidirectional so you
can<00:01:17.939> talk<00:01:18.119> around<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.689> anyone<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.200> talk

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
can talk around it anyone can talk

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.270 
can talk around it anyone can talk
around<00:01:19.530> anything<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.890> more<00:01:20.040> than<00:01:20.070> one

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
around anything that more than one

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.880 
around anything that more than one
person<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.330> icon<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.110> pretty<00:01:22.799> much

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
person and this icon here pretty much

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.649 
person and this icon here pretty much
signifies<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.850> an<00:01:24.240> omnidirectional

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
signifies that is an omnidirectional

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.590 
signifies that is an omnidirectional
microphone<00:01:25.470> now<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.580> reason<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:27.030> showed<00:01:27.330> you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
microphone now the reason I showed you

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.469 
microphone now the reason I showed you
the<00:01:27.960> blue<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.650> because<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:30.150> pretty

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the blue here is because it's pretty

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.450 
the blue here is because it's pretty
much<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> same<00:01:30.960> price<00:01:31.200> point<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> studio

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
much the same price point as the studio

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.100 
much the same price point as the studio
as<00:01:32.700> his<00:01:33.000> keys<00:01:33.240> there's<00:01:33.509> something<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> know

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
as his keys there's something to know

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.749 
as his keys there's something to know
now<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.159> looks<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.549> lot<00:01:35.700> more

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
now you can see this looks a lot more

response<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.359> from<00:03:10.390> 40<00:03:10.989> Hertz<00:03:11.109> to<00:03:11.350> 18

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
response is from 40 Hertz to 18

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.949 
response is from 40 Hertz to 18
kilohertz<00:03:11.890> which<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.609> fairly<00:03:12.970> good<00:03:13.180> for<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.420> USB

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
kilohertz which is fairly good for a USB

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.229 
kilohertz which is fairly good for a USB
microphone<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.650> Duncan's<00:03:15.579> voice<00:03:15.760> definitely

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
microphone and Duncan's voice definitely

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.970 
microphone and Duncan's voice definitely
a<00:03:16.269> lot<00:03:16.390> richer<00:03:16.630> it's<00:03:16.959> picking<00:03:17.350> up<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.620> lot<00:03:17.769> more

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
a lot richer it's picking up a lot more

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.920 
a lot richer it's picking up a lot more
of<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.250> middle<00:03:18.579> frequencies<00:03:19.150> where<00:03:19.420> the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
of the middle frequencies where the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.340 
of the middle frequencies where the
voice<00:03:20.109> lies<00:03:20.410> anyway<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:22.200> yeah<00:03:23.200> in

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
voice lies anyway and so yeah in

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.380 
voice lies anyway and so yeah in
cardioid<00:03:23.680> made<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.250> definitely<00:03:24.670> sounds<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.120> lot

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
cardioid made it definitely sounds a lot

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.870 
cardioid made it definitely sounds a lot
richer<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.410> lot<00:03:26.920> more<00:03:27.040> kind<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.370> sparkly<00:03:27.730> in

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
richer and a lot more kind of sparkly in

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.210 
richer and a lot more kind of sparkly in
a<00:03:27.940> way<00:03:28.290> alright<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.590> what<00:03:29.799> I'm<00:03:29.859> going<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.010> do<00:03:30.130> is

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
a way alright so what I'm going to do is

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.710 
a way alright so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:03:30.310> going<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.489> put<00:03:30.579> into<00:03:30.760> mode<00:03:30.910> 3<00:03:31.150> now<00:03:31.390> which

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
I'm going to put into mode 3 now which

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.259 
I'm going to put into mode 3 now which
is<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.400> omnidirectional<00:03:33.400> modes<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.120> should

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
is the omnidirectional modes it should

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.420 
is the omnidirectional modes it should
be<00:03:34.329> in<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.540> now<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.019> don't<00:03:35.890> if<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.070> sound<00:03:36.250> any

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
be in that now and don't if I sound any

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.370 
be in that now and don't if I sound any
different<00:03:36.489> here<00:03:36.910> down<00:03:37.060> what<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.239> think<00:03:37.480> well

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
different here down what you think well

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.080 
different here down what you think well
it's<00:03:39.130> definitely<00:03:39.280> picking<00:03:39.549> up<00:03:39.760> more<00:03:39.910> of<00:03:39.970> the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
it's definitely picking up more of the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.220 
it's definitely picking up more of the
room<00:03:40.359> so<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:42.640> know<00:03:42.730> because<00:03:43.030> of<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.230> relation

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
room so you know because of the relation

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.190 
room so you know because of the relation
of<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.380> actual<00:03:44.799> microphone<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.810> hear<00:03:47.170> a

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
of the actual microphone so you hear a

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.470 
of the actual microphone so you hear a
lot<00:03:47.380> more<00:03:47.440> ambience<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.850> lot<00:03:49.390> more

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
lot more ambience and a lot more

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.330 
lot more ambience and a lot more
reflection<00:03:50.019> from<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.230> room<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:50.890> great<00:03:51.190> for

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
reflection from the room so great for

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.039 
reflection from the room so great for
conferencing<00:03:51.880> not<00:03:52.180> great<00:03:52.600> for<00:03:52.810> up<00:03:53.019> close

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
conferencing not great for up close

it i'm sure don't get any more on that
it's<00:04:10.329> also<00:04:10.480> got<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.780> ax<00:04:10.840> minus<00:04:10.989> 10<00:04:11.319> decibelle

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
it's also got the ax minus 10 decibelle

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.520 
it's also got the ax minus 10 decibelle
pad<00:04:12.069> what<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:12.760> didn't<00:04:13.060> show<00:04:13.209> in<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:13.530> video

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
pad what I didn't show in the video

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.569 
pad what I didn't show in the video
before<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.489> it<00:04:16.030> actually<00:04:16.209> has

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
before is that it actually has

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.089 
before is that it actually has
a<00:04:16.609> blue<00:04:16.939> light<00:04:17.539> on<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:18.019> like<00:04:18.199> a<00:04:18.229> studio<00:04:18.709> lights

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
a blue light on it like a studio lights

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.529 
a blue light on it like a studio lights
so<00:04:19.370> i'll<00:04:19.579> provide<00:04:19.759> that<00:04:19.939> in<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.120> picture<00:04:20.419> which

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
so i'll provide that in a picture which

you should be able to see now and it's

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.770 
you should be able to see now and it's
in<00:04:22.490> its<00:04:22.610> shop<00:04:22.789> well<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.180> all<00:04:23.599> of<00:04:23.720> the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
in its shop well and all of the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.689 
in its shop well and all of the
microphone<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:24.259> i<00:04:24.349> showed<00:04:24.560> you<00:04:24.620> today<00:04:24.830> all

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
microphone so i showed you today all

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.279 
microphone so i showed you today all
position<00:04:26.210> next<00:04:26.449> to<00:04:26.599> each<00:04:26.750> other<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.169> i'm

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
position next to each other and i'm

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.200 
position next to each other and i'm
talking<00:04:27.469> at<00:04:27.770> them<00:04:27.949> so<00:04:28.219> you<00:04:28.580> can<00:04:28.699> sort<00:04:28.819> of<00:04:28.909> feel

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
talking at them so you can sort of feel

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.490 
talking at them so you can sort of feel
a<00:04:29.270> difference<00:04:29.719> so<00:04:29.900> down<00:04:30.110> what<00:04:30.259> you<00:04:30.289> think

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
a difference so down what you think

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.399 
a difference so down what you think
about<00:04:30.530> this<00:04:30.740> one<00:04:31.240> our<00:04:32.240> frequency<00:04:32.659> response<00:04:33.259> on

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:33.409 
about this one our frequency response on

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.980 
about this one our frequency response on
this<00:04:33.500> one<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:33.889> 20<00:04:34.159> Hertz<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.580> 18<00:04:34.879> kilohertz<00:04:35.180> all

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
this one is 20 Hertz to 18 kilohertz all

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.209 
this one is 20 Hertz to 18 kilohertz all
the<00:04:36.199> way<00:04:36.259> you<00:04:36.560> know<00:04:36.650> it<00:04:36.860> pretty<00:04:37.069> much

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.219 
the way you know it pretty much

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.149 
the way you know it pretty much
outperforms<00:04:37.969> the<00:04:38.030> snowball<00:04:38.710> by<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.740> very<00:04:40.069> small

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 
outperforms the snowball by a very small

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.510 
outperforms the snowball by a very small
margin<00:04:40.960> hyper-cardioid<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.830> condenser

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
margin hyper-cardioid and and condenser

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.399 
margin hyper-cardioid and and condenser
so<00:04:43.729> it's<00:04:44.000> going<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.210> be<00:04:44.360> better<00:04:44.599> quality<00:04:45.139> you

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409 
so it's going to be better quality you

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:46.480 
so it's going to be better quality you
can<00:04:45.439> definitely<00:04:45.650> tell<00:04:45.860> straight<00:04:46.189> away<00:04:46.219> it's

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
can definitely tell straight away it's

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.890 
can definitely tell straight away it's
picking<00:04:46.759> up<00:04:46.819> much<00:04:47.120> more<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.509> room<00:04:47.719> even

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
picking up much more of the room even

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.040 
picking up much more of the room even
though<00:04:48.050> it's<00:04:48.289> on<00:04:48.940> mode<00:04:49.940> number<00:04:50.240> one<00:04:50.449> which<00:04:50.900> is

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
though it's on mode number one which is

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.589 
though it's on mode number one which is
just<00:04:51.199> a<00:04:51.319> cardioid<00:04:51.680> setup<00:04:52.210> also<00:04:53.210> as<00:04:53.300> a<00:04:53.389> gold

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
just a cardioid setup also as a gold

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:54.850 
just a cardioid setup also as a gold
diaphragm<00:04:54.050> which<00:04:54.259> is<00:04:54.409> going<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.620> give<00:04:54.740> you

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
diaphragm which is going to give you

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.020 
diaphragm which is going to give you
more<00:04:55.240> sparkly<00:04:56.240> quality<00:04:57.460> alright<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:58.729> this<00:04:58.879> is

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
more sparkly quality alright so this is

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.430 
more sparkly quality alright so this is
in<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.300> single<00:04:59.870> road<00:04:59.990> i'm<00:05:00.110> just<00:05:00.289> going<00:05:00.409> to

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
in the single road i'm just going to

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.159 
in the single road i'm just going to
quickly<00:05:00.560> change<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:01.069> to<00:05:01.190> omnidirectional<00:05:02.169> so

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
quickly change it to omnidirectional so

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.869 
quickly change it to omnidirectional so
this<00:05:03.379> is<00:05:03.409> supposed<00:05:03.889> to<00:05:03.949> be<00:05:04.009> similar<00:05:04.490> i<00:05:04.639> guess

00:05:04.869 --> 00:05:04.879 
this is supposed to be similar i guess

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:06.520 
this is supposed to be similar i guess
to<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.240> blue<00:05:05.539> microphone<00:05:06.020> where<00:05:06.229> you<00:05:06.379> can

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
to the blue microphone where you can

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.409 
to the blue microphone where you can
have<00:05:06.770> more<00:05:07.039> than<00:05:07.099> one<00:05:07.219> person<00:05:07.400> around<00:05:07.879> it<00:05:08.120> I'm

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
have more than one person around it I'm

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:09.490 
have more than one person around it I'm
sure<00:05:08.599> Dan<00:05:08.930> you<00:05:09.050> can<00:05:09.169> give<00:05:09.289> us<00:05:09.379> some<00:05:09.469> more

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
sure Dan you can give us some more

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.980 
sure Dan you can give us some more
information<00:05:09.710> on<00:05:10.009> that<00:05:10.099> one<00:05:10.250> again<00:05:10.719> yeah<00:05:11.719> so

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
information on that one again yeah so

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.899 
information on that one again yeah so
they<00:05:12.770> basically<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.279> polar<00:05:13.490> pattern<00:05:13.759> of<00:05:13.819> the

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
they basically the polar pattern of the

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.159 
they basically the polar pattern of the
mic<00:05:14.060> changes<00:05:14.509> so<00:05:14.719> that<00:05:14.949> wherever<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:17.419> audio

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
mic changes so that wherever the audio

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.649 
mic changes so that wherever the audio
source<00:05:18.469> or<00:05:18.710> Voice<00:05:19.039> is<00:05:19.069> coming<00:05:19.310> from<00:05:19.580> it<00:05:20.479> should

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
source or Voice is coming from it should

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.920 
source or Voice is coming from it should
pick<00:05:20.810> up<00:05:20.870> in<00:05:21.590> a<00:05:21.650> more<00:05:21.860> balanced<00:05:22.279> fashion<00:05:22.930> but

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
pick up in a more balanced fashion but

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.360 
pick up in a more balanced fashion but
straight<00:05:24.169> away<00:05:24.199> you<00:05:24.409> can<00:05:24.650> hear<00:05:24.889> that<00:05:25.099> it's

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
straight away you can hear that it's

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.279 
straight away you can hear that it's
very<00:05:26.360> roomy<00:05:26.870> it<00:05:27.469> would<00:05:27.590> be<00:05:27.650> great<00:05:27.919> for

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
very roomy it would be great for

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.890 
very roomy it would be great for
recording<00:05:30.460> small<00:05:31.460> bands<00:05:31.879> small<00:05:32.360> ensembles<00:05:32.839> of

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
recording small bands small ensembles of

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.390 
recording small bands small ensembles of
acoustic<00:05:33.319> instrument<00:05:33.740> especially<00:05:34.099> piano

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
acoustic instrument especially piano

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.490 
acoustic instrument especially piano
it'd<00:05:34.610> be<00:05:34.729> great<00:05:34.940> for<00:05:34.969> that<00:05:35.150> but<00:05:36.050> it<00:05:36.169> really<00:05:36.379> is

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
it'd be great for that but it really is

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.619 
it'd be great for that but it really is
reem<00:05:36.800> dependent<00:05:37.339> miss<00:05:37.460> mode<00:05:37.699> and<00:05:38.029> if<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.449> have

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:38.629 
reem dependent miss mode and if you have

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:40.809 
reem dependent miss mode and if you have
quite<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:38.870> reflective<00:05:39.409> room<00:05:39.650> and<00:05:39.860> then<00:05:40.639> it's

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
quite a reflective room and then it's

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:41.980 
quite a reflective room and then it's
probably<00:05:41.029> not<00:05:41.180> going<00:05:41.389> to<00:05:41.479> give<00:05:41.629> you<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.810> best

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
probably not going to give you the best

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.820 
probably not going to give you the best
sound<00:05:42.610> alright<00:05:43.610> so<00:05:44.000> that<00:05:44.240> is<00:05:44.389> the<00:05:44.719> sl300<00:05:45.710> i'm

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
probably go for the SL for quality of

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.689 
probably go for the SL for quality of
voice<00:06:04.089> but<00:06:05.089> for<00:06:05.389> things<00:06:06.169> like<00:06:06.699> portability

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
voice but for things like portability

and you know for conferencing and things
like<00:06:10.819> that<00:06:10.879> just<00:06:11.270> because<00:06:12.020> it's<00:06:12.409> not<00:06:12.589> so<00:06:12.800> roomy

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190
