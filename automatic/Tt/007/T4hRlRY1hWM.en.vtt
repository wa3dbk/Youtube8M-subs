00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.389
 accor fleurs a pattern very nice 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.460
 you can stand alone but can also 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.410
 a simple pattern as a background 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.390
 behind it 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.010
 It is a very versatile pattern 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.000
 can shape it with all possible shapes 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.699
 Let's take a look at it 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:37.969
 we start with a kind of star 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:41.300
 no tips in cupid for somehow 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:43.920
 it does not have to look exactly like it does 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.500
 a lot of piping is also in principle 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.879
 no matter 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.469
 so they look for a job 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.579
 maybe not at the beginning 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.760
 outer edge but he here inside and 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.870
 then draw a line 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.390
 this is a bit bent over here 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.810
 and at the end it asks for this form 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.580
 We'll do the same again 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.729
 start at the same place 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.360
 but slowly wider and hay here 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.610
 again and when we did that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.409
 then we close the hook up here 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.259
 so that a band has emerged that 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.880
 do we now again we begin 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.600
 again at the same point down here 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.979
 but now walk in this way 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.979
 bit down this star 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.509
 that we have a second band again 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.299
 and so we keep doing that 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.060
 These tapes are about ours 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.060
 shape around it 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.640
 so now we are here at the end 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:14.660
 I arrived here I continue 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.030
 I'm a bit in the middle 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.470
 started 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:25.400
 it makes it easier than if 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:28.580
 I would start right down here 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.810
 my starting point may now be like this 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.470
 slowly up a bit 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.470
 move 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:42.830
 he walks a bit high and so on 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.080
 our point of view is already up 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.620
 hiked all up here so slowly 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:55.700
 then we get a one rotation 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:58.510
 that is going to be little by little now 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.510
 spiral 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.849
 so now we are here at the end 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.170
 but we have not yet 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.110
 we stop here have still quite 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.239
 large open space the next countries 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.689
 they are just disappearing under the 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.689
 first 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.290
 we always extend our point of view 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.290
 continue 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:38.180
 I do not feel completely confused 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.180
 a the time black 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:46.349
 so now we have the whole countries 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:48.530
 ready and we want now black 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:54.810
 Completion 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:04:01.560
 Just look at the black one 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:03.750
 I can also tape for example 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.530
 I put small beads on it then 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.590
 let it go is also bad 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.689
 I do that every other time or twice 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.480
 I just make the ribbons black what 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:19.320
 also looks very nice what if I 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:23.669
 leave such a small shine here and 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:27.979
 not quite with straight edges 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.979
 but a bit distorted edges 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.180
 so if you have that all the ribbons ready 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.630
 have to have played then actually 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.570
 only shock and we can 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.660
 make here under the bands 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:50.940
 then that looks even more so 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.940
 who think about it 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:01.570
 we can do this again as we do 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.100
 we did that during crises and 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.360
 Although the shadows are really all on 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:11.320
 the same side sit that is again 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.710
 not really realistic but that 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.710
 does not do anything 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.909
 this is accor fleur as you can see 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:28.289
 manacor flyer with all sorts of shapes 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.449
 I draw it here with one 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.069
 Tried Triangle they play 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.599
 Why are you trying? 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.599
 other forms have fun
