00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
another result of late diagnosis so what

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.520 
another result of late diagnosis so what
that<00:01:05.670> meant<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> ground<00:01:06.540> for<00:01:07.140> us<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.439> his

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
that meant on the ground for us as his

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.240 
that meant on the ground for us as his
family<00:01:08.600> was<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.840> he<00:01:10.530> had<00:01:10.560> by<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.860> stage

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
family was that he had by this stage

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.940 
family was that he had by this stage
lost<00:01:11.820> his<00:01:12.180> short-term<00:01:12.540> memory<00:01:12.950> almost

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
lost his short-term memory almost

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.730 
lost his short-term memory almost
entirely<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.090> his<00:01:15.270> brother<00:01:15.540> was<00:01:15.960> repeatedly

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
entirely so his brother was repeatedly

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.749 
entirely so his brother was repeatedly
asked<00:01:17.600> what<00:01:18.600> GCSE<00:01:19.290> choices<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.520> made
