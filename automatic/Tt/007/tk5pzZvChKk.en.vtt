is<00:01:05.939> quite<00:01:06.540> some<00:01:06.930> size<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.860> because<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
is quite some size to it because it's a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.140 
is quite some size to it because it's a
hundred<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.939> five<00:01:09.090> years<00:01:09.420> old

off of this and plain oranges now the
history<00:01:28.189> goes<00:01:29.189> back<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.900> actually<00:01:30.900> in

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
think and then was brought by seedlings

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.370 
think and then was brought by seedlings
and<00:01:38.100> by<00:01:38.250> cuttings<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.810> way<00:01:39.930> over<00:01:40.229> into

the Mediterranean area which still has
quite<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.020> citrus<00:01:43.530> industry<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:44.340> places<00:01:45.090> like

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
quite a citrus industry in places like

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.359 
quite a citrus industry in places like
Sicily<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.759> Cyprus<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.030> Italy<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.369> Egypt

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and all along the Mediterranean there

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.389 
and all along the Mediterranean there
where<00:01:52.710> we've<00:01:52.920> got<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.520> semi-tropical<00:01:54.450> climate

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
where we've got a semi-tropical climate

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.149 
where we've got a semi-tropical climate
which<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.790> great<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.509> citrus<00:01:57.979> some<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
which is great for citrus some of the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.039 
which is great for citrus some of the
tropics<00:01:59.610> like<00:01:59.909> citrus<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.689> different

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
tropics like citrus but different

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.510 
tropics like citrus but different
varieties<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:02.340> cannot<00:02:03.210> grow<00:02:03.540> citrus

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
varieties you cannot grow citrus

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.210 
varieties you cannot grow citrus
commercially<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:06.320> temperate<00:02:07.320> zones<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.979> get

commercially in temperate zones that get
into<00:02:08.780> freezes<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.860> consequently<00:02:11.690> citrus<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.900> a

into freezes so consequently citrus is a

into freezes so consequently citrus is a
winter<00:02:13.230> fruit

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
winter fruit

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.839 
winter fruit
by<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.400> large<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:16.500> have<00:02:16.739> many<00:02:17.430> different

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
by and large and we have many different

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.539 
by and large and we have many different
varieties<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.480> date<00:02:18.690> but<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.920> one<00:02:20.159> was<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
varieties to date but this one was the

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.059 
varieties to date but this one was the
old<00:02:20.819> timing<00:02:21.299> one<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.080> basically<00:02:22.739> where

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
old timing one that is basically where

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.670 
old timing one that is basically where
our<00:02:23.250> history<00:02:23.730> began<00:02:24.120> here<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.780> Florida<00:02:25.260> this

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
our history began here in Florida this
