seen and grown from her experiences

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.359 
seen and grown from her experiences
so<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.840> were<00:01:33.960> very<00:01:33.990> young<00:01:34.380> team<00:01:34.799> starting<00:01:35.280> out

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so we were very young team starting out

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.399 
so we were very young team starting out
so<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.659> makes<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.990> better<00:01:37.170> though

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
so I think that makes it better though

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.660 
so I think that makes it better though
because<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.920> means<00:01:38.039> that<00:01:38.280> by<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> time

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
because that means that by the time

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.580 
because that means that by the time
we're<00:01:38.850> firsties<00:01:39.329> we'll<00:01:39.539> be<00:01:39.689> old<00:01:39.960> veterans<00:01:40.469> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
we're firsties we'll be old veterans you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
we're firsties we'll be old veterans you
know<00:01:40.619> we'll<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.950> showing<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> new<00:01:41.430> pleats<00:01:41.700> how
