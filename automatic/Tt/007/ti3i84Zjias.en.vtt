we<00:00:00.390> are<00:00:00.570> now<00:00:00.810> looking<00:00:01.140> at<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.860> ideas<00:00:02.429> used<00:00:03.060> on

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
we are now looking at the ideas used on

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.289 
we are now looking at the ideas used on
the<00:00:03.510> abacus<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:04.680> order<00:00:05.130> numbers<00:00:05.670> without

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
the abacus to order numbers without

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.549 
the abacus to order numbers without
having<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.319> use<00:00:07.620> an<00:00:07.830> abacus<00:00:08.660> we<00:00:09.660> are<00:00:09.900> going<00:00:10.349> to

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
having to use an abacus we are going to

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.539 
having to use an abacus we are going to
arrange<00:00:10.980> these<00:00:11.400> numbers<00:00:11.940> in<00:00:12.150> ascending<00:00:12.990> order

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
arrange these numbers in ascending order

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.950 
arrange these numbers in ascending order
that<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.969> from<00:00:15.570> smallest<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.560> largest<00:00:17.750> we<00:00:18.750> will

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
that is from smallest to largest we will

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.000 
that is from smallest to largest we will
use<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.500> table<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.400> do<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.869> each<00:00:21.869> spike<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
use a table to do this each spike in the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.150 
use a table to do this each spike in the
abacus<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.820> replaced<00:00:24.720> by<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.260> column<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
abacus is replaced by a column in the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.339 
abacus is replaced by a column in the
table<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> first<00:00:28.050> number<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.769> our<00:00:28.949> list<00:00:29.189> is

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
table the first number in our list is

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.970 
table the first number in our list is
482<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.090> move<00:00:33.420> each<00:00:33.719> digit<00:00:34.230> into<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
482 and we then move each digit into the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.389 
482 and we then move each digit into the
correct<00:00:35.340> column<00:00:37.910> 482<00:00:39.440> we<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.680> now<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:40.920> this

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
correct column 482 we can now do this

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:54.300 
correct column 482 we can now do this
with<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.969> rest<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.780> numbers<00:00:44.750> 368<00:00:47.450> 386<00:00:49.460> 87

444<00:00:55.310> and<00:00:57.340> 428<00:00:58.540> we<00:00:59.540> have<00:00:59.750> now<00:00:59.990> placed<00:01:00.410> all<00:01:00.800> the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
444 and 428 we have now placed all the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.120 
444 and 428 we have now placed all the
numbers<00:01:01.490> in<00:01:01.700> the<00:01:01.910> table<00:01:02.350> we<00:01:03.350> then<00:01:03.590> look<00:01:03.890> at<00:01:04.040> the

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.130 
numbers in the table we then look at the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.270 
numbers in the table we then look at the
largest<00:01:04.760> place<00:01:05.239> value<00:01:05.270> column<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.770> hundreds

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
largest place value column the hundreds

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.890 
largest place value column the hundreds
first<00:01:08.090> as<00:01:08.480> we<00:01:09.130> are<00:01:10.130> arranging<00:01:10.910> in<00:01:11.150> ascending

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
first as we are arranging in ascending

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.070 
first as we are arranging in ascending
order<00:01:12.200> we<00:01:13.010> select<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.760> smallest<00:01:14.540> number

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
order we select the smallest number

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.990 
order we select the smallest number
which<00:01:15.680> in<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.100> case<00:01:16.160> is<00:01:16.700> 0<00:01:18.040> this<00:01:19.040> number<00:01:19.670> then

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
which in this case is 0 this number then

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.999 
which in this case is 0 this number then
moves<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.960> top<00:01:21.370> we<00:01:22.370> can<00:01:22.640> forget<00:01:22.970> about<00:01:23.330> it

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
moves to the top we can forget about it

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.990 
moves to the top we can forget about it
the<00:01:25.009> smallest<00:01:25.550> number<00:01:26.090> now<00:01:26.300> is<00:01:26.600> 3<00:01:27.640> these<00:01:28.640> now

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
the smallest number now is 3 these now

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.830 
the smallest number now is 3 these now
need<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.690> move<00:01:29.869> up

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
need to move up

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.550 
need to move up
for<00:01:32.770> these<00:01:33.039> two<00:01:33.399> numbers<00:01:33.700> let's<00:01:34.600> look<00:01:34.929> at<00:01:35.170> the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
for these two numbers let's look at the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.270 
for these two numbers let's look at the
tens<00:01:35.890> column<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:37.810> can<00:01:38.049> see<00:01:38.409> that<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.740> smaller

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
tens column we can see that the smaller

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.139 
tens column we can see that the smaller
number<00:01:39.969> is<00:01:40.149> six<00:01:41.069> this<00:01:42.069> means<00:01:42.549> that<00:01:42.759> these

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
number is six this means that these

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.309 
number is six this means that these
numbers<00:01:43.780> are<00:01:44.020> already<00:01:44.590> in<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.130> correct<00:01:45.579> order

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
numbers are already in the correct order

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.469 
numbers are already in the correct order
now<00:01:47.319> let's<00:01:47.679> look<00:01:47.950> at<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.340> numbers<00:01:48.789> with<00:01:49.060> four

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
now let's look at the numbers with four

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.859 
now let's look at the numbers with four
in<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.959> hundreds<00:01:50.439> column<00:01:51.030> now<00:01:52.030> let's<00:01:52.390> look<00:01:52.659> at

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
in the hundreds column now let's look at

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.490 
in the hundreds column now let's look at
the<00:01:53.110> tens<00:01:53.469> column<00:01:53.709> for<00:01:54.399> all<00:01:54.670> these<00:01:54.969> numbers<00:01:55.659> if

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
the tens column for all these numbers if

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.919 
the tens column for all these numbers if
we<00:01:56.799> look<00:01:57.009> at<00:01:57.189> these<00:01:57.429> three<00:01:57.759> numbers<00:01:58.060> there

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
we look at these three numbers there

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.020 
we look at these three numbers there
should<00:01:59.229> be<00:01:59.439> in<00:01:59.709> the<00:01:59.890> order<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:01.859> 48<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.880> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
should be in the order to 48 so the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.800 
should be in the order to 48 so the
numbers<00:02:04.509> can<00:02:04.840> be<00:02:04.869> rearranged<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:05.950> give<00:02:06.310> this

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
numbers can be rearranged to give this

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.889 
numbers can be rearranged to give this
we<00:02:07.810> now<00:02:08.079> have<00:02:08.110> all<00:02:08.709> six<00:02:09.340> numbers<00:02:09.720> arranged<00:02:10.720> in

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
we now have all six numbers arranged in

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.300 
we now have all six numbers arranged in
ascending<00:02:11.110> order

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:26.400 

hence<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.660> correct<00:02:18.110> order<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:19.300> 87<00:02:21.160> 368<00:02:23.739> 386

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
hence the correct order is 87 368 386

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:36.520 
hence the correct order is 87 368 386
428<00:02:29.140> 444<00:02:31.840> 482<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:34.760> time<00:02:35.120> we<00:02:35.510> are<00:02:35.720> arranging

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
428 444 482 this time we are arranging

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.750 
428 444 482 this time we are arranging
in<00:02:36.800> descending<00:02:37.610> order<00:02:38.060> or<00:02:38.590> from<00:02:39.590> largest<00:02:40.430> to

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
in descending order or from largest to

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.470 
in descending order or from largest to
smallest<00:02:41.860> once<00:02:42.860> again<00:02:43.099> let's<00:02:43.970> put<00:02:44.300> these

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
smallest once again let's put these

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.410 
smallest once again let's put these
numbers<00:02:45.050> into<00:02:45.349> a<00:02:45.590> table<00:02:47.200> 1001<00:02:48.790> ten<00:02:49.790> thousand

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
numbers into a table 1001 ten thousand

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.509 
numbers into a table 1001 ten thousand
and<00:02:50.600> ten<00:02:51.519> eleven<00:02:52.519> thousand<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.269> one<00:02:56.380> 1111

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
and ten eleven thousand and one 1111

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.509 
and ten eleven thousand and one 1111
thousand<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.700> ten<00:02:59.440> because<00:03:00.440> we<00:03:00.950> are<00:03:01.130> looking

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
thousand and ten because we are looking

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.900 
thousand and ten because we are looking
at<00:03:01.730> the<00:03:01.970> largest<00:03:02.540> number<00:03:02.780> first<00:03:03.620> we<00:03:04.459> look<00:03:04.730> at

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
at the largest number first we look at

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.039 
at the largest number first we look at
the<00:03:05.420> ten<00:03:05.750> thousands<00:03:06.590> column<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.510> we<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.720> see

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
the ten thousands column and we can see

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.789 
the ten thousands column and we can see
the<00:03:09.440> largest<00:03:10.010> number<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.760> one<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:12.260> we<00:03:12.530> select

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
the largest number is one so we select

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.910 
the largest number is one so we select
these<00:03:13.280> first<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.150> put<00:03:14.780> them<00:03:15.019> at<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.290> top<00:03:15.530> of

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
these first and put them at the top of

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.069 
these first and put them at the top of
the<00:03:16.250> table<00:03:18.370> for<00:03:19.370> these<00:03:19.580> numbers<00:03:20.209> we<00:03:20.540> need<00:03:20.810> to

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
the table for these numbers we need to

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.729 
the table for these numbers we need to
look<00:03:21.260> at<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.920> thousands<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.930> numbers<00:03:24.440> with<00:03:24.709> a

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
look at the thousands the numbers with a

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.660 
look at the thousands the numbers with a
one<00:03:25.160> in<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.670> thousands<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.840> largest<00:03:27.670> so

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
one in the thousands of the largest so

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.530 
one in the thousands of the largest so
they<00:03:28.970> need<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.660> move<00:03:29.900> up<00:03:30.489> both<00:03:31.489> have<00:03:31.819> zero<00:03:32.239> in

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
they need to move up both have zero in

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.559 
they need to move up both have zero in
the<00:03:32.780> hundred<00:03:33.230> column<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:34.310> we<00:03:34.489> move<00:03:34.790> on<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.299> the

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
the hundred column so we move on to the

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.460 
the hundred column so we move on to the
tins<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:37.069> largest<00:03:37.489> number<00:03:37.760> this<00:03:38.359> time<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.989> one

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
tins the largest number this time is one

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.750 
tins the largest number this time is one
that<00:03:40.459> number<00:03:41.030> moves<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.870> first<00:03:42.170> position

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
that number moves to the first position

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.090 
that number moves to the first position
we<00:03:43.760> just<00:03:44.120> need<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.660> deal<00:03:44.959> with<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.410> bottom<00:03:45.799> two

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
we just need to deal with the bottom two

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.330 
we just need to deal with the bottom two
numbers<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:47.510> thousands<00:03:48.170> column<00:03:48.380> shows<00:03:48.950> they

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
numbers the thousands column shows they

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.420 
numbers the thousands column shows they
are<00:03:49.519> both<00:03:49.790> one<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:51.290> we<00:03:51.470> move<00:03:51.769> on<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.310> the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
are both one so we move on to the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.430 
are both one so we move on to the
hundreds<00:03:53.560> one<00:03:54.560> is<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:55.280> largest<00:03:56.019> this<00:03:57.019> gives

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
hundreds one is the largest this gives

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.420 
hundreds one is the largest this gives
us<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:58.010> final<00:03:58.370> positions<00:03:59.329> and<00:03:59.799> we<00:04:00.799> list<00:04:01.130> these

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
us the final positions and we list these

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.190 
us the final positions and we list these
in<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.000> order<00:04:02.450> given<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.380> table<00:04:03.700> so<00:04:04.700> in

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
in the order given in the table so in

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.400 
in the order given in the table so in
descending<00:04:06.200> order<00:04:06.650> we<00:04:07.340> have<00:04:07.810> eleven<00:04:08.810> thousand

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
descending order we have eleven thousand

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:18.000 
descending order we have eleven thousand
and<00:04:09.590> ten<00:04:10.329> eleven<00:04:11.329> thousand<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.049> one<00:04:13.389> 10010

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.970 

1101<00:04:19.010> thousand<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:19.820> one
