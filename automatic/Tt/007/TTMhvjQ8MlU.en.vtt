00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
I think our biggest test is becoming a

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.470 
I think our biggest test is becoming a
team<00:00:14.340> for<00:00:14.460> 48<00:00:14.790> minutes<00:00:14.969> playing<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.360> whole

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
team for 48 minutes playing the whole

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.170 
team for 48 minutes playing the whole
48-minute<00:00:16.460> doing<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:17.699> needed<00:00:17.880> doing

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
48-minute doing what we needed doing

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.060 
48-minute doing what we needed doing
executing<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.779> well<00:00:18.930> getting<00:00:19.590> turnovers<00:00:19.800> I

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
executing it well getting turnovers I

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.890

think<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:20.340> all<00:00:20.430> about<00:00:20.640> us<00:00:20.880> at<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.510> point<00:00:21.720> we

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
think it's all about us at this point we

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.840 
think it's all about us at this point we
play<00:00:22.050> them<00:00:22.199> twice<00:00:22.380> already<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.039> both<00:00:23.670> times

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
play them twice already and both times

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
you execute it well you know we can't

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.890

play<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.769> potential<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.789> every<00:00:27.240> team<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.660> we

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
play the potential of every team that we

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.839 
play the potential of every team that we
play<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.230> got<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> put<00:00:28.529> our<00:00:28.560> own<00:00:28.710> potential<00:00:29.189> how

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
know is it's not just a bitch but i

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.650 
know is it's not just a bitch but i
think<00:02:23.340> when<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.760> bitch<00:02:23.910> comes<00:02:24.150> in<00:02:24.329> it<00:02:24.450> gives

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
think when the bitch comes in it gives

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.839 
think when the bitch comes in it gives
it<00:02:24.720> gets<00:02:25.170> good<00:02:25.349> relief<00:02:25.709> for<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.099> stars<00:02:26.640> but

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
it gets good relief for the stars but

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.850 
it gets good relief for the stars but
the<00:02:26.940> stars<00:02:27.180> are<00:02:27.329> doing<00:02:27.569> most<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.410> damage<00:02:28.590> i

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the stars are doing most of the damage i

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.069 
the stars are doing most of the damage i
