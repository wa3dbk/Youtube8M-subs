which<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.470> most<00:02:36.740> of<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.940> powerpoints<00:02:37.940> table

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
which is most of the powerpoints table

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.530 
which is most of the powerpoints table
ok<00:02:40.280> well<00:02:40.490> now<00:02:40.640> right<00:02:40.880> now<00:02:41.030> we're<00:02:41.330> displaying

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
ok well now right now we're displaying

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.180 
ok well now right now we're displaying
this<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> new<00:02:42.470> phone<00:02:42.710> right<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.130> it's

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
this is a new phone right so it's

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.770 
this is a new phone right so it's
running<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.120> actually<00:02:44.330> one<00:02:44.660> of<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
running so this is actually one of the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.440 
running so this is actually one of the
coolest<00:02:45.230> features<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.830> device<00:02:46.180> Luke<00:02:47.180> mode

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
coolest features of the device Luke mode

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.440 
coolest features of the device Luke mode
so<00:02:47.630> what<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.810> was<00:02:47.990> allows<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.680> do<00:02:48.920> is

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
so what this was allows you to do is

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.480 
so what this was allows you to do is
that<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.690> time<00:02:51.110> interval<00:02:51.350> for<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.190> trans

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
that a time interval for the trans

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.880 
that a time interval for the trans
between<00:02:52.850> transitions<00:02:53.450> on<00:02:53.930> its<00:02:54.410> life<00:02:54.680> so

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
between transitions on its life so

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.740 
between transitions on its life so
basically<00:02:55.340> what<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.640> can<00:02:55.760> say<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.270> want

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
basically what you can say it I want

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.600 
basically what you can say it I want
five<00:02:57.020> seconds<00:02:57.470> between<00:02:57.620> slide<00:02:58.010> transitions

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
five seconds between slide transitions

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.720 
five seconds between slide transitions
set<00:02:59.270> its<00:02:59.420> loop<00:02:59.660> mode<00:02:59.870> and<00:03:00.050> walk<00:03:00.230> away<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:01.400> the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
set its loop mode and walk away so the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.250 
set its loop mode and walk away so the
presenter<00:03:02.510> will<00:03:02.600> continue<00:03:02.960> to<00:03:03.080> loop

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
presenter will continue to loop

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.900 
presenter will continue to loop
indefinitely<00:03:03.740> and<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.250> can<00:03:04.400> go<00:03:04.520> off<00:03:04.700> without
