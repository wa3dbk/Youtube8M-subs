00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Hello everyone, I'm glad to welcome you to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.339
 housekeeping channel and 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.210
 Today I want to share with you 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.730
 experience 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.889
 I started waking up early as I did 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.780
 was able to wake up because you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.420
 I was just bombarded with questions after 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.650
 video about how I do it all 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.359
 They overwhelmed me with questions at stake Karen 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.640
 you get up so early and 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.680
 most of my viewers felt 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.529
 that i'm a lark actually i am an owl 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.390
 creepy owl i'm just a hopeless owl and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.900
 Today I will try to tell you about 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.900
 how can you become a morning person if you are fat 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.789
 let's start as always from afar I am all 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.100
 life i didn't wake up before 10 and 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.620
 for example waking up there for work on 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.899
 studying at university for me it was 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.750
 just hard labor just torture you don't 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.940
 imagine to yourself how am i 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.219
 for example hard to get up and early in the morning and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.379
 in general, the big score was not important 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.240
 what time i went to bed that is 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.280
 really late it is absolutely no way 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.320
 influenced the fact that I could not 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.909
 wake up that is and when was 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.830
 some kind of day off when issued 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.799
 some free day I am before ten 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.600
 in general simply did not rise and with 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.860
 over time, I'm just for myself 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.570
 I realized that this is not very rational in 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.060
 first I got a baby of course 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.369
 now sleep at 10 I just don't have 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.960
 possibilities even physical yes it 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.619
 first and secondly over time 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.509
 all the same know how old I am probably not 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.070
 very often it began to repeat but on 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.329
 in fact, that is, time goes by and I 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.399
 I understand that my life goes by and yes 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.229
 I really, really don't want to spend it in 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.140
 dream you can not imagine how much I 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.470
 It motivates early rise of the fact that 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.240
 i stand them after you can laugh and 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.600
 of course but 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.970
 I just realize that I have not so much 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.090
 a lot of time and labor though by and large 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.009
 Of course I am still young but I want to 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.720
 I can't imagine so much 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.789
 how many plans I have and can not imagine 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.670
 imagine how many pans I have and all these 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.239
 ideas all this in my head you know just that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.700
 boils sometimes spills out even i don't 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.440
 I know when all this has time and I would have nothing 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.060
 I wouldn't have time to eat at all 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.569
 I got up as before at 10 am 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.569
 that's why I can advise how 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.239
 you can get up early as I started early 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.790
 wake up i found early wake up sharply then 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.709
 There are usually many as I do before 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.260
 gradually everything earlier before 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.870
 earlier alarm clock puts it all not for 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.810
 me because it's so much worse 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.060
 know as if by a little bit of yourself 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.650
 still let you sleep that is for 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.519
 it's better to cut all ends right there 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.610
 Yes, and now get up as I need I started 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.830
 I got up at 7 am I decided for myself that 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.500
 principle for a housewife is not so 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.660
 early that is i principle with awareness 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.780
 the fact that I get enough sleep all the same I am 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.130
 I can still get up early and I just 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.140
 started to set the alarm for seven in the morning 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.940
 how to make yourself rise in the morning 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.780
 alarm clock how to force yourself not 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.200
 rearrange him than I usually sinned yes 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.040
 that is, there are seven times there at 15 15 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.829
 later end 9 and all I have not had time 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.830
 now when the alarm rings, I understand 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.170
 that i don't 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.670
 u rise just me even eyes not 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.990
 open up I can't even grope 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:37.150
 phone to turn off i just imagine 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:39.490
 I suggest that I am lazy but not loud 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.230
 live like that if I want to change something 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.790
 in life if i want to be better yes if i 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.850
 I want to get better every day 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.750
 then I need to act in this 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.890
 direction to 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.970
 if I have scheduled for today 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.760
 a lot of things will not help me 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.120
 I'll get up late and every day 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.770
 idle yourself inspired that let's come on 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.320
 you have a new life like this 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.540
 interesting and colorful life with all these 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.390
 things that are actually planned 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.670
 then out of them the body is very small then 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.800
 there is more business any such interesting 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.959
 for me that is, planets craze up in 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.840
 In terms of YouTube, I have a huge 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.670
 I understand the number of ideas that I need 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.140
 time to pay this money 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.600
 life I want to make one small 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.030
 reservation can not save time by 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.270
 sleep seems to contradict everything that 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.040
 I just said but probably need to find 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.890
 all the same golden middle if you are not 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.960
 get enough sleep then this is bad this is bad for 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.570
 health and how bad for beauty it is 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.770
 bad for nerves 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.870
 always have to get enough sleep 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.070
 oil basically yes all people have enough 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.740
 of a certain amount 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.770
 time to sleep and when you are in the morning 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.540
 wake up and don't want to get up 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.760
 this state is a little bit more 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.480
 Watson will watch a little lower 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.520
 I'm lying 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.110
 if you have such steel in the morning and you 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.740
 don't want to get up it doesn't mean that you 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.710
 didn't get enough sleep 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.570
 that is all the same on your brain rested 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.030
 all around me now I just need to get together 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.010
 with the forces and at least sit on the bed 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.229
 why don't we want to get up again 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.780
 in the morning because of banal laziness yes that is 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.669
 we have no strength naturally after sleep with us 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.310
 no strength we want to extend this 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.280
 state of bliss as possible 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.140
 more but personally i have a huge 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.120
 a huge-enormous motivator who 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.280
 lets me get up early this morning 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.250
 that I have 3 hours left 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.130
 lifting Veronica I understand that for it 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.070
 time I can make so many interesting 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.420
 attention interesting activities 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.700
 how much can I not do during the day 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.210
 then when she wakes up i am in the morning 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.460
 I edit the video in the morning I have all sorts of ideas there 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.820
 writing down the script writing writing articles 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.290
 that is, I have it in the morning 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:53.100
 performance as it should be necessary 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.750
 rises and I understand that if I am here 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.410
 now I will not get up for example yes when 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.540
 The alarm clock rang then I'm lazy 5. 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.460
 and in general, my life will not move with 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.160
 places nothing in my life be good i 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.950
 every morning i interfere with this i found myself 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.040
 what if I want something new in my 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.930
 life if i want a lot of time if i 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.060
 I want to do what I find interesting 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.150
 I am interested now at the moment in 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.070
 more youtube that is if i 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.080
 I want to do so interesting there 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.000
 don't just have to wake up anyway 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.000
 before my wake up 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.680
 Veronica I do not know this huge 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.480
 motivator again repeat ice and 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.120
 let's summarize me for you 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.010
 just two tips that will help me 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.570
 I hope that will help you get up earlier 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.910
 first you need to realize that life 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.300
 finite and that only in your hands 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.980
 extend my life and second seems to me 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.230
 you need to find interesting and 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.000
 fascinating occupation which will be 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.460
 make you wake up every morning 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.990
 make you get up every morning for 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.480
