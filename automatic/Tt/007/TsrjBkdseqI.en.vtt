00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.130
 trotted all and we are in one in one 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.560
 review of a mod 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.540
 and good if we are in a world 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.849
 extra flat and what is that that is seen 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:30.649
 background not know that is nothing is nothing and 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.960
 good guys we are with a review of 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.740
 a way I hope you like this mode and 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.310
 good as you have 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:42.580
 and it has seen good as you have read in the 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.550
 title we have a new mode and this time 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:50.190
 it's from 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.620
 at the dya stop is to generate creepers and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.079
 you will say and clippers creepers because we are not going 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.210
 to generate a new kripper here what 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.750
 you have, it 's pretty good, really, to look 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750
 how it explodes 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.650
 I do not the truth is pretty new good 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.510
 in truth I was not here in reality not 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.950
 is new to the new network are these 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.700
 that were here okay we have the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:18.080
 stripper we have the fire kripper the dirt 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.850
 clipper the water diver the snow kripper and 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.790
 the cookie kripper that for me this 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.860
 guys is the best I'm surrounded by 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.360
 slides let's kill them it's worth like that and this 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.640
 do not 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.950
 and well, let's generate the first 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.990
 clipper that is the ice 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.670
 here you see it is pretty good 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.619
 texture after good are all the same 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.840
 just as a clip is normal but with 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.140
 different colors we are going to do that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.030
 explode and look what it does 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.030
 here you see it when it explodes generates 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.380
 a kind of 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.590
 of giant square with ice that is 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.020
 made of ice is quite curious 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.770
 now we have the fire we put here and 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.210
 As you can see, it's like I said the texture of 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.800
 the only thing that changes is the color 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.650
 let's try to get him out of here 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.510
 we are going to remove this from you that is left 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.489
 OK 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.870
 but oh and this what it does is 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.660
 next when exploding 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.330
 generate 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.700
 by fire that's why it's called kripper's 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.430
 fire the truth that this 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.300
 The truth is that this mode is very good 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.010
 It has very interesting creepers 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.540
 and they can fly for some series of 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.060
 motorcycles that you have or any 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.980
 good thing now we have the dit the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.280
 clipper say is here you see it is from 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.730
 Color bound dirt from here and give you the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.420
 ball fleet fleet 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.330
 and good as its own name indicates 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.390
 generates a little here see one 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.080
 little alone and good we go with the one of 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.250
 Water 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.440
 bomb 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.970
 good this generates water but calm 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.630
 that this water is not going to stay there as 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.250
 you see disappears completely alone already 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.720
 come they see in the view touch me the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.550
 good moral 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.350
 here we have a snow clipper that like 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.050
 You see the truth that I love this is no 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.050
 I like it is very beautiful and we give it 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.740
 and here you have it generates snow and each one 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.690
 Well, like this, this is called snow 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.360
 clipper generates snow since he 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.980
 called dirt because it generates beat this 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.260
 Llama vara hay script see then generates 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.600
 ice this is called fire taps 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.690
 it generated fire as you have seen and the 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.470
 The water has generated water to see you 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:46.550
 matter let's put more to time set 0 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.190
 so that they leave here outside that you 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.230
 asks that he asks you from here do more for 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.230
 sack let's remove the men 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.540
 and well I said the ice generator 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.569

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.950
