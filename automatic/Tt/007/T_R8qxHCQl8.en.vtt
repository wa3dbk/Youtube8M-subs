00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:38.310 

I<00:00:36.269> think<00:00:37.269> that's<00:00:37.420> gonna<00:00:37.570> boil<00:00:37.809> down<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.050> who

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.590 
I think that's gonna boil down to who
can<00:00:38.350> you<00:00:38.590> vote<00:00:38.829> for<00:00:38.860> and<00:00:39.370> be<00:00:39.670> proud<00:00:40.090> in<00:00:40.510> the
