because that's the only thing that I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.700 
because that's the only thing that I
think<00:02:18.060> other<00:02:18.450> people<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:18.960> my<00:02:18.990> family<00:02:19.260> would<00:02:19.590> go

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.880 
looking for that they couldn't find the
rest<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.720> pretty<00:02:21.810> easy<00:02:22.110> these<00:02:22.320> are<00:02:22.380> like<00:02:22.650> heat

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
rest is pretty easy these are like heat

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.910 
rest is pretty easy these are like heat
socks<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:24.540> know<00:02:24.660> pads<00:02:25.050> for<00:02:25.530> what<00:02:25.800> do<00:02:25.860> you
