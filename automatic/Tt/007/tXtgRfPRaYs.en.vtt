in<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.849> video<00:00:09.150> we'll<00:00:09.450> teach<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.690> how<00:00:09.960> to

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
in this video we'll teach you how to

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.320 
in this video we'll teach you how to
avoid<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.800> rotor<00:00:10.980> using<00:00:11.580> real<00:00:11.759> accident

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
avoid the rotor using real accident

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.240 
avoid the rotor using real accident

the top-left of the screen where do you

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.429 
the top-left of the screen where do you
think<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> turbulence<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.960> slope<00:00:28.230> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
think the turbulence is on the slope is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.189 
think the turbulence is on the slope is
he<00:00:28.529> flying<00:00:28.769> around<00:00:29.720> probably<00:00:30.720> behind<00:00:31.080> the

he flying around probably behind the
trees<00:00:31.529> anything<00:00:32.340> downslope<00:00:33.030> that's<00:00:33.570> an

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
obstacle where do you think the wind

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.290 
obstacle where do you think the wind
will<00:00:36.809> accelerate<00:00:37.940> well<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.090> going<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> be

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
will accelerate well it's going to be

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.410 
will accelerate well it's going to be
worst<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> top<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> ridgeline<00:00:41.270> due<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
worst at the top of the ridgeline due to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.100 
worst at the top of the ridgeline due to
the<00:00:42.540> venturi<00:00:43.020> effect<00:00:44.570> this<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> be

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the venturi effect this is going to be

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.779 
the venturi effect this is going to be
even<00:00:46.230> worse<00:00:46.410> where<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> wind's<00:00:47.430> scooped

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
even worse where the wind's scooped

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.170 
even worse where the wind's scooped
across<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.360> face<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.989> converge<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.850> is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
across the face to converge and that is

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.619 
across the face to converge and that is
the<00:00:51.510> venturi<00:00:51.989> beast<00:00:52.940> there's<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.059> big<00:00:54.300> router

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the venturi beast there's a big router

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.350 
the venturi beast there's a big router
behind<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.500> ridge<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.370> wind<00:00:56.579> returns<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
behind the ridge as the wind returns to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.639 
behind the ridge as the wind returns to
the<00:00:57.449> low-pressure<00:00:57.870> point

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.620 

so<00:01:06.100> as<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.429> can<00:01:06.549> see<00:01:06.700> by<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.909> clouds<00:01:07.299> the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
so as you can see by the clouds the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.779 
so as you can see by the clouds the
winds<00:01:07.929> pretty<00:01:08.170> strong<00:01:08.500> up<00:01:08.649> top<00:01:08.890> it's<00:01:09.490> probably

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
winds pretty strong up top it's probably

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.969 
winds pretty strong up top it's probably
going<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:09.969> increase<00:01:10.390> with<00:01:10.689> a<00:01:11.200> soaring<00:01:11.679> round

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
going to increase with a soaring round

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.980 
going to increase with a soaring round
using<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.820> slope<00:01:13.060> on<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.359> right<00:01:13.509> hand<00:01:13.719> side

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
using the slope on the right hand side

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.749 
using the slope on the right hand side
that's<00:01:14.259> scooping<00:01:14.740> up<00:01:14.859> the<00:01:14.979> wind<00:01:17.340> off<00:01:18.340> an<00:01:18.640> hour

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
that's scooping up the wind off an hour

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.410 
that's scooping up the wind off an hour
later<00:01:18.969> the<00:01:19.210> winds<00:01:19.479> increased<00:01:19.899> and<00:01:21.179> two<00:01:22.179> pilots

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
later the winds increased and two pilots

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.899 
later the winds increased and two pilots
are<00:01:22.689> caught<00:01:22.899> out<00:01:23.140> ones<00:01:23.950> top<00:01:24.280> landing<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:24.850> a

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
are caught out ones top landing in a

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.139 
are caught out ones top landing in a
fairly<00:01:25.270> safe<00:01:25.600> area<00:01:25.959> for<00:01:26.170> landing<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:28.060> other

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
fairly safe area for landing the other

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.880 
fairly safe area for landing the other
one<00:01:28.390> is<00:01:28.840> close<00:01:29.289> to<00:01:29.469> the<00:01:29.590> venturi<00:01:29.950> beast<00:01:31.890> you'll

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
one is close to the venturi beast you'll

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.380 
one is close to the venturi beast you'll
see<00:01:33.069> this<00:01:33.189> pilot<00:01:33.549> on<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.700> right<00:01:33.880> gets<00:01:34.119> dragged

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
see this pilot on the right gets dragged

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.440 
see this pilot on the right gets dragged
quite<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:34.630> long<00:01:34.810> way<00:01:34.990> but<00:01:35.469> it's<00:01:35.649> in<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.859> safe<00:01:36.069> area

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
quite a long way but it's in a safe area

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.940 
quite a long way but it's in a safe area
the<00:01:37.450> other<00:01:37.479> pilot<00:01:37.959> really<00:01:38.259> needs<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.679> get<00:01:38.829> on

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
the other pilot really needs to get on

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.160 
the other pilot really needs to get on
the<00:01:39.069> speed<00:01:39.310> bar<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.640> get<00:01:39.789> out<00:01:39.939> of<00:01:40.060> there<00:01:40.950> as

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
the speed bar and get out of there as

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.660 
the speed bar and get out of there as
you<00:01:44.170> can<00:01:44.319> see<00:01:44.469> by<00:01:44.619> his<00:01:44.649> crown<00:01:45.099> shadow<00:01:45.429> is

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
you can see by his crown shadow is

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:58.770 
you can see by his crown shadow is
actually<00:01:45.789> drifting<00:01:46.360> slack<00:01:46.689> II<00:01:46.719> backwards

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.290 

so<00:01:59.380> at<00:01:59.560> this<00:01:59.680> point<00:01:59.950> he<00:02:00.220> can<00:02:00.430> still<00:02:00.670> drift<00:02:01.030> left

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
so at this point he can still drift left

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.330 
so at this point he can still drift left
and<00:02:01.570> land<00:02:01.750> on<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:01.990> top<00:02:02.260> of<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.650> slope<00:02:02.890> for<00:02:03.310> a

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
and land on the top of the slope for a

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.940 
and land on the top of the slope for a
safe<00:02:03.580> landing<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:05.110> area<00:02:05.410> on<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.560> top<00:02:05.590> is

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
safe landing the area on the top is

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.249 
safe landing the area on the top is
clear<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.520> rotor

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
clear of the rotor

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.520 
clear of the rotor
but<00:02:08.259> unfortunately<00:02:08.850> look<00:02:09.850> where<00:02:10.030> he's<00:02:10.149> going

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
but unfortunately look where he's going

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.080 
but unfortunately look where he's going
he's<00:02:11.530> heading<00:02:11.890> down<00:02:12.070> into<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.490> back<00:02:12.760> Valley

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
he's heading down into that back Valley

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.110 
he's heading down into that back Valley
and<00:02:14.040> his<00:02:15.040> shadows<00:02:15.430> actually<00:02:15.700> quite<00:02:15.880> touched

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and his shadows actually quite touched

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.910 
and his shadows actually quite touched
the<00:02:16.300> ground<00:02:16.540> on<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.720> right<00:02:16.930> they<00:02:17.530> still<00:02:17.830> in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
the ground on the right they still in

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.770 
the ground on the right they still in
clean<00:02:18.130> air<00:02:18.310> flow<00:02:18.520> they's<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.820> about<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.660> get

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
clean air flow they's just about to get

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.990 
clean air flow they's just about to get
into<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.110> rotor<00:02:20.320> area<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.070> then

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
into the rotor area and then

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.360 
into the rotor area and then
unfortunately<00:02:22.630> turns<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.650> fly<00:02:23.860> even<00:02:24.100> further

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
unfortunately turns to fly even further

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.910 
unfortunately turns to fly even further
into<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.820> rotor<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.390> it's<00:02:26.110> got<00:02:26.350> him<00:02:26.470> oh<00:02:27.030> no

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.199 

doesn't<00:02:32.920> matter<00:02:33.160> how<00:02:33.400> experienced<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.030> are

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
doesn't matter how experienced you are

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.630 
doesn't matter how experienced you are
if<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.200> flying<00:02:35.530> into<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:35.860> rotor<00:02:36.220> you're<00:02:36.489> not

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
if you flying into that rotor you're not

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.979 
if you flying into that rotor you're not
going<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:36.910> be<00:02:37.000> able<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.239> control<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.780> pitch

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
going to be able to control that pitch

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.440 
going to be able to control that pitch
now<00:02:38.739> have<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.890> look<00:02:39.010> at<00:02:39.100> which<00:02:39.430> way<00:02:39.700> Carlo<00:02:40.150> flies

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
now have a look at which way Carlo flies

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.990 
now have a look at which way Carlo flies
to<00:02:40.720> get<00:02:40.870> around<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.440> back<00:02:41.650> he's<00:02:42.459> staying<00:02:42.820> on

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
to get around the back he's staying on

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.270 
to get around the back he's staying on
the<00:02:43.120> high<00:02:43.300> ground<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.959> he's<00:02:44.650> avoiding<00:02:44.950> that

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
the high ground and he's avoiding that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.300 
the high ground and he's avoiding that
pit<00:02:45.600> altogether<00:02:46.600> are<00:02:47.410> going<00:02:47.739> around<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.220> the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
pit altogether are going around on the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
high ground the rotor is limited you can

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.910 
high ground the rotor is limited you can
see<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.390> valley<00:02:52.930> where<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.290> pilots<00:02:53.620> crash

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
see that valley where the pilots crash

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.699 
see that valley where the pilots crash
is<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.160> real<00:02:54.430> scoop<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> wind<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.350> going<00:02:56.620> to

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
is a real scoop and the wind is going to

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.270 
is a real scoop and the wind is going to
flow<00:02:57.070> back<00:02:57.400> up<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.730> slope<00:02:57.970> where<00:02:58.630> he<00:02:58.750> is<00:02:59.280> so

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
flow back up the slope where he is so

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.860 
flow back up the slope where he is so
Carlos<00:03:00.610> coming<00:03:00.970> in<00:03:01.060> as<00:03:01.150> close<00:03:01.360> as<00:03:01.390> he<00:03:01.540> can<00:03:01.810> to

Carlos coming in as close as he can to
come<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.590> rescue<00:03:03.100> but<00:03:04.000> obviously<00:03:04.330> he<00:03:04.390> doesn't

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
come and rescue but obviously he doesn't

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.180 
come and rescue but obviously he doesn't
want<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.750> crash<00:03:05.019> so<00:03:05.230> he's<00:03:05.380> staying<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:05.709> out

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
want to crash so he's staying just out

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.850 
want to crash so he's staying just out
of<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.370> rotor<00:03:06.580> area<00:03:07.030> if<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.200> about<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.650> far

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
of the rotor area if you about this far

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.170 
of the rotor area if you about this far
back<00:03:09.070> from<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:10.030> hill<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:11.320> is<00:03:11.530> churned<00:03:11.950> up<00:03:12.180> but

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
back from the hill it is churned up but

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.890 
back from the hill it is churned up but
it's<00:03:13.299> not<00:03:13.360> too<00:03:13.660> bad

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
it's not too bad

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.759 
it's not too bad
pointing<00:03:14.650> into<00:03:14.890> wind<00:03:15.180> legs<00:03:16.180> down<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:17.620> can

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
pointing into wind legs down you can

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.810 
pointing into wind legs down you can
still<00:03:18.010> do<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.220> safe<00:03:18.519> landing

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.950 

unfortunately<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.940> pilot<00:03:25.240> is<00:03:25.360> quite<00:03:25.600> badly

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
unfortunately the pilot is quite badly

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.410 
unfortunately the pilot is quite badly
hurt<00:03:26.430> he's<00:03:27.430> now<00:03:27.610> recovering<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.120> hope

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
hurt he's now recovering so I hope

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.240 
hurt he's now recovering so I hope
that's<00:03:31.690> helped<00:03:32.050> you<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.380> understand<00:03:32.920> where

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
that's helped you to understand where

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.540 
that's helped you to understand where
the<00:03:33.430> rotor<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.210> how<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.390> avoid<00:03:34.870> it

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
the rotor is and how to avoid it

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.010 
the rotor is and how to avoid it
just<00:03:36.550> remember<00:03:36.880> to<00:03:37.000> stay<00:03:37.270> away<00:03:37.300> from<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.840> top

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
just remember to stay away from the top

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.070 
just remember to stay away from the top
of<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.230> ridge<00:03:38.410> lines<00:03:38.710> and<00:03:39.100> avoid<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.360> venturi

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
of the ridge lines and avoid the venturi

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.500 
of the ridge lines and avoid the venturi
