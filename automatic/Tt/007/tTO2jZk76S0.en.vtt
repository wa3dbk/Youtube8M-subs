00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:16.869
 have the merchandise for example here 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.780
 we have a unit if in a hyundai h 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.700
 100 that is the one he sees from the park 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.040
 industrial since this cart is 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.610
 acquired by almost 90 percent of 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.700
 the carpentry industrialists we 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.080
 serves as mobility serves us to 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.149

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.820
 distribute the products that are made 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.270
 It is a very versatile very versatile cart 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.520
 and undoubtedly adequate to the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.210
 requirements of each item and you but 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.460
 it was in front that has been a combi 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.580
 follow only the transportation issue 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.800
 urban like the lady her being viable is 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.450
 trying to make the vehicles here of 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.950
 circulation because they already met their 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.170
 Lifecycle 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.070
 the engine as it is well still you are 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.050
 be a second life is so 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.289
 there is a boom of what are called 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.040
 carts holes to extend food 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.290
 on the beach at a fair or an event that 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.569
 is done where this large influx of 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.999
 public 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.609
 it's a rolling kitchen that solves 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:23.799
 problem the massive consumption of food 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.319
 if you are brought here by an engine 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.569
 rest is in charge if indeed what 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.359
 We design according to the need of 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:34.299
 client now let's see some 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.129
 body that is ready this is one of 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.879
 the best if this is a model 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:43.030
 mitsubishi crankcase that is more tonnage 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:46.310
 is four and a half tons in this 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.910
 case is a provider of 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.250
 soft drinks beer 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.060
 the size is low because it takes quite 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.860
 weight is now another large mass model in 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.890
 this case we have a van 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.810
 small two tons that we 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.930
 solve the problem of moving 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.460
 merchandise for a little margin of 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.250
 customers 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.830
 On the one hand tonnage carries and has the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.020
 category in the USA can not enter 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.820
 to the center of Lima at any time 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.680
 is inside the body that has 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.010
 a schedule restricted to that is a point 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.590
 important because the accesses then 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.540
 are regulated if it is limited by 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.020
 the municipal transport secretariat 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.030
 that can not enter the center of Lima 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.620
 large tonnage trucks sir 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.370

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.480
 point of view and clear that inclusion 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.489
 here in the case of metalworking goes with 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.519

 in a second we have been 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.190
 observing the structure of a combi 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.750
 where in reality it was just the engine and 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.080
 the chassis and here we are now 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.409
 finding that same model ready 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.199

 this alternative to this business 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.690
 so much implosion democracy that 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.780
 we need to create jobs and 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.580
 in reality 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.720

 world level is recognized the peru 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.510
 then this is an alternative for

 bring food to where people are 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.460
 It's the rice ceviche with the beach

 it turns out that it becomes a 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.100
 alternative to generate positions of 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.289
 work and definitely comfortable with a 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:14.460
 solid structure in fact lack the 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:16.480
 painting still the design really is 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.700

 ice cream now who will see even 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.260
 ice cream because the car is like this 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.360
 a vehicle that transits by any 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:38.340
 part but then locate it in the best
