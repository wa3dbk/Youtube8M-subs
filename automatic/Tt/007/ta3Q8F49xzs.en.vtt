that's not what martial arts are about

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.700 
that's not what martial arts are about
so<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:02.219> Mike<00:02:02.579> Tyson<00:02:03.000> came<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.420> fell<00:02:04.259> back

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
so it's if Mike Tyson came up fell back

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.190 
so it's if Mike Tyson came up fell back

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
in the 80s when he was actually

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
in the 80s when he was actually
moderately<00:02:07.200> sane<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:08.069> good<00:02:08.250> condition<00:02:08.360> he

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
moderately sane and in good condition he

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210 
moderately sane and in good condition he
came<00:02:09.539> up<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.810> said<00:02:09.959> hey<00:02:10.530> I'm<00:02:10.679> teaching<00:02:11.099> in

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
I don't believe that that's actually

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.310 
I don't believe that that's actually
correct<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.390> then<00:02:18.480> he<00:02:18.600> beat<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.900> crap<00:02:19.110> out<00:02:19.290> of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
correct and then he beat the crap out of

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.690 
correct and then he beat the crap out of
you<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.740> make<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.220> real

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
no because legitimacy and effectiveness

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.500 
no because legitimacy and effectiveness
or<00:02:23.430> two<00:02:23.520> different<00:02:23.820> things<00:02:23.970> no<00:02:24.150> matter<00:02:24.300> how

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
or two different things no matter how

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.570

effective<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.260> are<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:26.100> doesn't<00:02:26.460> mean<00:02:26.550> that

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
effective you are it doesn't mean that

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.800 
effective you are it doesn't mean that
you're<00:02:26.790> telling<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> truth<00:02:27.150> no<00:02:27.480> matter<00:02:27.510> how

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
you're telling the truth no matter how

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.270 
you're telling the truth no matter how
much<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.320> tell<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> truth<00:02:28.830> doesn't<00:02:29.190> mean

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
much you tell the truth doesn't mean

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.770

that<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:29.580> fight<00:02:29.760> anyone<00:02:30.090> it's

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
that you can fight anyone it's

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.060 
that you can fight anyone it's
completely<00:02:31.470> different<00:02:31.890> animals<00:02:33.080> um<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.980> know

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
completely different animals um you know

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.250 
completely different animals um you know
which<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:35.970> prefer<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.450> up<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.140> if

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
which one you prefer is up to you but if

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.070 
which one you prefer is up to you but if
you're<00:02:37.440> gonna<00:02:37.560> say<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.220> oh<00:02:38.810> it's<00:02:39.810> okay

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
you're gonna say that oh it's okay

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.600 
you're gonna say that oh it's okay
because<00:02:40.260> it's<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.680> most<00:02:40.800> effective<00:02:41.370> thing

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
because it's the most effective thing

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.670 
because it's the most effective thing
then<00:02:42.450> why<00:02:42.600> isn't<00:02:42.900> he<00:02:42.930> selling<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.380> based<00:02:43.560> on

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
then why isn't he selling it based on

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.410 
then why isn't he selling it based on
effectiveness<00:02:44.130> why<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.490> he<00:02:44.730> trying<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.240> make<00:02:45.390> a

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
effectiveness why is he trying to make a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.440 
effectiveness why is he trying to make a
fake<00:02:45.810> history<00:02:46.200> about<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:48.000> theory

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
fake history about it so that theory

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.240 
fake history about it so that theory
doesn't<00:02:48.720> work<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.440> usually<00:02:49.860> if<00:02:49.950> you're<00:02:50.100> making

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
doesn't work so usually if you're making

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.840 
doesn't work so usually if you're making
up<00:02:50.490> a<00:02:50.610> history<00:02:51.030> you're<00:02:51.600> teaching<00:02:51.930> crap

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.150 

another<00:02:56.850> thing<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.240> prove<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.560> he's<00:02:58.830> not

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
another thing is prove that he's not

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.320 
another thing is prove that he's not
telling<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.670> truth

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
telling the truth

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.240 
telling the truth
thank<00:03:01.110> doesn't<00:03:01.470> work<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.740> can't<00:03:01.950> prove<00:03:02.160> a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
thank doesn't work you can't prove a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.950 
thank doesn't work you can't prove a

have no actual argument other than the

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.980 
have no actual argument other than the
fact<00:04:59.889> that<00:04:59.949> you<00:05:00.389> like<00:05:01.389> the<00:05:01.569> person<00:05:01.900> you

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
fact that you like the person you

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.420 
fact that you like the person you
probably<00:05:02.080> believe<00:05:02.500> in<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.710> same<00:05:02.889> God<00:05:02.919> as<00:05:03.280> this

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430

person<00:05:03.819> so<00:05:04.000> that's<00:05:04.240> basically<00:05:04.810> your<00:05:05.020> only

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
person so that's basically your only

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.360 
person so that's basically your only
reason<00:05:05.560> for<00:05:05.880> agreeing<00:05:06.880> with<00:05:07.000> him<00:05:07.180> and<00:05:08.370> it's

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
reason for agreeing with him and it's

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.800 
reason for agreeing with him and it's
just<00:05:09.580> really<00:05:09.759> annoying<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:10.360> you<00:05:10.479> would<00:05:10.599> go

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
actual argument just means that you're

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.760
