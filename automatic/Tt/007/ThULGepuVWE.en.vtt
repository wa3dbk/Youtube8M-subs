in this first clip you can see the
numbering<00:01:20.600> system<00:01:20.840> in<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.100> 4-2-3-1<00:01:22.850> we<00:01:23.210> start

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
numbering system in the 4-2-3-1 we start

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.570 
numbering system in the 4-2-3-1 we start
with<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.630> goalkeeper<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:24.290> number<00:01:24.590> one<00:01:24.830> the
