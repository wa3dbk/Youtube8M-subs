00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819

other<00:01:54.869> attachments<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.890> needs<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.159> seem

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
other attachments and it needs to seem

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.679

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
definitely recommend that and then i'm

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.700 
definitely recommend that and then i'm
using<00:01:59.609> five<00:02:00.000> perks<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.659> class<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:01.439> first

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.620 
using five perks on this class my first
tier<00:02:02.039> is<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> flak<00:02:02.670> jacket<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.240> hardline

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
tier is a flak jacket and hardline

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.349 
tier is a flak jacket and hardline
second<00:02:04.380> tier<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.859> toughness<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.119> I'm<00:02:06.210> not

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
second tier is a toughness so I'm not

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.419 
second tier is a toughness so I'm not
using<00:02:06.600> scavenger<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.439> didn't<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.070> find<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
using scavenger I didn't really find the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.580 
using scavenger I didn't really find the
need<00:02:08.640> into<00:02:09.060> using<00:02:09.420> scavenger<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.079> shotgun

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
need into using scavenger on a shotgun

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.870 
need into using scavenger on a shotgun
class<00:02:10.829> because<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.340> didn't<00:02:11.579> see<00:02:11.700> myself

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
class because it didn't see myself

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.940 
class because it didn't see myself
running<00:02:12.209> out<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.480> ammo<00:02:12.750> anytime<00:02:13.350> soon<00:02:13.709> and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
running out of ammo anytime soon and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.220 
running out of ammo anytime soon and
then<00:02:14.370> my<00:02:14.489> third<00:02:14.519> tier<00:02:14.970> perks<00:02:15.299> are<00:02:15.600> dexterity

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
then my third tier perks are dexterity

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.810 
then my third tier perks are dexterity
and<00:02:16.350> tactical<00:02:16.890> mask<00:02:17.070> I've<00:02:17.400> said<00:02:17.790> this

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
and tactical mask I've said this

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.640 
and tactical mask I've said this
multiple<00:02:18.510> times<00:02:18.570> before<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.230> these<00:02:19.530> are

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
multiple times before but these are

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.620 
multiple times before but these are
probably<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.100> best<00:02:20.459> five<00:02:20.730> perks<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.209> use<00:02:21.420> on

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
probably the best five perks to use on

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.900 
probably the best five perks to use on
any<00:02:22.230> class<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:22.859> you're<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.100> rusher<00:02:23.609> if<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.820> have

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
any class if you're a rusher if you have

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.940 
any class if you're a rusher if you have
the<00:02:24.030> same<00:02:24.209> kind<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.480> playing<00:02:24.720> cell<00:02:24.989> as<00:02:25.170> me<00:02:25.470> the

the same kind of playing cell as me the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.349 
the same kind of playing cell as me the

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
only thing that I would recommend is a

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.479 
only thing that I would recommend is a
switching<00:02:27.930> out<00:02:28.049> toughness<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.890> scavenger

switching out toughness for scavenger

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.190 
switching out toughness for scavenger

I miss and it just helps me out a ton

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.380 
I miss and it just helps me out a ton
and<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.590> gets<00:03:16.709> me<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.130> many<00:03:17.250> kills<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.880> it's

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
and it gets me so many kills and it's

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.390 
and it gets me so many kills and it's
also<00:03:18.569> plus<00:03:18.900> 25<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.740> every<00:03:19.950> kills<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.370> I

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
guess and it goes ham sometimes so it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.020 
guess and it goes ham sometimes so it
can<00:03:22.800> easily<00:03:23.220> build<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.760> get<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.000> your
