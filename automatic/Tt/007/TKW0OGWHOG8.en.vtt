00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
noticed from the beginning of the video

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.270 
noticed from the beginning of the video
but<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:17.320> doesn't<00:02:18.320> work<00:02:18.350> which<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:18.830> why<00:02:19.100> we're

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
but it doesn't work which is why we're

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.940 
but it doesn't work which is why we're
not<00:02:19.310> taping<00:02:19.640> anything<00:02:20.180> up<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.630> no<00:02:21.410> it's<00:02:21.709> not

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
not taping anything up and no it's not

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.520 
not taping anything up and no it's not
because<00:02:22.130> we<00:02:22.850> painted<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.270> before<00:02:23.630> because<00:02:24.290> we

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
because we painted it before because we

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.170 
because we painted it before because we
did<00:02:24.709> tape<00:02:24.950> stuff<00:02:25.250> up<00:02:25.570> but<00:02:26.570> um<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:28.090> think<00:02:29.090> the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
did tape stuff up but um I think the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.720 
did tape stuff up but um I think the
piston<00:02:29.630> got<00:02:29.840> stripped<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:31.340> we're<00:02:31.610> not

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
piston got stripped so we're not

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.520 
piston got stripped so we're not
worrying<00:02:32.120> about<00:02:32.300> typing<00:02:32.780> anything<00:02:33.020> out<00:02:33.320> this

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
worrying about typing anything out this

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.940

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.650 
want to let that dry for about 15
minutes<00:03:10.280> since<00:03:10.580> it's<00:03:10.760> not<00:03:10.910> as<00:03:11.060> fast<00:03:11.239> drawing

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
minutes since it's not as fast drawing

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.300 
minutes since it's not as fast drawing
is<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.340> primer<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:14.890> next<00:03:15.890> we're<00:03:16.070> going<00:03:16.190> to

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
is the primer and next we're going to

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.009 
is the primer and next we're going to
purple<00:03:17.560> now<00:03:18.560> we're<00:03:18.799> doing<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.040> purple<00:03:19.430> and

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019

either cut on the edge but they're

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.229 
either cut on the edge but they're
bigger<00:03:24.470> for<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.250> purple<00:03:25.610> because<00:03:25.910> we're

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
bigger for the purple because we're

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.740
