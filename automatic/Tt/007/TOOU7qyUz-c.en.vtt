to<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.270> why<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.899> mean<00:01:55.320> yeah<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.950> writings<00:01:56.460> good

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
to see why I mean yeah the writings good

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.490 
to see why I mean yeah the writings good
at<00:01:56.909> Stephen<00:01:57.270> King<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.780> was<00:01:57.869> bound<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.320> be

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
at Stephen King so it was bound to be

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.109 
at Stephen King so it was bound to be
good<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.579> seemed<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.880> be<00:01:59.909> too

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
good but there just seemed to be too

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.670 
good but there just seemed to be too
many<00:02:00.329> moments<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> story<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.380> were

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
many moments in the story that were

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.850 
many moments in the story that were
completely<00:02:02.579> redundant<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:04.229> example

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
completely redundant like for example

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.249 
completely redundant like for example
the<00:02:05.009> custody<00:02:05.430> case<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:06.210> don't<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.750> see<00:02:07.049> what

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
the custody case I don't really see what

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.410 
the custody case I don't really see what
that<00:02:07.439> had<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.829> do<00:02:08.009> with<00:02:08.190> anything<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:09.000> took<00:02:09.239> up

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that had to do with anything it took up

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.170 
that had to do with anything it took up
a<00:02:09.539> lot<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.080> book<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.950> didn't<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
a lot of the book and I didn't see the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.040 
a lot of the book and I didn't see the
point<00:02:12.480> in<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
point in it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.960 
point in it

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and the whole haunted house aspect

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.760 
and the whole haunted house aspect
seemed<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.390> just<00:02:15.570> get<00:02:15.750> lumped<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.260> absent

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770

up a bit because in all honesty this

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.780 
up a bit because in all honesty this
book<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.690> boring<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:26.370> feel<00:02:26.640> bad
