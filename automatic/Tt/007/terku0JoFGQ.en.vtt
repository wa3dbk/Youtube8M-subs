00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
water okay and it's probably going to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.479 
water okay and it's probably going to
spill<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> bit<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:42.930> that's<00:00:43.050> okay

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.000 
it up now you can see that it's not
really<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> mix<00:00:54.149> very<00:00:54.449> well<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:58.010> that's

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
really going to mix very well and that's

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.139 
really going to mix very well and that's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.850 
able to use to glue so okay guys so it's
been<00:01:23.850> about<00:01:23.970> 10-15<00:01:24.810> minutes<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.439> wanted<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
been about 10-15 minutes I wanted to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
been about 10-15 minutes I wanted to
pull<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.189> out<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> fridge<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.030> gave<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
pull that out of the fridge I gave it a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.440 
pull that out of the fridge I gave it a
stir<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:30.420> has

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
stir and you can see that it has

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.300 
stir and you can see that it has
completely<00:01:31.049> dissolved<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.159> our

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
completely dissolved and we have our

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.960 
completely dissolved and we have our
glue<00:01:32.549> ready<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.780> our<00:01:34.049> fondant<00:01:34.970> decorations

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
glue ready for our fondant decorations

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.719 
glue ready for our fondant decorations
if<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.140> use<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.680> gum<00:01:37.829> Tex<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.430> will<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
if you use the gum Tex it will be a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.609 
if you use the gum Tex it will be a
little<00:01:38.880> bit<00:01:39.060> clearer<00:01:39.360> than<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.750> method

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
little bit clearer than this method

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.740 
little bit clearer than this method
context<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.579> tylose<00:01:42.030> it'll<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> little<00:01:42.570> bit

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
context but tylose it'll be a little bit

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.710 
context but tylose it'll be a little bit
clearer<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.860> gum<00:01:44.100> Tex<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.180> looks<00:01:45.390> like

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
clearer this is gum Tex so it looks like

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.289 
clearer this is gum Tex so it looks like
it<00:01:45.869> has<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> tint<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.549> but<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.579> do<00:01:47.700> assure<00:01:47.939> you

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
it has a tint to it but I do assure you

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.109 
it has a tint to it but I do assure you
once<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.720> apply<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.100> decorations<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
once you apply it to the decorations and

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.690 
once you apply it to the decorations and
it<00:01:51.270> dries<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.770> will<00:01:52.920> dry<00:01:53.130> completely

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it dries and it will dry completely

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.429 
it dries and it will dry completely
clear<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.570> won't<00:01:54.750> even<00:01:54.869> see<00:01:55.170> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
clear and you won't even see it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.889 
clear and you won't even see it
and<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:56.280> definitely<00:01:56.939> give<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.240> try<00:01:57.479> it

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and so definitely give this a try it

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.020 
and so definitely give this a try it
works<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.590> lot<00:01:58.710> better<00:01:58.770> than<00:01:59.250> using<00:02:01.790> icing<00:02:02.790> or

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
works a lot better than using icing or

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.319 
works a lot better than using icing or
water<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:04.369> your<00:02:05.369> fondant

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
water on your fondant

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.270
