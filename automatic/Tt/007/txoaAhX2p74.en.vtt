00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
but these colors though that they just

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.060 
but these colors though that they just
came<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.080> with<00:00:25.140> or<00:00:25.470> not<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:25.800> don't<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.010> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
came out with or not they don't have a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.290 
came out with or not they don't have a

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
day and come out with yet but it's a

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.429 
day and come out with yet but it's a
rumor<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.630> they'll<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.990> coming<00:00:28.320> out<00:00:28.410> very

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
rumor that they'll be coming out very

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.679 
rumor that they'll be coming out very
relatively<00:00:29.039> soon<00:00:29.369> these<00:00:30.240> colors<00:00:30.480> are

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
relatively soon these colors are

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.920 
relatively soon these colors are
actually<00:00:30.990> really<00:00:31.320> really<00:00:31.439> cool<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.719> the<00:00:33.719> one

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
actually really really cool and the one

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.209 
actually really really cool and the one
that<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.260> best<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> form<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that I like the best is the form of the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
that I like the best is the form of the
far<00:00:35.399> left<00:00:35.670> which<00:00:35.940> obviously<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> matte

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
far left which obviously is the matte

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.549 
far left which obviously is the matte
silver<00:00:37.559> kind<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.100> look<00:00:38.280> thing<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:40.350> these

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
silver kind of look thing and so these

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.889 
silver kind of look thing and so these
are<00:00:40.739> also<00:00:41.730> double<00:00:42.210> something<00:00:42.540> even<00:00:42.750> cooler

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
are also double something even cooler

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.959 
are also double something even cooler
which<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.399> fact<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.640> they're<00:00:44.789> going<00:00:44.910> to

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
which is the fact that they're going to

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.000 
which is the fact that they're going to
be<00:00:45.030> Wireless<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:46.050> people<00:00:46.260> are<00:00:46.440> thinking<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
be Wireless now people are thinking that

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.950 
be Wireless now people are thinking that
sound<00:00:47.399> quality<00:00:47.820> decreases<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:48.539> wireless

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
sound quality decreases with wireless

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.619 
sound quality decreases with wireless
pneus<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.770> not<00:00:49.920> true<00:00:50.180> sound<00:00:51.180> quality

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
pneus and that is not true sound quality

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
pneus and that is not true sound quality
is<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.890> doesn't<00:00:53.190> happen<00:00:53.250> it'll

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is not that it just doesn't happen it'll

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.400 
is not that it just doesn't happen it'll
decrease<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.420> bluetooth<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.110> not<00:00:55.289> with

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
decrease with bluetooth but not with

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010 
decrease with bluetooth but not with
wireless<00:00:55.860> wireless<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> bluetooth<00:00:56.850> Eric<00:00:57.270> are

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
wireless wireless and bluetooth Eric are

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.180 
wireless wireless and bluetooth Eric are
completely<00:00:58.440> different<00:00:58.680> things<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.070> people

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
completely different things and people

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.650 
completely different things and people
are<00:00:59.370> getting<00:00:59.489> them<00:00:59.670> mixed<00:00:59.789> up<00:01:00.030> really<00:01:00.420> really

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
are getting them mixed up really really

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.810 
are getting them mixed up really really
easily<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.070> clarify<00:01:02.219> that

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
easily so I just like to clarify that

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.429 
easily so I just like to clarify that
they<00:01:03.239> probably<00:01:03.480> won't<00:01:03.660> lose<00:01:03.870> any<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.229> sound

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
they probably won't lose any with sound

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.160 
they probably won't lose any with sound
quality<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:04.920> long<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.250> they're<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.400> bluetooth

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
quality as long as they're not bluetooth

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.630 
quality as long as they're not bluetooth
now<00:01:07.170> they're<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> need<00:01:07.920> batteries

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
now they're going to need batteries

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.780 
now they're going to need batteries
which<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.000> another<00:01:09.240> downfall<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.080> them<00:01:10.790> beats

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
which is another downfall of them beats

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.810 
which is another downfall of them beats
in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.390> past<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:12.960> needed<00:01:13.200> batteries

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
in the past have not needed batteries

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.550 
in the past have not needed batteries
but<00:01:14.820> these<00:01:15.450> ones<00:01:15.689> probably<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.380> because

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
but these ones probably will because

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.820 
but these ones probably will because
they<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:16.950> wireless<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:18.409> being<00:01:19.409> wireless

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
they are wireless but being wireless

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.980 
they are wireless but being wireless
headphones<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.400> pretty<00:01:20.850> cool<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.420> I

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
headphones that's pretty cool and I

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.609 
headphones that's pretty cool and I
actually<00:01:22.619> kind<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.130> look<00:01:23.280> forward<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> these

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
actually kind of look forward to these

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.600 
actually kind of look forward to these
obviously<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> sound<00:01:25.950> quality<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.490> going

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
obviously the sound quality is not going

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.730 
obviously the sound quality is not going
to<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.790> great<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.420> our<00:01:27.540> beats<00:01:27.840> but

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
to be that great because I our beats but

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.800 
to be that great because I our beats but
they<00:01:29.220> still<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.180> pretty<00:01:30.509> darn

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
they still are going to be pretty darn

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
I've seen so far and it just really

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.580 
I've seen so far and it just really
makes<00:01:48.119> sense<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> new<00:01:48.899> beats<00:01:49.140> mixers
