 easy simple where we apply 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.320
 directly on the scalp 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.570
 substances that give nutrition to that hair 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.970

 better what is that good secret when 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.950
 patients who have gone through many 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.720

 hair when a patient arrives is 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.110
 important to make an assessment for 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.510
 determine what is the cause of that fall 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.610
 of hair there are causes such as inheritance or 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.620
 as stress as external agents 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.060
 that are slowly weakening the pp 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.470

 determine what is the root of the problem 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.130
 and second determine what is the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.840
 treatment that the patient should follow 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.550

 improvement of results doctor this 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.560
 capillary infiltration procedure 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.290

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.970
 capillary infiltration

 capillary infiltrations can be 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.409
 perform in men and women 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.510
 are feeling that their hair is more 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.870
 weak that is not growing in the way 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.879
 habitual that is lifeless to 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.079
 strengthen it and nurture but it is also 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.629
 indicated in people who are losing 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.870
 your hair and want to recover volume 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.599
 quantity and population but sÃ£ that is to say

 what are the results grow the most the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.629
 Hair stops having hair fall is a 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.500
 combination of the two pretty much 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.629
 after the first infiltration 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.579
 we notice that it stops in a very 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.409
 significant hair quality at 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.269
 after about two or three sessions 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.739
 we started noticing a lot of 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.489
 small hair that starts to appear in 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.799
 the scalp 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.549
 the hair looks healthier looks stronger 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.859
 the patient says that people tell him 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.349
 that the hair looks the more it looks the better it looks 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.450
 prettier you can comb it easier 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.569
 because the hair looks nourished and much more 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.919
 strong and when the whole procedure the 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.810
 capillary infiltration your procedure 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.239
 simple is made with a gun 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.829
 pneumatic by applying directly to the 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.450
 Scalp small portions of 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.650
 substances that provide nutrition 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.540
 follicular 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.640
 more or less is a procedure of about 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.319
 five or ten minutes usually 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.319
 does in the upper portion of the head 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.930
 after applying the substances we put 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.610
 a helmet with a low laser Vido 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.260
 intensity to increase the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.090
 circulation around the follicle and the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.129
 substance is observed much more female doctor 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.450
 capillary infiltration hurts not 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.549
 it really is a very good procedure 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.530
 tolerated we use a gun 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.689
 special pneumatic to apply the 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.370
 substance that gives nutrition to the follicle and 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.720
 this substance mixed with anesthetics 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.030
 and so it is much easier 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.889
 procedure today is with us 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.930

 had very little hair and you can do as 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.740
 three years I also started to see a fall 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.770
 constant hair more than everything when 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.610
 I was brushing then I came 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.400
 to 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.199
