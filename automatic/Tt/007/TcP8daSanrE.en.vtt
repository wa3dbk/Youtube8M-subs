00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
but even in races it seems like in for

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.370 
but even in races it seems like in for
your<00:03:33.860> training<00:03:34.190> races<00:03:34.640> that<00:03:34.790> you've<00:03:34.970> been

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
your training races that you've been

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.870 
your training races that you've been
kind<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.410> going<00:03:36.500> with<00:03:36.710> a<00:03:36.800> plan<00:03:37.100> rookwood

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
kind of going with a plan rookwood

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.960 
kind of going with a plan rookwood
appropriate<00:03:38.470> you've<00:03:39.470> chosen<00:03:39.860> not<00:03:40.100> yeah<00:03:40.520> yeah

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
appropriate you've chosen not yeah yeah

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.590 
appropriate you've chosen not yeah yeah
we<00:03:41.150> might<00:03:41.390> plan<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.020> not<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.910> i<00:03:44.180> think<00:03:44.420> that

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
we might plan is to not and i think that

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.290 
we might plan is to not and i think that
i<00:03:44.840> think<00:03:44.960> that<00:03:45.350> allows<00:03:45.590> me<00:03:45.800> to<00:03:46.240> especially<00:03:47.240> the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
i think that allows me to especially the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.630 
i think that allows me to especially the
harder<00:03:47.540> it's<00:03:47.720> not<00:03:48.140> get<00:03:48.380> caught<00:03:48.650> up<00:03:48.890> in<00:03:49.070> trying

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
harder it's not get caught up in trying

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.800 
harder it's not get caught up in trying
to<00:03:50.860> strategize<00:03:51.860> time<00:03:53.890> I<00:03:55.480> definitely<00:03:56.480> think

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
to strategize time I definitely think

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.370 
to strategize time I definitely think
the<00:03:56.990> best<00:03:57.260> time<00:03:57.380> ever

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
the best time ever

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.820 
the best time ever
that's<00:03:58.680> where<00:03:59.690> my<00:04:00.690> 50<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.410> haven't<00:04:01.740> even

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.310 
evening so that's definitely my my
approach<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:22.170> do<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.320> have<00:04:22.410> any<00:04:22.680> sort<00:04:23.100> of<00:04:24.320> you

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
approach so do you have any sort of you

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.840 
approach so do you have any sort of you
know<00:04:25.350> strategy<00:04:26.070> but<00:04:26.310> are<00:04:26.430> you're<00:04:26.520> going<00:04:26.790> to

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
know strategy but are you're going to

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.050 
know strategy but are you're going to
try<00:04:26.970> to<00:04:27.000> hang<00:04:27.480> sort<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.960> close<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.560> runs<00:04:29.280> or

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
try to hang sort of close to the runs or

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.980 
try to hang sort of close to the runs or
are<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.330> just<00:04:30.420> gonna<00:04:30.540> run<00:04:30.720> your<00:04:30.870> own<00:04:30.900> race

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
are you just gonna run your own race

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.050 
are you just gonna run your own race
completely<00:04:31.740> mostly<00:04:32.250> try<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.550> run<00:04:32.700> my<00:04:32.820> race<00:04:33.000> and

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
completely mostly try to run my race and

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.850 
completely mostly try to run my race and
hanging<00:04:33.780> there<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.050> front<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.380> something<00:04:34.740> I

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
hanging there the front is something I

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.750 
hanging there the front is something I
usually<00:04:35.850> like<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.450> do<00:04:36.780> but<00:04:37.400> it's<00:04:38.400> gonna<00:04:38.580> depend

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
usually like to do but it's gonna depend

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.850 
usually like to do but it's gonna depend
entirely<00:04:39.210> on<00:04:39.450> the<00:04:39.630> rest<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.020> field<00:04:40.230> you

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
entirely on the rest of the field you

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.800 
entirely on the rest of the field you
know<00:04:40.980> if<00:04:41.130> somebody<00:04:41.340> takes<00:04:41.640> off<00:04:41.940> just<00:04:44.810> it's

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
know if somebody takes off just it's

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.510 
know if somebody takes off just it's
just<00:04:45.840> pushing<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.410> pace<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:46.980> point<00:04:47.310> that's

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
just pushing the pace to a point that's

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.940 
just pushing the pace to a point that's
not<00:04:47.850> it's<00:04:48.480> obviously<00:04:48.930> not<00:04:48.990> sustainable<00:04:49.710> I'm

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
not it's obviously not sustainable I'm

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.290 
not it's obviously not sustainable I'm
certainly<00:04:50.280> not<00:04:50.400> going<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:50.640> try<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.850> move<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.150> on

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
certainly not going to try to move it on

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.240 
certainly not going to try to move it on
