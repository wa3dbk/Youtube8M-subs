pretty thick layer here and at this

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.440 
pretty thick layer here and at this
point<00:01:14.799> if<00:01:15.040> all<00:01:15.369> we<00:01:15.549> wanted<00:01:15.759> to<00:01:15.909> do<00:01:16.060> was<00:01:16.270> add

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
point if all we wanted to do was add

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.139 
point if all we wanted to do was add
more<00:01:16.689> food<00:01:16.930> we<00:01:17.170> could<00:01:17.380> just<00:01:17.560> add<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.979> food<00:01:18.189> and

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
more food we could just add the food and

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.469 
more food we could just add the food and
put<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.600> top<00:01:19.780> back<00:01:19.810> on<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.229> we<00:01:20.409> be<00:01:20.560> done<00:01:20.830> but<00:01:21.700> I

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
put the top back on and we be done but I

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.649 
put the top back on and we be done but I
want<00:01:22.810> to<00:01:22.960> demonstrate<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:24.220> main<00:01:24.479> feature<00:01:25.479> of

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
want to demonstrate the main feature of

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.889 
want to demonstrate the main feature of
this<00:01:25.930> ez<00:01:26.920> roll<00:01:27.189> system<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:27.820> how<00:01:27.970> easily<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.869> is

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
this ez roll system is how easily it is

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.520 
this ez roll system is how easily it is
to<00:01:29.100> collect<00:01:30.100> or<00:01:30.340> harvest<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:31.750> worm<00:01:31.960> compost

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
to collect or harvest the worm compost

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.279 
to collect or harvest the worm compost
on<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.830> bottom<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:34.149> that's<00:01:34.840> what<00:01:34.990> we're<00:01:35.140> going

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
on the bottom so that's what we're going

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.330 
on the bottom so that's what we're going
to<00:01:35.350> do<00:01:35.470> right<00:01:35.649> now<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.890> we're<00:01:38.890> going<00:01:39.039> to<00:01:39.130> take

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
to do right now so we're going to take

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.410 
to do right now so we're going to take
these<00:01:39.659> lifts<00:01:40.659> these<00:01:40.780> rods<00:01:41.670> take<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.880> top<00:01:43.119> and

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
these lifts these rods take the top and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.859 
these lifts these rods take the top and
it's<00:01:43.929> going<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:45.960> slide<00:01:46.960> down<00:01:46.990> inside<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.970> rest

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
it's going to slide down inside and rest

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.190 
it's going to slide down inside and rest
right<00:01:50.470> on<00:01:50.619> top<00:01:51.539> of<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:53.229> worm<00:01:53.830> bit<00:01:55.020> then<00:01:56.020> we're

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
right on top of the worm bit then we're

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.580 
right on top of the worm bit then we're
going<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.380> take<00:01:56.560> our<00:01:56.799> just<00:01:57.670> very<00:01:58.420> simply<00:01:59.140> slide

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
going to take our just very simply slide

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.139 
going to take our just very simply slide
them<00:01:59.799> back<00:01:59.860> through<00:02:01.799> walking<00:02:02.799> down<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.909> top

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
them back through walking down the top

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:11.580 
them back through walking down the top
that<00:02:04.360> we<00:02:04.509> just<00:02:04.750> removed<00:02:08.880> then<00:02:10.170> we're<00:02:11.170> simply

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
that we just removed then we're simply

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.820 
that we just removed then we're simply
going<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.150> proceed<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:13.450> next<00:02:13.480> step

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.740 

and<00:02:19.280> we're<00:02:19.430> going<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.640> take<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:20.120> spin<00:02:20.540> and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
and we're going to take this spin and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.500 
and we're going to take this spin and
we're<00:02:20.900> just<00:02:21.020> going<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.410> roll<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.370> over<00:02:22.580> until

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
we're just going to roll it over until

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.390 
we're just going to roll it over until
it<00:02:24.470> rests<00:02:24.950> on<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.310> top<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:27.290> now<00:02:27.770> we're<00:02:28.040> simply

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
it rests on the top and now we're simply

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.660 
it rests on the top and now we're simply
going<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.970> remove<00:02:29.690> four<00:02:30.080> wing<00:02:30.560> nuts<00:02:30.920> from<00:02:31.400> what

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
going to remove four wing nuts from what

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.710 
going to remove four wing nuts from what
was<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.240> bottom

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.650 

you<00:02:38.170> can<00:02:38.380> see<00:02:38.560> we<00:02:38.770> have<00:02:38.950> four<00:02:39.250> holes<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:39.940> the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
you can see we have four holes in the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.580 
you can see we have four holes in the
bottom<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:42.450> worm<00:02:43.450> bin<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.020> this<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.200> for

down<00:02:53.770> I<00:02:54.160> don't<00:02:54.610> have<00:02:54.820> shown<00:02:55.120> here<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.420> pan<00:02:55.780> that

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
down I don't have shown here a pan that

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.210 
down I don't have shown here a pan that
I've<00:02:56.680> used<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.810> in<00:02:58.810> order<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.290> capture<00:02:59.860> that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
I've used to in order to capture that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:18.870 
I've used to in order to capture that
but<00:03:00.550> you<00:03:01.270> can<00:03:14.880> compost<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.720> case<00:03:17.880> several

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
but you can compost this case several

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:38.460 
but you can compost this case several
inches<00:03:19.180> of<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:37.570> doesn't<00:03:37.930> take<00:03:38.050> much<00:03:38.260> of

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
inches of it it doesn't take much of

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.530 
inches of it it doesn't take much of
this<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.890> goes<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.160> long<00:03:39.370> way<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.760> fertilize<00:03:40.360> our

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
this it goes a long way to fertilize our

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.790 
this it goes a long way to fertilize our
plants<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:42.190> so<00:03:42.660> if<00:03:43.660> you<00:03:43.870> want<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.140> store<00:03:44.560> some

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
plants and so if you want to store some

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.280 
plants and so if you want to store some
of<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.100> you<00:03:45.220> can<00:03:45.430> shovel<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.209> into<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.600> ziplock

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
of it you can shovel it into a ziplock

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.979 
of it you can shovel it into a ziplock
bag<00:03:47.560> or<00:03:48.160> if<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.000> want<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.239> take<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.450> lot<00:03:49.720> of<00:03:49.750> it

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
bag or if you want to take a lot of it

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.810 
bag or if you want to take a lot of it
out<00:03:50.110> you<00:03:50.980> could<00:03:51.130> use<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.340> bucket<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.720> just<00:03:53.820> go

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
out you could use a bucket and just go

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.720 
out you could use a bucket and just go
to<00:03:54.880> town<00:03:55.920> remove<00:03:56.920> as<00:03:57.040> much<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.489> as<00:03:57.550> you

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
to town remove as much of this as you

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.800 
to town remove as much of this as you
want<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.660> as<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:58.959> dig<00:03:59.170> down<00:04:00.209> I'm<00:04:01.209> not<00:04:01.480> hitting

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
want and as I dig down I'm not hitting

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.660 
want and as I dig down I'm not hitting
any<00:04:01.959> worms<00:04:02.260> here<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.890> that's<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.220> problem<00:04:03.640> that

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
any worms here and that's a problem that

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.900 
any worms here and that's a problem that
you<00:04:03.940> have<00:04:04.090> with<00:04:04.120> traditional<00:04:05.910> stackable

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
you have with traditional stackable

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.660 
you have with traditional stackable
systems<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.510> all<00:04:07.660> this<00:04:07.870> it's<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:09.160> trying<00:04:09.549> to

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
systems and all this it's is trying to

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.430 
systems and all this it's is trying to
get<00:04:09.790> rid<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.209> worms<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.810> separate<00:04:11.260> those

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
get rid of the worms and separate those

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.240 
get rid of the worms and separate those
from<00:04:11.769> your

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
from your

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.890 
from your
compost<00:04:12.730> can<00:04:12.940> be<00:04:13.000> quite<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.360> hassle<00:04:15.720> if<00:04:16.720> you

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
compost can be quite a hassle if you

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.099 
compost can be quite a hassle if you
should<00:04:17.109> run<00:04:17.290> into<00:04:17.500> worms<00:04:17.709> from<00:04:17.859> this<00:04:18.100> system

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
should run into worms from this system

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.569 
should run into worms from this system
all<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.260> do<00:04:20.410> is<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:20.590> leave<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.920> top<00:04:21.130> off<00:04:21.400> for

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
all you do is you leave the top off for

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.270 
all you do is you leave the top off for
a<00:04:21.640> little<00:04:21.760> bit<00:04:21.970> longer<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:23.650> worms<00:04:24.100> will

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
a little bit longer and the worms will

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.400 
a little bit longer and the worms will
go<00:04:24.430> deeper<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.210> can<00:04:25.390> do<00:04:25.720> it<00:04:25.870> in<00:04:25.990> cycles

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
go deeper and you can do it in cycles

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.720 
go deeper and you can do it in cycles
like<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:29.220> now<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.280> we've<00:04:30.520> demonstrated

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
like that so now that we've demonstrated

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:48.860 
like that so now that we've demonstrated
how<00:04:31.210> easily<00:04:31.540> it<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:31.870> to

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.500 

but<00:04:49.410> our<00:04:49.560> for<00:04:50.160> wingnuts<00:04:50.639> back<00:04:50.970> in<00:04:51.210> thought

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
but our for wingnuts back in thought

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.280 
but our for wingnuts back in thought
they<00:04:52.470> don't<00:04:52.650> have<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:52.889> be<00:04:53.010> real<00:04:53.250> tight<00:04:54.169> if<00:04:55.169> you

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
they don't have to be real tight if you

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.170 
they don't have to be real tight if you
leave<00:04:55.470> them<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.740> little<00:04:55.980> bit<00:04:56.100> loose<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.940> allows

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
leave them a little bit loose it allows

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.530 
leave them a little bit loose it allows
a<00:04:57.210> little<00:04:57.510> bit<00:04:57.690> more<00:04:57.870> airflow<00:04:58.139> on<00:04:58.680> me<00:04:59.389> which<00:05:00.389> is

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
a little bit more airflow on me which is

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.010 
a little bit more airflow on me which is
what<00:05:00.720> we<00:05:00.900> want<00:05:01.169> because<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.620> worms<00:05:02.870> meet<00:05:03.870> all

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
what we want because the worms meet all

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.980 
what we want because the worms meet all
the<00:05:04.169> oxygen<00:05:04.650> they<00:05:04.800> can<00:05:04.830> get<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.780> you'll

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
the oxygen they can get and you'll

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.300 
the oxygen they can get and you'll
notice<00:05:08.150> that<00:05:09.150> I've<00:05:09.449> got<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:10.710> can't<00:05:10.979> see<00:05:11.190> them

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
notice that I've got you can't see them

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.969 
notice that I've got you can't see them
here<00:05:11.520> but<00:05:11.639> I<00:05:11.760> have<00:05:11.910> holes<00:05:12.180> drilled<00:05:12.660> in<00:05:13.500> the

function<00:05:22.320> has<00:05:22.440> air<00:05:22.620> holes<00:05:26.030> now<00:05:27.030> we<00:05:27.180> simply

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
function has air holes now we simply

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:39.280 
function has air holes now we simply
roll<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.169> back<00:05:28.380> in<00:05:28.410> place

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:45.890 

pull<00:05:39.770> our<00:05:39.890> rods<00:05:40.130> back<00:05:40.430> out

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900

except the top backboard there you go

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.290

that's<00:05:49.500> how<00:05:49.620> easy<00:05:49.770> it<00:05:50.160> is<00:05:50.370> to<00:05:50.610> use<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:51.060> easy

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
that's how easy it is to use the easy

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.230 
that's how easy it is to use the easy
