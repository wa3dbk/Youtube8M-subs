00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.180
 Terms and Conditions: I can not guarantee that you do not know all of these things. I mean, how am I going to have a chance to know? 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.940
 10 things you do not know about: 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.500
 The chicken! 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:29.780
 The chickens are so small that they can fit into a hole between a wall and an iron fence or a glass panel. 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:39.600
 This is useful when you close them for torture or for their eggs. 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:48.340
 They are also small enough to fit in a kettle. 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:58.760
 You can actually close them inside the bowl by pushing another block above. 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:13.260
 Unfortunately, this does not work with hops, they simply fall through it or climb up. 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.880
 At first, all the chickens were male (cocks) ... 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:40.460
 Night said he nevertheless always lay eggs. 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.140
 Later he says that genders do not exist in Minecraft, which seems to be true. 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.600
 Chickens are the dumbest animals in Minecraft ... 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:15.520
 This can be proven if we look at the head of the chicken that can be done because the chickens do not have a texture on the lower part of the head. 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.740
 Throwing an egg has no more than 1/8 chance of chickens. 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:38.680
 One egg has a chance 1/256 to create 4 chickens! 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:50.760
 The beating of animals or players with eggs does not take any blood, but it makes them red as it would if they were taking them. 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:05.000
 In creation you can create something that is often called "chicken bomb". 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:16.360
 This is done by creating a huge number of chickens on just one block high in the sky. 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.920
 (here is some error and repeat the same text) 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.100
 ALL LIFE LAST 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.860
 TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.620
 May 7, 2013 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.780
 Home Sweet Home 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.160
 The chickens are stuck.
