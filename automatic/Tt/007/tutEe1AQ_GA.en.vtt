00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello very good as more all kids 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.549
 here is because commented on a gameplay 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.480
 more than white because everything is a game 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.519
 of more than 100 casualties duel too 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.710
 fast terrestrial warfare in the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.139
 raid map that when with the p of w 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.460
 muffler and quick charger and that's 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.050
 a very very good game that they are for 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.220
 that they are more than 100 went down like this 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.380
 I could have got enough more 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.570
 but well you know that not always everything 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.640
 I get it perfect yet I have to be 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.039
 happy about the result because finally 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.779
 I was carrying more than 100 casualties, I think 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.700
 which are four or five times or six times 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.530
 I know there have been many times and that's 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.910
 I'm really happy because I do not 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.500
 everyone can take out games of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.719
 more than 100 casualties and less in these modes 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.790
 of game so nothing very satisfied and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.250
 good of low gusts I'm with the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.680
 sneaky helicopter the versatile swarm 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.140
 and well this decided that in this in 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.940
 this map I put myself to these gusts because 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.469
 well when I take out the dogs and the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.699
 swarm in case he had the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.079
 dog without hunger 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.180
 apart from the ubr orbital seat that is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.770
 impepinable essential mind then 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.359
 fixed to fixed landlines here at the end no longer 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.739
 I could do so much I stayed super close 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.240
 of my first wicket helicopter but 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.399
 good has been a good exciting start 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.439
 but the swarm made at the time then 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:11.610
 Of course, when I throw them out, I, Alava, I have 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.799
 done at the same time because it does not look like 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 while those outside it 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.299
 They hide in buildings by my dogs 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.610
 they are loaded and so quickly I 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.220
 I concentrate not on our and keeping my 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.539
 low streak but simply 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.280
 concentrate or taking advantage of what you are 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.289
 orbit the rest of the time that I have left 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.640
 then take it to go back to 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.220
 build my other new gusts of 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.390
 low but good I decided to take 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.700
 the buts and the sneaky helicopter 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.979
 because the swarm alone is very 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.869
 very good on this map and the helicopter 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.750
 fort wayne to the noble tableware and the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.310
 sneaky helicopter you will also see it 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.080
 that kills a lot the good thing is that it does not 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.690
 Many people usually load it, I see 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.880
 lately few people who use the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.409
 rocket launcher to shoot it down and I think 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.100
 that every stealth helicopter you can 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.539
 Finish perfectly between 6 and 12 casualties 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.909
 that is, you can get many losses the 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.130
 true and that's why I think it's a good 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.049
 streak also in addition to that while 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.640
 I'm going for it by the swarm 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.619
 because my stealth helicopter can go 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.090
 taking their losses and also not 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.960
 they interfere not then while I'm 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.730
 taking me out one I can do 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.110
 Well, look here, I just got the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.550
 name of miracle what I say 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.050
 while I'm taking out the swarm 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.880
 I can also throw perfectly at the 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.950
 once the stealth helicopter so the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.050
 truth is that it is a very very combination 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.670
 good and I do not risk myself to the best 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.230
 get the universal and not reach the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.790
 swarm dogs because directly 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.370
 the sneaky helicopter gets a lot 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.780
 before and well here I want to save 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.770
 the swarm because there is very little left 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.290
 the best I knew was to be expected 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.330
 the next to the second time of the 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.040
 second round of this game I do not 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.480
 I wanted to comment simply a little thing 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.270
 Well, I 'm not going to go 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.960
 vacation I 'm going this Wednesday for the 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.240
 night and I'm going back on Monday for the 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.400
 late surely late night I go 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.460
 good girlfriend marine d'or ya portaventura 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.050
 with friends so anyway 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.750
 not what you want to say is that no 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.880
 during this time I will not let you 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.950
 without videos but I will be uploading 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.560
 several videos surely this video will 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.330
 come up on Wednesday the day I leave 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.730
 that I have left them already programmed this and 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.870
 two more so that they climb along 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.040
 this time that I go on vacation 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.230
 so good not to lose do not lose the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.640
 rhythm and now that I have the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.020
 last exam that I will have finished 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.720
 this Tuesday for when you will already have 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.440
 listened to this video well I've 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.000
 listened to and seen already I'll be ready 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.620
 for some good summer it was 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.510
 very much you want to start it because 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.120
 it has finally relieved me of a lot 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.650
 of work and logically so I'm going to 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.170
 bring a lot of content if it's not 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.940
 daily because it is almost daily 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.830
 the truth last management very excited 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.340
 they will have this streak again and this 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.660
 dynamic must continue uploading videos 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.239
 continuously good continuously in 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.770
 youtube and it's but good as long as 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.349
 receive is with a very good response 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.670
 that I know that you always give me and with a 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.959
 I like that it's going well because I'm glad 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.380
 a lot that I like a click that does not 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.030
 it's nothing and it's not really that we do not 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.530
 it bothers to give likes and those things because it is 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.300
 a jiffy that is if mind is a favor 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.980
 but thank you very much to all those who 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.709
 you do and I hope that this kind of 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.120
 games you enjoy them and not good 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.940
 we talk a little about what things I have 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.320
 thought to make the black os good more 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.389
 that white is the call of duty always goes 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.220
 to be my main goal because that 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.440
 it's my call of duty channel but 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.620
 lately I also find that 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.240
 I enjoy more by uploading likes or blogs 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.479
 or things like that use what I do 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.510
 maybe this for example are gameplays 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.370
 fairly serious because I put a 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.860
 gameplay or not usually all good 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.020
 games or very good games and I 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.419
 I set before talking about the game and 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.250
 details opposite as I want 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.540
 mention but I also like to do 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.330
 well this because apart from what 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.790
 I do not find them fun for me 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.580
 for my taste I like you can do me 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.580
 I'm going to do half a game 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:02.240
 live comments or like are blogs 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.000
 I'm here with the subtraction a pizza has 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.580
 come luxury but I like to do 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.920
 those funniest things funniest 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.510
 well I know that many people who 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.160
 they are in my channel they are by call of 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.600
 duty because they involve serious plans of 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.420
 those who reported and such that that too 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.370
 a main base of my channel doing 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.350
 informative videos of how we can 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.060
 play to improve playing court and those 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.100
 things but I also like to do the 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.360
 fun not because I know many of 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.610
 yeah although some maybe we do not 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.650
 convince at all but I believe that others 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.620
 many and they are also very funny and I 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.540
 I know that apart from having serious gameplays 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.139
 in which I learned digital I think that 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.229
 they also have a fun part, 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.810
 It's good and if not good I get a lot 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.270
 a lot of variation so today I want 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.319
 start doing a lot of variation I still like that 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.370
 I will have a channel for all 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.139
 likes not because you're never going to find 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.340
 a channel that is exactly what 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.229
 look there's always going to be a little bit 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.870
 of each thing so then what you 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:59.080
 like it and so take advantage of those parts 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.819
 and nothing like that, supporting the 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.919
 who upload the video does not does not 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.090
 I mean my channel specifically if 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.860
 not all youtube channels that 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.259
 continue because for example I am 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.610
 moderately known but there are many 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.830
 many young channels that also 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.389
 they have videos or an incredible initiative 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.000
 that upload videos that are worth a lot 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.500
 sorry and there they are that it costs them a lot 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.150
 grow because there is already to see leave is a 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.439
 little late to start on youtube and 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.810
 I started two years ago and still I have not 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:24.370
 grown as much as there could be 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.000
 done if he had dedicated to the best more 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.880
 weather 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.250
 more videos uploaded to youtube I do not know but 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.420
 well I'm satisfied at least with 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.980
 what I have achieved and I hope that 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.620
 you are therefore enjoying everything 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.750
 my channel of my content also area or 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.810
 fifa that maybe I really want to 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.570
 make them in 2.0 also not be a 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.950
 interesting interest that then 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.020
 you can not give ideas too 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.020
 so I will ask a question and answer but 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:54.110
 in blog version and that more than more than 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.730
 more I also plan to make good the 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.590
 special 10,000 subscribers although already 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.169
 comes to the 11 thousand that will be talking about me 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.510
 setup but I still can not because I do not 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.460
 I have exactly setup as I had it in 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.380
 a principle that is how it really was 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.600
 so I'm waiting for 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.820
 have my setup is exactly the same as 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.200
 that everything in my room so good 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.520
 I hope kids these things 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.419
 like and look here I missed a 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.950
 triple quad low with c4 but good 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:21.320
 One friend takes them off but nothing happens 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.030
 so it's a very good game and it's going 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.470
 to finish and for time I know four 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.960
 games I go crazy I love them or they are 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.550
 the best thing that there is a girl to remind her 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.930
 I like to see if we go to 200 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.020
 for this to imply is very good departure 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.759
 and nothing thanks for everything 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.560
 when I'm watching I'll bother going 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:37.120
 pump and my buddies and nothing to spend a 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.930
 good day they took care of many already until then 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.930
 goodbye
