I've<00:03:40.110> been<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:40.410> busy<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:41.760> realized<00:03:42.570> some

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
I've been so busy I just realized some

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.910 
I've been so busy I just realized some
time<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.930> was<00:03:43.050> ran<00:03:43.260> out<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.530> house<00:03:43.650> and

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
time it was ran out of the house and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.770 
time it was ran out of the house and
black<00:03:44.610> shirt<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:44.850> jeans<00:03:45.030> or<00:03:45.270> sometimes<00:03:45.600> it's

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
black shirt and jeans or sometimes it's

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.210 
black shirt and jeans or sometimes it's
fine<00:03:45.930> but<00:03:46.560> not<00:03:46.740> this<00:03:46.890> time

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
fine but not this time

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.560 
fine but not this time
so<00:03:48.210> this<00:03:49.020> cost<00:03:49.290> me<00:03:49.610> $70<00:03:50.610> but<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.330> screwed<00:03:52.320> up<00:03:52.440> so

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
so this cost me $70 but I screwed up so

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.740 
so this cost me $70 but I screwed up so
so<00:03:54.570> that's<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.170> penalty<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.620> guess

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
so that's the penalty I guess

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.840 
so that's the penalty I guess
that's<00:03:58.320> Karen<00:03:58.680> Ashley<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.190> Yellow<00:03:59.460> Ranger

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
that's Karen Ashley the Yellow Ranger

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.730
