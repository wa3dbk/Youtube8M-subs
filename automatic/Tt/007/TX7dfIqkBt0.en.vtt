00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.529
 hi people video will be from the series 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:24.640
 crazy hands 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.279
 this is my syma x5c quadrocopter 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.200
 so here it looks now in general that 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.100
 happened quadcopter fell sixth 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.989
 floor well, I'll tell you later how it is 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.420
 it happened a separate story well in 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.489
 general one does not work three 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.100
 engine starts one does not work 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.059
 Here now I decided to make out what to see 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:50.290
 here him well 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.110
 the problem here is what is discovered how would 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.880
 I do not know for each three cameras but eyes 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.520
 very difficult without a magnifying glass 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.840
 here and so consider shorter here 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.850
 contact on the go bent and throw 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.680
 Contact bent now we will try 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.450
 bend it under a magnifying glass 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.790
 backwards 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.909
 well and collect this little motor back not 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.180
 I know it will work or not well, you will see 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.049
 it is soon and I still have correlations 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.329
 covariance well 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.600
 I could see it only with the help 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.460
 shake multiple magnification with 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.840
 loops without a bow could not even consider 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.619
 thorium is older either here really 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.789
 everything is so very small here and there 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.889
 very difficult could be the camera can not 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.909
 I like to use a magnifying glass, too bad 

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:41.319
 you can see here you see closed contacts 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.789
 so now we will try it all 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:50.130
 install but also run the quadric in 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.130
 Generally fix the motor managed legs 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.450
 like this 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.410
 factory is stable it works if the video 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.410
 then rises such houses 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.090
 visible not visible not know 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.360
 i am seeing smoke 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.500
 in general, high-rise as 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.750
 Whether it is normal here and so 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.190
 I do not know it should be or could not 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.670
 I try the rest but it is also here I 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.520
 but I can not hold in my hands very 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.010
 it's hard here 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:42.170
 hold because here is the lower one here 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:45.030
 little thing well, he crumbled again shorter 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:50.970
 need to somehow and up to attach it there 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:55.640
 secured very, very, very somehow 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.640
 delicately that is, we are very complicated all 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.560
 here we catch now 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:07.290
 it seems like this whole household was restored 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.770
 that is, it works in principle now it 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.860
 now basically works but now 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.739
 Whether we will try to work as 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.230
 necessary because I think that there is a thrust 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.660
 even some little bit of vud there 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.700
 some if that will be different well 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.700
 quadric roll over to one side 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.500
 all the way, in principle, well, try again 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.209
 fix approach type or super-glue 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.940
 I don't know any other feather beds 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.350
 glue or even how it will be well, in general 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:40.380
 now try bye for now 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:44.820
 Well, in principle, it seems like it happened 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:48.720
 that is, so here I am on the usual 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.959
 pencil here is this thermo glue warming up 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.510
 lighter and secured the turn chuck because 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.450
 how is he there very much to show 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.060
 here let's show here so fastened 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.600
 there that is here are four points bent 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.110
 metal I straightened them a little so 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.180
 himself so small there is nothing that is 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.730
 we do not have tics than so little and not 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.120
 crawl that is specialized 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:20.390
 the tool should be a sharp blow well in 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.390
 principle let's see works 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.890
 works 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.009
 just there therefore we will now 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:35.490
 try to put it in its place 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:38.840
 let's see how it will work will 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.389
 does copter fly well in principle 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.550
 we will see in general now shorter 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.990
 so here with the pirates engines here 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.110
 under plastic 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.909
 everything should be neatly wired but 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.750
 so here we have after 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:56.340
 the sixth floor quadrocopter 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.039
 when he got stuck in a tree well now we 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.680
 it will also be treated will close 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.440
 here is exactly the same well, again, we will 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.349
 do this through here such that 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.289
 ordinary hot melt glue 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:12.690
 Well, so now it looks clear 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.720
 that plastic from this side and from this 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.409
 a little bit lighter than this thermo glue 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.449
 from this side this will therefore 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.879
 bring a little side here so here 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.509
 so with the help of calibration we then 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:30.860
 it will all be aligned well in 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:34.409
 In principle, something like this happened 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.699
 Well, in principle, squares that is 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:37.699
 put together let's try to turn it on 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:49.529
 end well that drove arrives I do not 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.949
 I'll ruin the apartment right now because 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:55.259
 like with one hand, I'm not under the steering wheel right now 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:57.090
 really want well quadrics take fly away 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.909
 let's principle him so that's where 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.389
 I put someone asked to check the camera 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:07.770
 let's check the camera i have this camera 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:09.569
 for now put here like this 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.190
 Cameron principle turns on like this 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:16.650
 that's the way now something should be there 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:21.259
 the decanter kim will light up and this is the camera 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.259
 should write us right now 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:47.180
 let 's write sounds now 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.830
 the next video will be about him 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:02.750
 because the next package wrapped which 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:06.720
 arrived with China will be about him 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:08.940
 in principle, see yes, somehow 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.920
 it turns out the eyes are afraid hands do though 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:16.830
 To be honest, I didnâ€™t believe it would work out 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.200
 assemble this little motor like that 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:23.580
 as you can see everything works in principle 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.540
 quadrics flies in principle, all while gods 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.540
 I'll see you
