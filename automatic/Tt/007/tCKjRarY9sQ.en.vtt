 the second day friends on how 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.620
 develop how to deal with 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.000
 emotions how not to let yourself go 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.650
 let overwhelm by emotions 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.070
 negative that we do not understand where 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.110
 they come 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.429
 we do not know how to put words we do not 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.910
 do not know how to clarify them 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.650
 and precisely today or how 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.390
 how to determine our feelings 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.800
 how to determine it was motion his 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.600
 emotions that we can have 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.519
 I appreciated that I speak of emotions 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.150
 negative in this series the emotions 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.529
 positive 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.550
 I know everything I wish you 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.230
 that's all I want you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.020
 to be in gratitude in the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.100
 well-being in serenity and a whole 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.840
 lots of stuff in joy in 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.629
 the enthusiast is so how 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.460
 determine an emotion how how 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.530
 understand how to know what 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.989
 what exactly do we feel 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.660
 but in fact it's very simple 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.079
 know that in fact at the base people they 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.699
 have they received so much emotion 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.110
 they put back but he would put 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.579
 so not in question actually on 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.550
 their emotions that after a while 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.140
 they are as assaulted actually by the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.120
 emotions and he thinks that in fact the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.739
 emotions it's just negative 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.659
 that the emotions its bad it takes 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.920
 especially not feeling emotions then 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.290
 that as I wanted from yesterday it's 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.880
 hyper-important feeling emotions 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.860
 negative and me with even I'm going to you 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.659
 to say that I prefer to feel 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.409
 negative emotions that emotions 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.360
 positive 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.650
 it sounds weird but it's like that 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.420
 why because emotions 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.820
 negative that I feel that's all 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.799
 just a signal that allows me to 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.540
 to say that here I can go I can 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.070
 do better in my life I can move on to 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.060
 the action somewhere you can it's 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.560
 quite important to me 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.909
 so I have to go there and everything 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.740
 heaps of stuff that really lets me 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.270
 we understand what's in the bottom of 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.890
 my guts to understand what's at 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.540
 bottom of my subconscious and everything 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.490
 simply to develop my life of 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.350
 of advanced actually and not be paralyzed 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.540
 like most people who those who 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.399
 are as overgrown with their emotions that 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.869
 are like assaulted who steal and mash 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.189
 they are fuzzy are there they are here or 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.640
 are bad but Saturday that's not even 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.049
 Why 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.430
 and in the end they lose they have a 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.890
 loss of control over their emotions a 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.840
 loss of control over themselves and sees 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.369
 so the simple thing actually for 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.960
 determine his feelings for 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.550
 determine these words on six ask yourself the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.990
 question 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.790
 it's as soon as you feel something 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.820
 more negative is to ask the question 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.150
 what feeling do I feel that it's 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.430
 anger 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.870
 is it sadness 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.930
 is it worth it 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.340
 is it feeling mediocre and 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.790
 his crates what are you 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.370
 feel and from there some 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.650
 notches cantat as to decide which 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.320
 feeling was exhausting took over what 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.420
 feelings that therefore feels for example 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.430
 anger rubs the question is this 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.990
 that really is angry is that 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.410
 really it's not rather than you're 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.230
 injured 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.530
 it's not rather you missed something 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:45.140
 thing or that you feel that the spell 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.150
 reject or where we have been flouted 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.230
 your values ​​where a whole thing does not pose the 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.790
 question actually because in fact the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.530
 anger does not come from the Holy Spirit does not 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.120
 does not come by chance like that she falls 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.830
 on you you 're angry no it's happening 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.570
 not like that anger comes from whatever 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.130
 thing in fact it's hyper important to 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.500
 really know about the angry city by 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.520
 example is to know where does this 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.300
 anger so is it someone 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.520
 leave to hurt 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.170
 is it something that 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.670
 is that you even since you yourself 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.250
 you're hurt is what you yourself 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.100
 you even get angry sometimes and it's a 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.260
 not so if you feel an emotion 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.610
 of rejection if an emotion of loneliness and 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.500
 You arises the question is what it is 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.170
 because you're separating a person that 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.570
 you often like me it happened to me 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.050
 it is that I sang a motion of 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.580
 rejection of solitude or weight 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.410
 loneliness and in fact I realized 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.870
 that it was always after that 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.239
 a person is consciously I had 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.280
 not at all I had not taken anything 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.980
 account that actually this person I 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.910
 loved that person actually and that's it 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.739
 it was really someone 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.420
 I appreciated that I appreciated from the bottom of the 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.830
 heart and actually when I was over with 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.150
 she bah there I felt bad 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.210
 and that's after I realized that 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.400
 done by asking these questions that actually 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.870
 these two people wow this is a 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.610
 I appreciate a lot 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.470
 and from there it was an indicator 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.820
 in fact just for me to me 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.230
 to say that to see in time it really takes 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.760
 that I do things are really going 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.930
 that I'm taking action for really 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.330
 that here I am putting things in 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.470
 place to be able to develop this 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.090
 relationship with this person 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.410
 because in fact it comes from the heart 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.850
 comes from the guts it comes from the old 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.680
 next and who tells me I 'm waiting for this 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.970
 person and wings and huawei is 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.030
 impact when you see what I mean 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.980
 and that's where I left myself instead of 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.670
 let me overwhelm by leaving the 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.330
 disappointment by sadness etc 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.560
 I precisely determine what and 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.900
 the emotion that I exactly determine 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.370
 precisely the emotion you have 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.440
 what I'm doing is something that is 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.480
 nice enough if I always played on 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.280
 me and as soon as it's okay I'm talking to 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.510
 I myself go to bed myself I write 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.430
 what is it what is it going 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.290
 not after I answer myself and 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.060
 it's ultimately quite exceptional 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.380
 it's a little schizophrenic but it's 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.940
 hyper powerful because in fact you 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.010
 rubbish but you talk to yourself and 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.810
 in addition you take you take of the 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.190
 dissociate actually from all this is happening 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.820
 better to understand what is 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.620
 pass in his head 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.419
 why do you feel such feelings and 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.430
 his fears a trick and after you can 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.840
 determine precisely what the 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.480
 problem and accurately determine 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.820
 which student the action to put in place 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.970
 so as not to be overwhelmed by 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.440
 emotions to develop a better 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.140
 life and we by not letting ourselves 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.770
 overwhelm by by a lot of things 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.330
 negative final 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.530
 we are paralyzed as the like the 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
 majority of people is we hope 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.520
 now united nations motors not sell 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.680
 motorbikes barely very emotional 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.720
 important we are emotional beings on 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.520
 lives in a world where emotions do not 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.490
 not no one has had the finger 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.340
 so not develop them tetris you do not go 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.620
 no change was working shut up 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.970
 you do not mind fucking boss in 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.890
 that's the problem so 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.000
 frankly if you really want to 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.650
 to move to a higher level 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.060
 really the key is really 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.300
 make conscious to determine with 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.580
 precision what are your emotions when 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.170
 you feel and note all that 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.030
 as I say and we'll meet again tomorrow 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.360
 for a next video we'll have a 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.890
 key or even more powerful and we 're going 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.400
 really know how to master his 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.930
 emotions to really be 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.230
 humans and not robots 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.680
 that said I hope because me that 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.180
 interests me 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.350
 we'll meet tomorrow for a 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.350
 next video cha or kisses
