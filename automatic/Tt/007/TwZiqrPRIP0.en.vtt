00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
is a 2 by 4 red brick it's really more

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.009 
is a 2 by 4 red brick it's really more
or<00:00:28.260> less<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.590> medium<00:00:29.099> sized<00:00:29.480> storage<00:00:30.480> container

but it is the Lego lunchbox in 2 by 4
and<00:00:35.550> red<00:00:36.390> they<00:00:36.899> make<00:00:37.050> them<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.290> different

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.049 
colors
you<00:00:38.579> still<00:00:38.879> get<00:00:39.030> these<00:00:39.500> there's<00:00:40.500> about<00:00:41.160> $15

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
you still get these there's about $15

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.920 
you still get these there's about $15
and<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.420> know<00:00:44.030> that's<00:00:45.030> how<00:00:45.180> much<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and I know that's how much it was at the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.040 
and I know that's how much it was at the
Container<00:00:46.350> Store<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> lunchbox

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
Container Store so this is the lunchbox

last you half a year not so much of your

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.050 
last you half a year not so much of your
human<00:01:04.040> it's<00:01:05.040> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.270> small<00:01:06.720> lunch

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
human it's kind of be a small lunch

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
human it's kind of be a small lunch
which<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.390> guess<00:01:09.780> wouldn't<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.260> bad<00:01:10.500> has

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
which I guess wouldn't be so bad has

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.179 
which I guess wouldn't be so bad has
Lego<00:01:11.369> logo<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.960> not<00:01:13.170> stackable<00:01:13.799> as

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
Lego logo on it it is not stackable as

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.789 
Lego logo on it it is not stackable as
far<00:01:14.640> as<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.270> doesn't<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.689> little<00:01:16.049> openings

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
far as it doesn't have little openings

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.990 
far as it doesn't have little openings
on<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> back<00:01:17.189> got<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> regular<00:01:17.729> Lego<00:01:18.420> brick

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
on the back got the regular Lego brick

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.999 
on the back got the regular Lego brick
so<00:01:21.000> anyway<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.930> stack<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.409> anything

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
so anyway can I stack it to anything

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.520 
so anyway can I stack it to anything
yeah<00:01:23.630> obviously<00:01:24.630> though<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.840> can't<00:01:25.200> use<00:01:25.500> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
yeah obviously though you can't use a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.950 
yeah obviously though you can't use a
regular<00:01:25.770> 2x4<00:01:26.549> brick<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.240> closest<00:01:27.689> thing<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
regular 2x4 brick the closest thing to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.700 
regular 2x4 brick the closest thing to
its<00:01:28.320> size<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> foam<00:01:29.340> brick<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:31.470> soft

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
its size is the foam brick the soft

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.520 
its size is the foam brick the soft
brick<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.310> should<00:01:32.490> say<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.079> closest

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
brick I should say it's the closest

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.350 
brick I should say it's the closest
brick<00:01:34.770> we've<00:01:34.979> looked<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.640> far<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.180> is

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
brick we've looked at so far that is

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.350 
brick we've looked at so far that is
about<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.320> same<00:01:37.500> size<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.939> will<00:01:39.119> not

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
about the same size and it will not

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.420 
about the same size and it will not
connect<00:01:40.200> either<00:01:40.380> although<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.189> count

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
connect either although you can count

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.069 
connect either although you can count
since<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.939> foam<00:01:42.180> it'll<00:01:42.509> stretch<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> little

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
since this foam it'll stretch a little

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.510 
since this foam it'll stretch a little
bit<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> over<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.130> couple<00:01:44.369> of

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
bit you can get it over a couple of

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.230 
bit you can get it over a couple of
studs<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.909> but<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.060> try<00:01:48.210> to

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
studs like like that but if you try to

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
studs like like that but if you try to
do<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.570> four<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:49.920> won't

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
do all four it really won't

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.120 
do all four it really won't
it'll<00:01:50.490> kind<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.829> too

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it'll kind of do it but it's it's too

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.730 
it'll kind of do it but it's it's too
too<00:01:54.030> small<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.840> little<00:01:55.229> bit<00:01:55.320> off<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
too small just a little bit off the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.179 
too small just a little bit off the
tolerance<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:57.030> there

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
tolerance to go there

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.130 
tolerance to go there
but<00:01:59.189> that's<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.579> lunch<00:01:59.759> box<00:02:00.090> another<00:02:00.509> 2<00:02:00.750> by<00:02:00.899> 4

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
