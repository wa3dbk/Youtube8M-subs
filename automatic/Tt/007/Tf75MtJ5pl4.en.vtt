00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
out of the five and I think it's because

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.939 
out of the five and I think it's because
they<00:05:29.750> so<00:05:29.900> strongly<00:05:30.229> claimed<00:05:30.620> that<00:05:30.800> it<00:05:30.919> was

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949

going to give my lashes some serious

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.529 
going to give my lashes some serious
volume<00:05:33.380> and<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:33.860> just<00:05:34.130> didn't<00:05:34.460> see<00:05:34.759> that<00:05:34.789> it

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
basis if I don't set the concealer under

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.010 
basis if I don't set the concealer under
my<00:06:51.340> eyes<00:06:51.490> which<00:06:51.970> I<00:06:52.090> don't<00:06:52.150> really<00:06:52.360> do<00:06:52.630> every

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
my eyes which I don't really do every

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.320 
my eyes which I don't really do every
single<00:06:53.199> day<00:06:53.500> this<00:06:54.130> mascara<00:06:54.789> does<00:06:55.030> sort<00:06:55.240> of

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
single day this mascara does sort of

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.719 
single day this mascara does sort of
smudge<00:06:55.660> under<00:06:56.050> there<00:06:56.229> so<00:06:56.860> if<00:06:57.130> I<00:06:57.250> had<00:06:57.430> to<00:06:57.550> choose

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:57.729 
smudge under there so if I had to choose

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:59.550 
smudge under there so if I had to choose
sort<00:06:58.030> of<00:06:58.120> between<00:06:58.449> the<00:06:58.690> two<00:06:58.870> Maybelline's<00:06:59.410> I

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
sort of between the two Maybelline's I

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.810 
sort of between the two Maybelline's I
will<00:06:59.770> go<00:06:59.889> from<00:07:00.039> my<00:07:00.190> Maybelline<00:07:00.610> falsies

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820 
will go from my Maybelline falsies

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.840 
will go from my Maybelline falsies
because<00:07:01.539> it<00:07:02.110> does<00:07:02.320> not<00:07:02.470> smudge<00:07:03.010> under<00:07:03.430> my<00:07:03.580> eyes

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850 
because it does not smudge under my eyes

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.580 
because it does not smudge under my eyes
and<00:07:04.240> then<00:07:04.419> I<00:07:04.539> guess<00:07:04.720> my<00:07:04.900> least<00:07:05.139> favorite<00:07:05.470> out

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
and then I guess my least favorite out

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.550 
and then I guess my least favorite out
of<00:07:05.710> all<00:07:05.889> of<00:07:05.919> them<00:07:06.130> was<00:07:06.400> this<00:07:06.639> L'Oreal

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.909 
of all of them was this L'Oreal
