00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.740
 frames of a mo 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.900
 we can be assembled in many ways 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:21.990
 the first one is easier but it doesn't have a big one 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:24.590
 seal and this takes the thread you do 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.590
 a noose 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:40.750
 so 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:40.750
 come back again, come back again 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:56.960
 almost as many times as you want 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:01:04.610
 after which a kind of pull is formed 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:10.090
 eight this point we sold we pass 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.090
 inside the first eyelet the second 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.729
 The second one 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.520
 and pull yourself 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.970
 this is one of the easiest ways to 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.530
 put the hook is not great 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.530
 great seal however allows to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 to fish 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.320
 Now there are hooks 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.610
 with eyelet 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.140
 to me eyelet slips inside the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.140
 wire 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.159
 so it turns 3 4 times 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.379
 then the end of the thread passed inside 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.379
 eyelet so 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.380
 took the boss then passed again 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.710
 p 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.530
 no one is a very strong man 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:17.129
 he says it cut and he never did it 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:29.920
 third way to put the years a little 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:32.489
 the harder it binds it takes the thread yes 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.489
 doubles 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.870
 he gets together with his wife 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.890
 so 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.930
 almost took the sky turns 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.790
 sicily 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:09.300
 how many times do you want this point 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.810
 you make the end of the thread you pass 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.810
 inside the ring 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.680
 so 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.550
 and it will be said 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.890
 sincere strong you can 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.680
 we will cut the thread more 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.090
 in the car
