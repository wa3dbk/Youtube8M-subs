00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.519
 We put plenty of water to boil in a 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.210
 pot we save when it breaks to boil and 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.210
 we take the rice 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.210
 Let boil the time indicated by the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.210
 maker 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.440
 we split sweet ham sticks 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.750
 we make sticks with the carrot 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.770
 previously peeled more or less the same 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.770
 size than sweet ham 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.000
 we look for the eggs in a bowl and the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.000
 we beat 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.460
 we take a tad of salt 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.320
 We cut the prawns that we have already cooked 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.470
 in plenty of water with salt for 3 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.470
 minutes 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.340
 we drained the rice and had a little 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.340
 of cold water 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.090
 in a wok we take a splash of oil 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.360
 of extra virgin olive and we incorporate the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.360
 rice 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.540
 then we toss the beaten egg 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.610
 although it seems a lot then it stays in 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.130
 nothing 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.570
 let's test with the rods without stopping 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.890
 we want to be made an omelet 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.510
 rice 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.080
 it is important that you have fire 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.080
 so strong 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.650
 we incorporated the peas 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.740
 the prawns 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.780
 a splash of soy to taste 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.220
 the sweet ham and the carrot we mix 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.220
 good and on the plate
