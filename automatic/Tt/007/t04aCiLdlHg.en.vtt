00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
okay now we are ready to learn the g7

okay now we are ready to learn the g7
chord<00:00:05.750> okay<00:00:07.040> there's<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.340> couple<00:00:08.670> different

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
chord okay there's a couple different

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.730 
chord okay there's a couple different
ways<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.330> playing<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:09.719> one<00:00:09.929> but<00:00:10.469> they're<00:00:10.620> all

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
ways of playing this one but they're all

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.950 
ways of playing this one but they're all
going<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.950> be<00:00:11.040> related<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> g<00:00:11.790> major<00:00:11.960> so

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
going to be related to the g major so

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.990 
going to be related to the g major so
let's<00:00:13.139> start<00:00:13.410> with<00:00:13.650> this<00:00:13.830> fingering<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.820> g

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
let's start with this fingering of the g

open D you pick in the bottom do you
recall<00:00:30.230> okay<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:32.219> simple<00:00:32.550> way<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.730> look<00:00:33.360> at

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
recall okay one simple way is look at

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.930 
recall okay one simple way is look at
this<00:00:33.570> G<00:00:33.870> octave<00:00:34.230> up<00:00:34.350> here<00:00:34.590> well<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.579> want<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.850> go

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
this G octave up here well we want to go

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.180 
this G octave up here well we want to go
to<00:00:35.969> run<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.570> play<00:00:36.719> an<00:00:36.840> F<00:00:37.020> instead<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.710> G<00:00:37.980> we

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
to run it play an F instead of that G we

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.240 
to run it play an F instead of that G we
don't<00:00:38.280> need<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.670> octave<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.070> fight

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
don't need that octave so you can fight

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
don't need that octave so you can fight
like<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.629> way<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> playing<00:00:43.079> it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
like this this is one way of playing it

like this this is one way of playing it
this<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.620> way

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
this is way

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.210 
this is way
it<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.200> convenient<00:00:46.649> from<00:00:46.980> switching

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
it is very convenient from switching

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.130 
it is very convenient from switching
from<00:00:47.550> C<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:49.620> g7<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.430> vice<00:00:50.700> versa<00:00:51.140> however

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
from C to the g7 or vice versa however

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.750 
from C to the g7 or vice versa however
it<00:00:52.320> keeps<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it keeps that

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.590 
it keeps that
it<00:00:54.239> gives<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> tritone<00:00:55.140> feel<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> tritone<00:00:56.600> be

an example of the notes from bead v2f
that<00:01:00.800> create<00:01:01.800> some<00:01:02.010> tensions<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that create some tensions so what you

might want to do is double your D you

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.300 
might want to do is double your D you

that pork finger if it's there it's not

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.690 
that pork finger if it's there it's not
it's<00:01:43.030> even<00:01:43.300> easier<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:44.920> stretch<00:01:45.220> can<00:01:45.520> be

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
it's even easier but this stretch can be

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.810 
it's even easier but this stretch can be
difficult<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.860> might<00:01:48.010> find<00:01:48.220> yourself<00:01:48.370> moving
