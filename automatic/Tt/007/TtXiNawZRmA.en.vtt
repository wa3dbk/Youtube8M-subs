00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.970
 is more than a museum in honor of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:17.340
 luiz gonzaga he tells a little about 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:18.690
 history of what is the sertão people saw 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.850
 who could not make a museum in 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.039
 homage to luiz gonzaga in honor of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.470
 he is in all things more than 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.800
 It should be a game with Tássio which is the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.390
 life in the wilderness what it is to be sertanejo o 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 that the hinterland to Brazil that the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.600
 backwoods to the world 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 so that he was baptized of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.059
 The dock of the backlands falls because it is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.559
 of the water near the zero mark where it was born 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.200
 the city of the municipality we had a 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.370
 area was destined for a harbor shed 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.379
 and an area between sheds we have already begun to 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.020
 working in this shed we solve 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.699
 use the shed I rebuilt it until 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.739
 because he was doomed we have 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.570
 to build low and build 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.680
 to build a new building is almost 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.050
 ready 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.470
 on the side that will house exhibitions 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.570
 temporary classrooms of courses 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.830
 to host a good auditorium for concerts to 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.299
 cinema we built a big block 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.720
 creating a large area 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.750
 shaded is for the pedestrian who is 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.790
 walking and walking around the city has 60 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.520
 meters are six meters high 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.830
 it is a great shadow indeed that he 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.869
 promotes it as an act of kindness 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.869
 with those from the building to the city 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.580
 the museum is composed of a reconstruction 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.909
 practically from one of an old shed 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.030
 from the port where we used the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.010
 original materials that had the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.000
 metallic roof structure 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.250
 would rule with the marcelo and we would then 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.590
 decided to use the concrete and half 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 very strong yellow very hot 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.020
 looking for something with the proximity to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.240
 hinterland light with the soil according to 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.940
 stone and apparent concrete even 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.410
 reasons first for the reason 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.220
 structural performance of this material 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.470
 which allows this free span of 60 meters 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.000
 shaded second by the is by 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.530
 also the simplicity of the material I 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.660
 wanted structure at the same time and 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.360
 closing at the same time and finishing 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.580
 the third is for durability 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.620
 resistance of this material 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.140
 over time and yet another 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.010
 advantage of being a public building is 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.840
 a material that demands very little 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.510
 maintenance whose maintenance is very low 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.410
 over time we wanted to make a 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.579
 building with this hot feature 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.860
 protected enclosure a veil of how the 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.600
 is a traditional element of the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.519
 Brazilian architecture and specifically 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.310
 the editor of pernambuco was born this 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.799
 2,200 cobogó are placed in the two 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.380
 facades of the building they filter the light 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.380
 they will serve to soften this 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.980
 impact of this yellow concrete stone 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.870
 in the city do a little 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.790
 reference to the hinterland as the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.560
 dry waters of the hinterland that is as if you 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.989
 always in the backlands you will see everything 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.440
 through that filter of the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.440
 backwoods 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.910
 the benefit is air conditioned to a 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.130
 museum in sea ​​hair 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.620
 I said he has a lot of equipment 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.900
 multimedia technology has to be 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.360
 protected and has pieces also works of 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.250
 art and in the case of the building of 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.600
 concrete we are in the coverage that the 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.690
 place of higher incidence of heat 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.640
 stimulate one is one will have a 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.290
 Rooftop restaurant overlooking 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.960
 the sea and the city 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.360
 the large terrace we have a 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.690
 landscaping project so the 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.930
 internal environment is already a bit more 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.930
 fresh 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.890
 it will be a building when ready 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.660
 probably one of the most important 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.260
 contemporary architecture in the city of 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.300
 Recife 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.150
 I believe you will be able to promote 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.310
 a certain transformation in that 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.050
 urban context that will have an impact on 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.000
 much higher when you have with people 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.180
 circulating in the usa go free with 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.570
 raise had aborted there on the edge 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.570
 from water
