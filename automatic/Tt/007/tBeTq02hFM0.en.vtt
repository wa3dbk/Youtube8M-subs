some<00:00:10.559> pentatonic<00:00:11.340> licks<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.880> are<00:00:12.570> two<00:00:12.840> notes

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
some pentatonic licks that are two notes

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.840 
some pentatonic licks that are two notes
per<00:00:13.170> string<00:00:14.120> but<00:00:15.120> they're<00:00:15.240> still<00:00:15.360> fast<00:00:16.850> this

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
per string but they're still fast this

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.660 
per string but they're still fast this
is<00:00:18.000> sort<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.270> sixteenth<00:00:18.720> note<00:00:19.020> feel<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
is sort of a sixteenth note feel in a

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.480 
is sort of a sixteenth note feel in a
minor<00:00:21.300> pentatonic<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:23.010> sounds<00:00:23.310> something

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
minor pentatonic and it sounds something

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.610 
minor pentatonic and it sounds something
like<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:23.970> maybe<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.750> through<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:32.620 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.960 

and<00:00:34.570> basically<00:00:35.570> i'm<00:00:35.810> doing<00:00:36.140> is<00:00:36.700> this<00:00:37.700> kind<00:00:37.880> of

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
and basically i'm doing is this kind of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.730 
and basically i'm doing is this kind of
pattern<00:00:38.360> we're<00:00:40.600> gonna<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.870> note<00:00:42.110> on<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.590> D

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
pattern we're gonna a note on the D

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.430 
pattern we're gonna a note on the D
string<00:00:42.770> and<00:00:43.190> ID<00:00:44.030> send<00:00:44.510> three<00:00:44.870> notes<00:00:45.050> in<00:00:45.350> a

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
string and ID send three notes in a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.820 
string and ID send three notes in a
minor<00:00:45.650> pentatonic<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:48.410> kind<00:00:48.560> of<00:00:48.620> thing

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
minor pentatonic that kind of thing

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.540 
minor pentatonic that kind of thing
using<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.460> pull<00:00:49.670> off<00:00:50.380> to<00:00:51.380> make<00:00:52.010> it<00:00:52.100> easier<00:00:52.430> to

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
using to pull off to make it easier to

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.010 
using to pull off to make it easier to
pick<00:00:52.760> basically<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.500> then<00:00:54.500> I<00:00:55.070> uh<00:00:55.100> send<00:00:56.020> backup

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
pick basically and then I uh send backup

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.590 
pick basically and then I uh send backup
to<00:00:57.200> the<00:00:57.320> original<00:00:57.680> note<00:00:57.860> and<00:00:58.390> look<00:00:59.390> at<00:00:59.510> the

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
to the original note and look at the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.080 
to the original note and look at the
c-note<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:00.230> back<00:01:00.350> down<00:01:00.560> so<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:01.580> way<00:01:01.700> I<00:01:01.730> sort

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
c-note and back down so the way I sort

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.730 
c-note and back down so the way I sort
of<00:01:02.120> look<00:01:02.270> at<00:01:02.420> it<00:01:02.450> is<00:01:02.660> these<00:01:03.020> two<00:01:03.200> things<00:01:03.470> this

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
of look at it is these two things this

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.010 
of look at it is these two things this
this<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.130> first<00:01:04.339> part<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:04.870> this<00:01:05.870> is<00:01:05.960> the

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
this is the first part and this is the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.359 
this is the first part and this is the
second<00:01:06.290> part<00:01:06.670> so<00:01:07.670> it's<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:08.060> GE<00:01:09.190> think<00:01:10.190> about

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
second part so it's a GE think about

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.560 
second part so it's a GE think about
them<00:01:10.520> notes<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:11.530> gac<00:01:12.910> so<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.180> two<00:01:14.330> parts

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
them notes and gac so the two parts

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.260 
them notes and gac so the two parts
together

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.370 

that's<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.480> main<00:01:21.750> sort<00:01:22.050> of<00:01:22.110> meat<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
that's the main sort of meat and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.690 
that's the main sort of meat and
potatoes<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.950> fact<00:01:23.130> that'll<00:01:23.340> give<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.550> real

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
potatoes in fact that'll give you a real

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.870 
potatoes in fact that'll give you a real
good<00:01:23.880> kind<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> triplet<00:01:24.540> leg<00:01:26.210> slower

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.980 

and<00:01:33.880> then<00:01:34.180> all<00:01:34.330> I<00:01:34.360> did<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.630> make<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.930> a

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
and then all I did to make it a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.930 
and then all I did to make it a
sixteenth<00:01:35.410> note<00:01:35.620> fields<00:01:35.980> add<00:01:36.160> two<00:01:36.430> more<00:01:36.700> notes

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
sixteenth note fields add two more notes

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.040 
sixteenth note fields add two more notes
in<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.150> end<00:01:37.300> that<00:01:37.510> we've<00:01:37.600> already<00:01:37.750> played<00:01:37.990> a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
in the end that we've already played a

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.120 
in the end that we've already played a
million<00:01:38.320> times<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:38.770> shouldn't<00:01:38.980> be<00:01:39.010> too

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
million times so it shouldn't be too

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.360 
million times so it shouldn't be too
much<00:01:39.250> trouble<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:41.200> then<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.410> added<00:01:41.620> on<00:01:41.770> Aang

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
much trouble and then I added on Aang

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.790 
much trouble and then I added on Aang
just<00:01:42.840> dissenting<00:01:43.840> again<00:01:44.110> on<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.290> same<00:01:44.440> scale

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
just dissenting again on the same scale

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.470 
just dissenting again on the same scale
so<00:01:45.220> I'm<00:01:45.280> repeating<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.700> lot<00:01:45.820> of<00:01:45.940> notes<00:01:46.120> but<00:01:46.390> it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
so I'm repeating a lot of notes but it

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.560 
so I'm repeating a lot of notes but it
ends<00:01:46.600> up<00:01:46.690> sounding<00:01:46.840> cool<00:01:48.420> that's<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.540> whole

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
ends up sounding cool that's the whole

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.940 
ends up sounding cool that's the whole
leg<00:01:54.690> just<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:55.930> cycled<00:01:56.500> over<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.740> over<00:01:56.800> will

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
leg just that cycled over and over will

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.160 
leg just that cycled over and over will
sound<00:01:57.130> pretty<00:01:57.280> cool

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.090 

check<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.320> accents<00:02:04.710> that's<00:02:04.860> real

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
check out the accents that's real

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.840 
check out the accents that's real
important<00:02:05.490> thing<00:02:06.680> all<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.740> did<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.220> put<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
important thing all I did was put that

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.969 
important thing all I did was put that
on<00:02:09.119> each<00:02:09.390> set<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.990> three<00:02:10.440> strings<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
on each set of three strings in the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.290 
on each set of three strings in the
pentatonic<00:02:11.250> scale<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.820> stood<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> first

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
pentatonic scale so it stood the first

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.600 
pentatonic scale so it stood the first
one<00:02:12.480> maybe<00:02:12.630> on<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.930> string<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:14.190> do<00:02:14.430> that

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
one maybe on the a string and do that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.950 
one maybe on the a string and do that
pattern

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.510 

on<00:02:19.960> those<00:02:20.470> three<00:02:20.620> strings<00:02:20.950> keeping<00:02:21.370> within

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
on those three strings keeping within

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.000 
on those three strings keeping within
the<00:02:21.700> shape<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.270> minor<00:02:22.480> pentatonic<00:02:22.750> then<00:02:23.500> do

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
the shape of a minor pentatonic then do

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.630 
the shape of a minor pentatonic then do
the<00:02:24.100> one<00:02:24.250> based<00:02:24.490> on<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.760> D<00:02:24.910> string<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:27.280> when<00:02:27.550> we

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
the one based on the D string is when we

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.480 
the one based on the D string is when we
started<00:02:28.000> on<00:02:28.090> then<00:02:28.800> do<00:02:29.800> one<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.220> g<00:02:30.370> string

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
started on then do one on the g string

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.160 
started on then do one on the g string
which<00:02:30.670> happens<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:30.940> be<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.150> Dino<00:02:34.020> some<00:02:35.020> kind

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
which happens to be the Dino some kind

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.430 
which happens to be the Dino some kind
of<00:02:35.200> pairing<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.470> little<00:02:35.620> bit<00:02:35.710> slower

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.440
