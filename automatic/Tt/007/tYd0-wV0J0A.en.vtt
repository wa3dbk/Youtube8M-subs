00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
we got to walk around one of the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.990 
we got to walk around one of the
memorial<00:03:47.620> monuments<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.650> they<00:03:48.830> have<00:03:49.010> at<00:03:49.700> the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
memorial monuments that they have at the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.449 
memorial monuments that they have at the
Ferrari<00:03:50.630> base<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.770> we<00:03:51.920> got<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.160> walk<00:03:52.340> around

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
Ferrari base and we got to walk around

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.250 
Ferrari base and we got to walk around
and<00:03:52.819> see<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:53.000> little<00:03:53.150> stones<00:03:53.510> with<00:03:53.780> names<00:03:54.020> and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
and see the little stones with names and

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.790 
and see the little stones with names and
soldiers<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.890> they've<00:03:55.220> lost<00:03:55.459> in<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:57.500> years

of<00:03:58.130> war<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.900> think<00:04:00.890> that<00:04:01.040> was<00:04:01.190> that<00:04:01.370> was

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
of war and I think that was that was

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.540 
of war and I think that was that was
pretty<00:04:01.520> interesting<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.240> was<00:04:02.300> also<00:04:02.570> sad<00:04:02.900> and

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
pretty interesting it was also sad and

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.860 
pretty interesting it was also sad and
made<00:04:04.550> you<00:04:04.700> realize<00:04:05.030> how<00:04:05.270> blessed<00:04:05.420> we<00:04:05.630> are<00:04:05.720> to

be<00:04:06.170> playing<00:04:06.500> basketball<00:04:06.650> while<00:04:07.280> they're<00:04:07.520> over

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
be playing basketball while they're over

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.330
