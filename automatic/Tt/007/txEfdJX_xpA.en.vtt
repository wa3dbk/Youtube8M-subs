00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
skeleton information and we're going to

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.870 
skeleton information and we're going to
export<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.330> animation<00:00:25.310> just<00:00:26.310> demonstrate

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
export this animation just demonstrate

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.089 
export this animation just demonstrate
the<00:00:27.060> sitting<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.630> from<00:00:27.779> animation<00:00:28.410> we're

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the sitting and from animation we're

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.919 
the sitting and from animation we're
going<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> trigger<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> set<00:00:29.849> animation<00:00:30.449> with

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
going to trigger the set animation with

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.560 
going to trigger the set animation with
that<00:00:31.489> with<00:00:32.489> matinee<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.300> we're<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.510> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that with matinee so we're going to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.630 
that with matinee so we're going to
export<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.820> this<00:00:35.820> scene<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:37.160> its<00:00:38.160> own<00:00:38.309> folder

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
export this this scene to its own folder

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.750 
export this this scene to its own folder
and<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.140> called<00:00:40.340> this<00:00:41.340> character<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
and this is called this character is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.139 
and this is called this character is
called<00:00:41.879> claws<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.989> I'm<00:00:43.800> gonna<00:00:43.920> export<00:00:44.850> Clause

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
called claws so I'm gonna export Clause

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.690 
called claws so I'm gonna export Clause
out<00:00:45.600> when<00:00:46.500> you're<00:00:46.620> exporting<00:00:46.920> make<00:00:47.219> sure<00:00:47.370> you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
out when you're exporting make sure you

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700 
out when you're exporting make sure you
have<00:00:48.239> animation<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.350> your<00:00:49.500> baked

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
have animation on and your baked

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.510 
have animation on and your baked
animation<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:52.230> embedded<00:00:52.649> media<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
animation on and embedded media so the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760 
animation on and embedded media so the
textures<00:00:53.879> come<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.530> when<00:00:55.530> you're<00:00:55.620> going

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
textures come with it when you're going

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
textures come with it when you're going
to<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.100> decay<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:57.510> go<00:00:57.660> into<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> content

you can actually see your bones bones in

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.470 
you can actually see your bones bones in
the<00:02:12.200> UK<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:12.709> shows<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.130> there's<00:02:13.340> 73<00:02:13.850> bones<00:02:14.090> and

the UK it shows you there's 73 bones and
1206<00:02:15.200> polygons<00:02:15.680> for<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.040> character<00:02:16.720> you

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
1206 polygons for this character you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.750 
1206 polygons for this character you
know<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:18.320> nice<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.620> see<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.890> bone<00:02:19.070> Eames<00:02:19.400> -

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
know it's nice to see the bone Eames -

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.590 
know it's nice to see the bone Eames -
it's<00:02:20.450> pretty<00:02:20.720> complex<00:02:21.590> but<00:02:22.240> so<00:02:23.240> that's<00:02:23.420> your

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
it's pretty complex but so that's your

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.720 
it's pretty complex but so that's your
animation<00:02:24.200> set<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:26.330> defines<00:02:26.780> your<00:02:27.730> your

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
animation set that defines your your

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
animation set that defines your your
sequence<00:02:29.300> for<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:31.190> down<00:02:31.850> here<00:02:32.150> are<00:02:32.570> the

this<00:02:37.730> tutorial<00:02:38.420> rocks<00:02:38.840> are<00:02:39.019> using<00:02:39.290> kismet<00:02:39.739> to

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
this tutorial rocks are using kismet to

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.160 
this tutorial rocks are using kismet to
drive<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.370> animation<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.690> we're<00:02:41.870> going<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.050> do

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
drive the animation so we're going to do

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.070 
drive the animation so we're going to do
is<00:02:42.320> just<00:02:42.500> put<00:02:42.800> skeleton<00:02:43.550> mesh<00:02:43.730> in<00:02:44.330> here<00:02:44.900> and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
is just put skeleton mesh in here and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.930 
is just put skeleton mesh in here and
I'm<00:02:45.470> going<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.650> bring<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.130> scale<00:02:46.400> up<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.730> few

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
I'm going to bring the scale up a few

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.710 
I'm going to bring the scale up a few
times<00:02:47.380> draw<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.410> scale<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.950> character<00:02:49.400> and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
times draw a scale of the character and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.330 
times draw a scale of the character and
just<00:02:50.720> bring<00:02:50.959> them<00:02:51.080> down<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.620> ground<00:02:51.739> level

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
just bring them down to the ground level

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.300 
just bring them down to the ground level
so<00:02:52.989> Klaus<00:02:53.989> is<00:02:54.170> here<00:02:54.200> it's<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.680> kind<00:02:55.220> of

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
so Klaus is here it's in a kind of

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.550 
so Klaus is here it's in a kind of
natural<00:02:55.489> pose<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:56.900> now<00:02:57.050> we're<00:02:57.170> going<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.320> add<00:02:57.530> a

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
natural pose so now we're going to add a

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.830 
natural pose so now we're going to add a
kismet<00:02:58.250> routine<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.910> what<00:02:59.540> we're<00:02:59.690> going<00:02:59.810> to

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
kismet routine and what we're going to

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.310 
kismet routine and what we're going to
do<00:03:00.019> is<00:03:00.230> say<00:03:00.470> new<00:03:01.250> event<00:03:01.610> level<00:03:02.150> loaded<00:03:02.660> and

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
do is say new event level loaded and

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.690 
do is say new event level loaded and
what<00:03:03.830> we're<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.070> do<00:03:04.160> is<00:03:04.280> do<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.459> new

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
what we're going to do is do a new

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.660 
what we're going to do is do a new
matinee<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.510> have<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.530> matinee<00:03:07.040> drive<00:03:07.459> the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
matinee and have it matinee drive the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.630 
matinee and have it matinee drive the
animation<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:08.570> we're<00:03:08.780> going<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:08.959> do<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.640> in

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
animation so we're going to do is in

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.580 
animation so we're going to do is in
here<00:03:11.030> add<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.269> new<00:03:11.690> empty<00:03:11.870> group<00:03:12.260> we're<00:03:12.470> going

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
here add a new empty group we're going

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.690 
here add a new empty group we're going
to<00:03:12.650> call<00:03:12.800> it<00:03:12.950> character<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:15.350> in<00:03:16.040> here<00:03:16.459> add<00:03:16.670> a

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
to call it character and in here add a

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.140 
to call it character and in here add a
new<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.709> character<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.549> can<00:03:19.700> set<00:03:20.000> your

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
new in the character you can set your

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.410 
new in the character you can set your
animation<00:03:20.750> set<00:03:21.049> on<00:03:21.320> in<00:03:22.160> this<00:03:22.310> case<00:03:22.610> because<00:03:23.330> we

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
animation set on in this case because we

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.900 
animation set on in this case because we
already<00:03:23.540> have<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:23.780> selected<00:03:24.489> we<00:03:25.489> should<00:03:25.730> be

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
already have it selected we should be

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.449 
already have it selected we should be
able<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.180> use<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:28.549> animation<00:03:29.510> set<00:03:29.810> for<00:03:30.590> this

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
able to use the animation set for this

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.760 
able to use the animation set for this
character<00:03:32.350> it's<00:03:33.350> located<00:03:33.890> inside

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
character it's located inside

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.620 
character it's located inside
the<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:37.390> package<00:03:38.080> what<00:03:38.290> we<00:03:38.410> loaded<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:40.330> you

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
you click the green arrow it appears

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.300 
you click the green arrow it appears
right<00:03:48.610> here<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.420> notice<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.960> name<00:03:50.230> bit<00:03:50.950> zero

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
right here and notice the name bit zero

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.000 
right here and notice the name bit zero
one<00:03:51.550> shows<00:03:51.880> up<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:53.050> you<00:03:53.110> needed<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.530> find<00:03:53.800> that

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
one shows up so you needed to find that

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.620 
one shows up so you needed to find that
in<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.220> character<00:03:54.820> before<00:03:55.270> you<00:03:55.420> add<00:03:55.600> a

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
in the character before you add a

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.590 
in the character before you add a
control<00:03:56.070> control<00:03:57.070> track<00:03:57.490> and<00:03:58.210> in<00:03:58.270> the<00:03:58.360> control

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
control control track and in the control

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.920 
control control track and in the control
track<00:03:59.050> is<00:03:59.260> where<00:03:59.470> we<00:03:59.680> add<00:04:00.330> when<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.570> where

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
track is where we add when and where

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.380 
track is where we add when and where
that<00:04:02.170> animation<00:04:02.770> happens<00:04:03.130> from<00:04:03.310> zero<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:04.180> one

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
that animation happens from zero to one

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.140 
that animation happens from zero to one
seconds<00:04:04.960> so<00:04:05.560> at<00:04:05.680> one<00:04:05.860> second<00:04:06.400> if<00:04:06.490> I<00:04:06.640> hit<00:04:06.910> enter

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
seconds so at one second if I hit enter

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.270 
seconds so at one second if I hit enter
I<00:04:07.900> can<00:04:08.890> add<00:04:09.040> clause<00:04:09.720> sequence<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:11.280> clause

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
I can add clause sequence and clause

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.470 
I can add clause sequence and clause
sequence<00:04:12.820> should<00:04:13.420> behave<00:04:14.610> on<00:04:15.610> the<00:04:15.670> timeline

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
sequence should behave on the timeline

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.410 
sequence should behave on the timeline
so<00:04:16.780> bring<00:04:17.650> in<00:04:17.920> over<00:04:18.220> my<00:04:18.400> playhead<00:04:19.560> in<00:04:20.560> matinee

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
so bring in over my playhead in matinee

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.690 
so bring in over my playhead in matinee
zoom<00:04:22.420> out<00:04:22.600> here<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:23.080> can<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.650> can<00:04:24.040> complete<00:04:24.490> that

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
zoom out here I can I can complete that

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.020 
zoom out here I can I can complete that
whole<00:04:24.880> animation<00:04:25.980> as<00:04:26.980> I<00:04:27.040> drag<00:04:27.520> over<00:04:27.760> my

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
whole animation as I drag over my

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.630 
whole animation as I drag over my
timeline<00:04:28.510> so<00:04:29.380> that<00:04:29.410> should<00:04:29.800> play<00:04:30.100> in<00:04:30.400> the

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
timeline so that should play in the

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.620 
timeline so that should play in the
character<00:04:31.090> scene<00:04:31.360> so<00:04:31.720> if<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:31.870> hit<00:04:32.050> if<00:04:32.770> I<00:04:32.890> go<00:04:33.070> out

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
character scene so if I hit if I go out

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.400 
character scene so if I hit if I go out
inside<00:04:34.630> in<00:04:35.100> -<00:04:36.100> unreal<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.790> notice<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.020> if<00:04:38.260> I
