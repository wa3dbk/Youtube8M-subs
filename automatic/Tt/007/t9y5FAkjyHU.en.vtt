00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
interesting scene because kind of like

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.320 
interesting scene because kind of like
the<00:02:07.890> other<00:02:08.009> colossal<00:02:08.550> titan<00:02:08.879> she<00:02:09.000> has<00:02:09.090> all<00:02:09.300> of

this like steam erupting from everywhere
so<00:02:11.489> they<00:02:11.580> can't<00:02:11.760> really<00:02:11.879> get

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
so they can't really get

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.320 
so they can't really get
close<00:02:12.409> so<00:02:13.040> they<00:02:13.159> can't<00:02:13.310> really<00:02:13.489> see<00:02:13.670> like<00:02:13.700> who

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
close so they can't really see like who

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.179 
close so they can't really see like who
the<00:02:14.480> person<00:02:14.659> is<00:02:14.959> inside<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.530> Titan<00:02:15.860> or

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
the person is inside of the Titan or

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.190 
the person is inside of the Titan or
even<00:02:16.489> if<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:16.700> person<00:02:17.030> was<00:02:17.209> eaten<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:18.079> this

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200

retreat you know these people who can
transform<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.450> titans<00:02:38.780> obviously<00:02:39.260> when

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
transform the titans obviously when

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.149 
transform the titans obviously when
they're<00:02:39.590> they're<00:02:39.829> done<00:02:40.010> with<00:02:40.099> the

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
they're they're done with the

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.530 
they're they're done with the
transformation<00:02:40.730> they're<00:02:40.849> kind<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.060> weak<00:02:41.299> but

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
transformation they're kind of weak but

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.119 
transformation they're kind of weak but
if<00:02:41.629> they<00:02:41.720> had<00:02:41.810> 3d<00:02:42.079> maneuver<00:02:42.530> gear<00:02:42.560> they<00:02:43.069> could

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
if they had 3d maneuver gear they could

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.550 
if they had 3d maneuver gear they could
get<00:02:43.310> around<00:02:43.579> pretty<00:02:43.760> easily<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.540> that's<00:02:45.379> when

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
get around pretty easily and that's when

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.289 
get around pretty easily and that's when
we<00:02:45.650> clearly<00:02:45.980> figure<00:02:46.370> out<00:02:46.549> that<00:02:46.730> this<00:02:46.819> person

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
we clearly figure out that this person

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.729 
we clearly figure out that this person

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
week guys tension and build up is one of

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.020 
week guys tension and build up is one of
the<00:03:12.680> things<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.069> I<00:03:13.099> think<00:03:13.190> attack<00:03:13.549> on<00:03:13.730> titan

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
the things that I think attack on titan

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.270 
the things that I think attack on titan
does<00:03:14.209> really<00:03:14.720> really<00:03:14.959> well<00:03:15.109> it<00:03:16.040> definitely

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
does really really well it definitely

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.250 
does really really well it definitely
showed<00:03:16.639> a<00:03:16.669> lot<00:03:17.090> more<00:03:17.269> in<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.690> second<00:03:17.989> half<00:03:18.139> of

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
showed a lot more in the second half of

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.809 
showed a lot more in the second half of
the<00:03:18.319> episode<00:03:18.650> like<00:03:18.799> i<00:03:18.859> said<00:03:19.099> i<00:03:19.129> just<00:03:19.400> didn't

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
the episode like i said i just didn't

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.220 
the episode like i said i just didn't
really<00:03:19.940> care<00:03:20.180> for<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.480> first<00:03:20.510> half<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.019> much

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
really care for the first half that much

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.740 
really care for the first half that much
that's<00:03:21.859> just<00:03:22.099> me<00:03:22.280> personally<00:03:22.519> um<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.510> that's

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
that's just me personally um and that's

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.240 
that's just me personally um and that's
probably<00:03:23.930> just<00:03:24.319> because<00:03:24.410> all<00:03:24.799> the<00:03:24.889> characters

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
probably just because all the characters

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.559 
probably just because all the characters
are<00:03:25.370> sort<00:03:25.579> of<00:03:25.609> just<00:03:25.760> reacting<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.269> same<00:03:26.299> way

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
are sort of just reacting the same way

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.050 
are sort of just reacting the same way
I'm<00:03:26.750> kind<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:26.989> reacting<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.590> just<00:03:28.489> yeah<00:03:28.819> that's

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
I'm kind of reacting I just yeah that's

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.610 
I'm kind of reacting I just yeah that's
kind<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:29.269> crazy<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.690> just<00:03:29.989> I<00:03:30.139> want<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.500> see

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
kind of crazy I just I want to see

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.559 
kind of crazy I just I want to see
what's<00:03:30.799> happening<00:03:31.280> though<00:03:31.459> but<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.030> understand

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
what's happening though but I understand

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.330 
what's happening though but I understand
why<00:03:32.690> they're<00:03:32.900> doing<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.859> kind<00:03:34.129> of<00:03:34.190> wish

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
why they're doing it and I kind of wish

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.890 
why they're doing it and I kind of wish
they<00:03:34.519> would<00:03:34.699> delve<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.180> little<00:03:35.209> bit<00:03:35.510> more<00:03:35.720> into

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
they would delve a little bit more into

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.509 
they would delve a little bit more into
some<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.139> the<00:03:36.230> more<00:03:36.379> unknown<00:03:36.889> characters<00:03:37.400> that

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
some of the more unknown characters that

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.759 
some of the more unknown characters that
we<00:03:37.639> haven't<00:03:37.849> seen<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.090> lot<00:03:38.299> of<00:03:38.329> yet<00:03:38.660> like<00:03:39.260> Krista

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
we haven't seen a lot of yet like Krista

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.979 
we haven't seen a lot of yet like Krista
on<00:03:39.919> Ymir<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.669> Connie<00:03:40.940> they<00:03:41.540> don't<00:03:41.720> really<00:03:41.750> get

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
on Ymir and Connie they don't really get

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.050 
on Ymir and Connie they don't really get
to<00:03:42.109> say<00:03:42.379> that<00:03:42.680> much<00:03:42.949> they<00:03:43.160> do<00:03:43.220> get<00:03:43.430> lines<00:03:43.790> to

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
to say that much they do get lines to

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.759 
to say that much they do get lines to
say<00:03:44.209> but<00:03:44.269> it's<00:03:44.510> mostly<00:03:44.780> just<00:03:44.870> reacting<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.650> the

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
say but it's mostly just reacting to the

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.140 
say but it's mostly just reacting to the
things<00:03:45.949> that<00:03:46.129> are<00:03:46.220> going<00:03:46.340> on<00:03:46.549> around<00:03:46.609> them<00:03:47.030> I'd

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
first half of the episode little slow

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:50.770 
first half of the episode little slow
but<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.669> loved<00:04:49.970> everything<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.509> was<00:04:50.599> pretty
