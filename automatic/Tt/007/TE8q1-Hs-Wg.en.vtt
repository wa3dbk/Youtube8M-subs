00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.730
 good to all welcome to solutions 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.219
 informative online today I'm going to 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.670
 explain how you can partition the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.860
 sd card to be able to earn an extra 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.930
 memory to your phone as you know 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.849
 the samsung galaxy is therefore not available 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.039
 a lot of internal memory here you can see 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.740
 that has 106 megabytes of the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.810
 which we only have 75 free megabytes 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.350
 then it 's pretty little because now 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.910
 that we install so much of this 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.449
 applications like facebook whatsapp and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.390
 we're going to run out of memory 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.710
 then nothing what we are going to do is 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.159
 well first of all before doing this 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.530
 process 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.839
 you need to have the phone rooted 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.120
 for the following if you have not 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.229
 you still have it here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.150
 I'll leave some windows where you can 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:56.309
 install and download the root swell 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.839
 there you see it good then we are going to 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.900
 go the previous chapter we have seen how 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.030
 we can move to applications of the 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.760
 internal memory of the phone to the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.260
 sd card using the link 2 application 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.260
 sd or link tube 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.140
 in English then now let's see 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.640
 how can we do the same with the 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.500
 application that is called titanium backup 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.960
 then it is totally free the can 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.290
 download from play store and let's see 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.110
 how is this application for here we 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.480
 asks superuser permissions yes but 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 I'm super jussÃ  you have a video in the 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.060
 channel that explains how we allow 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.780
 the permissions and you're setting the the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.479
 things for some windows of 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.340
 welcome and so on when it's here 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.810
 you have three general tabs copy 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.040
 restore and scheduled tasks here 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.560
 above we are going to copy and restore them 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.080
 and here we have all the applications and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.480
 files needed for the runs 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.670
 system as I say you have to have a little 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.770
 be careful because for example here 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.020
 download manager are files 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.060
 packages that the android system needs 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.810
 to operate since being careful 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.640
 with what we do not see and touch before is a 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.330
 be careful and first of all insurance 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.740
 seeing what you do because this is 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.720
 playing with own files 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.740
 system then ok here I have a 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.860
 facebook application 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.310
 here you see only a warning icon but 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.040
 and that's how it goes, it's normal for it to come out 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.900
 then when the applications are 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.720
 on the sd card we will leave even with 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.850
 here like this is an sd card with 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.860
 the warning that come out in all 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:42.160
 then let's pass facebook to the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.550
 sd card voucher to save memory 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.490
 internal phone then it's very 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.140
 simple let's go to the application press and 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.450
 here we have a menu so here in the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.700
 menu what we have to do is good and 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.800
 you see that copy freeze uninstall 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.050
 here is a type obligation 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.270
 some of movistar or low that does not 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.710
 you want it to be on your phone 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.480
 you can extract from here giving 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.550
 superuser permissions and they are 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.220
 normally installs then also the 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.930
 typical tetris demo or modern 6 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.160
 I make a game that you do not want because 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.400
 you do not know, you can also be 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.960
 here but to move the application to the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.720
 sd card we do not sell chores 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.980
 we pass the finger we go to options there 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.260
 you see special options are not granted 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.020
 three months then the user and here 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.000
 we have a lot of options to do 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.700
 we have in general is by closures 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.170
 forced tablet labels and so on 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.480
 you will also be interested will be here 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.550
 where does storage have we delete 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.840
 cache to erase the data from which 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.430
 save the application from the cache 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.640
 explore etcetera and the window the option 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.310
 forgiveness that interests us is to be moving to 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.480
 that way you are watching him move to that 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.520
 then nothing click here is already 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.160
 processing is granted the permits of 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.670
 superuser and this nothing in thing of 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.760
 less than two minutes 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.190
 the sd card is processed and moved 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.450
 depending on the application it will 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.959
 take a little more a little less 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.410
 but when it's over there's no no 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.510
 there is no problem 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.360
 well here as you see finally 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.700
 is in the facebook application in the 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.260
 sd card there you see the icon that is in 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.640
 the card from here you can also 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.310
 make a backup or if 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.280
 you want then pressing you have to copy 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.250
 etc 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.840
