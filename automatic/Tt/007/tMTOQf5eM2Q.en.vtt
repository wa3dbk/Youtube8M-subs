00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.610

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
 Use lanes at home 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.790

 6 o 6 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.660
 It feels very similar to this Slater winding 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.360
 Seriously Suka physician fader 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.780
 To the power 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.260
 How about try to actually touch or place of Peida 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:26.740
 Again that is I'm Tteyuu on the last name of my 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:31.180
 It's no does not matter it does not first and say 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:35.109
 So I'd think it's quite famous Well Anyway those who are scratch 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.930
 That Tteyuu have the fader that dif hs 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:41.730
 To say Ino Vader mini

 Not mean to like a child version of what is or I well faders are mounted not put 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.510
 Is not there 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.489
 So another Hubert also much to recommend 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.819
 I say that the scratch of the scratch is good enough in the 20,000 yen Mass 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.769
 Imai Hanamone is it? 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:03.400
 It is part but I think that's what has become a very hot topic at that kind of thing 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:09.390
 It is dark but the Japanese Islands arm already 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.390
 I actually felt it was smooth or clean when I touched it 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.630
 Yes 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.440
 Kuni' to Ku Come on another that 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.440
 It sounds too good as it is ending pattern I'll Do Ya Oh and you were always 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.030
 I really struggle with such a race page 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.060
 Natsumi Sir N' 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.010
 Vesta falls if it is a long time ago 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.860
 That technique is about to stay 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.480
 It seems that hot rolled 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.740
 Close to selling land vestar 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.050
 Well Dora room felt this Bester 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.590
 We close in 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:59.320
 Because Oh Some people do not know the Tteyuu the cut lag 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.720
 There are 4 guys out of Vader 's broad-spoiled light , so it's broken or broken here 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:07.810
 From a place such as cut a thousand 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:13.350
 That's right I'm Ne play does it Natsumi that the present What's the total comes to close to the vest 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:17.739
 Well, it's made quite thick, so this part of the fader itself 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.760
 Is it the story of Tasser? 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.730
 It sounds like heavy noodles and something like money 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.410
 Now I see 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:31.139
 I just wanted to say that it was used Bester but the rest is ok 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.860
 If you want to use it in the future 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.860
 Smoothly 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.449
 It feels like it can be used 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.300
 Feel of the fader 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:46.629
 The loosest of 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.500
 A state that I can afford together 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.340
 Oh 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.340
 I see . 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.500
 What the radar 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:03.770
 It is pretty good to say that fade out while clicking curve 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.770
 I think it does not matter if it is Kamo streak 9 baht 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.770
 I guess it happened to sk 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.800
 Continued to be science 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:17.830
 It sounds like a song but it is more than leaves 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:22.110
 Text ex different loss and damage tools 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.110
 The eq's too big 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:29.520
 Ah I see you 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:34.590
 Nu also ne old high of Ekura but I have seen 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:37.190
 I wonder how sharp I want to be. 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:41.509
 It is the knob of that equalizer 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:44.340
 Really twice as much as that kind of Vesta 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:48.510
 Kana about 1.5 times the Batada 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.940
 There are 10 times the feeling, but the feeling of good voice diameter 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.440
 I can only play a fine act 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.580
 To use anything like two scratch 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.430
 Is there 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.680
 I think it's an ant 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.740

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.740
