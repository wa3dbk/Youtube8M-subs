made out of metal nice red cord and
that's<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.180> bit<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.390> goes<00:02:37.630> around<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.260> you

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
that's the bit that goes around and you

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.380 
that's the bit that goes around and you
can<00:02:38.590> pull<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.280> adjust<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.360> that

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
can pull that and adjust it so that

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.380 
can pull that and adjust it so that

a blue one for the left-hand side not
sure<00:03:14.769> why<00:03:14.920> they're<00:03:15.100> color<00:03:15.340> coded<00:03:15.400> but<00:03:15.880> they

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
sure why they're color coded but they

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.270 
sure why they're color coded but they
are<00:03:16.090> really<00:03:16.959> heavy<00:03:17.260> as<00:03:17.440> well<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:17.830> you<00:03:17.920> can<00:03:18.040> tell

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
are really heavy as well so you can tell

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.250 
are really heavy as well so you can tell
they're<00:03:18.430> good<00:03:18.640> quality<00:03:18.820> by<00:03:19.600> just<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.080> weight

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
they're good quality by just the weight

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.290 
they're good quality by just the weight
on<00:03:20.410> their<00:03:20.560> own<00:03:20.709> now<00:03:21.580> I<00:03:21.610> did<00:03:21.820> have<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.060> choice

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
on their own now I did have the choice

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.820 
on their own now I did have the choice
of<00:03:22.480> either<00:03:22.570> these<00:03:22.930> or<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.590> tours<00:03:24.209> which<00:03:25.209> are

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
of either these or the tours which are

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.930 
of either these or the tours which are
the<00:03:26.830> other<00:03:27.010> monster<00:03:27.430> headphones<00:03:27.760> they're

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
the other monster headphones they're

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.640 
the other monster headphones they're
slightly<00:03:28.209> more<00:03:28.330> expensive<00:03:28.390> than<00:03:28.930> these<00:03:29.050> but

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
slightly more expensive than these but

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.990 
slightly more expensive than these but
it<00:03:29.709> turns<00:03:29.920> out<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.160> tours<00:03:30.430> after<00:03:30.700> doing<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:30.910> lot

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
it turns out the tours after doing a lot

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000 
it turns out the tours after doing a lot
of<00:03:31.060> research<00:03:31.269> they've<00:03:31.720> made<00:03:31.840> out<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.050> plastic

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
of research they've made out of plastic

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.420 
of research they've made out of plastic
and<00:03:33.190> they<00:03:33.340> do<00:03:33.400> break<00:03:33.820> quite<00:03:34.239> easily<00:03:34.450> so<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:36.220> went

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
and they do break quite easily so I went

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.160 
and they do break quite easily so I went
for<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.670> beats<00:03:36.940> instead<00:03:37.390> they're<00:03:37.989> just

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
for the beats instead they're just

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.080 
for the beats instead they're just
sturdier<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.920> they<00:03:39.190> perform<00:03:39.580> pretty<00:03:39.850> much

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
sturdier and they perform pretty much

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.720 
sturdier and they perform pretty much
exactly<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.750> same<00:03:41.250> there<00:03:42.250> are<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.430> lot<00:03:42.700> of

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
exactly the same there are a lot of

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.580 
exactly the same there are a lot of
fakes<00:03:43.120> around<00:03:43.510> as<00:03:43.660> well<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:43.989> if<00:03:44.080> you<00:03:44.170> guys<00:03:44.320> do

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
fakes around as well so if you guys do

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.320 
fakes around as well so if you guys do
want<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.830> buy<00:03:44.950> yourself<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.400> set<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:46.000> these<00:03:46.090> and

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
want to buy yourself a set of these and

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.910 
want to buy yourself a set of these and
the<00:03:46.720> price<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.080> normally<00:03:47.230> too<00:03:47.500> good<00:03:47.739> to<00:03:47.830> be

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
the price is normally too good to be

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.370 
the price is normally too good to be
true<00:03:47.950> or<00:03:48.430> going<00:03:48.850> really<00:03:49.000> cheap<00:03:49.360> then<00:03:49.870> probably

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
true or going really cheap then probably

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.960 
true or going really cheap then probably
you<00:03:50.530> want<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.739> stay<00:03:50.890> away<00:03:51.040> with<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.310> stay

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
you want to stay away with that stay

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.550 
you want to stay away with that stay
away<00:03:52.120> from<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.360> because<00:03:52.570> then<00:03:53.049> it's<00:03:53.380> most

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
away from that because then it's most

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.860 
away from that because then it's most
likely<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.860> fake<00:03:54.299> these<00:03:55.299> were<00:03:55.450> bought<00:03:55.660> in<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
likely a fake these were bought in the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.110 
likely a fake these were bought in the
high<00:03:55.989> street<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:56.799> they're<00:03:57.220> definitely<00:03:57.519> real

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
high street so they're definitely real

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.280 
high street so they're definitely real
and<00:03:58.980> they<00:03:59.980> just<00:04:00.160> looked<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:00.760> nice<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.540> I've

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
and they just looked so nice and I've

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.990 
and they just looked so nice and I've
tried<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.560> set<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.860> these<00:04:02.950> before<00:04:03.400> not<00:04:03.910> this

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
tried a set of these before not this

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.640 
tried a set of these before not this
exact<00:04:04.480> one<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.810> eye<00:04:04.840> beats<00:04:05.140> but<00:04:05.350> a<00:04:05.380> very

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
exact one the eye beats but a very

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.500 
exact one the eye beats but a very
similar<00:04:06.340> set<00:04:06.519> which<00:04:06.670> are<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:06.880> same<00:04:07.090> spec<00:04:07.480> of

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
similar set which are the same spec of

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.440 
similar set which are the same spec of
these<00:04:07.900> just<00:04:08.530> not<00:04:08.709> I<00:04:08.739> think<00:04:09.330> enabled<00:04:10.330> or

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
these just not I think enabled or

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.370 
these just not I think enabled or
compatible<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:12.100> they<00:04:12.220> sound<00:04:12.549> absolutely

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
compatible and they sound absolutely

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.990 
compatible and they sound absolutely
amazing<00:04:14.380> like<00:04:14.890> at<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.250> moment<00:04:15.400> I've<00:04:15.610> got<00:04:15.640> sign

amazing like at the moment I've got sign

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.289 
amazing like at the moment I've got sign
