00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.550
 on a little video a little bit 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.319
 special wimille subscribers 1 as we have 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.269
 spent barding yes they are worried 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.530
 I did not have much time to do 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:36.920
 videos during the holidays but 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.210
 I'm trying to do anyway 2 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.769
 also because there is my pc that in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.390
 falling apart because I 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.809
 have to redo each big duo 1 5 6 times 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.309
 belly your kidneys a good a good rendering 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.030
 no display bug like on the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.190
 last video 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.989
 in addition to it plays but in video 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.989
 we'll say 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.289
 it's an episode of wakfu it's 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.960
 episode 2 wakfu trick the heliotrope there 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.640
 for those who want to know 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.079
 just simply wimille ben I 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.220
 would like to thank you because it's 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.470
 really huge 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.820
 finally I imagine is really not happen 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.240
 a day to subscribers wimille when I 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 started on youtube besides it's not 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.259
 because we come to wimille than that 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.030
 it increases less and less precisely 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.270
 it increases faster and faster but 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.899
 in a way it's just amazing 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.320
 it's just monstrous when the city and 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:34.820
 ten thousand from here not even I would have 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.549
 already the attacks I think well and them 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:43.740
 and so that's it for the 8000 I'm 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.450
 I said I was going to ask you 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 do a little FAQ that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.899
 it's a little fashion for the moment 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.189
 because it's been a long time since I 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.869
 not done I had already made one or 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.240
 two when I was older when I was a 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.240
 little less known at the very beginning of genre 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.969
 to 1000 1500 subscribers but now but 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.549
 I want to simply ask me 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.900
 ask the questions you want 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.180
 to know about me 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.670
 and I will try to answer it live at 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.010
 my opinion I will warn you before 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.540
 manage to do that well 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:18.370
 so besides that I think that 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.220
 unfortunately for those who followed 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.850
 my web to series with with after 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.410
 unfortunately I will have to stop it 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.930
 but it's for questions 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.510
 of organization since here we arrive 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.980
 not to get organized with school and everything 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.530
 to be able to shoot the episodes 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.950
 so either we stop it or we'll have to 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.850
 really wait for a good while before 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.850
 continue especially me I have how 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.500
 to say I deleted the little hop while 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.510
 transferring the equipment on the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.209
 bag nothing to worry about that but I 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.950
 deleted the little because ever 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.250
 need so much more to make a 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.770
 character gruff our series on suez 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.380
 so I delete them it will just take 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:11.500
 that I buy at a slot sit down 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:13.330
 raspail 1 and what else yahia on the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.040
 video yahia alley that made grow 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.100
 is a tree pretty quickly would have 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.760
 believed in in asterix mission cleopatra 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.860
 in vain so are what I had 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.489
 want to tell you also ah yes for 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.280
 information I ordered there are two 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.040
 weeks and a half I would say a new 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.550

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.060

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.720
 micro what the heck the x9 in fact it's 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.420
 a micro usb that classifies there 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.040
 professionals and a site that a 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.480
 anti filter to really have a 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.910
 super quality in and I thought 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.670
 bounce notice otherwise here is my computer 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.590
 hangs there in the end 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.650
 March early April when it will be my 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.769

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.039
 sick you will see 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.840

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:32.750
 a contest in not a long time 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:37.580

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.430
 against i noticed that in my ma 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.740
 small series and chronicles 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:02.389

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.099
 one that there were a lot of people who 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.220

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.630

 try to continue the series 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.080
 the problem is again for 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.130
 the renderings so I'll try to 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.110
 defer a maximum and I try to do 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.909
 the best I can because that's what 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.580
 this is not me who does not want cpc 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.500
 who does not want you can have made I 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.659
 you say pretty much that see rendered from a 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.330
 video about twenty minutes 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:43.280
 it takes between 5 and 6 hours of rendering and 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:45.680
 for the pcb he has a little trouble pursuing 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.130
 it goes a little bit in pc you that a dual 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.699
 core with a small stone gtx 110 a 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.030
 something like 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:56.419
 i have a little too much what to a pc more 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.090

 new pc that really change the life I 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.659

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.850
 very little time so 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:11.020
