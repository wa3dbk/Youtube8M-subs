00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.920 
my phone this is no hoax now over here
my<00:05:21.170> phone<00:05:21.350> is<00:05:21.500> done<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:22.450> again<00:05:23.450> you<00:05:23.750> probably

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
my phone is done and again you probably

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.750 
my phone is done and again you probably
can't<00:05:24.350> see<00:05:24.530> it<00:05:24.560> but<00:05:24.830> it<00:05:24.980> still<00:05:25.280> says<00:05:25.550> two

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
can't see it but it still says two

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.020 
can't see it but it still says two
dollars<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.180> ninety<00:05:26.210> two<00:05:26.420> cent<00:05:26.810> I<00:05:27.940> wish<00:05:28.940> I

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
dollars and ninety two cent I wish I

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.520 
dollars and ninety two cent I wish I
could<00:05:29.180> get<00:05:29.300> some<00:05:29.690> way<00:05:29.810> for<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.140> read<00:05:30.350> that

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
could get some way for you to read that

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.770 
could get some way for you to read that
but<00:05:30.770> you<00:05:30.920> really<00:05:31.220> can't<00:05:31.520> make<00:05:32.180> if<00:05:32.270> I<00:05:32.330> cooked<00:05:32.630> it

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
but you really can't make if I cooked it

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:40.570 
but you really can't make if I cooked it
a<00:05:32.810> little<00:05:32.960> bit<00:05:37.330> you<00:05:38.330> can<00:05:38.450> almost<00:05:38.600> read<00:05:38.870> it<00:05:39.580> but

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
a little bit you can almost read it but

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.380 
a little bit you can almost read it but
I<00:05:40.640> assure<00:05:41.030> you<00:05:41.060> I<00:05:41.950> swear<00:05:42.950> to<00:05:43.190> you<00:05:43.340> I<00:05:43.610> wasn't

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
I assure you I swear to you I wasn't

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.510 
I assure you I swear to you I wasn't
swear<00:05:44.720> if<00:05:44.840> it<00:05:44.960> wasn't<00:05:45.200> true<00:05:45.380> that<00:05:45.680> it<00:05:46.220> still

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
swear if it wasn't true that it still

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.360 
swear if it wasn't true that it still
says<00:05:46.790> two<00:05:46.970> dollars<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.300> ninety<00:05:47.330> two<00:05:47.510> cent

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
says two dollars and ninety two cent

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.590 
says two dollars and ninety two cent
okay<00:05:49.370> so<00:05:49.610> that's<00:05:49.790> the<00:05:49.880> first<00:05:49.910> way<00:05:50.300> in<00:05:50.510> the

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
okay so that's the first way in the

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.860 
okay so that's the first way in the
second<00:05:50.960> way<00:05:51.080> which<00:05:51.530> is<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:51.830> most<00:05:52.750> common<00:05:53.750> way

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
second way which is the most common way

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.950 
second way which is the most common way
that<00:05:53.900> people<00:05:54.110> know<00:05:54.470> about<00:05:54.500> is<00:05:55.100> simply<00:05:55.760> to<00:05:56.210> send

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
that people know about is simply to send

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.000 
that people know about is simply to send
a<00:05:57.080> link<00:05:57.350> to<00:05:57.560> yourself

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
a link to yourself

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.190 
a link to yourself
here<00:05:58.550> are<00:05:58.670> my<00:05:58.730> set<00:05:58.940> messages<00:05:59.390> as<00:05:59.540> you<00:05:59.960> can<00:06:00.050> see

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
here are my set messages as you can see

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:11.190 
here are my set messages as you can see
um<00:06:04.180> it<00:06:05.380> says<00:06:06.460> HTTP<00:06:08.050> WWL

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:20.120 

and<00:06:13.630> resend<00:06:14.630> it<00:06:15.820> resend

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.500 

so<00:06:21.130> this<00:06:21.370> only<00:06:21.580> works<00:06:21.820> with<00:06:22.000> the<00:06:22.030> newer<00:06:22.210> phones

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
so this only works with the newer phones

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.270 
so this only works with the newer phones
that<00:06:22.720> supports<00:06:23.139> links<00:06:23.500> inside<00:06:23.740> of<00:06:23.830> messages

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
that supports links inside of messages

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.430 
that supports links inside of messages
so<00:06:24.880> the<00:06:25.030> order<00:06:25.210> phones<00:06:25.450> from<00:06:25.750> like<00:06:25.900> 2005

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
so the order phones from like 2005

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.230 
so the order phones from like 2005
probably<00:06:26.860> won't<00:06:27.040> support<00:06:27.310> it<00:06:27.460> but<00:06:27.880> this<00:06:28.060> one

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
probably won't support it but this one

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.780 
probably won't support it but this one
does<00:06:28.450> my<00:06:29.110> crazier<00:06:29.590> on<00:06:29.740> their<00:06:29.860> other<00:06:30.220> hand<00:06:30.520> does

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
does my crazier on their other hand does

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.780 
does my crazier on their other hand does
not<00:06:30.820> support<00:06:31.389> it<00:06:31.600> anyway<00:06:32.590> you<00:06:33.130> open<00:06:33.370> it<00:06:33.460> up<00:06:33.580> and

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
not support it anyway you open it up and

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.120 
not support it anyway you open it up and
the<00:06:34.120> link<00:06:34.480> is<00:06:34.720> underlined<00:06:35.200> you<00:06:35.440> just<00:06:35.680> press

the link is underlined you just press

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.440 
the link is underlined you just press
the<00:06:36.280> down<00:06:36.430> button<00:06:36.460> so<00:06:36.850> that<00:06:37.000> highlights<00:06:37.360> the

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
the down button so that highlights the

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.200 
the down button so that highlights the
link<00:06:37.660> like<00:06:37.810> that<00:06:38.020> and<00:06:38.200> you<00:06:38.260> just<00:06:38.290> press<00:06:38.530> ok<00:06:38.860> and

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.800

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.490 
still two dollars and ninety two cent

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.540 
still two dollars and ninety two cent
even<00:07:36.490> though<00:07:36.580> you<00:07:36.640> can't<00:07:36.940> read<00:07:37.150> it<00:07:37.270> I<00:07:38.550> promise

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:45.880 
so that's two separate ways to get on

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.490 
so that's two separate ways to get on
browse<00:07:46.330> mother's<00:07:46.720> internet<00:07:46.990> for<00:07:47.140> free<00:07:47.320> so

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:52.660 
anywhere you want to for free I haven't

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.030 
anywhere you want to for free I haven't
really<00:07:52.840> tested<00:07:52.990> this<00:07:53.260> on<00:07:53.380> many<00:07:53.590> phones<00:07:53.830> but

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.040 
really tested this on many phones but

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.950 
really tested this on many phones but
every<00:07:54.250> phone<00:07:54.430> I've<00:07:54.550> used<00:07:54.760> so<00:07:54.880> far<00:07:55.150> at<00:07:55.420> least

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:55.960 
every phone I've used so far at least

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.980 
every phone I've used so far at least
one<00:07:56.260> of<00:07:56.380> these<00:07:56.470> methods<00:07:56.950> work<00:07:57.220> so<00:07:58.150> if<00:07:58.570> you<00:07:58.810> have

00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:58.990 
one of these methods work so if you have
