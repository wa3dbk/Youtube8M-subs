00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
trees a river to float down brother and

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.710 
trees a river to float down brother and
I<00:00:15.589> decided<00:00:16.009> that<00:00:16.279> we<00:00:16.670> would<00:00:16.849> float<00:00:17.300> down<00:00:17.540> this

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.990 
I decided that we would float down this
river<00:00:17.990> take<00:00:18.529> advantage<00:00:18.980> of<00:00:19.160> our<00:00:19.279> buoyancy<00:00:19.640> on

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
river take advantage of our buoyancy on

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.330 
river take advantage of our buoyancy on
the<00:00:20.330> greenbrier<00:00:20.779> river<00:00:20.990> get<00:00:21.740> strong<00:00:22.099> in

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
the greenbrier river get strong in

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.800 
the greenbrier river get strong in
certain<00:00:22.669> points<00:00:23.029> but<00:00:23.210> it's<00:00:23.359> nothing<00:00:23.539> that<00:00:23.689> we

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
certain points but it's nothing that we

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.240 
certain points but it's nothing that we
couldn't<00:00:24.080> handle<00:00:24.350> my<00:00:24.500> brother<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:24.890> I<00:00:24.949> decided

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
couldn't handle my brother and I decided

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.710 
couldn't handle my brother and I decided
to<00:00:25.430> take<00:00:25.550> this<00:00:25.730> floating<00:00:26.150> trip<00:00:26.480> in<00:00:26.630> the

knowing<00:00:54.230> that<00:00:54.350> all<00:00:54.500> we<00:00:54.620> would<00:00:54.770> have<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:55.070> do<00:00:55.219> is

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
knowing that all we would have to do is

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.360 
knowing that all we would have to do is
locate<00:00:56.030> our<00:00:56.480> dock<00:00:56.780> on<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.260> right<00:00:57.410> side<00:00:57.739> and

locate our dock on the right side and

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.340 
locate our dock on the right side and
get<00:00:58.640> on<00:00:58.789> out<00:00:58.820> because<00:00:59.600> how<00:00:59.719> dark<00:00:59.960> could<00:01:00.109> it<00:01:00.199> get

get on out because how dark could it get

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.830 
get on out because how dark could it get
answer<00:01:01.039> dark<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:01.760> we<00:01:01.789> inevitably<00:01:02.090> passed<00:01:02.660> the

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
answer dark so we inevitably passed the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.060 
answer dark so we inevitably passed the
damn<00:01:03.020> doc<00:01:03.260> because<00:01:03.500> there's<00:01:03.800> no<00:01:03.920> other

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070
