00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.490
 hello today we are cooking greek 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.879
 the dish is called midi from sagana first 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.610
 turn on the stove by business 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.699
 pour 140 grams of olive oil 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.290
 better than the first cold press and 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.720
 we start to warm it up naturally 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.289
 we need midi because fresh 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.390
 mussels in our area no we take midi 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.880
 frozen we will need tomatoes 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.079
 or here is such a substitute for tomatoes then 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.629
 there are grated tomatoes 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.700
 it's all such a very nice piece 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:43.670
 Greek fett I managed to buy 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.440
 store greens oregano salt pepper 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.730
 black ground 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.200
 and here is such a ceramic saucepan 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.270
 while my oil is heating up somewhat 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.149
 words about the recipe that I now 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.280
 realize the fact is that any recipe 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.010
 national cuisine but greek 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.870
 Italian anybody in general yes he 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.149
 adapted to the area in which 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.130
 people live and respectively 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.170
 for example in greek cuisine in 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.020
 Saganaki's classic mussel recipe 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.389
 which I'll post in the description of the rabbit 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.520
 naturally used tomatoes yes but 

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:19.369
 Greek tomatoes well, imagine them on 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.799
 unnaturally did not cause the sauce they mrs 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.590
 I mean you, but these are really tomatoes 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.520
 but these are the shops and therefore I am their 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.770
 use not by 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.630
 in order to replace tomatoes i 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.600
 I use just ready such here 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.229
 rubbed already tomatoes checked 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.770
 it's ok and it's quick about 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.159
 and just then we got bread 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.479
 him 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.479
 so wonderful 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.980
 bread we need to cool now 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.160
 Now we are on the left with mussels 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.700
 just wondrous wrap it up 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.340
 napkin and cool the grill but for now 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.320
 do mussels 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.470
 well one more thing the fact is that in 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.750
 Greece oregano is added to this dish 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.310
 which grows fresh fresh there with us 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.520
 no such guys so we will 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.220
 add dry oregano but to the greens 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.520
 all the same was present add dill 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.860
 Well now that I'm doing well and 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.170

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.990
 oregano or what dill can be in 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.000
 Greek mussels ah saganaki is not needed here 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.400

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.620
 the case is not rubbed here when I do it all 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.590
 told explain that this is still my 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.820
 a variation of the Greek dish I added 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.250
 pureed tomatoes 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.170
 heated up olive oil and now it's 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.080
 everything needs to be well mixed 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.420
 turn this time a nice tasty 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.459
 flavored sauce 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.800
 need some salt to our sauce well 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.770
 salt a little remember that after all feta 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.780
 we are quite salty 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.239
 general and fresh midi it is cooked very 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.760
 quickly by these those we buy in 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.890
 store cooked and frozen and in fact 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.700
 need now only so that they but bring 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.890
 them to a boil and you can already remove the plate 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.030
 Well, in the meantime, I will do what on 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.790

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.530
 big cubes well i'm drinking greek 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.660

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.769
 stir with a spoon of midi saganaki cook 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.230

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.970
 Greece, and so want to leave as soon as possible 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.150

 someone like the counter, but no 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.210
 for my taste too much pepper is not necessary 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.190
 it is necessary that there was only shades 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.940

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:05.120

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.620
 so we are the oven for me after 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.230

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:47.710
 because it is still feta cuts off 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:53.990

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.220
 I still have no greens in the garden 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.140
 I honestly do not know the Greeks at all 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.210

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.650

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.650
