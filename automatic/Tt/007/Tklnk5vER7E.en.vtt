00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.840
 this week good to be able to find 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.630
 south we will simply have to come 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.280
 to where the vanguards are and 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.500
 here in the part on the right we're going to 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.930
 south to find the agent 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.130
 nine so let's talk to him 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.830
 well let's ar that brought this week 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.390
 and anyway I think no one 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.550
 is very interesting as the bride is going 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.440
 He brought the skull but good of these 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.569
 ways this week work things 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.280
 interesting I 'm going to talk about 

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:41.230
 them good first thing is the helmet for 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.809
 the visitor this dlc they are called 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.280
 eternal warrior and his first best is 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.260
 that increases the energy for the super 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.199
 obtained by killing spirits of the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.199
 darkness fills the health by picking up a 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.659
 Orb light and unstoppable to the fist of 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.519
 good chaos this helmet is pretty good 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.609
 martÃ­ so much and I already have it for that reason 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.260
 the gold to buy but this one helps us 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.600
 have the super fastest kill 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.850
 enemies in the pib and osea nazaire their 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.860
 missions and also it also helps us 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.380
 regenerate our health to the record 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.960
 of light can serve us for crucible for 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.660
 jumps missions and of course the root 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.940
 from the end of chalk at level 33 that is in 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.080
 the place where we do not recover health or 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.120
 it can also be useful for us 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.910
 presidio the elders land and for 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.650
 The last one is that he gives unstoppable fist 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.210
 of chaos this serves us so that the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.670
 moment we are going to throw the fist of 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.120
 chaos that is the titan's supertel 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.790
 assailant then they can shoot us 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.470
 can give hits and whatever and is 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.290
 very difficult to get killed then it is 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.780
 unstoppable so let's always throw 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.420
 our our fist of chaos then 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.090
 the second helmet was very good 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.369
 it's the third man's mask and it's from 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.410
 the original version of the game but 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.790
 also brings this infusion improvement that 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.070
 it can also serve the people who 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.020
 as I said, they may be in need 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.690
 a helmet to make the end network 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.430
 crete or it can serve them to do the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.070
 receive social or can help them already 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.560
 that can regenerate your health at the moment 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.630
 to pick up a north of light besides this 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.790
 helmet help to increase speed 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.950
 of melee attacks and the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.490
 downhill attacks with using less energy 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.110
 for the 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.420
 but yes it is also a good helmet 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.210
 to use the crucible since the 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.090
 deaths that we make or the attacks that 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.860
 we do with the arch sheet as they go to 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.350
 consume less energy from the super 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.880
 I think it's pretty good so 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.140
 I recommend this helmet for all those who 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.880
 they do not have what it is like 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.280
 original version I imagine that already the 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.590
 most have it and then we go with 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.680
 is that chest armor for the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.320
 sorcerer that from the first tlc well 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.760
 that we are not going to see this increases the 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.370
 amount of ammunition you can give for 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.050
 fusion rifles the second best 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.270
 increases the amount of ammunition that 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.070
 can carry for heavy weapons and for 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.880
 last one gets a fusion grenade 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.830
 additional 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.990
 good this this armor can you 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.940
 help more than anything for these 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.250
 two improvements so it can carry more 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.750
 heavy ammunition and they get a grenade 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.730
 of additional function that can 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.920
 help quite less civilians to 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.540
 help in the crucible and good equal in 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.340
 any other activity this is the 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.620
 only improvement that not since the officer of 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.260
 production are still useful but really 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.730
 they are not used too much so if 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.470
 Soon they like to use the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.670
 fusion fuses can serve them but 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.250
 more than anything 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.410
 is for these two best good then 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.690
 let's move on let's go for the lord 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.340
 of thunder is the third time or the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.020
 the second time he brings her suits the 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.739
 the second time he brings it no more he has 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.090
 brought more times so it's pretty 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.610
 good for all the people who 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.220
 it takes I really have a 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.069
 curse with the lord of the throne he won 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.760
 almost every week so I do not think 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.760
 buy it and never again the region was in 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.830
 raid I was assaulted alive was then the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.959
 extra teacher and now it's pretty good 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.600
 It's a machine gun that I like a lot 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.910
 and it has a lot of power or a lot 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.830
 damage when it is 100% improved if not 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.380
 they have it is a very good machine gun 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.030
 to complete for example assault the 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.790
 case or any other activity that 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.610
 may need the damage this from 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.039
 Electrical and this helps a lot because webber 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.590
 the first improvement of this machine gun 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.539
 is that casualties with this weapon accelerates 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.090
 the recharge speed during a 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.610
 short time and the next improvement is 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.620
 The longer you keep the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.860
 faster and more accurate trigger will be to be 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.530
 which means that every time 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.150
 we are firing while we are more 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.310
 The longer we leave the 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.560
 trigger because more accurate is going to do this 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.320
 gun and that's pretty good because 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.150
 usually the machine guns as well as 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.070
 that bounce too much and you bullets 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.500
 not the very precise ones but with this improvement 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.810
 it's much more accurate I really like it 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.090
 a lot is like machine guns my 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.800
 favorite to do activities not so much 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.710
 for the crucible for the floor I like them 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.960
 others less others but to do 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.240
 activities like raid like raid yes 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.389
 it is also good to do for example 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.099
 assault case or heroic assaults this is 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.129
 a very good weapon and I recommend it to 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.279
 everyone 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:14.139
 well now we move on to what it generated 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.089
 storms do not need that so 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.369
 well for the people who also need 

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:20.679
 can serve you and remember that if 

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:23.469
 you do not have many fragments in 

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:26.169
 this dlc we are going to use them then 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:28.330
 Well, maybe they can agree to go 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.239
 buying a few since with that 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.610
 we will be able to improve what would be the 

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:35.229
 weapons that we have at this moment the 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.929
 we want the ones we want to convert 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.399
 for the second year not only the 

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:42.369
 weapons that have that possibility do not 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:46.119
 are all for example in the last 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:48.039
 Word the hot fly with moon and good 

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:50.800
 There are several that I have already mentioned 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.300
 destination hype so these weapons are going to 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.159
 enter institutional fragments for 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.300
 can convert them to the second year like this 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.159
 that I recommend you buy 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.749
 a few also do not spend all currencies 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.610
 in this but if they are buying some 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:03.729
 few if I do lack 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.069
 I am about 60 and obviously I will continue 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.319
 having but for the people that makes it 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:09.789
 lack is pretty good and as 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.009
 always then bring one in grass 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.779
 exceptional this time brought armor 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.580
 of chest so if you are looking for a 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:18.580
 special some 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.520
 one of these exceptional prints by 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.319
 good light specks besides that brings 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.169
 like every week the consumables 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.389
 then I was extracting telemetries for 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.580
 automatic rifles telemetry for 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.949
 pulse rifles and telemetry for 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.960
 launch rockets we also bring known 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:37.000
 the colors milestones for your super hummingbird 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.139
 so that they no longer have controls 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.180
 coloring is then simply 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.759
 they buy this they put it on and they already have 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.340
 a hummingbird of legend is also the 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:47.409
 Synthetic recharge of heavy ammunition like this 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.690
 that can also be a good option 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:51.580
 If they already have everyone they can buy this 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.840
 ammunition to the south and good so calm 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.599
 to do raids and all the rest 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.430
 activities and as always is the road of 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:59.590
 century that is to give two strange coins 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.150
 with a speck of light and therefore do not 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.680
 I recommend if you need light spots 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.780
 remember that they can go to change all 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.789
 the ascending and radiant materials 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:10.000
 with the speaker and they come here they buy 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:11.710
 south as these these in grams and is 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.150
 what they were looking for and well 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.159
 guys, that's what works a week 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.750
 really not many things are going to 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:19.000
 surprise already with the exit of the grab 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.880
 I think it was the biggest surprise 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.740
 until the time of the game but good 

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.720
 keep bringing good weapons still 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.880
 bringing good armor for the people 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.080
 that maybe he does not have everything and those who 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.640
 we have everything because it will not surprise us 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.860
 absolutely nothing will not interest us 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.540
 but for the people who are so far 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.980
 knowing things is a great thing 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.630
