tonight but I think emotions were
running<00:05:41.200> high<00:05:41.380> especially<00:05:41.740> after<00:05:42.160> the<00:05:42.490> the

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
running high especially after the the

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.730 
running high especially after the the
previous<00:05:43.000> game<00:05:43.420> when<00:05:43.630> they<00:05:44.350> made<00:05:44.500> it<00:05:44.590> quite

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
now obviously Tyler Pierre seemed very

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.280 
now obviously Tyler Pierre seemed very
inexperienced<00:06:12.430> in<00:06:13.060> terms<00:06:13.270> of<00:06:13.480> the<00:06:13.780> season<00:06:14.110> and

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
inexperienced in terms of the season and

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.510 
inexperienced in terms of the season and
playoffs<00:06:14.740> as<00:06:14.920> well<00:06:15.070> do<00:06:15.220> you<00:06:15.280> think<00:06:15.400> they

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
playoffs as well do you think they

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.160 
playoffs as well do you think they
really<00:06:15.880> took<00:06:16.000> advantage<00:06:16.150> of<00:06:16.450> that<00:06:16.510> tonight<00:06:16.930> I

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 
really took advantage of that tonight I

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.710 
really took advantage of that tonight I
thought<00:06:17.680> Tyler<00:06:17.920> played<00:06:18.190> well<00:06:18.430> a<00:06:18.820> couple<00:06:19.360> goals

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
thought Tyler played well a couple goals

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.150 
thought Tyler played well a couple goals
there<00:06:19.900> he<00:06:20.050> was<00:06:20.200> screen<00:06:20.590> and<00:06:20.770> there's<00:06:20.890> not<00:06:20.980> much

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
there he was screen and there's not much

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.610 
there he was screen and there's not much
he<00:06:21.310> could<00:06:21.490> do<00:06:21.640> but<00:06:21.880> know<00:06:22.870> we<00:06:23.020> have<00:06:23.140> faith<00:06:23.410> in

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
he could do but know we have faith in

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.890 
he could do but know we have faith in
Tyler<00:06:23.860> he's<00:06:24.130> a<00:06:24.190> good<00:06:24.370> goaltender<00:06:25.060> and<00:06:25.090> if<00:06:25.720> we

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
Tyler he's a good goaltender and if we

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.390 
Tyler he's a good goaltender and if we
have<00:06:26.050> to<00:06:26.170> go<00:06:26.230> with<00:06:26.530> them<00:06:26.680> on<00:06:26.830> Wednesday<00:06:27.100> which

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.150 
have to go with them on Wednesday which
I'm<00:06:27.550> expecting<00:06:28.090> we<00:06:28.180> do<00:06:28.360> because<00:06:29.100> it's<00:06:30.100> a

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
I'm expecting we do because it's a

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.620 
I'm expecting we do because it's a
pretty<00:06:30.310> serious<00:06:30.520> injury<00:06:30.760> right<00:06:31.030> now<00:06:31.210> if<00:06:31.330> Andre

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
make an adjustment for that knowing that

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.330 
make an adjustment for that knowing that
most<00:06:41.140> of<00:06:41.380> your<00:06:41.470> game<00:06:41.650> was<00:06:41.800> spent<00:06:42.010> using

most of your game was spent using

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.190 
most of your game was spent using
special<00:06:42.670> teams<00:06:42.850> well<00:06:43.660> they<00:06:43.780> won't<00:06:43.930> be<00:06:44.020> on

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
special teams well they won't be on

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.960 
special teams well they won't be on
special<00:06:44.590> teams<00:06:44.710> so<00:06:44.980> much<00:06:45.160> attires<00:06:45.580> yell

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:45.970 
special teams so much attires yell

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.440 
special teams so much attires yell
fatigue<00:06:46.750> sets<00:06:47.050> in<00:06:47.260> so<00:06:47.590> the<00:06:48.100> bottom<00:06:48.880> line<00:06:48.940> is<00:06:49.090> we

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
fatigue sets in so the bottom line is we

say<00:06:57.060> that<00:06:57.090> your<00:06:57.390> team<00:06:57.540> probably<00:06:57.840> wasn't<00:06:58.140> very

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
say that your team probably wasn't very

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.870
