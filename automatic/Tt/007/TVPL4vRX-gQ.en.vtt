I'm going to do this to every one of

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.330 
I'm going to do this to every one of
these<00:02:50.880> bonds<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.800> right<00:02:56.190> before

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
we put it in the oven and it tastes good

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.670 
we put it in the oven and it tastes good
I<00:03:00.090> don't<00:03:00.150> care<00:03:00.390> what<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.690> looks<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:01.020> but<00:03:01.410> when

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
I don't care what it looks like but when

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.410 
I don't care what it looks like but when
I<00:03:01.710> make<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.160> for<00:03:02.340> roommates<00:03:02.730> or<00:03:02.880> whatever<00:03:03.180> I

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
I make this for roommates or whatever I

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.200 
I make this for roommates or whatever I
would<00:03:04.110> always<00:03:04.230> sprinkle<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.250> little<00:03:05.580> bit<00:03:05.910> extra

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
would always sprinkle a little bit extra

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.170 
would always sprinkle a little bit extra
cheese<00:03:06.660> on<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.990> top<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.460> put<00:03:08.820> parsley

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
cheese on the top and then I put parsley

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.480 
cheese on the top and then I put parsley
dried<00:03:09.780> parsley<00:03:10.110> on<00:03:10.380> top<00:03:10.410> because<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:11.340> this

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
dried parsley on top because that this

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.040 
dried parsley on top because that this
is<00:03:11.730> barely<00:03:12.000> going<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.330> affect<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.690> taste<00:03:12.840> at

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
is barely going to affect the taste at

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.330 
is barely going to affect the taste at
all<00:03:13.110> parsley<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.740> definitely<00:03:14.040> not<00:03:14.130> going<00:03:14.250> to

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
all parsley is definitely not going to

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.050 
all parsley is definitely not going to
do<00:03:14.460> a<00:03:14.490> damn<00:03:14.700> thing<00:03:14.940> but<00:03:16.190> weird<00:03:17.190> people<00:03:17.850> that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
do a damn thing but weird people that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.730 
do a damn thing but weird people that
care<00:03:18.660> about<00:03:18.690> what<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.020> looks<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.410> instead<00:03:19.680> of

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
care about what it looks like instead of

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.830 
care about what it looks like instead of
what<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.010> tastes<00:03:20.490> like<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:21.420> helps<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.810> ton

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
what it tastes like this helps a ton

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.150 
what it tastes like this helps a ton
because<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.320> actually<00:03:22.500> looks<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.920> lot<00:03:23.010> better

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
because it actually looks a lot better
