00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.760 
play or at least I think it is I kind of
searched<00:00:42.629> around<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> couldn't<00:00:43.379> find<00:00:43.590> any

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.779 
other videos granted I am a prestige
master<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.590> had<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> copy<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.309> class<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
master so I had to copy the class up to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.670 
master so I had to copy the class up to
one<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> my<00:00:48.239> custom<00:00:48.600> classes<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.320> then<00:00:49.649> I

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
one of my custom classes and then I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.439 
one of my custom classes and then I
actually<00:00:49.860> added<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.370> couple<00:00:50.550> camos<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> two

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
actually added a couple camos on the two

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.720 
actually added a couple camos on the two
guns<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:51.840> well<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.590> other<00:00:52.800> than<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
guns as well but other than that is is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.060 
guns as well but other than that is is
the<00:00:54.030> same<00:00:54.059> exact<00:00:54.690> setup<00:00:54.930> although<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.680> am<00:00:55.920> not

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the same exact setup although I am not

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.650 
the same exact setup although I am not
using<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.520> default<00:00:56.969> scorestreaks<00:00:57.539> I'm

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
using this default scorestreaks I'm

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.389 
using this default scorestreaks I'm
actually<00:00:57.840> using<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.379> UAV<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> counter<00:00:59.250> UAV

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
actually using the UAV the counter UAV

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.310 
actually using the UAV the counter UAV
and<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.879> orbital<00:01:00.270> II<00:01:00.329> set<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.780> great

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and the orbital II set a great

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.470 
and the orbital II set a great
scorestreaks<00:01:02.250> set<00:01:02.399> up<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.670> 66<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.359> actually

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
scorestreaks set up in 66 I actually

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.929 
scorestreaks set up in 66 I actually
have<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.769> nuclear<00:01:04.949> best<00:01:05.430> scorestreaks

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
have a going nuclear best scorestreaks

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.480 
have a going nuclear best scorestreaks

up<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:08.820> channel<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.360> guys<00:01:09.570> missed<00:01:09.810> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
up in my channel if you guys missed that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
up in my channel if you guys missed that
you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.140> definitely<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.470> check<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:10.850> but

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you can definitely go check it out but

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.120 
you can definitely go check it out but
this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.020> still<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> nuclear<00:01:13.740> gameplay

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this is it's still a nuclear gameplay

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.219 
this is it's still a nuclear gameplay
with<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.790> default<00:01:15.330> class<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.869> thought<00:01:16.110> this

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
with a default class so I thought this

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.499 
with a default class so I thought this
would<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.500> pretty<00:01:17.130> entertaining<00:01:17.430> video<00:01:18.090> now

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
would be pretty entertaining video now

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.999 
would be pretty entertaining video now
obviously<00:01:18.930> as<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.259> see<00:01:19.470> I'm<00:01:19.619> using<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
obviously as you can see I'm using the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.219 
obviously as you can see I'm using the
scorpion<00:01:20.490> evil<00:01:20.759> default<00:01:21.210> class<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:22.049> is

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
scorpion evil default class which is

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.780 
scorpion evil default class which is
actually<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> decent<00:01:22.950> class<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:23.670> more

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
actually a decent class but more

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.670 
actually a decent class but more
importantly<00:01:24.240> made<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> most<00:01:24.960> sense<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.409> go

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
importantly made the most sense to go

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440 
importantly made the most sense to go
with<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.040> class<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> other<00:01:26.939> default

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
with this class over the other default

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870 
with this class over the other default
classes<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.799> class<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.520> has

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
classes because this class one it has

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.340 
classes because this class one it has
ghost<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:30.869> too<00:01:31.079> which<00:01:31.229> is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
ghost on it and then too which is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
ghost on it and then too which is
probably<00:01:31.619> even<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:31.890> important<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.820> class

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
probably even more important this class

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.420 
probably even more important this class
has<00:01:33.329> scavengers<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.470> were<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.799> use<00:01:34.829> any

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
has scavengers so if I were to use any

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
has scavengers so if I were to use any
of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> other<00:01:35.820> default<00:01:36.390> classes<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.049> could

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
of the other default classes I could

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.490 
of the other default classes I could
really<00:01:37.950> only<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.670> 10<00:01:39.060> 12<00:01:39.450> kills<00:01:39.810> maybe<00:01:40.049> before

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
really only get 10 12 kills maybe before

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.710 
really only get 10 12 kills maybe before
I<00:01:40.560> had<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> pick<00:01:41.820> up<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.150> start<00:01:42.329> using<00:01:42.450> a

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
I had to pick up and start using a

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.899 
I had to pick up and start using a
different<00:01:43.170> gun<00:01:43.350> which<00:01:43.890> isn't<00:01:44.159> nearly<00:01:44.610> as

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
different gun which isn't nearly as

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.399 
different gun which isn't nearly as
impressive<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.990> kind<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.229> doesn't

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
impressive and that just kind of doesn't

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.210 
impressive and that just kind of doesn't
make<00:01:46.680> sense

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
make sense

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.569 
make sense
thankfully<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.030> Scorpion<00:01:48.450> has<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.840> grip<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
thankfully the Scorpion has a grip on it

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.609 
thankfully the Scorpion has a grip on it
on<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.759> class<00:01:50.970> has<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> grip<00:01:51.540> because<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
on this class has a grip because you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.260 
on this class has a grip because you
know<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.860> all<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.220> how<00:01:53.369> brutal<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.909> kick<00:01:54.090> can

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270

useful<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:58.430> haven't<00:02:59.060> really<00:02:59.569> used<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.959> whole

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
useful I haven't really used it a whole

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.259 
useful I haven't really used it a whole
lot<00:03:00.170> in<00:03:00.530> black<00:03:00.739> ops<00:03:00.950> 2<00:03:01.160> until<00:03:01.819> I<00:03:01.880> started<00:03:02.239> using

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
lot in black ops 2 until I started using

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.690 
lot in black ops 2 until I started using
this<00:03:02.599> default<00:03:02.989> class<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.680> there's<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.549> couple

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
this default class and there's a couple

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.460 
this default class and there's a couple
different<00:03:05.090> ways<00:03:05.209> for<00:03:05.540> using<00:03:05.840> smoke<00:03:06.140> grenade

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
different ways for using smoke grenade

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.380 
different ways for using smoke grenade
the<00:03:06.920> obvious<00:03:07.310> one<00:03:07.489> is<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.790> use<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.030> as<00:03:08.120> cover

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
the obvious one is to use it as cover

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.930 
the obvious one is to use it as cover
but<00:03:09.140> then<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.620> like<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.400> use<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.760> as<00:03:10.910> a

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
but then I like to use it as a

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.930 
but then I like to use it as a
distraction<00:03:11.450> sometimes<00:03:12.230> too<00:03:12.650> especially

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
distraction sometimes too especially

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.979 
distraction sometimes too especially

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
something like that because enemies tend
