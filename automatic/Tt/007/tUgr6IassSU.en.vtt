00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.790
 dive peppers we have pepper seedlings 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.040
 they are already stretched enough seedlings and 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.660
 they sit pretty empty we'll them 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.869
 dive into the cassette drawer one at a time 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.000
 we will take the finished cassettes 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:24.510
 I have already filled one of them with special 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.279
 ground for peppers and tomatoes in this 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.610
 the ground we will plant our peppers that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:37.110
 for this you need to do first 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:44.190
 and shall water the seedlings carefully so I them 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:50.030
 watering the soil is moistened and it will be easier 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:55.649
 from there to get water soaked the ground 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.890
 now we will understand them every pepper 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:07.020
 take out separately and put our 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:09.380
 we pulled out a box here 2 things 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.090
 it turned out two peppers 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:19.130
 my share all the same neatly 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.130
 divided do not hurt pepper roots 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.799
 so on the ground poured in the checkout then we 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.020
 we make indentations and we plant there our 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:36.619
 pepper 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.619
 carefully sealing the soil of the box 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.390
 excess land we clean and pour something 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.290
 what is missing 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:51.610
 boxes of one pepper are planted the same 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:56.020
 the way we dive the rest of the seedlings 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.470
 we lower deeper they have stretched 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.470
 pouring land 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:17.830
 each seedling in a separate box 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.620
 slightly compacted after watering the soil 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:28.690
 it will settle and we sprinkle a little new 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:34.000
 so that the seedlings do not fall here is the third pepper 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:37.560
 our I take it neatly by the roots not 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.560
 breaking soil coma 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.570
 don't rinse the roots just gently 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.290
 transplant seedling 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:53.050
 A new box we pour zemlykam here at 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.590
 us peppers will grow to disembark in 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.590
 greenhouse 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.420
 we have planted three things 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:14.290
 after you planted her well 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.290
 no void should remain 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:24.579
 we pour a little land where necessary 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:27.799
 and correcting seedlings 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:32.659
 in the same way we do the rest 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:36.549
 peppers in a box similar act 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.549
 with remaining pepper seedlings
