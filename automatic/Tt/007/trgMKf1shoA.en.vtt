00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.539
 yeah 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.330
 kevin and it's a sport 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.560
 dangerous does it make you 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.540
 but as I said just now 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.890
 it's not a dangerous sport because 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.550
 that they never had to kill by 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.310
 example in trials 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.660
 but it's not without risk either 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.760
 know that what we do we have a 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.800
 some masters a very big 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.360
 mastery of learning and we are not 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.180
 never safe from a kit so in a 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.040
 piece of the bike that would break 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.290
 can we put in there right now yes we 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.730
 so otherwise if the movement is 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.700
 realized with all the consciousness one has 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:46.260
 through his years of practice and well 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.160
 we realize good solution 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.800
 the equator has evolved in order to montfort 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.420
 and I actually work a little different 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.740
 because for competitions it's 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.050
 to work in the 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.690
 the other both surfaces but admits 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.130
 to have confrontations is in 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.860
 places we do not control when we 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.020
 see abroad is because we will have 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.310
 to do so we may have to make some 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.820
 natural obstacles on which we must 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.000
 evolve 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:16.250
 or else artificial obstacles are 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.290
 square no death or shape okay 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.250
 do a strip like today too 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.860
 so it's true that working on 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.240
 two surfaces for a workout in 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.500
 the high level elite it's really 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.900
 important what because we have to be 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.420
 brought to find the two types of 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.420
 surface and one must respond present to the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.180
 good time here is tahri 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.250
 to be afraid of steam you have to be afraid 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.750
 this stage not afraid you come back in the case 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.070
 of unconsciousness and there you put yourself in 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.430
 danger yourself and then the others 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.600
 fear is the brake if you are not afraid 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.250
 is that at some point there is a 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.250
 worry here 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.500
 yeah
