00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:12.280
 hello dear viewers here and 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.280
 autumn came to us 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:24.900
 but itâ€™s not a very good base 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.070
 than we are now A loan is 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.329
 we will transplant hazel 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.559
 here we have it 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:42.550
 bushes and hazel bushes 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:46.930
 this biennial bushes already we have them two 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:54.579
 years they are planted Saref with ordinary hazel 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:59.309
 and here they are with us here they are also 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:03.640
 I have the same age 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:11.320
 hazel seedlings here are not much 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:14.770
 less but let them grow for another year 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.090
 here and then we will transplant them but 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:24.340
 now we will be transplanting with you here 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.840
 these are the bushes why autumn spring 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.599
 hazelnut starts its own very early 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.979
 livelihoods and have time and and 

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:37.509
 transplanted is very problematic because 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.340
 that starting before planting in the spring she 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:44.319
 then it hurts very long and badly 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.039
 survives about planting in the fall gives it all 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.459
 The chance that she will take root normally and 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.830
 I will give chelas early obnozhka 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:02:01.090
 so we dig and plant a new place 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:03.459
 ahead and so here we have prepared a pit for 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.429
 planting our hazel dug and done 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:13.390
 ditch to collect water dug yank 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:19.530
 added perry noah all mixed and here 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.090
 our hazel is such a land and 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.200
 spine has 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:30.599
 here so reducible to a permanent place 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:34.319
 here in this pit with 1 so here we have it 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:38.280
 already planted land a little 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:42.150
 rammed around it now add 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:50.190
 some water for better land 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:52.790
 around the root and everything was cool we are not 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.560
 forget 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.220
 honey harvest and the amount of honey you can 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.660
 collect directly depends on the beekeeper 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:07.440
 work to improve the honey base in 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.930
