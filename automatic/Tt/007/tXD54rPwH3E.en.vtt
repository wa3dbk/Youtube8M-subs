again except it's after this I have no
idea<00:00:17.789> what<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.210> do<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.510> can<00:00:18.600> hide<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.170> but

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
idea what to do you can hide in this but

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.109 
idea what to do you can hide in this but
it<00:00:19.710> doesn't<00:00:19.859> really<00:00:20.100> seem<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.369> be<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.520> point<00:00:20.850> I

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
it doesn't really seem to be a point I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.570 
it doesn't really seem to be a point I
guess<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:22.140> look<00:00:22.320> around<00:00:22.470> until<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.220> figure

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
guess just look around until we figure

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.210 
guess just look around until we figure
out<00:00:23.609> what<00:00:23.910> needs<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.390> done<00:00:25.099> let's<00:00:26.099> see

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.310 

it's<00:05:37.730> not<00:05:37.880> saying<00:05:38.090> to<00:05:38.180> be<00:05:38.240> yet<00:05:38.389> so<00:05:38.690> maybe<00:05:38.900> it's

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
it's not saying to be yet so maybe it's

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.830 
it's not saying to be yet so maybe it's
like<00:05:39.790> six<00:05:41.230> seven<00:05:42.230> nine<00:05:43.270> okay<00:05:44.270> I<00:05:44.300> guess<00:05:44.570> that

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
like six seven nine okay I guess that

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.050 
like six seven nine okay I guess that
isn't<00:05:45.139> what<00:05:45.380> that<00:05:45.530> code<00:05:45.710> goes<00:05:45.950> to<00:05:46.160> okay<00:05:46.520> so<00:05:46.700> I

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
isn't what that code goes to okay so I

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.970 
isn't what that code goes to okay so I
figured<00:05:47.450> out<00:05:47.600> one<00:05:47.870> thing<00:05:48.200> that<00:05:48.440> just<00:05:48.650> leads<00:05:48.860> to

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
figured out one thing that just leads to

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.980 
figured out one thing that just leads to
another<00:05:49.100> confusion<00:05:49.970> I'm<00:05:50.300> happy<00:05:50.660> I<00:05:50.720> figured

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
another confusion I'm happy I figured

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.330 
another confusion I'm happy I figured
out<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.200> piano<00:05:51.380> thing<00:05:51.680> because<00:05:51.860> I<00:05:51.919> was<00:05:52.100> really

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
out the piano thing because I was really

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.730 
out the piano thing because I was really
only<00:05:52.430> a<00:05:52.580> guess<00:05:52.880> but<00:05:53.660> six<00:05:54.080> seven<00:05:54.470> nine<00:05:54.680> I

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
only a guess but six seven nine I

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.770 
only a guess but six seven nine I
haven't<00:05:55.400> seen<00:05:55.550> anywhere<00:05:55.970> else<00:05:56.240> where<00:05:56.540> I<00:05:56.570> can

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
haven't seen anywhere else where I can

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.770 
haven't seen anywhere else where I can
input<00:05:57.169> that<00:05:57.230> into<00:05:57.590> the<00:05:58.580> mean<00:05:58.730> in<00:05:59.090> fact<00:05:59.300> I<00:05:59.570> don't

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.720 
input that into the mean in fact I don't
even<00:05:59.840> know<00:06:00.169> one<00:06:00.740> other<00:06:01.010> thing<00:06:01.400> they<00:06:01.460> need<00:06:01.610> to
