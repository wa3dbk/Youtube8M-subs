00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.400
 the next technique we're going to 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.400
 use is the formal thermos then 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.369
 we can do it in two ways one 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.859
 placing my little piece of foami that I'm going to 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.029
 have to form under a rag the 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:27.699
 iron should be in a medium term and 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.699
 I must place it a while on 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.140
 the foam and 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.750
 and I'm going to check that he's taking the 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.540
 way that I wish it is important that if the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.480
 foam and already have it decorated place it 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.410
 down the decoration so that it is 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:49.120
 so the other way is to place the foam and 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.120
 directly on the iron 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.440
 why 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.440
 the go on inflating 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.340
 let's do it like this with patience 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.120
 waiting he goes first to stick a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.100
 poquitico of the iron and then going to 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.220
 take the form 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.220
 [Music] 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.530
 and the next technique that we're going to 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.920
 use this beautiful shapes with mold 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.110
 so let's cut out a piece of 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.049
 foami more or less like a centimeter and 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.479
 half an edge on all sides what 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.510
 we put under the cloth we're going to 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.270
 use to iron 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.100
 a good space waiting for you 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.190
 hot pretty pretty the foam and 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.640
 when we feel that it is already good 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.280
 hot let's take it out but let's 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.700
 flip them over the mold so that we 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.650
 the part that I base on 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.560
 the part of the mold should be the one 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:59.780
 received the heat in this case I put it 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.350
 here he placed the counter mold he squeezed 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.409
 he waited a few seconds there until he 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.300
 cool again 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:13.629
 deep down when I take it out I took it out 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.340
 my form is left as I wish and 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.340
 I can cut the excesses
