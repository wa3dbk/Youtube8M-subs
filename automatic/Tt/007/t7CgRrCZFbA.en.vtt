00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
reporting snow right now you can see

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.280 
reporting snow right now you can see
we're<00:01:14.369> still<00:01:14.580> solidly<00:01:15.330> into<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> rain<00:01:15.990> across

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
we're still solidly into the rain across

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.560 
we're still solidly into the rain across
the<00:01:16.409> Charlotte<00:01:16.979> area<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.210> area

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the Charlotte area but as this area

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.090 
the Charlotte area but as this area
cools<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.560> next<00:01:19.740> couple<00:01:19.979> of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
cools down here in the next couple of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.469 
cools down here in the next couple of
hours<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:20.490> after<00:01:21.000> eight<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:21.330> nine

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
hours I think after eight or nine

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.179 
hours I think after eight or nine
o'clock<00:01:21.810> we're<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> pretty<00:01:22.979> big

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
o'clock we're going to see a pretty big

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.609 
o'clock we're going to see a pretty big
area<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.520> snow<00:01:23.820> develop<00:01:24.180> right<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
area of snow develop right in here and

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.440 
area of snow develop right in here and
so<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.270> those

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
so this is going to be one of those

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.120 
so this is going to be one of those
things<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.900> farther<00:01:28.170> north<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.619> west<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.070> go

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
things the farther north and west you go

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.859 
things the farther north and west you go
the<00:01:29.759> better<00:01:29.790> chance<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.570> seeing

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the better chance you have of seeing

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.090 
the better chance you have of seeing
heavy<00:01:31.049> snow<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.439> there's<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.680> little<00:01:31.799> tail

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
heavy snow now there's a little tail

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.890 
heavy snow now there's a little tail
band<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.700> snow<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.970> extends<00:01:33.570> down<00:01:33.750> to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
band of snow that extends down to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.780 
band of snow that extends down to
Atlanta<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.829> produced<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.280> quick<00:01:35.490> three

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
Atlanta that produced a quick three

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.270 
Atlanta that produced a quick three
inches<00:01:36.090> down<00:01:36.210> towards<00:01:36.570> Talladega<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.470> in

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
inches down towards Talladega in in

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.310 
inches down towards Talladega in in
Alabama<00:01:38.790> east<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.270> Birmingham<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
Alabama east of Birmingham and that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.460 
Alabama east of Birmingham and that
seems<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.740> moving<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.159> right<00:01:41.610> north<00:01:42.210> of

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
seems to be moving up right north of

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.950 
seems to be moving up right north of
i-85<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> think<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.130> 85<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.119> that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
i-85 so I think I 85 is going to be that

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.170 
i-85 so I think I 85 is going to be that
kind<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.380> typical<00:01:46.710> dividing<00:01:47.640> line<00:01:47.790> if<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
kind of typical dividing line if you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.940 
kind of typical dividing line if you
live<00:01:48.360> south<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.810> i-85<00:01:49.290> you're<00:01:49.560> probably<00:01:49.740> just

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
live south of i-85 you're probably just

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.590 
live south of i-85 you're probably just
going<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> quick<00:01:50.759> burst<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.180> snow<00:01:51.299> maybe

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
going to see a quick burst of snow maybe

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.020 
going to see a quick burst of snow maybe
nothing<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.350> north<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.070> i-85<00:01:53.579> that's<00:01:53.880> where

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
nothing and north of i-85 that's where

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.370 
nothing and north of i-85 that's where
you'll<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> real<00:01:54.600> heavy<00:01:54.869> stuff<00:01:55.170> so

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you'll see the real heavy stuff so

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.690 
you'll see the real heavy stuff so
that's<00:01:55.770> what's<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.310> right<00:01:56.369> now<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
that's what's going on right now I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.450 
that's what's going on right now I
expect<00:01:57.180> conditions<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.719> kind<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.930> go<00:01:58.079> downhill

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
expect conditions to kind of go downhill

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.920 
expect conditions to kind of go downhill

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
freezing but I don't think

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
roads are going to be that bad across

roads are going to be that bad across
the<00:02:15.040> Piedmont<00:02:15.310> unless<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.850> snow<00:02:16.120> really

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
picks up temperatures are staying pretty

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.220 
picks up temperatures are staying pretty
close<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:19.030> at<00:02:19.240> or<00:02:19.480> above<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.870> freezing<00:02:20.050> mark

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
close to at or above the freezing mark

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.260 
close to at or above the freezing mark
even<00:02:20.650> back<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.100> west<00:02:21.340> behind<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> system

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
even back to the west behind the system

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.390 
even back to the west behind the system
we're<00:02:22.810> not<00:02:22.930> seeing<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.230> rapid<00:02:23.680> cool<00:02:23.890> down<00:02:24.100> so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
we're not seeing a rapid cool down so

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.760 
we're not seeing a rapid cool down so
heavy<00:02:25.209> snow<00:02:25.450> can<00:02:25.660> certainly<00:02:26.020> cause<00:02:26.260> issues<00:02:26.500> on

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
heavy snow can certainly cause issues on

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.680 
heavy snow can certainly cause issues on
the<00:02:26.860> roadways<00:02:27.280> if<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.880> falls<00:02:28.060> quick<00:02:28.390> enough

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
the roadways if it falls quick enough

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.960 
the roadways if it falls quick enough
but<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.230> think<00:02:29.319> by<00:02:29.620> morning<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.250> commute<00:02:30.580> might

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
but I think by morning the commute might

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.060 
but I think by morning the commute might
be<00:02:31.180> okay<00:02:31.540> for<00:02:31.600> most<00:02:32.020> areas<00:02:32.290> will<00:02:32.680> have<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.920> keep

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
be okay for most areas will have to keep

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.530 
be okay for most areas will have to keep
an<00:02:33.220> eye<00:02:33.310> on<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.670> course<00:02:33.910> you're<00:02:34.300> going<00:02:34.450> to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
an eye on it of course you're going to

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.750 
an eye on it of course you're going to
want<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.780> get<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.200> watch<00:02:35.340> NBC<00:02:36.340> Charlotte

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
want to get up and watch NBC Charlotte

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.820 
want to get up and watch NBC Charlotte
up<00:02:36.850> starting<00:02:37.180> at<00:02:37.300> four<00:02:37.690> a.m.<00:02:38.020> for<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.590> latest

up starting at four a.m. for the latest

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.860 
up starting at four a.m. for the latest
on<00:02:39.040> what's<00:02:39.250> going<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.489> happen<00:02:39.820> but<00:02:40.000> right<00:02:40.690> now

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
on what's going to happen but right now

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.000 
on what's going to happen but right now
I<00:02:40.900> think<00:02:41.080> we're<00:02:41.320> going<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.500> see<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.680> kind<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:41.950> a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
I think we're going to see a kind of a

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.010 
I think we're going to see a kind of a
slushy<00:02:42.310> mess<00:02:42.640> right<00:02:42.880> now<00:02:42.940> but<00:02:43.090> areas<00:02:43.630> north<00:02:43.870> of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
slushy mess right now but areas north of

slushy mess right now but areas north of
I<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.470> 40<00:02:45.340> definitely<00:02:45.730> could<00:02:45.910> see<00:02:45.940> a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
I I 40 definitely could see a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.670 
I I 40 definitely could see a
significant<00:02:46.810> snowfall<00:02:47.050> in<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.320> mountains

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
significant snowfall in the mountains

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.140 
significant snowfall in the mountains
are<00:02:47.739> getting<00:02:47.980> hammered<00:02:48.310> right<00:02:48.670> now<00:02:48.730> and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
are getting hammered right now and

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.490 
are getting hammered right now and
that's<00:02:49.600> going<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:49.840> continue<00:02:49.989> into<00:02:50.470> the

that's going to continue into the
