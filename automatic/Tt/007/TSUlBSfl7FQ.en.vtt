00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
firewire now keep in mind the drobo is

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.690 
firewire now keep in mind the drobo is
an<00:00:33.899> enclosure<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:35.010> you'll<00:00:35.160> need<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> get<00:00:35.610> an

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
an enclosure so you'll need to get an

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.389 
an enclosure so you'll need to get an
SATA<00:00:36.059> hard<00:00:36.570> drive<00:00:36.899> for<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.380> use<00:00:38.219> your

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
SATA hard drive for it or use your

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.369 
SATA hard drive for it or use your
existing<00:00:38.640> ones<00:00:38.969> it's<00:00:39.450> got<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> capacity<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.230> up

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
existing ones it's got a capacity of up

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.530 
existing ones it's got a capacity of up
to<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.710> terabyte<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.370> each<00:00:41.460> slot<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.239> four

be failing to set up the drobo you
simply<00:01:40.829> drop<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.340> your<00:01:41.369> SATA<00:01:42.030> drives<00:01:42.479> then<00:01:42.810> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
simply drop in your SATA drives then you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.800 
simply drop in your SATA drives then you
connect<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.590> your<00:01:43.619> PC<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.030> units

connect it to your PC that is it units

also<00:01:46.110> cool<00:01:46.320> meaning<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.040> doesn't<00:01:47.070> get<00:01:47.759> hot

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
also cool meaning it doesn't get hot

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.569 
also cool meaning it doesn't get hot
it's<00:01:48.750> cool<00:01:48.990> looking<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.770> keeps<00:01:49.979> itself<00:01:50.310> cool

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
it's cool looking but keeps itself cool

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.910 
it's cool looking but keeps itself cool
because<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.060> fan<00:01:51.270> USB<00:01:52.140> transfer<00:01:52.409> speeds

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
because of the fan USB transfer speeds

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770 
because of the fan USB transfer speeds
or<00:01:53.310> what<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.549> would<00:01:53.670> expect<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.630> as

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
or what you would expect it's not as

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
or what you would expect it's not as
fast<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.200> an<00:01:55.320> internal<00:01:55.619> drive<00:01:55.890> obviously<00:01:56.460> but

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
fast as an internal drive obviously but

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.730 
fast as an internal drive obviously but
still<00:01:57.210> fast<00:01:57.390> enough<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.229> thing<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.560> like

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
still fast enough and the thing I like

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.100 
still fast enough and the thing I like
most<00:01:58.770> about<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.579> I<00:02:00.329> can't<00:02:00.570> hear<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.930> it's

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
most about it is I can't hear it it's

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.050 
most about it is I can't hear it it's
