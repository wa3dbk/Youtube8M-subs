00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.720
 you know 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.720
 throwing them are too complicated 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.840
 paypal 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.840
 improvements 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.150
 Yes 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.600
 today the topic 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.600
 pcw 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.550
 you find yourself really funny 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.550
 the motorized bicycle 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.360
 can see here 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.370
 it's about 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.370
 she would not be like that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.370
 for example in the only way 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.370
 have mature 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.660
 pretty good just for 20 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.050
 but actually the cbs does it exactly 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.050
 right 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.760
 we all just catch coffee here 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.200
 only say I intend 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.040
 no wonder that 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.790
 but wait and see! 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.860
 and as I said again 510 ps 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.730
 run every 15 ps throttled 130 things 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.010
 Or less 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.880
 the cbr power also shows right then 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:39.350
 which is quite cheap to buy 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:44.800
 is there then from 3000 euro performance with 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.800
 the iso 3.200 come what are you doing there 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.400
 is also very economical here from the engine ago 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.170
 that we again have a 4 clock and before 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.500
 Everything is just about as good as it gets 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.150
 nothing by their rather thin 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.580
 construction and has just been often 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.620
 these thin tires 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.760
 That's a good 25 years from their time 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.890
 only 14 ps 115 ps 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.640
 which is also much more in 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:19.190
 final speed off than now eg dsm 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.190
 a super beautiful 100 become 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.230
 that's just life in life 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.849
 I can understand as well as possible so 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.849
 He really looks like one 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.689
 such a miniature cbr 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.430
 they just make it small and 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.300
 especially 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.750
 certainly had strange 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.750
 right 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.810
 built today 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.670
 roth 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.230
 That's why he comes from the home honda 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.819
 and if you do not work now 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.819
 goes against a concrete pillar survived the 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.900
 ding and pull a long time, therefore, 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.150
 from a friend of mine only good 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.150
 belongs to the then newly purchased 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.830
 buddy of the number 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.380
 also like ten years leading 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.270
 he his ktm 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.030
 and I believe in cooking 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.820
 only in my case I'm not the one 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.550
 biggest but i'm not the smallest 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:29.140
 I'm 85 and I have but 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.420
 put on it and I drove only round 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.530
 and it just really is me 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.290
 too small 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.650
 in supersport you should be pretty 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.640
 hang down far below pointless 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.530
 all because of the handlebar study in the 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.080
 hang very low down that yes 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.080
 a supermoto humor 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.400
 has with the baby does to whatever 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.660
 easy 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.010
 that would have been too small for me 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.140
 actually then somehow with the poor 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.430
 here somewhere in a special front 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.280
 bent over then somewhere under 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.390
 my chest and barely see my hands 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.600
 At least that's what it feels like to others 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.600
 total 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.860
 I want one for the fin 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.240
 since the short 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.240
 i can be okay from both planners 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.630
 and yet this is biking 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.990
 from the engine class 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.370
 processed and that runs and 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.370
 it is not running yet 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.380
 and therefore all this 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.060
 this one is about to snap yeah ok full in 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.540
 order I think so as the 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.740
 driver you have to think about it because 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.930
 These jokes are just out of the scene 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.380
 come 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.660
 but I do not think that's okay anymore 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.660
 is a big round would have 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.690
 so dark really stupid statements 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.680
 that this motorcycle is now gay 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.840
 is 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.840
 I read what a game over 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.529
 that usually comes to some 14-year-olds 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:12.669
 kiddies who do not even have one 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.669
 inso comments the swiss 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.929
 Anyone can make his jokes about it 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:23.439
 but nothing more to what is today 

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:23.439
 Come on 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.819
 if you watch video now has so 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.840
 last but with time together 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.650
 We should do the job for example 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:43.159
 can only pant a little bit 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.159
 more quickly 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.960
 j 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.060
 oh yes with what's going on 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.340
 yes yes with the valley so pretty funny idea 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.610
 but hopefully that would mean that 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.610
 it 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.639
 it will not reveal anything because 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.409
 it just awesome 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:29.879
 is that please here he has good but 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:35.020
 what is clear on circles 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:38.050
 it's loud it stinks it's on 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:43.870
 the same rims and paint color as the 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:45.830
 Yes well that's why not now 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.090
 20 clubs 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.090
 my pulse car but 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.720
 pretty cool then it's time too 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.720
 crÃªpes is 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:24.630
 so can already a lot of money for 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:28.080
 his manuscript youth did not like 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:31.110
 again had a winter unfortunately a few 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.620
 videos link to a fiery with 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.420
 engine block again in the charts 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.780
 simply because I like it with 1001 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.140
 do 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:44.450
 Thanks for the table a second video quiet 

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.450
 failed once 

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:53.689
 4
