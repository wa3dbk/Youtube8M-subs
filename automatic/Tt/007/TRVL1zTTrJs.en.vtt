00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.519
 can do it the way he wanted it 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.260
 the whole topic to multi theft auto and 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.390
 gta san andreas actually relative 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.709
 simply we do not need to explain 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.810
 i do not need a tutorial great 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.130
 do and show you the whole thing 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.350
 actually installed is relative 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.930
 just you just downloaded the 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.450
 she simply opens files 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.579
 simply because you can not go wrong 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.829
 No matter what you give no matter what you do 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.450
 get dead when then is it 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.100
 maybe because you are your drivers 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.840
 did not install yours correctly 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.230
 graphics drivers are out of date 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.870
 or that you have any audio 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.530
 have problems because he also needs one 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.420
 audio graphics memory card he needs 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.489
 also an audio driver otherwise 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.290
 it does not work then 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.660
 we have a big problem and then it opens 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.890
 not mta because he needs a fence 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.449
 Driver yes all this, thank you 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.350
