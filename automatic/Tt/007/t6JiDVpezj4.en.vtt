00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.300 

alright<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> quick<00:00:19.230> word<00:00:19.500> about<00:00:19.680> workflow

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
alright just a quick word about workflow

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.970 
alright just a quick word about workflow
and<00:00:20.610> these<00:00:20.910> cameras<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.900> pretty<00:00:22.350> similar<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
and these cameras it's pretty similar to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.950 
and these cameras it's pretty similar to
a<00:00:23.010> DSLR<00:00:23.490> Rob<00:00:23.730> right<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.540> mean<00:00:24.840> we're

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
a DSLR Rob right it is I mean we're

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.200 
a DSLR Rob right it is I mean we're
working<00:00:24.990> with<00:00:25.380> compressed<00:00:25.950> file<00:00:26.189> formats<00:00:26.670> now

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
working with compressed file formats now

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.060 
working with compressed file formats now
depending<00:00:27.360> on<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:28.290> camera<00:00:28.710> you're<00:00:28.860> using

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
depending on what camera you're using

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.650 
depending on what camera you're using
you<00:00:29.279> might<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.610> a<00:00:29.640> choice<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.270> file<00:00:30.450> formats

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
you might have a choice of file formats

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.690 
you might have a choice of file formats
yeah<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.439> mov<00:00:32.010> which<00:00:32.189> approaches<00:00:32.520> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
yeah from mov which approaches a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.689 
yeah from mov which approaches a
QuickTime<00:00:33.059> file<00:00:33.330> to<00:00:33.870> ABC<00:00:34.230> intra<00:00:34.559> files<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.370> mp4

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
QuickTime file to ABC intra files to mp4

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.670 
QuickTime file to ABC intra files to mp4
s<00:00:36.180> yeah<00:00:36.449> it<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:36.900> depends<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.379> you're

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
s yeah it really just depends and you're

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.229 
s yeah it really just depends and you're
going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.830> want<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> look<00:00:38.370> specifically<00:00:39.090> at

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
going to want to look specifically at

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.080 
going to want to look specifically at
that<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.750> know<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.989> example<00:00:40.080> the<00:00:40.860> om-d<00:00:41.250> it's

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that you know for example the om-d it's

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.510 
that you know for example the om-d it's
an<00:00:42.239> h.264<00:00:43.080> file<00:00:43.410> now<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.590> could<00:00:43.890> drop<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.370> in

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
an h.264 file now I could drop that in

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.610 
an h.264 file now I could drop that in
Premiere<00:00:44.850> native<00:00:45.180> yep<00:00:45.540> I<00:00:45.660> could<00:00:45.900> drop<00:00:46.199> it<00:00:46.440> into

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
Premiere native yep I could drop it into

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.710 
Premiere native yep I could drop it into
the<00:00:46.830> newer<00:00:47.160> Final<00:00:47.610> Cut<00:00:47.730> 10<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.330> could<00:00:48.540> work

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
the newer Final Cut 10 and it could work

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.939 
the newer Final Cut 10 and it could work
native<00:00:49.080> or<00:00:49.230> it'll<00:00:49.350> transcribe<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
native or it'll transcribe in the

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.069 
native or it'll transcribe in the
background<00:00:50.340> way<00:00:50.460> that's<00:00:50.760> fine<00:00:50.970> if<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.809> are

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
background way that's fine if you are

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.139 
background way that's fine if you are
serious<00:00:52.710> about<00:00:52.980> shooting<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.520> lot<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.910> video

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
serious about shooting a lot of video

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.750 
serious about shooting a lot of video
and<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.739> specifically<00:00:55.739> buying<00:00:56.130> this<00:00:56.430> form

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and you specifically buying this form

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.670 
and you specifically buying this form
factor<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.239> video<00:00:57.450> I<00:00:57.660> would<00:00:58.230> say<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
factor for video I would say that the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.650 
factor for video I would say that the
gh3<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.520> kind<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> leader<00:01:00.210> here<00:01:00.450> because

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
gh3 is kind of the leader here because

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.619 
gh3 is kind of the leader here because
AVCHD<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:01.920> robust<00:01:02.280> than<00:01:02.360> h.264<00:01:03.360> yeah<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
AVCHD is more robust than h.264 yeah a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.090 
AVCHD is more robust than h.264 yeah a
lot<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.110> broadcasters<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:04.770> thinking<00:01:05.009> about

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
lot of broadcasters are thinking about

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.130 
lot of broadcasters are thinking about
it<00:01:05.250> using<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:05.729> an<00:01:05.850> acquisition<00:01:06.420> format<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
it using it as an acquisition format it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.070 
it using it as an acquisition format it
is<00:01:07.560> rather<00:01:07.860> robust<00:01:08.399> now<00:01:08.640> i<00:01:08.880> will<00:01:09.240> say<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.720> ABC

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
is rather robust now i will say for ABC

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.529 
is rather robust now i will say for ABC
HD<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.530> need<00:01:10.800> to<00:01:11.009> make<00:01:11.190> sure<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:12.119> your

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
HD you need to make sure that your

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.420 
HD you need to make sure that your
editing<00:01:13.170> software<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> support<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
editing software is going to support the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.190 
editing software is going to support the
codec<00:01:14.759> right<00:01:14.970> some<00:01:15.210> older<00:01:15.509> piece<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.930> software

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
codec right some older piece of software

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.320 
codec right some older piece of software
won't<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.979> also<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.520> h.264

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
won't do it and also just like h.264

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.120 
won't do it and also just like h.264
it's<00:01:18.840> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.080> require<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.410> little<00:01:19.710> bit<00:01:19.860> more

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it's going to require a little bit more

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.520 
it's going to require a little bit more
how<00:01:20.520> should<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.729> say<00:01:20.970> mmm<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.410> your

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
how should I say mmm out of your

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.620 
how should I say mmm out of your
computer<00:01:22.709> system<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.179> the<00:01:24.300> optimal

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
computer system to get the optimal

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.029 
computer system to get the optimal
playback<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.289> drop<00:01:25.500> frames<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> things

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
playback and not drop frames and things

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.380 
playback and not drop frames and things
of<00:01:26.160> that<00:01:26.190> nature<00:01:26.280> yeah<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.789> lot<00:01:26.910> of<00:01:27.030> times<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
of that nature yeah a lot of times the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
of that nature yeah a lot of times the
drop<00:01:27.600> frame<00:01:27.929> problem<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.709> be<00:01:28.800> caused

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
drop frame problem is going to be caused

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.580 
drop frame problem is going to be caused
by<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:29.490> codec<00:01:30.119> now<00:01:30.390> things<00:01:31.050> like<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.319> mercury

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
by the codec now things like the mercury

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.109 
by the codec now things like the mercury
playback<00:01:31.950> engine<00:01:32.190> really<00:01:32.580> work<00:01:32.700> well<00:01:32.910> with

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
playback engine really work well with

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.870 
playback engine really work well with
this<00:01:33.270> having<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.810> good<00:01:34.020> GPU<00:01:34.410> lots<00:01:35.099> of<00:01:35.310> RAM<00:01:35.550> all

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
this having a good GPU lots of RAM all

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.430 
this having a good GPU lots of RAM all
these<00:01:36.119> things<00:01:36.330> come<00:01:36.569> in<00:01:36.599> handy<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.259> don't

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
these things come in handy but you don't

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.740 
these things come in handy but you don't
necessarily<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.280> transcode<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.209> other

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
necessarily have to transcode the other

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.300 
necessarily have to transcode the other
thing<00:01:39.959> I<00:01:40.050> would<00:01:40.110> say<00:01:40.319> about<00:01:40.530> these<00:01:41.039> is<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
thing I would say about these is that

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.850 
thing I would say about these is that
card<00:01:42.090> speed<00:01:42.479> makes<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.050> huge<00:01:43.229> difference<00:01:43.530> right

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
card speed makes a huge difference right

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.859 
card speed makes a huge difference right
i<00:01:43.920> mean<00:01:43.950> these<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.580> SD<00:01:44.729> cards<00:01:45.300> but<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.660> can't

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
i mean these are SD cards but you can't

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050 
i mean these are SD cards but you can't
just<00:01:46.020> use<00:01:46.170> any<00:01:46.440> SD<00:01:46.679> card<00:01:47.039> no<00:01:47.340> i<00:01:47.369> mean<00:01:47.640> we've

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
just use any SD card no i mean we've

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.520 
just use any SD card no i mean we've
talked<00:01:48.270> about<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.720> previous<00:01:49.080> episodes

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
talked about this on previous episodes

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.800 
talked about this on previous episodes
as<00:01:49.679> well<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.190> I'm<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.640> philosophy<00:01:51.060> of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
as well but I'm of the philosophy of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.949 
as well but I'm of the philosophy of
getting<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.470> pretty<00:01:52.679> beefy<00:01:52.920> fast<00:01:53.630> SD<00:01:54.630> card<00:01:54.869> or

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
getting a pretty beefy fast SD card or

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.600 
getting a pretty beefy fast SD card or
it<00:01:55.200> may<00:01:55.440> be<00:01:55.500> compact<00:01:55.890> flash<00:01:56.099> card<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> depend

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
it may be compact flash card to depend

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.740 
it may be compact flash card to depend
on<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.789> system<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.149> you're<00:01:57.240> working<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.539> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
on the system that you're working on and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.510 
on the system that you're working on and
there<00:01:58.410> are<00:01:58.560> some<00:01:58.770> newer<00:01:58.950> standards<00:01:59.190> what's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
there are some newer standards what's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.620 
there are some newer standards what's
that<00:01:59.640> new<00:01:59.729> standard<00:02:00.030> call<00:02:00.179> that<00:02:00.330> everybody's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that new standard call that everybody's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.040 
that new standard call that everybody's
using<00:02:00.750> SD<00:02:01.280> sdhc<00:02:02.280> SDXC<00:02:03.209> and<00:02:03.660> that's<00:02:03.899> you're

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
using SD sdhc SDXC and that's you're

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.999 
using SD sdhc SDXC and that's you're
going<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> want<00:02:04.349> to<00:02:04.410> look<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:04.709> that<00:02:04.830> and

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
going to want to look for that and

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.350 
going to want to look for that and
that's<00:02:05.520> what<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.149> black

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that's what we have here in the black

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.809 
that's what we have here in the black
magic<00:02:06.810> which<00:02:06.959> is<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.110> 600<00:02:07.770> x<00:02:07.920> card<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> required

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
magic which is a 600 x card it required

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.690 
magic which is a 600 x card it required
that<00:02:09.000> these<00:02:09.840> guys<00:02:10.080> are<00:02:10.140> okay<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.560> 400<00:02:11.190> x<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that these guys are okay with 400 x and

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.740 
that these guys are okay with 400 x and
that<00:02:11.760> makes<00:02:12.000> sense<00:02:12.209> though<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.390> these

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
that makes sense though because these

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.660 
that makes sense though because these
are<00:02:12.900> shooting<00:02:13.200> compressed<00:02:13.650> formats<00:02:14.130> these

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
are shooting compressed formats these

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.199 
are shooting compressed formats these
two<00:02:14.849> guys<00:02:14.970> were<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.730> pocket<00:02:17.730> camera<00:02:17.970> still

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
two guys were as the pocket camera still

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.850 
two guys were as the pocket camera still
shooting<00:02:18.450> compress<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.020> pro<00:02:19.200> res<00:02:19.440> right

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
shooting compress and pro res right

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.290 
shooting compress and pro res right
prores<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> much<00:02:21.060> higher

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
prores is going to have a much higher

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.240 
prores is going to have a much higher
data<00:02:21.660> rate<00:02:21.900> than<00:02:22.080> something<00:02:22.290> like<00:02:22.410> h.264

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
data rate than something like h.264

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.250 
data rate than something like h.264
alright<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.000> pretty<00:02:24.360> straightforward<00:02:25.050> stuff

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
alright so pretty straightforward stuff

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.839 
alright so pretty straightforward stuff
we're<00:02:25.830> going<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.040> head<00:02:26.189> down<00:02:26.219> in<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.640> post

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
we're going to head down in the post

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.160 
we're going to head down in the post
environment<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.450> little<00:02:27.659> bit<00:02:27.750> later<00:02:27.989> and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
environment a little bit later and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.319 
environment a little bit later and
you'll<00:02:28.290> see<00:02:28.530> us<00:02:28.650> bring<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.069> files<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.579> but<00:02:30.150> if

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
you'll see us bring the files in but if

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.360 
you'll see us bring the files in but if
you<00:02:30.629> are<00:02:30.810> used<00:02:31.409> to<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> DSLR

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
you are used to a DSLR

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.309 
you are used to a DSLR
flow<00:02:32.610> there<00:02:32.940> really<00:02:33.299> isn't<00:02:33.629> much<00:02:33.659> different

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
flow there really isn't much different

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.320 
flow there really isn't much different
here<00:02:34.349> about<00:02:34.709> these<00:02:34.920> cameras<00:02:35.370> I'd<00:02:35.700> still<00:02:36.090> run

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
here about these cameras I'd still run

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.330 
here about these cameras I'd still run
an<00:02:36.480> external<00:02:36.959> mic<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.349> their<00:02:37.709> mics<00:02:37.950> are<00:02:38.159> just

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
an external mic in their mics are just

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.009 
an external mic in their mics are just
as<00:02:38.459> bad<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:38.670> built<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.180> mics<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.629> beyond<00:02:39.989> that

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
as bad for built in mics and beyond that

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.410 
as bad for built in mics and beyond that
it's<00:02:40.470> pretty<00:02:40.709> straightforward<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.370> think<00:02:42.180> if

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
it's pretty straightforward I think if

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.630 
it's pretty straightforward I think if
you<00:02:42.780> are<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.959> video<00:02:43.530> shooter<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.250> will<00:02:44.400> find

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
you are a video shooter you will find

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.580 
you are a video shooter you will find
the<00:02:44.730> gh3<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.330> be<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> one<00:02:45.690> most<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.440> what

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
the gh3 to be the one most to what

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.660 
the gh3 to be the one most to what
you're<00:02:46.739> used<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:47.069> particular<00:02:47.519> if<00:02:47.580> your
