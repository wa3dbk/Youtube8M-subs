00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.380
 This is where we test the direct sowing of corn under biological conditions 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.920
 This is a great challenge because we give up herbicides, especially from Roundup 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.440
 We make these attempts, because there is no erosion here. 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.180
 Here is a natural washout that can be seen from the slight slope. 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.920
 Further on, there are many more seals, as evidenced by the deep impressions left by tires. 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.480
 This is not there. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.219
 Here, despite heavy harvesters, we have almost no soil compaction. 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.400
 Also there are many more organic substances in this method, not here. 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.340
 And with nitrogen the influence of beans. 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.470
 This is in short the advantage of this technique of roofing and direct sowing - compared to plowing. 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.380
 The process of direct maize sowing actually began in the previous year: 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.420
 Grass harvesting takes place after harvesting of the stubble. 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.240
 Then, from mid-September to the end of October, a wintering roofing crop is planted. 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.000
 We tested different mixtures for roofing. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.740
 The best results showed EFB 33. 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.030
 This is forage peas, which makes a massive and well-preserved winter. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.930
 In spring you have to wait with the sowing of corn. 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.580
 To reach the temperature of the soil bed 8 - 10 Â° C. 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.760
 Because the soil covered with green culture warms much slower. 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.870
 In recent years, we have managed to sow corn between May 20th and June 1st. 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.880
 Start by grinding / cutting the green table with a roller with knives 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.430
 and then a maize direct sowing machine is sown directly through the green table. 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.609
 This year, Hans Peter Briteter adapted and improved the sowing technique. 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:20.689
 So far we have had difficulty in sowing a slice of only 1-2 cm. 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.620
 and so the maize germ had to break through the stems of the rolled table. 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.960
 He adapted the sowing machine, 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.280
 that she first cuts the vegetable mass 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.600
 and then with the scrapers releases the sowing channels. 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.760
 So the seed finds better conditions for development. 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.320
 Better warming of the soil is ensured 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.320
 and increases the possibility of faster maize growth. 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.579
 To optimize the development of corn, 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:03:00.709
 in recent years we added 250 kg. biological fertilizer (Biorga Quick) directly with the sowing. 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.200
 We are in the process of mulching here. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.599
 Three days before sowing, we mulled a mixture of rye, pheasant, peas and red clover. 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.299
 This layer currently covers the soil and prevents the growth of weeds. 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:27.559
 Here it is seen beneath the layer that despite the low rainfall the soil is still moist. 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.840
 Here we have used EFB 33 mixer. 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:42.840
 The good news is that here maize is as high as in classical plowing technology. 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.680
 You can only guess what this is due to. 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.220
 Corn is likely to extract nitrogen from the bacteria 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.780
 on peas. 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.180
 We compared a strip by comparison. 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:11.000
 In the 2 holes, we achieved a pronounced and better mineralization of nitrogen. 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.730
 and this was shown in the height of the plants. 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.530
 Interestingly, however, the upper part of the soil is already relatively dry. 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.670
 Ultimately, how this will affect yields, we will only say in autumn, 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.750
 when we make measurements of dry matter in corn. 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.690
 Very often, maize produced by the direct sowing method has a higher dry matter content 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.070
 and so lower yields can be partially offset. 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.740
 The direct sowing of maize in organic farming is possible. This has been the last four years. 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.280
 But further improvements are needed in the entire fertilization system. 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.060
 Corn varieties are required with a short vegetation period. 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.440
 Another important problem is naked snails. 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.930
 We have found that when using rye as a roofing crop there is a larger snail attack 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.860
 compared to using the EFB 33 mixture or the red clover mix - phyt. 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.240
 Another interesting observation was that at first we thought we had an attack on ravens - 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.740
 there were many of them in the field. But after a more thorough observation of the ravens, 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.130
 that the birds do not attack the corn, but actually eat the snails. 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.660
 The problem with naked snails is certainly a matter to be solved. 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.500
 But with the application of roofing culture, this is perfectly solvable.
