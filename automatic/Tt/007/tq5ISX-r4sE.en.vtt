what's up I mean she'd just been a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.340 
what's up I mean she'd just been a
couple<00:01:08.670> months<00:01:08.850> probably<00:01:09.360> since<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.930> painted

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
couple months probably since I painted

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.580 
couple months probably since I painted
this<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.799> gotta<00:01:11.570> look<00:01:12.570> back<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> videos<00:01:13.409> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
this I gotta look back on the videos to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
this I gotta look back on the videos to
see<00:01:13.770> exactly<00:01:14.010> when<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.430> was<00:01:14.490> painted<00:01:20.570> but<00:01:21.570> we

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
see exactly when it was painted but we

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.520 
see exactly when it was painted but we
got<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> mask<00:01:22.650> on

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.520 

so<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.590> don't<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.010> just<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:30.260> don't<00:01:31.260> know<00:01:31.350> why

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
so I don't know if just I don't know why

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.960 
so I don't know if just I don't know why
I<00:01:31.560> didn't<00:01:31.830> wipe<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.130> off<00:01:32.250> real<00:01:32.520> quick<00:01:32.550> but<00:01:32.910> he

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
I didn't wipe it off real quick but he

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.150 
I didn't wipe it off real quick but he
noticed<00:01:33.330> that<00:01:33.420> he<00:01:33.720> had<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.870> bunch<00:01:34.050> of<00:01:34.140> gas<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.680> I

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
noticed that he had a bunch of gas on I

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.420 
noticed that he had a bunch of gas on I
think<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.990> fill<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> up<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.620> stop<00:01:37.950> somewhere

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
think you fill it up and stop somewhere

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
think you fill it up and stop somewhere
for<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> meeting<00:01:39.450> or<00:01:39.570> something<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.229> came<00:01:40.470> out
