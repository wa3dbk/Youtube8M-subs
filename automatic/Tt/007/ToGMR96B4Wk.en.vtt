00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.380
 well I salute you my friends and all 4 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.540
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.010
 commented gameplay so on a mode that 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.330
 unfortunately no longer exists on the 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.440
 menu a two or three ie the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.120
 fashion weapons game 18 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.620
 there was also the weapons game mode 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.030
 6 x 3 which was unfortunately ben 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.559
 here it is no longer present in the menu 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.140
 it's a shame because honestly 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.760
 as soon as discourage on the multiplayer 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.230
 frankly it amuses me and well what 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.239
 game it allowed me to relax a little 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.220
 on this game yes we can still relax 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.840
 on his eyes here I go you 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.480
 first talk a little about my class so 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.160
 I play with numbers 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.210
 it was fun so good at the beginning of 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.530
 gameplay you saw it I already have 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.829
 chained to the five enemies in less than 30 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.110
 seconds 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.030
 5 see if I know more and then so 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.680
 I would say I'm the opposite of the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.350
 first part where I was at the beginning of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.930
 Part sprint italy and stuff 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.399
 is denis heaven and here we are and after I 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.080
 will direct me to autistic licensed and 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.630
 despite everything but I'm still 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.300
 finish the game fast enough 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.500
 so also in the selections 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.780
 of the community there is also the mode 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.250
 so the drop zone is also a 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.660
 new fashion mode in the dead that is 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.580
 released not long ago and so 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.290
 previously there is a video on cofigeo 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.540
 cocef knows more about who exactly is talking 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.470
 of this mode is so good I invite you to 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.180
 watch this video 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.409
 speaking of four Scottish judges f I 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.030
 will try to send this video 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.920
 I have already done many tests but 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.210
 there the gameplay is really a super 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.650
 gameplay i will not spoiler score of 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.210
 hungry but it's really a trick of 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.670
 sick and so I'll see you that one 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.960
 again after that I 'm really going to 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.310
 chained even when I'm at the edge of 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.440
 to die I'm going to succeed to me 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.119
 go out you will see little by 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.159
 respect to six women in this month 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.450
 holes what happened I was talking to you 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.350
 a little crazy game mode that you have to 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.790
 surely know 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.680
 So it is a fact mode all wrong 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.409
 chained with 18 different weapons and 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.750
 so get to 18 for to win this 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.010
 part the blood black up that 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.709
 already existed except that in fact it was necessary 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.780
 get to 20 weapons so without blake koch 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.940
 it was 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.530
 finally we started with a weapon 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.610
 pretty weak after that increases and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.720
 it was more and more simple and 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.850
 France turned to knife 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.740
 ballistics and where it's a little harder 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.810
 but here on one or three that's it 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.940
 two of the strongest weapons in arms 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.819
 the most a bit honestly I hope 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.010
 enormously that this mode reassure oneself g18 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.180
 quite powerful 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.190
 I really hope that this mode will be on 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.080
 black ops 2 I know there will be the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.410
 back I believe matches in Paris x 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.060
 terra 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.030
 but I hope that this mode 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.510
 particular the weapons game mode 18 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.680
 will be present if not a little else in 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.060
 other modes of selecting the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.880
 community this is the dual titou mode 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.930
 I invite you to do a lot 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.489
 so in fact it makes it possible to go up 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.380
 up to level 80 very quickly so 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.730
 it's really nice little dodge 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.160
 by the way here I'm finishing the game 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.620
 on a score of 18.0 you have it 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.090
 surely guessed the little trick tour 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.530
 pass password there is not too much understood 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.090
 what was happening to her here is a 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.709
 mission to 10.0 I hope you have 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.209
 liked this video I hope you like 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.040
 happier and I hope you will do 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.440
 a tour of on my channel if that's the case 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.610
 So here we are low for Wednesday 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.380
 two new videos not only in this 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.850
 moment I'm in a little word series 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.350
 let's call all the words that's nice to 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.350
 look at the Celts or not
