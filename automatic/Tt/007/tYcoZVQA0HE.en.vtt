00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.460
 save salve guys 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.950
 Welcome everyone, one more 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.619
 epic game play on the channel and this time 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.650
 We are going to play the game call of duty. 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.580
 ghost a game is right that I already 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.880
 I played and played a lot, I played a lot 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.090
 no 360 so I got the same game here 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.189
 for xbox one platform very 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.649
 even out of curiosity, it is certain that I 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.620
 I would like to know a little about the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.050
 game type that the game has different what 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.860
 the game has no different question 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.079
 graphic that changes what catches the eye 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.969
 including for the node for new platform 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.309
 including the same game 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.170
 and I have noticed that you let 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.270
 here at xbox live 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.230
 I am looking for a room for us 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.239
 power is to comment a little on the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.329
 content lets search here let's see 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.460
 If we find a quick match 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.250
 remembering to throw the safe of type xo in 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.979
 xbox one platform playing here on xbox 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.290
 live to be able to bring a little to 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.250
 You and it's raining that we're all going 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.650
 to see if we can find anything is the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.400
 what happens here we can observe 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.680
 that in the game you find more players 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.320
 quick hit the question of the rooms 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.240
 I believe it is because the console 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.820
 is trying companies are trying 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.400
 invest in the device in order to have a 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.030
 high support as the servers and the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.869
 content of six of each game are per 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.860
 responsibility of the developer of the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.619
 game 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.140
 then what I believe 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.700
 using the new platform you have 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.020
 a better facility to find 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.240
 players 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.520
 against Serbian we will not say so 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.860
 but the question of the players 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.290
 I realize that there is a lot of room with 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.149
 lack of players ie you enter 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.090
 in a room and the room is not crowded 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.490
 notes that here we're okay 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.600
 closed in the room is right from here 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.479
 Bit if someone decides to leave 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.140
 there is simply no player for you 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.650
 to be able to return the player type 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.410
 there is a staff there willing to play the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.630
 game might be because everything 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.690
 world wants the game, can not he 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.480
 no it was not very well accepted 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.740
 let's say some kind of content 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.959
 thus 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.430
 good this video here is actually for 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.120
 show you a little of the issue 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.959
 graph of the game is comparing with other 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.180
 160 good people here on xbox one do not know 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.660
 has any kind of extraordinary thing 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.910
 What can we say to you? 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.150
 Game is beautiful game, this is it. 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.010
 another does not have maps that really 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.640
 and have other maps that really 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.200
 you can not find any kind of resource 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.680
 additional or anything new 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.040
 so you can say that it is 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.130
 extraordinary 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.170
 logical that here in xbox one everything has to 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.019
 be a detail everything has its beauty right 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.090
 and everything becomes a little more beautiful 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.120
 Of course I believe the weight of your xbox 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.090
 one and influences the content more 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.160
 finally saying in the context in general you 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.350
 finds a lot of things 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.310
 I'll stop here in a corner 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.260
 for you to see the issue of 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.220
 drawing in the bin some kind of 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.430
 content so you observe that not only 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.860
 the beauty of the game does not have much 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.829
 game, it's nice, it's a game, it's not ugly 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.390
 game, it's beautiful, I did not find it vulgar. 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.400
 let it pass here in the other place 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.680
 you see something here one O 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.040
 bit of the chart does not find a bug in the 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.590
 game on the contrary the game is beautiful 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.410
 only that what happens I realized that the 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.799
 game does not have many players comparing 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.390
 to 350 I believe that if the person 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.459
 there are people today 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.820
 they are doing that they are not 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.440
 Migrating taste of the 360 ​​pro year they in 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.760
 truth are getting content 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.100
 exclusive 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.680
 I believe they are correctly correct 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.350
 because of you instead of buying one 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.700
 game you've ever played in like 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.620
 previous platform 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.570
 knowing that it will be the same game is more 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.260
 you give preference to the 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.500
 exclusive logic but otherwise there the 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.630
 game was 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.340
 basically a little better than the 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.170
 of 360 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.790
 improvement is not that thing 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.210
 extraordinary 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.720
 ok if you want you can compare with 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.660
 It's with a game you can just 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.580
 pick up and on your 360 and play 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.340
 the call of duty goals you will see that 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.000
 the maps do not have much of 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.940
 diversity but there are rumors until they say 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.870
 certain rumors say they have 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.890
 maps that in 360 he's more beautiful 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.500
 let's say like this 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.810
 but in leather 1cor pado for the console 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.530
 for Sunday season it might be yes 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.169
 koff of goals and gave the one that I 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.700
 I would tell you and that charm for 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.700
 Xbox 360 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:18.480
 due to its renewal is certain due to the 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.230
 its innovation for the time since the xbox 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.590
 one 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.780
 he did not have much too much fun 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.210
 let it were about to speak to 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.220
 You look, this game is a very 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.200
 Fantastic, you have to buy the game. 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.940
 because the game is really on time 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.190
 a matter of graphic beauty and I 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.350
 particularly expected more of the game 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.750
 It's okay if I tell you not to 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.120
 I did not expect I'm not lying to myself 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.540
 I particularly expected a lot about this 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.900
 I was expecting a lot about the content of 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.870
 play the content in the general context it 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.380
 It is cool all right the contents of the lc 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:58.680
 maps are ipê cool but really the 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.990
 graphic game question I expected more 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.540
 It works, you can see it from here. 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.330
 a piece of iron on the floor I expected 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.280
 another context over the game're beautiful I 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.150
 I give 9 note to this game here for the 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:15.120
 xbox one of life I have already played it on 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.850
 360 so really when you play one 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.500
 game on a previous platform 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.900
 and you will play the same game in the new 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.000
 platform the game kind of does not 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.970
 stay with that grace and that 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.250
 that kind of expectation we're going 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.710
 say so you would if you did not 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.780
 play if the game before but really on 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.479
 My opinion, the game is cool 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.720
 logical game is not extraordinary ' 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.330
 compared 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.600
 the previous platform but I wanted to bring 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.910
 at least a little bit of the game call of 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.680
 duty like xbox one for you 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.710
 can at least have an idea of ​​the 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.540
 context of the game in general in the 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.420
 graphic is right 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.240
 Good crowd, that's it, that's it. 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.610
 here is our part, I'm going to give 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.070
 Good study because I just sang the 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.410
 game then I did not play much 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.880
 the content of the game but simply I 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.690
 I'm going to study and I'll give a 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.000
 trained 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.340
 I'll try to get a content one 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.770
 a little more and so I can bring a 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:17.230
 cool content and do some 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:20.020
 game place is for you too koff do 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.640
 Like the beauty then the guys I go to 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.530
 staying here I want to wish that 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.460
 he is a big strong hug to everyone and even 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.000
 the next 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.000
 fable
