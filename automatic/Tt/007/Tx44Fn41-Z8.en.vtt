00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
never doubt the hog an eyesore I'm going

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
never doubt the hog an eyesore I'm going
back<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.869> church<00:01:21.200> but<00:01:22.200> yeah<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:23.009> got<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.549> an

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
back to church but yeah we got into an

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.630 
back to church but yeah we got into an
accident<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.840> funny<00:01:25.049> thing<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.250> bike

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
accident and the funny thing is the bike

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
accident and the funny thing is the bike
I<00:01:27.140> think<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:30.150> Shogun<00:01:30.840> frame<00:01:31.229> sliders

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
I think the the Shogun frame sliders

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
I think the the Shogun frame sliders
saved<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.909> bike<00:01:33.119> took<00:01:33.420> most<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.930> hit

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
saved the bike took most of the hit

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.300 
saved the bike took most of the hit
really<00:01:34.560> when<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.189> skidded<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> ground<00:01:36.090> um

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
really when it skidded on the ground um

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.170 
really when it skidded on the ground um
it<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.880> couple<00:01:39.210> scratches<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.180> on

it just a couple scratches you know on
the<00:01:42.689> side<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.079> bike<00:01:43.290> wasn't<00:01:43.979> even<00:01:44.340> dented

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the side of the bike wasn't even dented

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.280 
the side of the bike wasn't even dented
