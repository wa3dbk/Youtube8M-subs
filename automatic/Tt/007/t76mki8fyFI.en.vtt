 it is important to help 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.320
 explained so 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.700
 Today we warmly welcome this to our two authors and video 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.800
 yes, at any time go for dangerous hunting again but before we do that today 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.860
 Doing such diseases one just goes out of his way to be the actions 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.239
 from the Board of Directors, which I know takes more time 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.139
 "It's very important to know how the situation develops where you are 

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:29.079
 preferably 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.369
 Love lies I am certainly not a contradiction 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.069
 and Bavaria 

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:36.730
 Ritchie both developments too 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.920
 despite crass 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.840
 the sound will now also support my desk and varnish 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.280
 continue 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.540
 who does not recognize that and sometimes 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.900
 such a governing with his first working groups and that in the literal 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.440
 Sense of the first show lamenting stuff around coco-bonds so a bit 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.490
 they highlight and reflect on the work that is a bit more enjoyable too 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.970
 do 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.550
 the second step will be 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.550
 then it would be about the Pokemon 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.590
 and he returns in the third show blade-servers 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.790
 we have here to measure their three dogs the debtor of the world 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.840
 align 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.660
 and youth center spreads see 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.660
 the native Licher who over maps and around 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.010
 after all, lock and hacker 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.000
 Here in focus, the GEMA have caught the we then fed a bit 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 because they know passive and affluent your dream 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.200
 why works are already there and how much that is ours presented 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.940
 but not 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.050
 by Thomas Gutmann the customer so if you are still all the while 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.190
 Socialists 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.750
 and promptly 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.320
 exactly 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.230
 It is also very important Berrer SMS both Aquarius Boku is easy 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.130

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.430
 very important for us also the draw against dangerous effect and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.480
 fight such as political culture and pure nature 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.479
 then with their insistence on the protection you can get dressed 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.890
 but no injuries happier happened 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.489
 then finally in our heads Ska St 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.909

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.999
 where a butterfly to book you have at Lufthansa 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.419
 the problem with these problems is that is pretty quite rare that is 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:26.029
 often were so fond of 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.090
 and is doing Vanja Schauer but must for the one variant 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:31.499

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.549
