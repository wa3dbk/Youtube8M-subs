00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.579 

notice<00:00:01.020> again<00:00:01.199> so<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.250> problem<00:00:02.669> that<00:00:03.589> he's

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
notice again so the problem that he's

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.970 
notice again so the problem that he's
spinning<00:00:04.980> around<00:00:05.069> us<00:00:05.490> too<00:00:05.759> fast<00:00:06.740> so<00:00:07.740> he's<00:00:07.859> not

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
spinning around us too fast so he's not

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.850 
spinning around us too fast so he's not
actually<00:00:08.250> facing<00:00:09.000> us<00:00:09.469> or<00:00:10.969> in<00:00:11.969> front<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.300> us<00:00:12.420> so

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
actually facing us or in front of us so

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.250 
actually facing us or in front of us so
let's<00:00:13.860> fix<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.250> that's<00:00:14.549> part<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.820> his<00:00:14.940> AI<00:00:18.260> so

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
let's fix that that's part of his AI so

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.420 
let's fix that that's part of his AI so
remove<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.800> enemy<00:00:20.160> AI<00:00:22.010> who's<00:00:23.010> going<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> set<00:00:23.400> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
remove the enemy AI who's going to set a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.310 
remove the enemy AI who's going to set a
public<00:00:24.529> int<00:00:25.550> will<00:00:26.550> say<00:00:27.920> mini<00:00:28.920> distance

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
public int will say mini distance

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.510 
public int will say mini distance
let's<00:00:31.320> talk<00:00:31.470> max<00:00:31.740> distance<00:00:34.250> now<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.399> is

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
let's talk max distance now this is

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.160 
let's talk max distance now this is
going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> maximum<00:00:36.239> distance<00:00:36.600> we'll

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
going to be the maximum distance we'll

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.630 
going to be the maximum distance we'll
be<00:00:37.290> away<00:00:37.530> from<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.860> before<00:00:38.010> he<00:00:38.250> starts<00:00:38.489> moving

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
be away from you before he starts moving

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.580 
be away from you before he starts moving
towards<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> start<00:00:41.190> function

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
towards you so on the start function

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.510 
towards you so on the start function
we're<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.770> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.920> say<00:00:44.100> max<00:00:44.730> distance<00:00:46.520> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
we're just going to say max distance is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.200 
we're just going to say max distance is
equal<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:49.760> 2<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:52.850> remember<00:00:53.850> he's<00:00:53.940> going<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
equal to 2 now remember he's going to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.830 
equal to 2 now remember he's going to
attack<00:00:54.510> at<00:00:55.219> 2.5<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> an<00:00:58.590> update<00:00:59.719> we'll<00:01:00.719> keep

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
attack at 2.5 so an update we'll keep

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.250 
attack at 2.5 so an update we'll keep
looking<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.590> he's<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.309> move

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
looking at it so he's not going to move

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.210 
looking at it so he's not going to move
unless<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.439> distance<00:01:05.150> is<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.420> greater<00:01:06.750> than<00:01:06.930> 2

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
unless this distance is a greater than 2

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.330 
unless this distance is a greater than 2
so<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.460> vector<00:01:09.360> 3<00:01:11.479> distance<00:01:12.710> our<00:01:13.710> targets

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so this vector 3 distance our targets

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
so this vector 3 distance our targets
distance<00:01:15.030> our<00:01:15.930> targets<00:01:17.119> Trent's<00:01:18.119> well<00:01:18.600> I

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
distance our targets Trent's well I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
distance our targets Trent's well I
shall<00:01:19.200> target<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> transform<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.640> used

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
shall target is a transform here so used

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.999 
shall target is a transform here so used
to<00:01:21.470> target<00:01:22.470> position<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.640> car<00:01:24.600> position

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.630 

which<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.310> cash<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.420> transform<00:01:31.640> not

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
which we have cash see my transform not

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:50.830 
which we have cash see my transform not
position<00:01:34.579> is<00:01:35.579> greater<00:01:36.000> than<00:01:37.880> max<00:01:38.880> distance

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.920 

let's<00:01:51.840> save<00:01:52.080> that<00:01:52.110> off<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:54.450> sure<00:01:54.659> we're<00:01:54.810> over

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
let's save that off we sure we're over

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.680 
let's save that off we sure we're over
the<00:01:55.050> airs

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
the airs

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.060 
the airs
and<00:01:57.690> let's<00:01:58.260> try<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.560> out

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.590 

so<00:02:02.070> buddy<00:02:02.250> gets<00:02:02.400> within<00:02:02.670> two<00:02:02.880> he<00:02:03.060> should<00:02:03.240> stop

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
so buddy gets within two he should stop

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.570 
so buddy gets within two he should stop
there<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.650> go<00:02:04.770> your<00:02:05.760> cactus<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.750> attacked<00:02:07.050> us

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
there we go your cactus the attacked us

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:17.150 
there we go your cactus the attacked us
the<00:02:08.580> cactus<00:02:09.140> we<00:02:10.140> can<00:02:10.289> attack<00:02:10.560> back<00:02:13.550> alright<00:02:16.160> so

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
the cactus we can attack back alright so

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.860 
the cactus we can attack back alright so
we<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.280> our<00:02:17.430> small<00:02:17.820> little<00:02:17.850> combat<00:02:18.480> system

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
we have our small little combat system

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.780 
we have our small little combat system
in<00:02:18.959> place<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.860> next<00:02:20.069> week<00:02:20.310> we'll<00:02:20.430> work<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.760> a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
in place so next week we'll work on a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.340 
in place so next week we'll work on a
targeting<00:02:21.239> system<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.780> allows<00:02:21.989> us<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.230> have

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
targeting system that allows us to have

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.500 
targeting system that allows us to have
multiple<00:02:22.620> enemies<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.459> scene<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.360> we'll

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
multiple enemies in the scene and we'll

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.780 
multiple enemies in the scene and we'll
be<00:02:24.630> able<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.840> target<00:02:25.050> through<00:02:25.410> each<00:02:25.530> one<00:02:25.790> till

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
be able to target through each one till

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.420 
be able to target through each one till
then<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.209> fun
