00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 is a problem that is solved with a 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.919
 surgery is eyelid cough let's 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.380
 know better than that is that we are 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.500
 speak with the help of Dr. Luisa a 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.160
 was asking for the election of the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.199
 morning hour and it is not easy you need 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.000
 also see with ours where is the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.590
 problem is we have to consider that the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.410
 problem arose because the term means 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.869
 an increase of the eyelid that this is 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.510
 normal what exactly is not normal is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.320
 I'm eyelid stay down 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.829
 what is normal for both is tava 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.870
 cover a Sunday affection from the eye in the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.480
 But it's not just a problem. 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.399
 is a functional problem 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.530
 is one of the most important 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.360
 organs and this causes difficulty in 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 active vision light person not female 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.829
 completely blocked television but 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.469
 causes a decrease of the field in the field 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.730
 of vision but in some cases ends up 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.450
 continue beyond this difficulty 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.900
 some tiredness that is only beyond 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.189
 often get werton 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.909
 head 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.000
 some people take a stand 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.909
 tendentious raise the cash squad 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.189
 try to compensate for the excess 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.280
 eyelid strip other people are 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.380
 constantly contracting muscles 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.540
 cause a renewal of the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.729
 region of the eyebrow at the same time 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.320
 also try to have a 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.920
 renewal thereof 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 now the variance to various causes 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.409
 before we talk about the causes now 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.759
 pastor simply think it's easy 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.750
 realize that we are talking 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.630
 but we brought some photos 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.460
 We would pass the fair already published in this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.439
 moment to realize in this case already 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.930
 here we have a bad situation by 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.950
 correct and rectify it 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.290
 button this is a case of mapitol to 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.860
 congenital or that person is thus 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.350
 who was born and therefore has this 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.200
 lowering of the upper eyelid in 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.150
 to the other normal eyelid 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.099
 is to do with 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.340
 with a formation of the muscle responsible 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.659
 for pulling up talk as a musician 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.569
 of the eyelid 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.579
 we have one more campus to spend too 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.970
 in this also running not in this case is 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:29.310
 which is neither truly a ptosis 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.290
 of the more traditional houses 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.750
 in this case it is a very 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.030
 as there is going to be a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.819
 hardening of people, this is a 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.370
 War plays lazio which also causes of 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.310
 a lowering of the eyelid 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.970
 with a skin graft that is 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.889
 accumulates and that people actually 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.049
 measure effectively becoming more 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.900
 have very frequent in people with 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.939
 elderly women and it is certain that if we 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.220
 now thoughtfully 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.620
 remember some people have this this 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.170
 problem that causes many cases to 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.180
 same symptomatology girl already pains 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.439
 head difficulty and decrease of the field 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.230
 visual impairment and also fatigue and 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.250
 compensatory replacement region 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.069
 front line 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.120
 Let's not say now that it comes from 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.150
 causes of a cause already 20 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.810
 suzana thus gets to pass other 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.409
 causes 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.840
 just as much the cause of origin 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.209
 on the site to a malformation of the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.819
 musician or a muscular problem for 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.250
 example the chronic use of 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.069
 contact patients can inform and 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.349
 can irritate the musician who elevates 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.849
 eyelid and even cause 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.919
 transient bike 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:52.019
 there are also some situations associated 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.329
 certain accelerated form or that is due 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.569
 in which the musician progressively goes 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.639
 getting more there think or whistle the uncertain 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.970
 its insertion and in this case the movement 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.549
 close grip and take up the ability to 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.599
 huwara eyelid up can be a 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.229
 muscular cause 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:14.609
 then nervous situations soybean the por 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:18.299
 some nerve motive responsible for giving the 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.880
 function the musician has an injury can be 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.190
 in some cases of brain tumors or 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.120
 type of technology that can be 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.000
 condition 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.970
 and if and then the situations 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.490
 that have to do with 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.740
 an illusion of example imagine that aper 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.820
 these situations that cause 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.880
 do not you think 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.520
 we already mentioned before here is the case 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.790
 in which the defendant's chief actually causes 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.919
 some weight and conditions 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.010
 eye closure 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.630
 let's talk about public treatment in 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.910
 that the wind in question has already been 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.789
 born with her face nor congenital 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.380
 all others can be symptoms of 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.320
 other diseases this is also so 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:06.449
 do not forget it 's a trip to the doctor 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.190
 to realize the why of clothes 0 did 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.100
 This is one thing I said was 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.110
 one thing, let's say almost a day 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.610
 for the other this can happen in this 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.639
 case it is obviously very important to 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.699
 people being in this type of pathology 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:24.080
 in this case we are obviously talking 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:26.610
 only given paulo white upper height 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.400
 although there are also some other 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.070
 situations for example associated with 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.810
 lower eyelid but no longer 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.990
 falls within the capital 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.240
 probably palpating the eyelid 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.240
 superior is that this objective is 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.410
 close this question a bit is to speak 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:54.720
 the kind of child intervention that is a 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:57.930
 easy surgery and yes it is a 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.080
 surgery that people do not really 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.229
 extremely anxious people can 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.630
 be performed under local anesthesia 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:10.620
 It is a very little decision to stay 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.090
 disguised in the upper eyelid and all 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.599
 have most people have a 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.520
 prainha right upper same time and 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:20.340
 do you do at any age and 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.639
 yes only in December rates usually 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.639
 happened was still a child should not be 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.639
 denied 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.080
 there will depend affection and a child 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.180
 given the gravity if you build a 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.040
 single-seat and warn 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.440
 obviously a child in front of 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.750
 talk about having an operation with an aunt 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.210
 as local justice because it will not 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.080
 will not last for many times will end up 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.610
 be passed in time and planned in time 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.000
 intervention is obviously something that 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.410
 very often parents and 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 doctors themselves advise that the 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.940
 intervention is made as 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.420
 possible future required the 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.420
 economy
