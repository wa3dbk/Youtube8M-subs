up<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.759> just

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.040 

that<00:02:02.220> was<00:02:02.370> pretty<00:02:02.520> much<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> pain<00:02:03.030> because<00:02:03.450> it

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
that was pretty much a pain because it

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.930 
that was pretty much a pain because it
it's<00:02:04.860> hard<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.520> normal<00:02:05.790> size

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
it's hard to get to with a normal size

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.120 
it's hard to get to with a normal size
socket<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.810> would<00:02:07.380> recommend<00:02:07.530> using<00:02:07.950> your

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
socket so I would recommend using your

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.300 
socket so I would recommend using your
little<00:02:08.550> socket<00:02:09.030> which<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.960> replace<00:02:10.290> mine<00:02:10.560> or

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
little socket which I replace mine or

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.700 
little socket which I replace mine or
misplace<00:02:12.210> mine<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:15.290> really<00:02:16.290> don't<00:02:16.410> know<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.650> I

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
misplace mine I really don't know what I

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.030 
misplace mine I really don't know what I
did<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.730> anyways<00:02:21.530> once<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.650> once<00:02:22.920> you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.210 
did with it so anyways once you once you
pull<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:25.130> DM<00:02:26.480> battery<00:02:27.480> tray<00:02:28.110> out<00:02:28.290> you're

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220

it's<00:02:42.060> hard<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.390> get<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.810> bolt<00:02:43.140> right<00:02:43.380> here

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
it's hard to get to this bolt right here

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.740 
it's hard to get to this bolt right here
for<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.040> battery<00:02:44.370> tray<00:02:44.610> if<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.210> don't<00:02:45.420> loosen

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
for the battery tray if you don't loosen

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.090 
for the battery tray if you don't loosen
it<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:45.990> just<00:02:46.050> loosened<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:46.770> can<00:02:46.920> push

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
it out of the way a little bit and then

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.980 
it out of the way a little bit and then
once<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.320> get<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.850> out<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.750> press

once you get it all that out you press
your<00:02:52.170> switches<00:02:52.530> right<00:02:52.709> here<00:02:53.240> and<00:02:54.470> just<00:02:55.470> got

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
your switches right here and just got

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.470 
your switches right here and just got
that<00:02:55.709> little<00:02:55.980> connector<00:02:56.610> on<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.450> just

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
that little connector on it you just

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.440 
that little connector on it you just
squeeze<00:02:57.990> it<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:59.040> pop<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.310> right<00:02:59.430> off<00:02:59.610> and<00:03:00.030> to

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
squeeze it and pop it right off and to

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.960 
squeeze it and pop it right off and to
get<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.750> off<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.500> can't<00:03:01.770> use<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:01.980> socket<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:02.940> I

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
get it off you can't use a socket so I

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.940 
get it off you can't use a socket so I
just<00:03:03.240> use<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.390> pair<00:03:03.600> of<00:03:03.660> channellocks<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.709> not

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
just use a pair of channellocks it's not

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.410 
just use a pair of channellocks it's not
really<00:03:05.370> tight<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:05.760> there<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.150> when<00:03:06.330> you

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
really tight on there and when you

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.729 
really tight on there and when you
replace<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:06.989> don't<00:03:07.140> want<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.380> put<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> real

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
replace it you don't want to put a real

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.229 
replace it you don't want to put a real
tight<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:07.950> there<00:03:08.250> right<00:03:08.730> now<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:09.030> just

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
tight on there right now it's just

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.000 
tight on there right now it's just
finger<00:03:09.900> grip<00:03:10.110> because<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.350> just<00:03:10.530> brewed<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.860> in

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
finger grip because I just brewed it in

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.420 
finger grip because I just brewed it in
so<00:03:11.880> that's<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.209> second<00:03:12.600> third<00:03:12.870> gear<00:03:13.430> the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
so that's the second third gear the

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
pressure switch your pressure switch is

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.250 
pressure switch your pressure switch is
actually<00:03:55.860> behind<00:03:56.340> here<00:03:56.730> um<00:03:57.390> it<00:03:57.660> plugs<00:03:58.080> in

right here off and remove it but I

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.020 
right here off and remove it but I
didn't<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.010> just<00:04:08.220> moved<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.519> out<00:04:08.580> of<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.730> way

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
didn't I just moved it out of the way

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.789 
didn't I just moved it out of the way
got<00:04:09.480> my<00:04:09.600> channel<00:04:09.900> locks<00:04:10.049> in<00:04:10.200> there<00:04:10.350> popped<00:04:10.620> it

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
got my channel locks in there popped it

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.890 
got my channel locks in there popped it
off<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.250> then<00:04:11.820> screwed<00:04:12.359> it<00:04:12.480> right<00:04:12.600> back<00:04:12.690> in

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
off and then screwed it right back in

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.360 
off and then screwed it right back in
tightened<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:13.980> put<00:04:14.100> a

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
tightened it and put a

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.789 
tightened it and put a
so<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:15.209> fourth<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.930> fourth<00:04:16.109> gear<00:04:16.410> one<00:04:16.620> is

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
so the fourth the fourth gear one is

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.220 
so the fourth the fourth gear one is
really<00:04:17.130> simple<00:04:17.609> it's<00:04:18.060> literally<00:04:18.570> one<00:04:18.930> bolt

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
really simple it's literally one bolt

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.770 
really simple it's literally one bolt
and<00:04:20.100> then<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.609> little<00:04:20.820> thing<00:04:21.570> right<00:04:21.720> here

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
and then this little thing right here

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.689 
and then this little thing right here
and<00:04:22.199> then<00:04:22.800> when<00:04:22.889> you<00:04:22.949> go<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.070> replace<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.669> you

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
and then when you go to replace it you

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.760 
and then when you go to replace it you
just<00:04:23.940> put<00:04:24.090> this<00:04:24.180> back<00:04:24.360> on<00:04:24.600> in<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.260> same<00:04:25.410> order

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
just put this back on in the same order

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.689 
just put this back on in the same order
and<00:04:27.530> put<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:28.650> back<00:04:28.860> and<00:04:29.070> make<00:04:29.250> sure<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:29.610> a

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
and put this back and make sure it's a

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:30.710 
and put this back and make sure it's a
little<00:04:29.910> center<00:04:30.150> piece<00:04:30.300> right<00:04:30.449> here<00:04:30.600> this

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
little center piece right here this

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.050 
little center piece right here this
little<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.800> little<00:04:31.860> plug<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.490> all<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:32.970> way

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
little this little plug is all the way

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.879 
little this little plug is all the way
out<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.479> so<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.110> can<00:04:34.229> get<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:34.470> back<00:04:34.680> into

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
out of it so you can get it back into

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.080 
out of it so you can get it back into
the<00:04:35.010> frame<00:04:35.160> of<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.310> car<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.669> then<00:04:35.790> once<00:04:35.970> you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
the frame of the car and then once you

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.500 
the frame of the car and then once you
slide<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:37.050> insert<00:04:37.530> right<00:04:37.680> here<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.949> anchor

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
slide the insert right here the anchor

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.879 
slide the insert right here the anchor
you'll<00:04:39.510> push<00:04:39.750> that<00:04:39.930> through<00:04:40.139> nails<00:04:40.440> it'll

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
you'll push that through nails it'll

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.040 
you'll push that through nails it'll
split<00:04:41.160> these<00:04:41.310> prongs<00:04:41.699> out<00:04:42.000> for<00:04:42.210> you<00:04:42.330> so<00:04:42.930> it

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
split these prongs out for you so it

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.439 
split these prongs out for you so it
stays<00:04:43.290> in<00:04:43.500> there<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.130> it's<00:04:44.669> nice<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:44.970> tighten

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
stays in there so it's nice and tighten

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.060 
stays in there so it's nice and tighten

people<00:04:52.680> at<00:04:52.889> Honda<00:04:53.190> said<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:54.350> actually<00:04:55.350> had

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
people at Honda said that actually had

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.440 
people at Honda said that actually had
to<00:04:55.770> get<00:04:55.950> underneath<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.729> car<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:56.970> do<00:04:57.300> it

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
to get underneath the car to do it

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.450 
to get underneath the car to do it
because<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.780> was<00:04:57.900> on<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.050> bottom<00:04:58.440> and<00:04:59.070> I<00:04:59.280> got

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
because it was on the bottom and I got

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.550 
because it was on the bottom and I got
underneath<00:04:59.850> there<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.320> had<00:05:01.320> never<00:05:01.440> done

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
underneath there and I had never done

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.050 
underneath there and I had never done
this<00:05:01.770> before<00:05:01.919> so<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.280> got<00:05:02.460> underneath<00:05:02.820> there

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
this before so I got underneath there

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.690 
this before so I got underneath there
and<00:05:03.300> I<00:05:04.290> figured<00:05:04.770> out<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:04.919> that's<00:05:05.280> not<00:05:05.550> where

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
and I figured out that that's not where

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.460 
and I figured out that that's not where
you<00:05:05.789> were<00:05:05.880> supposed<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.270> be<00:05:06.419> so<00:05:07.080> I<00:05:07.110> came<00:05:07.350> up

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
you were supposed to be so I came up

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.750 
you were supposed to be so I came up
here<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.650> I<00:05:07.740> just<00:05:07.889> started<00:05:08.130> taking<00:05:08.250> pieces

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
here and I just started taking pieces

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.210 
here and I just started taking pieces
out<00:05:08.880> one<00:05:09.090> by<00:05:09.240> one<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:10.470> turned<00:05:10.889> out<00:05:10.979> to<00:05:11.100> be<00:05:11.130> a

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
out one by one and it turned out to be a

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.490 
out one by one and it turned out to be a
fairly<00:05:11.430> easy<00:05:11.550> adventure<00:05:12.180> oh<00:05:12.389> one<00:05:13.289> thing<00:05:13.320> I

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
fairly easy adventure oh one thing I

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.260 
fairly easy adventure oh one thing I
