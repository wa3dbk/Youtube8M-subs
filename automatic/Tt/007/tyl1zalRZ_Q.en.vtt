way it looks like you can't I'm gonna
work<00:02:28.210> fine<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.680> uh<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:30.220> guess<00:02:31.060> that<00:02:31.240> gives<00:02:31.420> you

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
work fine but uh I guess that gives you

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.200 
work fine but uh I guess that gives you
some<00:02:31.780> adjustment<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.680> chain<00:02:33.610> length<00:02:33.910> on

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
some adjustment on the chain length on

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.250 
some adjustment on the chain length on
this<00:02:34.420> side<00:02:35.190> more<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.430> than<00:02:36.610> that<00:02:36.640> side<00:02:37.260> they

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
this side more so than that side they

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.850 
this side more so than that side they
went<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.560> fine<00:02:38.920> tightened<00:02:39.880> up<00:02:40.260> new<00:02:41.260> axle<00:02:41.800> and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
went on fine tightened up new axle and

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.350 
went on fine tightened up new axle and
do<00:02:41.980> nut<00:02:42.630> new<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.840> Durotar<00:02:44.970> these<00:02:45.970> are<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.210> old

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
do nut new and Durotar these are the old

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.700 
do nut new and Durotar these are the old
parts<00:02:46.930> showed<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.160> previous<00:02:49.140> hole<00:02:50.140> nut<00:02:50.470> that

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
parts showed you previous hole nut that

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.040 
parts showed you previous hole nut that
was<00:02:50.830> stripped<00:02:51.190> out<00:02:51.510> because<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.720> way<00:02:52.840> they

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
was stripped out because of the way they

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.570 
was stripped out because of the way they
lock<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.220> mm<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:56.230> socket<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:57.190> can<00:02:57.250> definitely

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
lock it mm and socket you can definitely

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.130 
lock it mm and socket you can definitely
see<00:02:58.060> it's<00:02:58.260> it's<00:02:59.260> rounded<00:03:00.540> WR<00:03:01.540> got<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> little

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
see it's it's rounded WR got a little

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.340 
see it's it's rounded WR got a little
power<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:04.150> uh<00:03:04.980> that's<00:03:05.980> it
