00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.110 

I'll<00:00:10.780> be<00:00:10.900> demonstrating<00:00:11.140> the<00:00:12.010> pearl<00:00:12.310> cast<00:00:12.790> on

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
I'll be demonstrating the pearl cast on

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.800 
I'll be demonstrating the pearl cast on
it<00:00:13.930> can<00:00:14.110> be<00:00:14.230> useful<00:00:14.440> in<00:00:14.920> helping<00:00:14.950> your<00:00:15.880> edge<00:00:16.209> to

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
it can be useful in helping your edge to

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.220 
it can be useful in helping your edge to
not<00:00:17.080> curl<00:00:17.619> and<00:00:18.070> it's<00:00:18.640> also<00:00:18.940> nice<00:00:19.330> to<00:00:19.690> use<00:00:19.960> in

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
not curl and it's also nice to use in

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.650 
not curl and it's also nice to use in
conjunction<00:00:20.440> with<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.490> long<00:00:21.790> tail<00:00:22.060> cast<00:00:22.090> on

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
conjunction with the long tail cast on

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.410 
conjunction with the long tail cast on
when<00:00:23.439> cast<00:00:23.980> so<00:00:24.310> that<00:00:24.460> you<00:00:24.550> are<00:00:24.640> able<00:00:24.850> to<00:00:25.150> cast

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
when cast so that you are able to cast

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.290 
when cast so that you are able to cast
on<00:00:25.690> it<00:00:25.840> rib<00:00:26.140> which<00:00:26.650> I<00:00:26.800> will<00:00:26.980> demonstrate<00:00:27.300> after

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
on it rib which I will demonstrate after

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.740 
on it rib which I will demonstrate after
this

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
this

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.440 
this
so<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.440> begin<00:00:29.650> to<00:00:29.950> pearl<00:00:30.190> cast<00:00:30.520> on<00:00:30.850> you<00:00:31.240> have

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
so to begin to pearl cast on you have

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.810 
so to begin to pearl cast on you have
the<00:00:31.600> same<00:00:31.840> setup<00:00:32.290> that<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.890> have<00:00:33.190> with<00:00:33.640> the

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
the same setup that you have with the

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.960 
the same setup that you have with the
long<00:00:34.000> tail<00:00:34.330> we<00:00:34.930> start<00:00:35.290> with<00:00:35.470> a<00:00:35.500> slipknot<00:00:35.970> our

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
long tail we start with a slipknot our

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.020 
long tail we start with a slipknot our
tail<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:37.750> in<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.110> front<00:00:38.470> of<00:00:38.890> our<00:00:39.309> working<00:00:39.850> yarn

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
tail is in the front of our working yarn

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.130 
tail is in the front of our working yarn
is<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.870> the<00:00:41.020> back<00:00:41.820> putting<00:00:42.820> our<00:00:43.090> thumb<00:00:43.360> and

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
is to the back putting our thumb and

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.090 
is to the back putting our thumb and
index<00:00:44.920> finger<00:00:45.329> inside<00:00:46.329> here<00:00:46.899> we<00:00:47.649> have<00:00:47.920> the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
index finger inside here we have the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.060 
index finger inside here we have the
same<00:00:48.370> setup<00:00:48.880> that<00:00:49.300> we<00:00:49.840> do<00:00:50.050> for<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.500> long<00:00:50.680> tail

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
same setup that we do for the long tail

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.420 
same setup that we do for the long tail
now<00:00:52.059> working<00:00:52.899> the<00:00:52.930> pearl<00:00:53.290> cast<00:00:53.680> on<00:00:54.010> we<00:00:54.370> are

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
now working the pearl cast on we are

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.340 
now working the pearl cast on we are
going<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.640> be<00:00:54.760> concerned<00:00:55.270> with<00:00:55.450> this<00:00:55.870> strand

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
going to be concerned with this strand

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.750 
going to be concerned with this strand
which<00:00:57.309> I<00:00:57.460> will<00:00:57.579> call<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:57.910> index<00:00:58.390> strand<00:00:59.320> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
which I will call the index strand and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.720 
which I will call the index strand and
this<00:01:00.760> one<00:01:01.120> here<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:02.500> outer<00:01:02.739> one<00:01:03.160> or<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.430> thumb

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
this one here the outer one or the thumb

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.290 
this one here the outer one or the thumb
that<00:01:04.180> I<00:01:04.239> will<00:01:04.540> call<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:05.140> thumb<00:01:05.500> strand<00:01:06.430> so<00:01:07.240> to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
that I will call the thumb strand so to

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.540 
that I will call the thumb strand so to
begin<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.410> pearl<00:01:08.979> cast<00:01:09.490> on<00:01:09.850> we<00:01:10.750> go<00:01:11.050> under<00:01:11.979> the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
begin the pearl cast on we go under the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.830 
begin the pearl cast on we go under the
index<00:01:13.590> down<00:01:14.590> through<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.580> thumb<00:01:15.909> and<00:01:16.270> toward

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
index down through the thumb and toward

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.140 
index down through the thumb and toward
you<00:01:18.840> over<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.020> index<00:01:21.810> over<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.320> thumb<00:01:24.150> up

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
you over the index over the thumb up

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.240 
you over the index over the thumb up
through<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.049> thumb<00:01:26.939> under<00:01:27.939> the<00:01:28.119> index<00:01:28.689> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
through the thumb under the index and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.340 
through the thumb under the index and
done

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.429 

you<00:01:33.950> can<00:01:34.100> see<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.549> bit<00:01:34.970> tricky<00:01:35.479> let's<00:01:36.110> start

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
you can see a bit tricky let's start

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.620 
you can see a bit tricky let's start
again<00:01:37.119> under<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.330> index<00:01:39.580> down<00:01:40.580> through<00:01:41.420> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
again under the index down through the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.130 
again under the index down through the
thumb<00:01:41.960> towards<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:43.960> over<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.170> index<00:01:47.140> over

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
thumb towards you over the index over

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.570 
thumb towards you over the index over
the<00:01:48.320> thumb<00:01:48.680> up<00:01:49.520> through<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.750> thumb<00:01:51.399> under<00:01:52.399> the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
the thumb up through the thumb under the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.460 
the thumb up through the thumb under the
index<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:53.770> done<00:01:55.690> if<00:01:56.690> you<00:01:56.869> look<00:01:57.140> at<00:01:57.350> the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
index and done if you look at the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.980 
index and done if you look at the
stitches<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.070> my<00:01:58.100> needle<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:59.299> can<00:01:59.479> see<00:01:59.690> that<00:01:59.869> I

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
stitches on my needle you can see that I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.950 
stitches on my needle you can see that I
am<00:02:00.229> creating<00:02:00.950> purl<00:02:01.369> bumps<00:02:01.880> right<00:02:02.330> here<00:02:02.600> at<00:02:02.780> the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
am creating purl bumps right here at the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.059 
am creating purl bumps right here at the
base<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.200> each<00:02:03.500> cast<00:02:03.860> on<00:02:04.100> stitch<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.990> again<00:02:06.470> we

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
base of each cast on stitch so again we

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.380 
base of each cast on stitch so again we
go<00:02:07.250> behind<00:02:08.060> or<00:02:08.600> under<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.440> index<00:02:10.390> down

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
go behind or under the index down

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.610 
go behind or under the index down
through<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.140> thumb<00:02:12.380> towards<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:14.440> over<00:02:15.440> the
