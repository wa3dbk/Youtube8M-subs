00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.380
 and I fell in love 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.350
 of the illusion of this ability that 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.129
 has the human being to be able to do 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:16.460
 visible the invisible is the closest thing 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.100
 that I have 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 to magic I still can not achieve magic 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.310
 that I want that I want so much 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.320
 to transmit 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.099
 but so far I think I've gone for a 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.099
 good way 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.219
 I say that the base is like a big 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.900
 monster the great abyss that is you 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.470
 pulling and that makes me vertigo 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.470
 here 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.710
 i 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.560
 Y 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.570
 nothing 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.670
 Believing to dance is this desire that I have 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.730
 of wanting to take off from here like 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.220
 want to fly in turning the wind or in 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.540
 convert as the wakes of movement 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.540
 in something that the viewer can see 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.190
 Y 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.760
 Y 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.760
 i 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 Y 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:28.439
 and the butterflies for me is a symbol of 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.439
 external beauty of total beauty 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.170
 I was criticized a lot for the fact 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.910
 that was dancing the measurements that 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.450
 why it goes in the areas for children and not 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.070
 I know for a moment if he hit me and yes yes 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.990
 to exist if it affected me much 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.460
 fact that I could not tell you how to 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.290
 people that a man could be there 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.050
 because it was not my mother who told me 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.760
 look son this one 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.240
 all you want and if you want 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.240
 dance Dance 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.690
 here 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.970
 once 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.450
