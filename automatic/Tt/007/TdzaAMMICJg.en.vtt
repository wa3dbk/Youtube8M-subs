00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
 well let's look after the new 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.340
 by deed 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.840
 the suspect took a good stand 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.990
 we are very good 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.240
 in the picture under the lights and immediately 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.369
 hung hit so far he looks like 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:29.580
 some kind of double to be honest is 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:31.260
 you decide sign maybe it's not rock 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.469
 I know if it was at fire 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.510
 or still something to glitches haze but 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.570
 home record we recorded with bad 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.879
 tickrate therefore it seems that the player is on 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.550
 advancing shoots so far it's only 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.550
 the beginning therefore there can be anything 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.170
 then I'm on the headphones then wear listen 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.930
 it is necessary together good accounting well, there is hardly 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.039
 It was on vodka just for fun 9 we all 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.619
 know well and understand that the gun 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.150
 2 mora dimple 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.090
 plays and so we understand any role on 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.600
 plenary well or not at matchmaking 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.030
 notions of the crowd and whose role is just like that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.570
 stand to the end watching watching both 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.570
 had seen 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.430
 flew like there suspiciously to be honest 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.800
 I looked at the length I wanted to sort of 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.520
 move away but something its 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.580
 what did you bother him? maybe intuition 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.410
 maybe slow what my friend don't know but 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.560
 meanwhile killed on the length you start 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.020
 whether you are flooded at all that is all 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.650
 headshots that got it 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.520
 really just fart just farce this 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.320
 fact he has hello today 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 about her ideas but I don't know it big 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:04.560
 silver star i play so 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.600
 silver that gains overshadows all 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.600
 on the server so you get spoiled 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.700
 it is he and he can not be in my 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.100
 back to wind not like you can wait 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.010
 once again for this round let's oh 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:32.680
 excuse me forgive my bin is worth it 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:36.970
 round they sweep him up some kind of it 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.860
 new recoil in my guys are not at all 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.180
 I can understand 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.180
 let's look at him again 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:58.720
 look after him again a bit like this 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.990
 he new call is a special config 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.430
 or a program that reduces the spread 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.540
 that is, he is not shooting nothing 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.790
 when he is guided he is not a mouse, and that's not 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.210
 using a mouse, its spread is controlled with 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.640
 using this config well or specifically 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.090
 this a4tech mouse is just the same 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.450
 the very thing that people do with the hand he does 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.950
 I do not know by software methods 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.310
 understand 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:38.379
 this is strange shooting to be honest very 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:41.019
 strange try to understand but or 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:46.900
 full of brazen or well, fleas here and so 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:49.269
 as 11 8 let's continue this March 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.050
 I went to the picture of an open flash drive 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.050
 the terrorist 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.569
 decides came infa to ah date he 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.630
 runs to help out their teammates oyoi 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:09.510
 cocoa is gorgeous someone salute salute let 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:12.780
 man in my no embroidered infantfish 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.739
 thinks that he was shot on the grant 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:22.030
 shot from far now he sat down such 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.490
 control is he wait for him killed then 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.900
 Nothing he does not have children, even if either of 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:32.440
 I think the same will now properly go it bugs 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:36.310
 haze i really because of the tickrate 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.510
 because slc demos let 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.410
 16cm gives 16 it seems that in general that 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.410
 index by fate 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.860
 but looking down the sniper went out could him 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.800
 kill him at this moment pavel sight in 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.330
 in the city would not have been in a hack might even 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.889
 pretend he looks down on in 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.690
 the moment sniper left immediately pavel 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.100
 came probably he did it after 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.100
 shot to therefore 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.240
 full this is not knowing to be honest even 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.169
 if four of these chitter do not want 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.260
 ban because i 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.300
 it does not help it fastens it just 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.640
 not helping 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:30.290
 so here are these 11 situation is a bomb in a box 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:33.110
 it seems that you long wow this 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.169
 it's just a masterpiece guys it's a masterpiece I'm not 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.510
 I know how this silver came into my head 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.640
 serious good element meaning he is everything 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:45.100
 understood read now hears looks 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.940
 length and most likely all the same 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.530
 suspicion either but I won't 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:54.590
 let's get him on it that they are definitely not 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:56.090
 know deny you I will leave this 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.419
 moment in the comments required 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.330
 write what you think about this 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.640
 I think that the suspect is not a cheater in 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.380
 tooth side of how bad he plays he 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.660
 he can't shoot at all 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.740
 moves or moves but he is very 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:16.000
 cool now played 11 situation i 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:21.100
 How many I play with subscribers there different 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.380
 silver my head rarely come and 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.280
 bright thoughts for this person 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.340
 the thought came that is, he just as well 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.750
 just how normal conscience played 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:49.210
 I realized that the bomb will take a longstock 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:51.640
 run from the weight on came nosik took here 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.770
 I donâ€™t even know what to remember 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.930
 moments when he shot very generally 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:07:00.669
 Real now in the end began to give 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:06.310
 headshots but as I said, I still 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:09.490
 all the same I will say that no all the same no this 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.370
 not a cheater is some kind of silver 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.590
 which game was sometimes sometimes not going 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:18.850
 but that moment I liked it seems to me 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:21.460
 that there is no 4 confirm we confirm that 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.500
 not really enough not enough 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:27.970
 I don't have proof for this demo 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:31.169
 I want baths just because people because I 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.169
 want it wrong
