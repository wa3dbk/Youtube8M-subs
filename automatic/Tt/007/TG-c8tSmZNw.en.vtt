hello<00:00:00.719> everyone<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.709> here<00:00:02.100> with<00:00:02.280> Michael

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hello everyone I'm here with Michael

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.910 
hello everyone I'm here with Michael
arts<00:00:02.850> from<00:00:03.030> Charles<00:00:03.419> land<00:00:03.659> what<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.110> cylon<00:00:04.680> and

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
arts from Charles land what is cylon and

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.270 
arts from Charles land what is cylon and
we've<00:00:05.460> taken<00:00:05.700> out<00:00:05.940> V<00:00:06.150> 2014<00:00:06.839> Corolla<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:08.069> is

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
we've taken out V 2014 Corolla this is

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.419 
we've taken out V 2014 Corolla this is
our<00:00:08.519> second<00:00:09.150> outing<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.290> Corolla<00:00:10.559> first

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
our second outing in the Corolla first

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.410 
our second outing in the Corolla first
one<00:00:11.639> was<00:00:11.790> with<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.030> manual<00:00:12.389> transmission

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
one was with the manual transmission

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.900 
one was with the manual transmission
this<00:00:13.110> one<00:00:13.320> has<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.679> CVT<00:00:14.280> transmission

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
this one has the CVT transmission

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.029 
this one has the CVT transmission
continuously<00:00:15.540> variable<00:00:15.960> transmission<00:00:16.650> and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
continuously variable transmission and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.800 
continuously variable transmission and
what<00:00:17.789> happens<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.240> there<00:00:18.359> are<00:00:18.390> essentially

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
what happens is there are essentially

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.890 
what happens is there are essentially
two<00:00:18.960> pulleys<00:00:19.880> but<00:00:20.880> make<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.359> transmission

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
two pulleys but make up for transmission

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.090 
two pulleys but make up for transmission
and<00:00:22.109> they're<00:00:22.199> connected<00:00:22.560> by<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> steel<00:00:23.250> belt

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
and they're connected by a steel belt

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.200 
and they're connected by a steel belt
the<00:00:25.430> width<00:00:25.760> of<00:00:26.000> the<00:00:26.240> pulleys<00:00:26.740> of<00:00:27.740> each<00:00:27.920> one

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
the width of the pulleys of each one

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.839 
the width of the pulleys of each one
affects<00:00:29.210> how<00:00:29.510> high<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.800> belt<00:00:31.010> rides<00:00:31.310> in<00:00:31.699> the

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
affects how high the belt rides in the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.479 
affects how high the belt rides in the
groove<00:00:32.119> and<00:00:32.390> it<00:00:32.920> essentially<00:00:33.920> equates<00:00:34.190> to<00:00:34.340> the

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
groove and it essentially equates to the

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.460 
groove and it essentially equates to the
same<00:00:34.640> thing<00:00:34.850> as<00:00:35.000> here<00:00:35.239> gear<00:00:35.900> sprockets<00:00:36.350> on<00:00:36.440> a

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
same thing as here gear sprockets on a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.020 
same thing as here gear sprockets on a
bicycle<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:37.010> front<00:00:37.220> gear<00:00:37.400> in<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.610> back<00:00:37.640> here

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
bicycle the front gear in the back here

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.460 
bicycle the front gear in the back here
so<00:00:38.300> changing<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.690> size<00:00:38.960> of<00:00:39.110> those<00:00:39.200> gears

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
so changing the size of those gears

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.460 
so changing the size of those gears
changes<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.460> gearing<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.030> because<00:00:42.019> you<00:00:42.230> just

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
changes the gearing and because you just

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.560 
changes the gearing and because you just
changed<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.430> width<00:00:43.580> of<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:43.820> gears<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.330> have

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
changed the width of the gears you have

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.990 
changed the width of the gears you have
an<00:00:44.750> infinite<00:00:45.110> number<00:00:45.140> of<00:00:45.410> settings<00:00:45.820> we've<00:00:46.820> got

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
an infinite number of settings we've got

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.299 
an infinite number of settings we've got
that<00:00:47.180> on<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:47.449> cart<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.190> traditionally<00:00:49.190> it's

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
that on this cart and traditionally it's

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.900 
that on this cart and traditionally it's
been<00:00:51.070> unusual<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.280> kind<00:00:52.489> of<00:00:52.580> a<00:00:52.610> funny

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
been unusual and kind of a funny

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.000 
been unusual and kind of a funny
sensation<00:00:53.089> for<00:00:53.660> drivers<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.260> so<00:00:54.410> it's<00:00:54.530> been

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
sensation for drivers and so it's been

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.880 
sensation for drivers and so it's been
kind<00:00:55.339> of<00:00:55.430> slow<00:00:55.610> in<00:00:56.089> coming<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:57.019> market<00:00:57.200> the

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
kind of slow in coming to market the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.380 
kind of slow in coming to market the
other<00:00:58.039> reason<00:00:58.399> is<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:58.730> was<00:00:58.820> difficult<00:00:59.000> to

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
other reason is that it was difficult to

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.029 
other reason is that it was difficult to
put<00:00:59.960> a<00:00:59.989> lot<00:01:00.230> of<00:01:00.350> power<00:01:00.500> through<00:01:00.920> these

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
put a lot of power through these

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.590 
put a lot of power through these
transmissions<00:01:01.670> but<00:01:01.879> they've<00:01:02.030> resolved<00:01:02.450> that

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
transmissions but they've resolved that

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.420 
transmissions but they've resolved that
and<00:01:02.870> they've<00:01:03.530> tweaked<00:01:03.980> how<00:01:04.220> these

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
and they've tweaked how these

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.980 
and they've tweaked how these
transmissions<00:01:05.030> feels<00:01:05.330> something<00:01:05.690> we're

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
transmissions feels something we're

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.170 
transmissions feels something we're
driving<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.250> we've<00:01:07.430> bought<00:01:07.610> it<00:01:07.759> here<00:01:07.970> on<00:01:08.060> the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
driving so we've bought it here on the

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.580 
driving so we've bought it here on the
Corolla<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:08.750> we're<00:01:08.869> going<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.080> see<00:01:09.259> what<00:01:09.440> it's

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
Corolla and we're going to see what it's

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.490 
Corolla and we're going to see what it's
like

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
like

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.300 
like
now<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> thought<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.850> cam<00:01:12.180> hooked<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:13.250> on<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
now I thought a cam hooked up on a

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.850 
now I thought a cam hooked up on a
tachometer<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.060> speedometer<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:16.650> going

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
tachometer and speedometer and I'm going

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.770 
tachometer and speedometer and I'm going
to<00:01:16.920> show<00:01:17.190> you<00:01:17.220> essentially<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.330> happens

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
to show you essentially what happens

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.140 
to show you essentially what happens
here<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.740> we've<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.100> all<00:01:20.370> traffic<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.790> slow

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
here so we've got all traffic will slow

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.940 
here so we've got all traffic will slow
down

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
down

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.900 
down
so<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.610> notice<00:01:23.940> rpms<00:01:24.510> are<00:01:24.690> staying<00:01:25.050> flat<00:01:25.440> at

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
so you notice rpms are staying flat at

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.359 
so you notice rpms are staying flat at
1200<00:01:26.910> even<00:01:27.210> though<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.420> speed<00:01:27.660> is<00:01:27.690> decreasing

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
1200 even though my speed is decreasing

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.580 
1200 even though my speed is decreasing
I'm<00:01:29.369> actually<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> hound<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> throttle

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
I'm actually going to hound the throttle

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.640 
I'm actually going to hound the throttle
into<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> ground<00:01:32.190> here<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.080> watch<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.260> RPMs

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
into the ground here and watch the RPMs

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
into the ground here and watch the RPMs
climb<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.250> then<00:01:35.369> stay<00:01:35.640> steady<00:01:35.940> while<00:01:36.210> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
climb and then stay steady while the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.780 
climb and then stay steady while the
speed<00:01:36.660> picks<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.900> find<00:01:40.140> its

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
speed picks up so it's going to find its

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.540 
speed picks up so it's going to find its
optimum<00:01:41.790> rpm<00:01:42.180> range<00:01:43.280> actually<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.340> one

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
optimum rpm range actually this one

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.490 
optimum rpm range actually this one
climbs<00:01:44.850> that's<00:01:45.720> interesting

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
climbs that's interesting

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.260 
climbs that's interesting
so<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.399> idle<00:01:47.940> or<00:01:48.119> off<00:01:48.300> throttle<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:49.970> kicks<00:01:50.970> an

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
so in idle or off throttle it kicks an

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.790 
so in idle or off throttle it kicks an
RPM<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.810> stays<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.440> doesn't<00:01:52.619> do

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
RPM and stays there but it doesn't do

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.500 
RPM and stays there but it doesn't do
it'll<00:01:52.979> climb

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
it'll climb

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.940 
it'll climb
I<00:01:54.950> will<00:01:55.950> shoot<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.490> thing<00:01:57.470> gonna<00:01:58.470> happen

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
I will shoot that thing gonna happen

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.290 
I will shoot that thing gonna happen
that's<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.430> what<00:01:59.550> happens<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.850> itself

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
that's to see what happens on itself

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.770 
that's to see what happens on itself
yeah

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.730 

okay<00:02:09.610> interesting<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.540> today<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.170> scenario<00:02:12.680> I

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
okay interesting so today the scenario I

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.390 
okay interesting so today the scenario I
described<00:02:13.280> is<00:02:13.490> how<00:02:13.520> Honda<00:02:14.209> have<00:02:14.420> actually

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
described is how Honda have actually

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.220 
described is how Honda have actually
enabled<00:02:16.400> their<00:02:16.550> Sica<00:02:16.910> team<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.540> was<00:02:17.720> kind

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
enabled their Sica team and I was kind

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.720 
enabled their Sica team and I was kind
of<00:02:18.260> expecting<00:02:18.740> a<00:02:18.860> tortoise<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.490> same

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
of expecting a tortoise to be the same

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.130 
of expecting a tortoise to be the same
right<00:02:20.060> Toyota<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:21.050> instead<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.600> simulated

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
right Toyota have instead I simulated

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.800 
right Toyota have instead I simulated
upshift<00:02:25.100> if<00:02:25.700> i<00:02:25.880> had<00:02:26.030> rammed<00:02:26.270> ya<00:02:26.600> it's

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
upshift if i had rammed ya it's

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.570 
upshift if i had rammed ya it's
programmed<00:02:27.230> into<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.530> transmission<00:02:27.950> they

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
programmed into the transmission they

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.190 
programmed into the transmission they
don't<00:02:28.790> need<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.150> do<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.630> only<00:02:29.660> reason

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
don't need to do that the only reason

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.960 
don't need to do that the only reason
they've<00:02:30.320> done<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.460> that<00:02:31.640> for<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
they've done that is so that for the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.730 
they've done that is so that for the
driver<00:02:32.240> it<00:02:32.510> feels<00:02:32.810> like<00:02:33.020> an<00:02:33.200> additional

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
driver it feels like an additional

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.350 
driver it feels like an additional
transmission<00:02:34.160> correct<00:02:34.820> unfortunately

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
transmission correct unfortunately

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.740 
transmission correct unfortunately
that's<00:02:36.260> not<00:02:36.500> using<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.610> engine<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.150> its<00:02:38.330> most

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
that's not using the engine to its most

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
that's not using the engine to its most
optimal<00:02:39.380> settings<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.120> you're<00:02:41.270> actually<00:02:41.600> not

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
optimal settings so you're actually not

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.840 
optimal settings so you're actually not
getting<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.950> most<00:02:43.070> power<00:02:43.400> out<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.820> engine

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
getting the most power out of the engine

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.850 
getting the most power out of the engine
this<00:02:44.240> way<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.690> you're<00:02:45.260> not<00:02:45.350> getting<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.710> best

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
this way and you're not getting the best

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.530 
this way and you're not getting the best
fuel<00:02:46.160> efficiency<00:02:46.700> out<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.180> engine<00:02:47.450> this

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
fuel efficiency out of the engine this

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.990 
fuel efficiency out of the engine this
way<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.620> they've<00:02:48.800> compromised<00:02:49.400> on<00:02:49.640> both<00:02:49.820> of

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
way so they've compromised on both of

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.800 
way so they've compromised on both of
those<00:02:50.060> things<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.630> give<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.440> driver<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.920> more

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
those things to give the driver a more

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.670 
those things to give the driver a more
natural<00:02:53.810> in<00:02:53.930> terms<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.260> what<00:02:54.350> we've<00:02:54.500> come<00:02:54.650> to

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
natural in terms of what we've come to

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.500 
natural in terms of what we've come to
expect<00:02:55.130> driving<00:02:55.820> experience<00:02:56.240> from<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
expect driving experience from the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.900 
expect driving experience from the
automatic<00:02:56.990> transmission<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.790> was

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
automatic transmission so that was

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.850 
automatic transmission so that was
interesting<00:02:59.060> finding<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.780> out<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.260> this

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
interesting finding that out and this

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.490 
interesting finding that out and this
cop<00:03:01.100> is<00:03:01.130> definitely<00:03:01.700> not<00:03:01.790> for<00:03:02.030> us<00:03:02.260> they<00:03:03.260> found

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
cop is definitely not for us they found

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.330 
cop is definitely not for us they found
you<00:03:03.700> good<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:08.620> yeah<00:03:09.620> that's<00:03:09.800> interesting<00:03:09.980> one

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
you good and yeah that's interesting one

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.370 
you good and yeah that's interesting one
thing<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.790> note<00:03:11.000> about<00:03:11.270> that<00:03:12.550> experience<00:03:13.550> was

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
thing to note about that experience was

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.900 
thing to note about that experience was
when<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.440> was<00:03:15.590> slowing<00:03:15.830> down<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.310> set<00:03:16.550> up<00:03:16.730> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
when I was slowing down to set up the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.410 
when I was slowing down to set up the
test<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.840> RPMs<00:03:18.380> did<00:03:18.650> stay<00:03:18.890> at<00:03:19.010> 1,200<00:03:19.970> as<00:03:20.120> my

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
test the RPMs did stay at 1,200 as my

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.600 
test the RPMs did stay at 1,200 as my
speed<00:03:20.720> dropped<00:03:20.989> from<00:03:21.290> basically<00:03:21.830> 80<00:03:22.130> down<00:03:22.400> to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
speed dropped from basically 80 down to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.300 
speed dropped from basically 80 down to
about<00:03:22.730> 20<00:03:23.030> quarters<00:03:23.360> now<00:03:23.830> so<00:03:24.830> in<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.070> regard

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
about 20 quarters now so in that regard

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.310 
about 20 quarters now so in that regard
the<00:03:25.610> transmission<00:03:26.150> was<00:03:26.270> acting<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:26.690> a<00:03:26.810> CVT

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
the transmission was acting like a CVT

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.760 
the transmission was acting like a CVT
transmission

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
transmission

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.560 
transmission
are<00:03:29.770> there<00:03:29.920> any<00:03:30.070> transmission<00:03:30.940> settings<00:03:31.390> I

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
are there any transmission settings I

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.140 
are there any transmission settings I
can<00:03:31.630> make<00:03:31.990> on<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:32.380> no<00:03:32.980> it's<00:03:33.700> just<00:03:33.880> like<00:03:33.970> I

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
can make on this no it's just like I

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.760 
can make on this no it's just like I
said<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.480> pre-programmed<00:03:34.660> but<00:03:35.530> it's

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
said it's pre-programmed but it's

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.760 
said it's pre-programmed but it's
basically<00:03:36.220> coming<00:03:36.460> from<00:03:36.820> our<00:03:37.090> our<00:03:37.770> technology

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
basically coming from our our technology

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.260 
basically coming from our our technology
with<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.040> Prius<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.430> that's<00:03:39.760> what's<00:03:40.000> carried

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
with the Prius and that's what's carried

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.990 
with the Prius and that's what's carried
over<00:03:40.390> here<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.960> think<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.470> we're<00:03:42.250> very

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
over here and I think that we're very

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.750 
over here and I think that we're very
good<00:03:43.180> leaders<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:43.630> that<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.050> that<00:03:44.080> okay

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
good leaders in that and that okay

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.990 
good leaders in that and that okay

I<00:03:46.030> think<00:03:46.690> people<00:03:47.110> unless<00:03:48.040> they're<00:03:48.370> told<00:03:48.610> that

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
I think people unless they're told that

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.160 
I think people unless they're told that
there's<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.030> CVT<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.570> this<00:03:49.780> car<00:03:49.990> won't

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
there's a CVT and this car won't

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.900 
there's a CVT and this car won't
actually<00:03:50.350> really<00:03:50.680> notice<00:03:51.010> no<00:03:51.310> simulation

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
actually really notice no simulation

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.089 
actually really notice no simulation
very<00:03:52.420> well

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.599 

okay<00:03:57.060> that's<00:03:57.239> interesting<00:03:57.499> that's<00:03:58.499> a<00:03:58.829> yeah

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
okay that's interesting that's a yeah

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.839 
okay that's interesting that's a yeah
let's<00:03:59.909> need<00:04:01.129> different<00:04:02.129> takes<00:04:02.549> of<00:04:02.700> your

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
let's need different takes of your

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.540 
let's need different takes of your
philosophies<00:04:03.420> on<00:04:03.659> how<00:04:03.689> the<00:04:03.870> city<00:04:04.349> should<00:04:04.530> be

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.450 

so<00:04:08.120> in<00:04:08.360> addition<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:09.020> CVT<00:04:09.800> transmission

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
so in addition to the CVT transmission

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.400 
so in addition to the CVT transmission
on<00:04:10.640> this<00:04:10.880> Corolla<00:04:11.450> we've<00:04:11.690> also<00:04:11.840> got<00:04:12.080> paddle

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
on this Corolla we've also got paddle

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.950 
on this Corolla we've also got paddle
shifters<00:04:12.740> and<00:04:13.180> which<00:04:14.180> trims<00:04:14.510> are<00:04:14.630> where<00:04:14.900> the

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
shifters and which trims are where the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.960 
shifters and which trims are where the
paddle<00:04:15.200> shifts<00:04:15.470> on<00:04:15.560> there<00:04:16.190> on<00:04:16.310> all<00:04:16.670> the<00:04:16.850> S

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
paddle shifts on there on all the S

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.699 
paddle shifts on there on all the S
models<00:04:17.450> okay<00:04:17.870> oh<00:04:17.900> there's<00:04:18.260> four<00:04:18.470> trim<00:04:18.680> levels

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
models okay oh there's four trim levels

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.240 
models okay oh there's four trim levels
but<00:04:19.130> yes<00:04:19.340> oil<00:04:19.880> as<00:04:20.420> walls<00:04:20.660> yeah<00:04:21.080> and<00:04:21.320> how<00:04:22.040> do<00:04:22.100> I

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
but yes oil as walls yeah and how do I

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.980 
but yes oil as walls yeah and how do I
access<00:04:22.910> those<00:04:23.390> paddles

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
access those paddles

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.230 
access those paddles
well<00:04:24.440> access<00:04:24.920> the<00:04:25.040> right<00:04:25.130> away<00:04:25.310> like<00:04:25.460> that<00:04:25.490> yes

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
well access the right away like that yes

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.910 
well access the right away like that yes
but<00:04:26.480> you<00:04:26.600> also<00:04:26.630> can<00:04:27.110> you<00:04:27.320> can<00:04:27.530> engage<00:04:27.860> in

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
but you also can you can engage in

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.770 
but you also can you can engage in
two-man<00:04:28.460> Matic

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
two-man Matic

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.100 
two-man Matic
and<00:04:29.960> then<00:04:30.080> it'll<00:04:30.260> probably<00:04:30.530> holding<00:04:30.950> here

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
and then it'll probably holding here

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.150 
and then it'll probably holding here
sometimes<00:04:33.110> if<00:04:33.260> you<00:04:33.350> just<00:04:33.500> did<00:04:33.680> Drive<00:04:33.920> and<00:04:34.100> you

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
sometimes if you just did Drive and you

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.790 
sometimes if you just did Drive and you
do<00:04:34.310> that<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:34.640> will<00:04:34.760> often<00:04:35.000> hold

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.410 

back<00:04:38.099> to<00:04:38.780> second<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:39.900> my<00:04:40.229> guess

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
back to second so my guess

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.060 
back to second so my guess
right<00:04:41.930> let's<00:04:42.140> see<00:04:42.290> what<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.500> performance<00:04:42.650> is

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
right let's see what the performance is

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.000 
right let's see what the performance is
like<00:04:43.250> from<00:04:43.520> this

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
like from this

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:56.420 
like from this
quasi<00:04:45.880> I'll<00:04:46.510> shift

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.920 

okay<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.000> know<00:04:57.150> what<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.449> system<00:04:57.810> is

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
okay you know what the system is

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.320 
okay you know what the system is
actually<00:04:58.110> faster<00:04:58.830> than<00:04:59.009> Wanda's<00:04:59.430> system<00:05:00.210> our

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
actually faster than Wanda's system our

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.379 
actually faster than Wanda's system our
report

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389

did<00:05:02.599> you<00:05:02.689> notice<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:03.020> seven-speed<00:05:03.530> on<00:05:03.680> your<00:05:03.800> -

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
did you notice a seven-speed on your -

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.830 
did you notice a seven-speed on your -
yes<00:05:04.789> I<00:05:04.939> said<00:05:05.000> that's<00:05:05.930> kind<00:05:06.199> of<00:05:06.379> for<00:05:07.159> me<00:05:07.219> that's

yes I said that's kind of for me that's

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.350 
yes I said that's kind of for me that's
state<00:05:08.840> kids<00:05:09.110> but<00:05:09.460> standard<00:05:10.460> but<00:05:10.639> also<00:05:10.759> the<00:05:11.030> CET

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
state kids but standard but also the CET

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.510 
state kids but standard but also the CET
it's<00:05:11.659> just<00:05:11.900> a<00:05:12.050> slot<00:05:12.379> and<00:05:12.740> that<00:05:12.919> continue<00:05:13.370> herbs

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
it's just a slot and that continue herbs

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.260 
it's just a slot and that continue herbs
that's<00:05:13.699> not<00:05:13.849> a<00:05:13.879> big<00:05:14.060> deal

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
that's not a big deal

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.089 
that's not a big deal
it's<00:05:14.960> nice<00:05:15.139> having<00:05:15.319> that<00:05:15.500> seventh<00:05:15.889> here<00:05:16.039> I

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
it's nice having that seventh here I

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.580 
it's nice having that seventh here I
guess

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
guess

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.750 
guess
five<00:05:17.950> uses<00:05:18.160> of<00:05:18.430> you

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.450 

is<00:05:20.790> very<00:05:21.120> nice<00:05:21.330> expensive

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
is very nice expensive

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:33.570 
is very nice expensive
and<00:05:23.550> I<00:05:23.669> know<00:05:23.880> something<00:05:24.180> more<00:05:24.509> about

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.880 

so<00:05:34.030> you<00:05:34.120> know<00:05:34.240> what<00:05:34.420> in<00:05:34.630> the<00:05:34.750> Accord<00:05:35.110> I<00:05:35.320> my

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
so you know what in the Accord I my

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.690 
so you know what in the Accord I my
recommendation<00:05:36.580> was<00:05:36.700> not<00:05:36.730> to<00:05:37.240> buy

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
recommendation was not to buy

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.900 
recommendation was not to buy

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.300 

in<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:46.860> case<00:05:47.070> I'd<00:05:47.310> recommend<00:05:47.730> either

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
in that case I'd recommend either

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.680 
in that case I'd recommend either
six<00:05:50.120> feet<00:05:50.650> in<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.800> turret

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
six feet in the turret

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.750 
six feet in the turret
v6<00:05:53.530> or<00:05:54.370> in<00:05:54.760> standard<00:05:55.120> CVT<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.940> record

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
v6 or in standard CVT to record

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.700 
v6 or in standard CVT to record
in<00:05:59.910> the<00:06:00.030> guerrilla<00:06:00.360> however<00:06:00.750> if<00:06:01.080> you<00:06:01.290> really

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
in the guerrilla however if you really

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.490 
in the guerrilla however if you really
do<00:06:01.890> want<00:06:01.920> that<00:06:02.310> paddle<00:06:02.580> shift<00:06:03.000> if<00:06:03.330> I<00:06:03.450> say<00:06:03.690> it's

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
do want that paddle shift if I say it's

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.670 
do want that paddle shift if I say it's
worthwhile<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:06.030> is<00:06:06.240> it's

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
worthwhile it is it's

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.850 
worthwhile it is it's
I<00:06:08.710> guess<00:06:09.220> quite<00:06:09.400> there's<00:06:09.970> a<00:06:10.030> pop<00:06:10.330> like<00:06:10.630> but<00:06:10.810> I

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
I guess quite there's a pop like but I

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.080 
I guess quite there's a pop like but I
go<00:06:11.860> back<00:06:12.010> to<00:06:12.190> sixth<00:06:12.460> gear<00:06:12.580> here<00:06:12.820> and<00:06:13.000> I'll

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
go back to sixth gear here and I'll

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.410 
go back to sixth gear here and I'll
downshift<00:06:13.510> to<00:06:13.570> the<00:06:13.720> path

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
downshift to the path

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.700 
downshift to the path
you<00:06:14.990> can<00:06:15.140> feel<00:06:15.700> the<00:06:16.700> change<00:06:17.110> and<00:06:18.110> again<00:06:18.500> they

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
you can feel the change and again they

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.820 
you can feel the change and again they
do<00:06:18.770> not

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
do not

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.380 
do not
could<00:06:20.010> have<00:06:20.100> made<00:06:20.250> a<00:06:20.280> smoother<00:06:20.880> but<00:06:21.180> they've

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
could have made a smoother but they've

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:28.760 
could have made a smoother but they've
added<00:06:21.810> just<00:06:22.020> a<00:06:22.110> little<00:06:22.410> bit<00:06:22.560> of<00:06:22.650> a<00:06:22.740> jolt<00:06:23.010> there

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.320 

seven<00:06:29.460> screen<00:06:29.699> trips

this case and how they design their

this case and how they design their

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.300 

it's<00:06:44.560> like<00:06:44.710> Honda's<00:06:45.159> version

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 
it's like Honda's version
