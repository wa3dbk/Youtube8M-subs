 that is, the same model is produced 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.450

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.159
 colors black and red let's go to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.380
 review of the appearance of the clock will start 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.150
 pebbles it is plastic with metal 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.520

 the back of the body is sand too 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.920
 plastic she is removable and under it 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.750
 there is a very interesting thing 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.610
 under the batteries you will find something that you donâ€™t 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.860

 if it can be done even without the main 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.359
 smartphone just put them sim cards 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:18.230

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.950
 miter is on the right side 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.599
 one single button fell out 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.849
 more it rotates but it's just a tribute 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.769
 fashion does not carry any functionality if 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.530

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.330
