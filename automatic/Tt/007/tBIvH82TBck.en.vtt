00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
currently at 61 degrees so we're talking

below<00:00:46.620> average<00:00:46.739> temperatures<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.640> check

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
below average temperatures and check

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.540 
below average temperatures and check
this<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.350> 67<00:00:49.350> degrees<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.860> was<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> high

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
this out 67 degrees that was the high

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.639 
this out 67 degrees that was the high
today<00:00:51.020> that<00:00:52.020> was<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> high<00:00:52.260> today<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.530> downtown

today that was a high today in downtown

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.360 
today that was a high today in downtown
average<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.850> 78<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.289> were<00:00:55.440> far<00:00:55.829> below

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
average is 78 so we were far below

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.209 
average is 78 so we were far below
average<00:00:56.699> record<00:00:57.539> temperatures<00:00:57.960> 99<00:00:58.800> degrees

so certainly didn't get anywhere close

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.869 
so certainly didn't get anywhere close
to<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.530> getting<00:01:01.800> anywhere<00:01:02.070> close<00:01:02.129> over

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to that not getting anywhere close over

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.250 
to that not getting anywhere close over
the<00:01:02.969> next<00:01:03.149> 24<00:01:03.600> hours<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.989> your<00:01:04.110> weather

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790

wash your cars
we're<00:01:36.180> looking<00:01:36.630> at<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.900> marine<00:01:37.200> layer

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
we're looking at that marine layer

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.109 
we're looking at that marine layer
really<00:01:37.860> starting<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.340> thicken<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.939> with

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
really starting to thicken up and with

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.580 
really starting to thicken up and with
that<00:01:39.299> drizzle<00:01:39.659> isn't<00:01:40.049> out<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> question

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that drizzle isn't out of the question

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.469 
that drizzle isn't out of the question
but<00:01:41.280> at<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.549> point<00:01:41.790> again<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.270> looks<00:01:42.360> like

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
but at this point again it looks like

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.999 
but at this point again it looks like
this<00:01:42.600> pattern<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:43.619> gonna<00:01:43.740> stick

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this pattern is really gonna stick

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.289 
this pattern is really gonna stick
around<00:01:44.040> for<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.700> while

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
around for a little while

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
around for a little while
lax<00:01:45.899> right<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> airport<00:01:46.770> right<00:01:46.890> at<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
lax right at the airport right at the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.620 
lax right at the airport right at the
coast<00:01:47.340> we're<00:01:47.640> already<00:01:47.880> dealing<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.329> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
coast we're already dealing with that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.139 
coast we're already dealing with that
fog<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.979> making<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.909> comeback

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
fog and it's really making a comeback

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.600 
fog and it's really making a comeback
and<00:01:51.329> staying<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.500> us<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> while<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.189> fact

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and staying with us for a while in fact

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.030 
and staying with us for a while in fact
looks<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.659> coast<00:01:54.899> could<00:01:55.170> stay<00:01:55.500> soft<00:01:55.829> in

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
looks like the coast could stay soft in

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.649 
looks like the coast could stay soft in
for<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.340> next<00:01:56.430> couple<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.880> days<00:01:57.060> maybe

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
for the next couple of days maybe

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.300 
for the next couple of days maybe
getting<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.079> little<00:01:58.110> more<00:01:58.439> sunshine<00:01:58.710> into<00:01:59.219> our

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
getting a little more sunshine into our

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
getting a little more sunshine into our
inland<00:01:59.790> spots<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.509> still<00:02:00.780> calling<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> partly

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
inland spots but still calling it partly

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.740 
inland spots but still calling it partly
cloudy<00:02:01.770> inland<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:03.240> warmer<00:02:03.600> by<00:02:03.719> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
cloudy inland a little warmer by the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
inland spots the coast pretty much

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.869 
inland spots the coast pretty much

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
nineties triple digits to the east of us

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.069 
nineties triple digits to the east of us
but<00:04:02.609> here<00:04:02.879> at<00:04:03.030> home<00:04:03.239> we're<00:04:03.569> barely<00:04:03.959> even

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
but here at home we're barely even

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.530 
but here at home we're barely even
making<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.680> 70<00:04:05.519> degrees<00:04:05.879> in<00:04:05.909> fact<00:04:06.299> today

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
making it to 70 degrees in fact today

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.780 
making it to 70 degrees in fact today
spots<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.049> downtown<00:04:07.560> only<00:04:08.220> made<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.519> up<00:04:08.609> to

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
spots like downtown only made it up to

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.920 
spots like downtown only made it up to
67<00:04:09.659> degrees<00:04:09.959> where<00:04:10.319> average<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.979> about<00:04:11.940> 78<00:04:12.449> so

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
67 degrees where average is about 78 so

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.289 
67 degrees where average is about 78 so
we<00:04:13.169> were<00:04:13.319> well<00:04:13.650> below<00:04:14.099> that<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.729> you'll<00:04:15.120> see

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
we were well below that and you'll see

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.569 
we were well below that and you'll see
why<00:04:15.449> right<00:04:15.750> here<00:04:15.780> plenty<00:04:16.289> of<00:04:16.620> fog<00:04:17.099> keeping

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
why right here plenty of fog keeping

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.000 
why right here plenty of fog keeping
things<00:04:17.820> nice<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.389> cool<00:04:18.659> you'll<00:04:19.320> see<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.769> fog

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
things nice and cool you'll see that fog

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.890
