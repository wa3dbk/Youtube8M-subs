mains power cable on this VAX 6131 now
you<00:00:16.870> may<00:00:17.110> have<00:00:17.230> damaged<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.710> cable<00:00:18.039> if<00:00:18.130> you've

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.280 
you may have damaged the cable if you've

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.520 
you may have damaged the cable if you've
yanked<00:00:18.700> it<00:00:18.820> too<00:00:19.030> hard<00:00:19.330> or<00:00:19.660> if<00:00:20.050> you<00:00:20.170> wrap<00:00:20.320> it

around the machine to store it over time

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.200 
around the machine to store it over time
this<00:00:22.630> can<00:00:22.690> also<00:00:22.990> damage<00:00:23.260> the<00:00:23.560> cable<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.970> can

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
this can also damage the cable you can

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.570 
this can also damage the cable you can
use<00:00:25.450> any<00:00:25.720> flex<00:00:26.080> but<00:00:26.650> we<00:00:26.770> do<00:00:26.920> recommend<00:00:27.310> that

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580

you<00:00:27.700> use<00:00:27.850> the<00:00:28.030> genuine<00:00:28.510> VAX<00:00:28.750> replacement<00:00:29.790> now

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
you use the genuine VAX replacement now

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.609 
you use the genuine VAX replacement now
safety<00:00:31.090> first<00:00:31.240> always<00:00:31.690> make<00:00:32.110> sure<00:00:32.469> your

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
to remove this cover which is held in

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.520 
to remove this cover which is held in
place<00:00:50.319> by<00:00:50.530> one<00:00:50.859> screw<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.960> with<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.260> cover

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
place by one screw now with the cover

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.590 
place by one screw now with the cover
off<00:00:56.829> you<00:00:57.370> can<00:00:57.519> see<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:57.819> the<00:00:57.909> cables<00:00:58.089> held<00:00:58.479> in

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
off you can see that the cables held in

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.079 
off you can see that the cables held in
place<00:00:58.719> by<00:00:58.839> this<00:00:59.050> cable<00:00:59.589> guard<00:00:59.800> which<00:01:00.699> is<00:01:00.729> held

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
place by this cable guard which is held

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.899 
place by this cable guard which is held
in<00:01:01.239> place<00:01:01.329> by<00:01:01.449> two<00:01:01.659> screws<00:01:02.159> so<00:01:03.159> I'm<00:01:03.429> just<00:01:03.670> going

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
in place by two screws so I'm just going

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.390 
in place by two screws so I'm just going
to<00:01:03.969> remove<00:01:04.300> them<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.290> cable<00:01:08.650> guard<00:01:08.890> just

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
to remove them so the cable guard just

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.219 
to remove them so the cable guard just
pulls<00:01:09.700> out<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:10.590> up<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.890> comes<00:01:12.759> away<00:01:12.939> and<00:01:13.360> all

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
pulls out and up and comes away and all

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.709 
pulls out and up and comes away and all
that<00:01:14.409> remains<00:01:14.740> is<00:01:15.009> to<00:01:15.369> undo<00:01:15.939> these<00:01:16.180> two<00:01:16.240> wires

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
that remains is to undo these two wires

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.380 
that remains is to undo these two wires
from<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.500> terminal<00:01:18.040> block<00:01:18.189> now<00:01:19.030> it's<00:01:19.210> very

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
from the terminal block now it's very

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.109 
from the terminal block now it's very
simple<00:01:19.780> wiring<00:01:20.290> but<00:01:20.740> here<00:01:20.979> at<00:01:21.070> espares<00:01:21.610> we

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
simple wiring but here at espares we

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.580 
simple wiring but here at espares we
have<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.299> rule<00:01:22.570> where<00:01:22.780> we<00:01:22.899> take<00:01:23.079> a<00:01:23.110> picture<00:01:23.409> of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
have a rule where we take a picture of

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.310 
have a rule where we take a picture of
any<00:01:23.979> wiring<00:01:24.310> so<00:01:25.149> that<00:01:25.240> we<00:01:25.329> can<00:01:25.509> always<00:01:25.960> rewire

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
any wiring so that we can always rewire

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.630 
any wiring so that we can always rewire
it<00:01:26.500> exactly<00:01:27.039> as<00:01:27.159> we<00:01:27.310> find<00:01:27.549> it

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.020 

right<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:34.930> now<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.890> just<00:01:36.250> need<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.670> remove<00:01:36.880> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
right so now I just need to remove the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
right so now I just need to remove the
cable<00:01:37.240> collar<00:01:37.630> from<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:38.050> old<00:01:38.260> cable<00:01:38.620> and<00:01:40.050> put

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
cable collar from the old cable and put

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.850 
cable collar from the old cable and put
it<00:01:41.170> onto<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.650> new<00:01:41.860> cable<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.320> just

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
it onto the new cable and then I just

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.340 
it onto the new cable and then I just
need<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.250> rewire<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.570> put<00:01:47.140> everything

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
need to rewire it and put everything

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:57.210 
need to rewire it and put everything
back<00:01:47.590> together<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:56.740> we<00:01:56.860> go

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
back together there we go

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.070 
back together there we go
that's<00:01:57.759> just<00:01:58.060> how<00:01:58.240> easy<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.869> replace

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
that's just how easy it is to replace

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.050 
that's just how easy it is to replace
