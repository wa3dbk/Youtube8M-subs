00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.750
 Today we test the speed sl of the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.630
 of course, due to its light weight 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.700
 he is stopped by players 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.780
 like marco reus I wish you much 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.780
 fun while testing 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
 11 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.469
 there drives 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.230
 God 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700
 cham 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
 at 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.490
 6 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.100
 at the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.620
 Let's come to my conclusion 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.830
 personal concluding conclusion to the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.110
 I really like the design, for example 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.760
 very good and the first thing one 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.100
 Of course you notice when you are in the shoe 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.110
 bad is how easy he really is 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.060
 Of course this is reflected in the comfort 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.630
 again because you really feel very much 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.210
 well 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.610
 the upper is really very much 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.530
 skinny what a barefoot course 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.170
 to convey similar ball feeling 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.570
 I felt the upper material but as 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.970
 something stiff is not so important 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.160
 my foot adjusted so i here 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.740
 awarded three out of five points 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.600
 the faction stayed with the eebus like 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.750
 I train with all the other cougars 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.240
 until now was allowed to come perfectly 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.830
 Now we reach the critical point of the asb dsl 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.960
 namely for durability 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.730
 Of course, here you can see that I have one 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.340
 Awarded 55 points 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.500
 because after the first hours at 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.570
 my test is at the side 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.850
 Torn up as you could see here 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.750
 Of course you want to do that with a shoe 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.070
 do not expect this price range 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.810
 of course you have to say that I do 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.000
 really straining the shoe 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.740
 However , I only have them racing 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.590
 tested and not like others on 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.700
 kunstrasen 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.530
 Finally one can say that with the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.510
 show a mostly positive 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.400
 left an impression 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.360
 the basic idea behind this shoe 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.250
 like 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.340
 to develop very light shoes 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.950
 therefore not final 7 of 10 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.480
 distribute points 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.230
 I thank you as always for you 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.640
 watch 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.410
 I hope see you next time 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.410
 video skin pure people
