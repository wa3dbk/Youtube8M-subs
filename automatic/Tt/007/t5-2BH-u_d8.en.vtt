rating but I've checked the comments and
all<00:00:33.270> these<00:00:33.360> people<00:00:33.600> were<00:00:33.809> saying<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.380> 82

all these people were saying it like 82

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.889 
all these people were saying it like 82
is<00:00:34.920> an<00:00:35.040> understatement<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.969> got<00:00:36.149> him<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.360> 85

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
is an understatement and I got him to 85

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.990 
is an understatement and I got him to 85
and<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.440> my<00:00:37.590> third<00:00:37.890> season<00:00:38.340> or<00:00:38.430> whatever<00:00:38.640> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
and like my third season or whatever and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.479 
and like my third season or whatever and
so<00:00:39.780> that's<00:00:40.050> why<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.500> did<00:00:40.829> put<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.129> card<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
so that's why I did put the card a

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.680 
so that's why I did put the card a
little<00:00:41.730> bit<00:00:41.820> higher<00:00:42.000> than<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.329> foot<00:00:42.540> had

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
little bit higher than what foot had

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
little bit higher than what foot had
predicts<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.129> does<00:00:44.280> actually<00:00:44.460> say

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
predicts because it does actually say

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.850 
predicts because it does actually say
that<00:00:45.030> them<00:00:45.539> their<00:00:46.200> predictions<00:00:46.649> aren't

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
that them their predictions aren't

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.000 
that them their predictions aren't
always<00:00:47.129> correct<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.629> his<00:00:48.960> regular<00:00:49.410> stats<00:00:49.710> have

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

a lot of premier league side to actually
heard<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.259> him<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.920> what<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.129> haven't<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
heard of him but what I haven't so I

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.540 
heard of him but what I haven't so I
haven't<00:02:09.989> checked<00:02:10.200> out<00:02:10.440> how<00:02:10.920> much<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.250> goes<00:02:11.370> for

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
haven't checked out how much it goes for

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.470 
haven't checked out how much it goes for
on<00:02:11.640> his<00:02:11.730> first<00:02:12.000> season<00:02:12.239> are<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:12.900> curry

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
on his first season are on curry

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.479 
on his first season are on curry
but<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:13.900> they<00:02:13.989> had<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.379> guess<00:02:14.530> I'd<00:02:14.769> say<00:02:14.800> he'd<00:02:15.310> be

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
but if they had to guess I'd say he'd be

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.789 
but if they had to guess I'd say he'd be
around<00:02:15.700> about<00:02:15.940> one<00:02:16.300> or<00:02:16.450> two<00:02:16.480> million<00:02:17.230> mainly

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
around about one or two million mainly

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.649 
around about one or two million mainly
because<00:02:17.980> he<00:02:18.310> have<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:18.670> much<00:02:18.819> potential<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.540> he

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
because he have so much potential and he

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.780 
because he have so much potential and he
would<00:02:19.870> actually<00:02:20.170> sort<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.830> fit<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.310> style<00:02:21.549> at

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
would actually sort of fit the style at

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.000 
would actually sort of fit the style at
psv<00:02:22.299> playing<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.720> very<00:02:22.900> attacking<00:02:23.349> very<00:02:23.709> fast

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
psv playing a very attacking very fast

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.640 
psv playing a very attacking very fast
counter-attacks<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.940> he's<00:02:25.090> also<00:02:25.299> Dutch<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.349> I

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
counter-attacks and he's also Dutch so I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.559 
counter-attacks and he's also Dutch so I
do<00:02:26.950> think<00:02:27.640> they<00:02:27.819> would<00:02:27.940> like<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.180> keep<00:02:28.360> him

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
do think they would like to keep him

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.789 
do think they would like to keep him
just<00:02:28.780> because<00:02:28.930> he's<00:02:29.230> good<00:02:29.500> squad

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
just because he's good squad

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.350 
just because he's good squad
integrations<00:02:30.430> nice<00:02:30.610> touch<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.060> obviously

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
integrations nice touch and obviously

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.780 
integrations nice touch and obviously
PSV<00:02:31.750> or<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.900> Dutch<00:02:32.140> side<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.799> do<00:02:32.860> think<00:02:33.549> that

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
PSV or a Dutch side and I do think that

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.979 
PSV or a Dutch side and I do think that
they'll<00:02:34.090> wait<00:02:34.299> for<00:02:34.330> him<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.540> get<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.720> little<00:02:34.900> bit

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
they'll wait for him to get a little bit

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.020 
they'll wait for him to get a little bit
older<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.799> you<00:02:35.950> know<00:02:36.040> develop<00:02:36.549> him<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.760> lot

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
older and you know develop him a lot

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.000 
older and you know develop him a lot
more<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:37.780> he<00:02:37.870> gets<00:02:38.080> better<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:38.530> they<00:02:38.709> could<00:02:38.860> put

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
more so he gets better so they could put

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.490 
more so he gets better so they could put
a<00:02:39.069> bigger<00:02:39.400> price<00:02:39.760> tag<00:02:40.000> on<00:02:40.120> him<00:02:40.269> so<00:02:40.720> I<00:02:40.750> reckon<00:02:41.349> in

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
a bigger price tag on him so I reckon in

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.559 
a bigger price tag on him so I reckon in
this<00:02:42.099> first<00:02:42.310> seasonal<00:02:42.760> go<00:02:42.909> for<00:02:43.090> about<00:02:43.150> 1<00:02:43.450> or<00:02:43.480> 2

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
this first seasonal go for about 1 or 2

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.509 
this first seasonal go for about 1 or 2
mil<00:02:43.959> not<00:02:44.200> too<00:02:44.379> sure<00:02:44.620> but<00:02:44.890> in<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.099> second

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
mil not too sure but in the second

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.830 
mil not too sure but in the second
season<00:02:45.579> will<00:02:45.819> be<00:02:45.910> going<00:02:46.060> for<00:02:46.180> about<00:02:46.239> 10<00:02:46.599> mil

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
season will be going for about 10 mil

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.869 
season will be going for about 10 mil
then<00:02:47.260> its<00:02:47.470> third<00:02:47.709> season<00:02:47.890> will<00:02:48.129> be<00:02:48.220> 20<00:02:48.700> mil
