you<00:02:34.709> how<00:02:34.950> deep<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.459> goes<00:02:38.150> no<00:02:39.200> species<00:02:40.200> in

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
you how deep it goes no species in

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.140 
you how deep it goes no species in
nature<00:02:42.859> combines<00:02:43.859> food<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.549> way<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:44.909> do

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
nature combines food the way we do

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.069 
nature combines food the way we do
because<00:02:45.689> if<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.989> did<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:47.159> would<00:02:47.340> die<00:02:47.579> in<00:02:48.079> half

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
because if it did it would die in half

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:55.039 
because if it did it would die in half
its<00:02:49.349> lifespan<00:02:51.859> not<00:02:52.859> only<00:02:53.189> that<00:02:53.400> no<00:02:54.239> species<00:02:54.870> in

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
its lifespan not only that no species in

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:00.190 
its lifespan not only that no species in
nature<00:02:55.200> eats<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.069> drinks<00:02:56.099> at<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.000> same<00:02:57.269> time

weaken the hydrochloric acid in your

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.710 
weaken the hydrochloric acid in your
stomach<00:03:19.709> which<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.489> needed<00:03:20.729> for<00:03:20.970> powerful
