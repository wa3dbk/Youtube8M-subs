00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
I think Richard Pryor was he was kind of

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.429 
I think Richard Pryor was he was kind of
like<00:01:42.869> oh<00:01:44.540> he<00:01:45.540> was<00:01:45.750> definitely<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.710> bridge<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
like oh he was definitely the bridge and

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.539 
like oh he was definitely the bridge and
the<00:01:49.439> liaison<00:01:50.600> culturally<00:01:51.799> for<00:01:52.799> black<00:01:53.070> people

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
he was ahead of his time and great and a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.680 
he was ahead of his time and great and a
great<00:02:43.170> comic<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:43.770> Richard<00:02:44.130> Pryor<00:02:44.510> knew<00:02:45.510> what

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
great comic but Richard Pryor knew what

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.350 
great comic but Richard Pryor knew what
racism<00:02:46.140> was<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.950> knew<00:02:47.400> what<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.700> was<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> come

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.170 
racism was and knew what it was to come
to<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.860> think<00:02:50.160> that's<00:02:50.550> what<00:02:50.790> made<00:02:50.970> him

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
to it and I think that's what made him

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.050 
to it and I think that's what made him
very<00:02:51.360> very<00:02:51.660> unique<00:02:52.140> because<00:02:52.530> he<00:02:52.770> was<00:02:53.060> supposed

very very unique because he was supposed

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.760 
very very unique because he was supposed
