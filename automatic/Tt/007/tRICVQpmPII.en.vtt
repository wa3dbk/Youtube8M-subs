00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
did think that between the trip to LA

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.120 
did think that between the trip to LA
and<00:03:21.670> our<00:03:22.240> New<00:03:22.450> Year's<00:03:22.750> party<00:03:23.050> and<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.830> few<00:03:24.010> other

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
and our New Year's party and a few other

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.410 
and our New Year's party and a few other
things<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.520> this<00:03:24.730> month<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.090> gonna<00:03:25.210> be<00:03:25.390> a

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
things that this month is gonna be a

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.300 
things that this month is gonna be a
really<00:03:25.720> slow<00:03:26.140> month<00:03:26.380> for<00:03:26.590> weight<00:03:26.710> loss<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.160> it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
really slow month for weight loss and it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.040 
really slow month for weight loss and it
certainly<00:03:27.880> wasn't<00:03:28.150> as<00:03:28.360> fast<00:03:28.570> as<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.840> sort<00:03:28.960> of

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.400 
think you could really see it in my face
I<00:03:57.010> really<00:03:57.820> think<00:03:58.060> for<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.390> first<00:03:58.600> time<00:03:58.840> I'm

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
I really think for the first time I'm

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.780 
I really think for the first time I'm
starting<00:03:59.710> to<00:03:59.920> notice<00:04:00.130> it<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.430> it's

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
starting to notice it and it's

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.210 
starting to notice it and it's
surprising<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.660> me<00:04:01.810> it's<00:04:02.290> very<00:04:02.590> surprising<00:04:02.830> to

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
surprising to me it's very surprising to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.650 
surprising to me it's very surprising to
me<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.940> I'm<00:04:04.060> very<00:04:04.210> very<00:04:04.450> happy<00:04:04.660> about<00:04:04.930> it

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
me and I'm very very happy about it

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.030 
me and I'm very very happy about it
other<00:04:07.660> than<00:04:07.750> that<00:04:08.080> there's<00:04:08.410> not<00:04:08.590> much<00:04:08.830> going

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040
