everything else below now we have this

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.900 
everything else below now we have this
way<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.210> looks<00:00:09.450> like<00:00:09.950> this<00:00:10.950> was<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.429> normally

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
way it looks like this was it normally

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.580 
way it looks like this was it normally
would<00:00:12.090> look<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:13.080> need<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.320> turn<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
would look like you need to turn the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.359 
would look like you need to turn the
water<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.370> come<00:00:14.639> out<00:00:14.670> here<00:00:15.150> but<00:00:16.190> right<00:00:17.190> in

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
water on it come out here but right in

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.650 
water on it come out here but right in
here<00:00:18.050> little<00:00:19.050> device<00:00:19.410> we<00:00:20.310> had<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> leak<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.970> so

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
here little device we had a leak and so

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.920 
here little device we had a leak and so
I<00:00:22.160> spent<00:00:23.160> some<00:00:23.189> time<00:00:23.490> working<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.210> try<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
I spent some time working on it try to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.009 
I spent some time working on it try to
take<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.350> off<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:26.880> see<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.750> didn't

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
take it off but as you can see it didn't

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.900 
take it off but as you can see it didn't
work<00:00:28.140> too<00:00:28.289> well<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.400> do<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.730> we're

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
work too well so we have to do is we're

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.910 
work too well so we have to do is we're
gonna<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.359> go<00:00:30.449> into<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.019> wall<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
gonna have to go into the wall here and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.120 
gonna have to go into the wall here and
so<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.460> thought<00:00:32.669> well<00:00:32.960> one<00:00:33.960> option<00:00:34.440> would<00:00:34.559> be<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
so I thought well one option would be to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.560 
so I thought well one option would be to
do<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.940> take<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:37.309> hole<00:00:38.309> saw<00:00:38.579> cut<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:40.250> like<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
do is take a hole saw cut it like that

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.319 
do is take a hole saw cut it like that
make<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> big<00:00:42.870> cut<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.770> problem<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
make a big cut with problem is I have to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.350 
make a big cut with problem is I have to
put<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.039> little<00:00:47.280> hole<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.969> so

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
put this in that little hole and so

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
put this in that little hole and so
there's<00:00:48.930> no<00:00:49.110> room<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.680> my<00:00:49.860> hand<00:00:50.160> or<00:00:50.340> anything

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
there's no room for my hand or anything

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.680 
there's no room for my hand or anything
so<00:00:51.680> what<00:00:52.680> we're<00:00:52.800> gonna<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:54.390> we're

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
so what we're gonna do is I think we're

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.250 
so what we're gonna do is I think we're
going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.760> look<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:56.910> some<00:00:57.030> other<00:00:57.180> options<00:00:57.260> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
going to look at some other options and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.389 
going to look at some other options and
go<00:00:58.559> from<00:00:58.739> there<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.719> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.109> what's<00:01:01.949> going

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
go from there but this is what's going

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.310 
go from there but this is what's going
to<00:01:02.489> replace<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.799> lot<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.880> work<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.780> special

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.100 
got the water turned off this is what's
inside<00:01:29.820> here<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.430> when<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.520> turn<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.110> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
inside here and when you turn it it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.969 
inside here and when you turn it it
turns<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.970> valve<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.630> off<00:01:36.750> inside<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
turns to valve on and off inside and

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.160 
turns to valve on and off inside and
this<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.250> actually<00:01:38.640> 12<00:01:38.909> inches<00:01:39.329> inside<00:01:39.869> so

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
this is actually 12 inches inside so

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.590 
this is actually 12 inches inside so
because<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.860> does<00:01:41.040> freeze<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.390> now

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
because we it does freeze here so now

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.840 
because we it does freeze here so now
we're<00:01:43.500> gonna<00:01:43.619> find<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.220> way<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:46.649> access<00:01:46.979> that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
we're gonna find a way to access that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.940 
we're gonna find a way to access that
point<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.990> know<00:01:49.110> open<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.619> up<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
point so we can you know open it up and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.170 
point so we can you know open it up and
fix<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.670> without<00:01:52.009> hopefully<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.820> trying<00:01:54.090> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
fix it without hopefully not trying to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.649 
fix it without hopefully not trying to
cut<00:01:54.390> right<00:01:54.780> here<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.439> bear<00:01:56.310> with<00:01:56.340> me<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.180> we're

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
cut right here so bear with me and we're

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:04.429 
cut right here so bear with me and we're
gonna<00:01:57.719> get<00:01:57.930> this<00:01:58.020> fixed<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:02.689> here's<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.930> very

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
gonna get this fixed and here's the very

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.449 
gonna get this fixed and here's the very
duct<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.979> goes<00:02:05.130> outside<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:07.459> basically

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
duct that goes outside and so basically

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.900 
duct that goes outside and so basically
where<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.450> valve<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.679> outside<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.670> five

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
where that valve is outside it's five

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.140 
where that valve is outside it's five
inches<00:02:12.180> from<00:02:12.510> here

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
inches from here

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.070 
inches from here
and<00:02:14.080> then<00:02:14.709> it's<00:02:15.180> three<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.299> a<00:02:16.330> quarter<00:02:16.569> inches

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
and then it's three and a quarter inches

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:25.440 
and then it's three and a quarter inches
this<00:02:17.560> way<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:19.980> then<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:23.220> got<00:02:24.220> beef<00:02:24.730> my

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
this way and then it's got beef my

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.949 
this way and then it's got beef my
actually<00:02:26.080> it's<00:02:26.200> less<00:02:26.440> than<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.799> deep<00:02:27.069> across

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
actually it's less than that deep across

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.470 
actually it's less than that deep across
so<00:02:29.430> what<00:02:30.430> I'm<00:02:30.489> gonna<00:02:30.610> do<00:02:30.760> now<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.180> we're<00:02:31.390> gonna

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
so what I'm gonna do now is we're gonna

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.690 
so what I'm gonna do now is we're gonna
go<00:02:31.810> ahead<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.079> mark<00:02:32.379> where<00:02:33.099> we're<00:02:33.250> gonna<00:02:33.400> cut

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
go ahead and mark where we're gonna cut

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.430 
go ahead and mark where we're gonna cut
roughly<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:35.620> going<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.010> be<00:02:36.959> five<00:02:37.959> inches<00:02:38.200> up

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
roughly it's going to be five inches up

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.069 
roughly it's going to be five inches up
reading<00:02:41.440> quarter<00:02:41.829> inches<00:02:42.190> so<00:02:42.909> it's<00:02:43.150> roughly

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
reading quarter inches so it's roughly

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.360 
reading quarter inches so it's roughly
right<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:45.010> here<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:47.530> wall<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:47.799> only<00:02:48.099> two

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
right in here and this wall is only two

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.400 
right in here and this wall is only two
inches<00:02:48.700> deep<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.239> it's<00:02:49.780> an<00:02:49.989> inch<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.379> a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
inches deep so it's an inch and a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.170 
inches deep so it's an inch and a
quarter<00:02:51.359> back<00:02:52.359> pass<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.230> wall<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:54.280> that's

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
quarter back pass this wall so that's

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.520 
quarter back pass this wall so that's
what<00:02:55.329> we're<00:02:55.450> going<00:02:55.569> to<00:02:55.599> be<00:02:55.690> doing<00:02:55.840> I'm<00:02:56.410> going

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
what we're going to be doing I'm going

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.440 
what we're going to be doing I'm going
to<00:02:56.620> spend<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.829> few<00:02:56.980> minutes<00:02:57.099> trying<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.000> measure

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
to spend a few minutes trying to measure

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.229 
to spend a few minutes trying to measure
exactly<00:02:59.140> where<00:02:59.319> I<00:02:59.349> want<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.680> cut<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.129> then<00:03:01.090> now

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239
