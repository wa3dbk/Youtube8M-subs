fertilizer<00:01:59.740> and<00:01:59.920> such<00:02:00.219> so<00:02:00.549> I'm<00:02:01.210> just<00:02:01.420> gonna

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
fertilizer and such so I'm just gonna

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.620 
fertilizer and such so I'm just gonna
give<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.500> nice<00:02:02.710> little<00:02:02.740> wet<00:02:03.250> damp<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
give this a nice little wet damp and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.609 
give this a nice little wet damp and
let's<00:02:07.630> kind<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.869> make<00:02:08.019> sure<00:02:08.229> everything's

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
let's kind of make sure everything's

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.780 
let's kind of make sure everything's
nice<00:02:08.769> and<00:02:09.009> evenly<00:02:09.310> wet<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:12.579> we're<00:02:12.700> going

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
nice and evenly wet so here we're going

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.420 
nice and evenly wet so here we're going
to<00:02:12.880> sew<00:02:13.030> some<00:02:13.329> of<00:02:13.450> our<00:02:13.600> long<00:02:14.380> red<00:02:14.950> cayenne

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
to sew some of our long red cayenne

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.470 
to sew some of our long red cayenne
pepper<00:02:15.730> seeds<00:02:16.829> from<00:02:17.829> 2011<00:02:18.730> lot<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.120> hopefully

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
pepper seeds from 2011 lot so hopefully

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.160 
pepper seeds from 2011 lot so hopefully
these<00:02:19.660> are<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.959> good<00:02:20.519> viable<00:02:21.519> seed<00:02:21.910> block<00:02:22.170> so

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
these are a good viable seed block so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.050 
these are a good viable seed block so
we're<00:02:23.709> gonna<00:02:23.829> this<00:02:24.310> probably<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> good<00:02:24.850> amount

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
we're gonna this probably a good amount

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.050 
we're gonna this probably a good amount
of<00:02:25.299> them<00:02:25.480> probably<00:02:26.260> like<00:02:26.380> about<00:02:26.790> 12<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:28.030> 18

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
of them probably like about 12 to 18

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.030 
of them probably like about 12 to 18
just

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
just

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.580 
just
the<00:02:29.159> expectation<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.469> we're<00:02:31.469> gonna

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the expectation that we're gonna

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.410 
the expectation that we're gonna
eventually<00:02:32.099> replant<00:02:33.000> them<00:02:33.120> into<00:02:33.390> our

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
eventually replant them into our

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.619 
eventually replant them into our
seedling<00:02:33.890> 6-cell<00:02:34.890> tray<00:02:35.159> here<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:35.939> we<00:02:36.390> want<00:02:36.540> to

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
seedling 6-cell tray here so we want to

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.509 
seedling 6-cell tray here so we want to
have<00:02:36.719> like<00:02:36.930> maybe<00:02:37.140> one<00:02:37.500> two<00:02:37.709> three<00:02:38.069> viable

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
have like maybe one two three viable

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.929 
have like maybe one two three viable
seeds<00:02:39.030> transplanted<00:02:39.900> into<00:02:40.109> yourself<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.939> you

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
seeds transplanted into yourself so you

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.640 
seeds transplanted into yourself so you
know<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.209> looks<00:02:42.569> like<00:02:42.810> about<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.469> right

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
know this looks like about the right

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.289 
know this looks like about the right
amount<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.579> I'm<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:44.790> going<00:02:44.909> to<00:02:45.000> fold<00:02:45.150> this

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
amount so I'm just going to fold this

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.619 
amount so I'm just going to fold this
over<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:46.670> easy<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:47.819> that<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.239> just<00:02:48.390> want<00:02:48.569> to

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
over and easy as that we just want to

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.300 
over and easy as that we just want to
keep<00:02:48.750> everything<00:02:49.019> moist<00:02:49.319> on<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.859> sit<00:02:50.069> again

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
keep everything moist on this sit again

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.670 
keep everything moist on this sit again
flip<00:02:50.909> it<00:02:51.060> over

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
flip it over

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.420 
flip it over
miss<00:02:52.680> one<00:02:53.250> more<00:02:53.400> time<00:02:55.400> make<00:02:56.400> sure

everything<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.859> nice<00:03:14.159> and<00:03:14.220> moist<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:14.819> in

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
everything is nice and moist this in

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.220 
everything is nice and moist this in
case<00:03:15.180> there's<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.510> hole<00:03:15.750> somewhere<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.349> bag

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
case there's a hole somewhere in the bag

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.110 
case there's a hole somewhere in the bag
it'll<00:03:19.230> retain<00:03:20.069> its<00:03:20.370> moisture<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.909> course

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
it'll retain its moisture of course

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.119 
it'll retain its moisture of course
during<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.629> sloppy<00:03:21.930> job<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.620> did<00:03:22.919> there's

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
during the sloppy job that I did there's

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.789 
during the sloppy job that I did there's
a<00:03:23.189> seat<00:03:23.459> that's<00:03:23.700> outside<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.780> napkin<00:03:25.500> but

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
a seat that's outside of the napkin but

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.649 
a seat that's outside of the napkin but
that's<00:03:25.950> fine<00:03:26.129> you<00:03:26.400> know<00:03:26.489> what<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.180> idea<00:03:27.569> is

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
that's fine you know what the idea is

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:28.879 
that's fine you know what the idea is
that<00:03:27.780> we're<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:27.989> putting<00:03:28.230> moisture<00:03:28.709> on<00:03:28.799> the

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
that we're just putting moisture on the

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.649 
that we're just putting moisture on the
seeds<00:03:29.099> laying<00:03:29.310> them<00:03:29.459> hydrate<00:03:29.909> and<00:03:30.120> then

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
seeds laying them hydrate and then

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.750 
seeds laying them hydrate and then
germinate<00:03:31.169> in<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.500> bag<00:03:31.709> so<00:03:32.669> let's<00:03:33.209> label<00:03:33.419> this

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
germinate in the bag so let's label this

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:43.610 
germinate in the bag so let's label this
cayenne<00:03:35.760> pepper<00:03:36.680> see<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.889> why<00:03:38.819> II<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.930> make

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
cayenne pepper see a why II and and make

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.640 
cayenne pepper see a why II and and make
sure<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.799> spell<00:03:44.159> that<00:03:44.190> correctly<00:03:44.519> on<00:03:45.060> film

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
sure I spell that correctly on film

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.830 
sure I spell that correctly on film
pepper<00:03:48.889> okay<00:03:50.000> 2011<00:03:51.000> but<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.239> really<00:03:51.569> don't<00:03:51.750> need

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
pepper okay 2011 but I really don't need

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.390 
pepper okay 2011 but I really don't need
to<00:03:51.900> date<00:03:52.169> it<00:03:52.319> because<00:03:52.620> we're<00:03:53.069> gonna<00:03:53.190> check

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
to date it because we're gonna check

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.670 
to date it because we're gonna check
back<00:03:53.459> on<00:03:53.790> these<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.269> one<00:03:54.419> week<00:03:54.659> and<00:03:54.930> hopefully

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
back on these in one week and hopefully

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.960 
back on these in one week and hopefully
that's<00:03:55.859> enough<00:03:56.069> time<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.400> have<00:03:56.790> them

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
that's enough time to have them

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.729 
that's enough time to have them
germinate<00:03:57.389> and<00:03:57.569> then<00:03:58.049> we'll<00:03:58.229> do<00:03:58.409> a<00:03:58.440> follow-up

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
germinate and then we'll do a follow-up

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.059 
germinate and then we'll do a follow-up
video

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069
