00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.259
 very good youtube seeds that other 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.000
 once, chanito gamer with 1 video for 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.580
 our channel and this time I come with a 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.590
 video that is a solution to an old 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.220
 video that I did on how to download 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.660
 java 7 and say he walked away 8 good this 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.329
 video I do it mainly because 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.609
 many people have had problems has not 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.529
 worked the previous video and 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.839
 we found two possible solutions that 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.970
 they may be the right ones for them to 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.729
 serve the minecraft and can play without 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.439
 any good problem without more 

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:34.390
 preambles let's move on with the first 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.460
 which is the most common the most frequent 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.520
 we open in a clear minecraft chat 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.910
 and we put our user here 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.280
 everything would be fine but at the moment 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.699
 it gets complicated the thing is when 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.800
 we give to play at this time or 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.129
 they gave play and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.399
 this happens to them that so bogado or it comes out 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.860
 They left the route and well I've 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.019
 discovered a solution investigating 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.119
 digging around there I discovered a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.490
 very simple solution the truth is that 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:14.510
 It's a bit silly but it's pretty easy 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.210
 here we give to edit profil 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.790
 and here below where it says in java settings 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.160
 advanced set we give you check that this 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.260
 executable check and how will they see 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.190
 exit program files java 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.970
 jrt 8 we click here and only 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:35.060
 we delete the number 8 and we put 7 it 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.800
 we give save profile we go back to 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.650
 edith profit to confirm that there 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.560
 been saved yes and now we give to 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.260
 play and so simple problem 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.660
 solved nothing else that was what I 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.479
 I was referring to telling you that you have to 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.490
 changing the route left very simple and 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.280
 well I'm going to stay here so you can see 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.590
 we talk normal and minecraft 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.890
 nothing happens I will not make cuts for 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.740
 that do not believe that it is edited or anything and 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.549
 good 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.090
 as you will see , the microsoft is appearing 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.090
 We waited a while 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.260
 and we would have our michaels ready 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.700
 to play and to put what we 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.129
 we want for example here right now I already 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.379
 comes out a multiplayer mods player can 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.260
 confirm what I want and I care 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.989
 It's very pretty, it's really cool and good 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.700
 until here would be this first point of 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.870
 this first solution now we would pass 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.870
 with the second solution 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.930
 and good the second solution that has 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.280
 found for this problem too 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.980
 would be the next one first let's panel 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.739
 of control 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.209
 see by category to make it look more 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:55.700
 ordered we go to the system and security 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.560
 here we give the system here in the green 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.810
 and here on the left we would see 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.260
 Advanced configuration of the system 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.580
 we click we would appear this little window 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.090
 that says system properties 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.770
 advanced options let's variables of 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.550
 environment 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.490
 as you will see here I get 33 articles 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:19.550
 with three little things that good is java 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.190
 options would not help us since many 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.560
 people when they have this or move away 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.900
 the lot of java memory this is put 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.360
 Some people will work for bone 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.550
 increase the level of your java so that 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.350
 be much better and go better with your 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.660
 minecraft but for those who have 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.720
 not so powerful computers can that 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.000
 scratch them and that's why that's 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.980
 they left it does not work for them to play 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.670
 minecraft so we only give it 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.410
 click to delete and as you will see 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.210
 it was eliminated only missing give it to 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.610
 accept accept and we could open 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.650
 our minecraft we will be able to play 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.390
 quietly and these are both 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.090
 errors you have found there may be 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.890
 more yes but so far it's 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.500
 as much as possible that they may have had 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.970
 no, and well, I say goodbye, I hope 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.069
 I have helped them, I hope they serve you 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.530
 give me a like if I help you many 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.640
 thanks that supports a lot and good 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.000
 until next time 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.000
 bye Bye
