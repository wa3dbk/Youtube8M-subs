00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the IP so to get started for example we

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.900 
the IP so to get started for example we
use<00:00:20.699> an<00:00:20.880> image<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.840> go<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.020> imager<00:00:22.560> and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
use an image so if you go to imager and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.429 
use an image so if you go to imager and
it's<00:00:23.910> just<00:00:24.119> find<00:00:24.359> any<00:00:24.539> random<00:00:24.810> image<00:00:25.170> like

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
it's just find any random image like

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.800 
it's just find any random image like
this<00:00:26.119> a<00:00:27.410> copy<00:00:28.410> image<00:00:28.800> URL<00:00:29.269> so<00:00:30.269> that's<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.689> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
this a copy image URL so that's going to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.749 
this a copy image URL so that's going to
be<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.140> URL<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.830> we're<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.369> using

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
be the URL that we're going to be using

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.139 
be the URL that we're going to be using
so<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.329> copy<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.750> paste<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:35.070> here<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.000> now<00:00:36.090> we

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
so we copy that paste in here and now we

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.440 
so we copy that paste in here and now we
want<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.480> create<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.079> URL<00:00:38.059> takes<00:00:39.059> us<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
want to create this URL takes us to this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.260 
want to create this URL takes us to this
page<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> URL<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.760> give<00:00:42.000> to

the<00:00:42.660> person<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.410> want<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:44.160> their<00:00:44.340> IP

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the person that we want to get their IP

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.869 
the person that we want to get their IP
for<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.230> click<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.469> takes<00:00:47.460> us<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.760> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
information about the browser so chrome

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.910 
information about the browser so chrome
version<00:01:15.869> three<00:01:16.110> points<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:17.180> 36.0<00:01:18.180> and

any referring URL so maybe if they

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
any referring URL so maybe if they
clicked<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.140> Facebook<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.830> show

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
clicked on it from Facebook or show

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.679 
clicked on it from Facebook or show
Facebook<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.759> neighbors<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.210> say<00:01:24.330> put<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> in

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
Facebook and neighbors and say put it in

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
Facebook and neighbors and say put it in
directly<00:01:25.080> nothing<00:01:25.470> shows<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
directly nothing shows up and then the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.280 
directly nothing shows up and then the
host<00:01:27.180> name<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.270> this<00:01:30.270> doesn't<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.110> be

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
host name so this doesn't have to be

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.770 
host name so this doesn't have to be
used<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:32.009> image<00:01:32.880> or<00:01:33.060> links<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.479> use<00:01:33.659> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
used with image or links you can use it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.039 
used with image or links you can use it
with<00:01:33.900> anything<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.670> go<00:01:36.030> back<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
with anything so if we go back here and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:45.170 
with anything so if we go back here and
put<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:40.280> youtube.com<00:01:41.720> create<00:01:42.720> URL<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.970> go

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
put in youtube.com create URL and go

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.660 
put in youtube.com create URL and go
here<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.689> then<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.530> URL<00:01:47.100> because<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> puts

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
here so then this is URL because it puts

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.800 
here so then this is URL because it puts
in<00:01:47.820> their<00:01:48.180> browser<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:50.180> BAM<00:01:53.299> takes<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.659> are

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
in their browser so BAM takes if you are
