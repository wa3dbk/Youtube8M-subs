seems to place on crafting and
specifically<00:01:39.130> repairing<00:01:39.759> i<00:01:40.060> think<00:01:40.869> it<00:01:40.929> was

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
specifically repairing i think it was

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:42.749 
specifically repairing i think it was
fundamentally<00:01:41.830> crucial<00:01:42.280> for<00:01:42.459> a<00:01:42.489> second

the<00:01:45.220> need<00:01:45.429> to<00:01:45.580> store<00:01:45.849> tools<00:01:46.179> repair<00:01:46.929> materials

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
the need to store tools repair materials

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.770 
the need to store tools repair materials
and<00:01:47.950> just<00:01:48.280> ingredients<00:01:48.910> in<00:01:49.030> general<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.660> was

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
and just ingredients in general it was

00:01:49.780 --> 00:02:00.140 
and just ingredients in general it was
certainly<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.170> welcome<00:01:50.349> addition

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150
