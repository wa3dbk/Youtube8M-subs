00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
finished all you have to do now is the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.760 
finished all you have to do now is the
site<00:00:06.000> which<00:00:06.270> stat<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.870> put<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.140> last<00:00:07.440> load<00:00:07.620> of

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
site which stat to put the last load of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.620 
site which stat to put the last load of
EVs<00:00:08.220> on<00:00:08.370> because<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.880> maximum<00:00:09.300> you<00:00:09.360> can<00:00:09.450> have

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
EVs on because the maximum you can have

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.379 
EVs on because the maximum you can have
is<00:00:09.780> 510<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.120> 252<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.300> 252<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.460> 504<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.210> there's

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
is 510 and 252 I 252 is 504 so there's

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.500 
is 510 and 252 I 252 is 504 so there's
still<00:00:15.480> six<00:00:15.870> left<00:00:17.029> all<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.390> do
