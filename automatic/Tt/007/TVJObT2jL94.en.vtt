00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
quite a lot of permit ease going on

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.190 
quite a lot of permit ease going on
which<00:01:34.970> gives<00:01:35.180> them<00:01:35.300> a<00:01:35.390> lot<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:35.780> built-in

which gives them a lot of built-in
volume<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:36.950> makes<00:01:37.730> them<00:01:38.000> very<00:01:38.330> flattering

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
volume and makes them very flattering

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.290 
volume and makes them very flattering
for<00:01:39.140> a<00:01:39.200> wide<00:01:39.470> range<00:01:39.500> of<00:01:39.950> face<00:01:40.190> shapes<00:01:40.520> I<00:01:40.760> think

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
for a wide range of face shapes I think

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.420 
for a wide range of face shapes I think
that<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.540> is<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.900> very<00:01:42.140> beautiful<00:01:42.290> amount<00:01:43.280> of

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430

volume<00:01:43.820> for<00:01:44.180> someone<00:01:44.600> like<00:01:44.720> me<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:44.990> think<00:01:45.140> it

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
volume for someone like me I think it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.400 
volume for someone like me I think it
looks<00:01:45.860> really<00:01:46.130> nice<00:01:46.640> on<00:01:47.050> but<00:01:48.050> it<00:01:48.140> might<00:01:48.290> be

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
looks really nice on but it might be

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.780 
looks really nice on but it might be
overwhelming<00:01:48.650> for<00:01:49.100> people<00:01:49.130> with<00:01:49.490> smaller

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
overwhelming for people with smaller

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.210 
overwhelming for people with smaller
frames<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:50.690> just<00:01:50.990> just<00:01:51.440> kind<00:01:51.620> of<00:01:51.650> keep<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.040> in

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
frames so just just kind of keep that in

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.360 
frames so just just kind of keep that in
mind<00:01:52.460> as<00:01:52.670> you're<00:01:53.420> on<00:01:53.630> your<00:01:54.200> hunt<00:01:54.470> for<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:54.920> new

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.780 
to me it kind of to think of what would
happen<00:02:00.800> if<00:02:01.160> you<00:02:01.970> had<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.080> may<00:02:03.320> wig<00:02:03.590> as<00:02:03.800> as<00:02:04.460> your

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
happen if you had the may wig as as your

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.780 
happen if you had the may wig as as your
normal<00:02:05.300> hair<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.780> just<00:02:05.870> kind<00:02:06.110> of<00:02:06.170> grew<00:02:06.440> it<00:02:06.620> out

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
normal hair and just kind of grew it out

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.309 
normal hair and just kind of grew it out
because<00:02:07.790> this<00:02:08.209> is<00:02:08.390> substantially<00:02:09.080> longer

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
because this is substantially longer

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.770 
because this is substantially longer
than<00:02:09.679> May<00:02:09.860> but<00:02:10.250> has<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.460> lot<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:10.880> similar

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
than May but has a lot of similar

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.380 
than May but has a lot of similar
layering<00:02:12.110> going<00:02:12.830> on<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.220> has<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.400> shorter

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
layering going on it has the shorter

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.630 
layering going on it has the shorter
front<00:02:14.690> though<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.380> front<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:15.830> Jackson<00:02:16.490> is

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
front though the front on Jackson is

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.230 
front though the front on Jackson is
substantially<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:19.190> layering<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.030> front

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
substantially the layering in the front

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.020 
substantially the layering in the front
of<00:02:20.390> Jackson<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:21.020> substantially<00:02:22.010> longer<00:02:22.670> than

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
of Jackson is substantially longer than

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.080 
of Jackson is substantially longer than
it<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.300> on<00:02:23.569> May<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.860> front<00:02:25.100> is<00:02:25.280> 6.8<00:02:25.790> inches

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
it is on May the front is 6.8 inches

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.670 
it is on May the front is 6.8 inches
which<00:02:26.240> will<00:02:26.390> almost<00:02:26.720> go<00:02:26.840> all<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.110> way<00:02:27.200> down<00:02:27.380> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
which will almost go all the way down to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.920 
which will almost go all the way down to
my<00:02:27.830> jawline<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.880> quite<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.360> lot<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.720> layering

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
my jawline so quite a lot of layering

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.690 
my jawline so quite a lot of layering
going<00:02:30.290> on<00:02:30.410> here<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.770> front<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.459> could

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
going on here in the front you could

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.940 
going on here in the front you could
always<00:02:31.850> have<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:32.090> stylist<00:02:32.690> trim<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.440> for<00:02:33.770> you

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
always have a stylist trim that for you

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.030 
always have a stylist trim that for you
or<00:02:34.220> cut<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.700> bang<00:02:35.060> into<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.630> if<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.870> wanted<00:02:36.170> I

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
or cut a bang into it if you wanted I

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.490 
or cut a bang into it if you wanted I
just<00:02:37.880> like<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.510> kind<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.900> play<00:02:39.050> with<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.319> in

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
just like to kind of play with it in

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.410 
just like to kind of play with it in
front<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.709> my<00:02:39.800> face<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.190> think<00:02:40.250> that's<00:02:40.550> kind<00:02:41.300> of

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
front of my face I think that's kind of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.590 
front of my face I think that's kind of
fun<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.319> let<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.739> sort<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.340> frame<00:02:43.940> my<00:02:44.330> face<00:02:44.570> a

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
fun to let that sort of frame my face a

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.800 
fun to let that sort of frame my face a
little<00:02:44.840> bit<00:02:45.050> better<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.640> think<00:02:46.640> that<00:02:46.880> this<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:47.360> a

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
little bit better I think that this is a

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.670 
little bit better I think that this is a
lot<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.260> hair<00:02:48.940> they<00:02:49.940> give<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.300> quite<00:02:51.140> a<00:02:51.200> bit<00:02:51.470> of

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
lot of hair they give you quite a bit of

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.380 
lot of hair they give you quite a bit of
hair<00:02:51.920> in<00:02:52.100> this<00:02:52.550> wig<00:02:54.010> which<00:02:55.010> again<00:02:55.340> on<00:02:55.670> me<00:02:56.360> I

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
hair in this wig which again on me I

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.000 
hair in this wig which again on me I
think<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.840> looks<00:02:56.989> great<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.620> think<00:02:57.890> on

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
think it looks great but I think on

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.380 
think it looks great but I think on
somebody<00:02:58.340> with<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.489> smaller<00:02:58.760> frame<00:02:59.000> this<00:02:59.209> might

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
somebody with a smaller frame this might

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.530 
somebody with a smaller frame this might
be<00:02:59.569> a<00:02:59.600> bit<00:02:59.810> much<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.880> still<00:03:02.090> technically

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
be a bit much this is still technically

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.509 
be a bit much this is still technically
a<00:03:02.630> mid-length<00:03:03.110> style<00:03:03.680> it's<00:03:03.920> not<00:03:04.100> particularly

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
a mid-length style it's not particularly

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.210 
a mid-length style it's not particularly
long<00:03:05.080> though<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.319> most<00:03:06.620> certainly<00:03:06.860> longer

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
long though it is most certainly longer

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.009 
long though it is most certainly longer
than<00:03:07.459> may<00:03:07.760> in<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.060> number<00:03:08.300> of<00:03:08.330> other<00:03:08.510> noriko

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
than may in a number of other noriko

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.650 
than may in a number of other noriko
wigs<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.580> let<00:03:10.670> me<00:03:10.760> go<00:03:10.880> ahead<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.239> turn<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.569> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
wigs so let me go ahead and turn to the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.110 
wigs so let me go ahead and turn to the
side<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.230> can<00:03:12.260> show<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.680> all<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.819> stuff

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
side so I can show you all the stuff

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.930 
side so I can show you all the stuff
that's<00:03:14.390> going<00:03:14.660> on<00:03:14.780> this<00:03:15.709> is<00:03:15.890> what<00:03:16.100> Jackson

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
that's going on this is what Jackson

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.370 
that's going on this is what Jackson
looks<00:03:17.090> like<00:03:17.269> when<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:19.720> push<00:03:20.720> all<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.170> hair

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
looks like when you push all the hair

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.090 
looks like when you push all the hair
backwards<00:03:21.769> off<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.340> face<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.860> then<00:03:26.380> if<00:03:27.380> you

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
backwards off the face and then if you

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.810 
backwards off the face and then if you
push<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.519> forward<00:03:28.970> onto<00:03:29.180> your<00:03:29.329> shoulders<00:03:30.820> you

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
push it forward onto your shoulders you

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.280 
push it forward onto your shoulders you
can<00:03:31.880> really<00:03:32.269> pick<00:03:32.420> up<00:03:32.540> on<00:03:32.690> that<00:03:32.810> highlight

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
can really pick up on that highlight

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.440 
can really pick up on that highlight
shade<00:03:33.590> by<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.860> way<00:03:34.070> lots<00:03:34.640> of<00:03:35.000> highlights

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
shade by the way lots of highlights

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.410 
shade by the way lots of highlights
going<00:03:35.720> on<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.400> then<00:03:38.180> here<00:03:38.510> is<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.840> back<00:03:40.420> back

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
going on and then here is the back back

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.150 
going on and then here is the back back
is<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.660> little<00:03:41.959> bit<00:03:42.140> longer<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.739> I'll<00:03:42.859> tell<00:03:43.040> you

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
is a little bit longer and I'll tell you

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.550 
is a little bit longer and I'll tell you
the<00:03:43.310> exact<00:03:43.579> measurement<00:03:44.000> when<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.180> turn<00:03:44.359> around

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.130 

moves<00:03:48.560> very<00:03:48.829> nicely<00:03:49.540> it's<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.630> little<00:03:50.959> bit

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
moves very nicely it's a little bit

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.650 
moves very nicely it's a little bit
heavy<00:03:51.380> but<00:03:51.700> it's<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.820> noriko<00:03:53.209> wick<00:03:53.420> they<00:03:53.600> do

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
heavy but it's a noriko wick they do

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.440 
heavy but it's a noriko wick they do
that<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.340> think<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.459> the<00:03:55.579> fibers<00:03:56.030> on<00:03:56.299> these

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
that I think that the fibers on these

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.750 
that I think that the fibers on these
noriko<00:03:56.870> wigs<00:03:57.079> feel<00:03:57.590> very<00:03:58.010> nice<00:03:58.220> they<00:03:58.549> feel

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
noriko wigs feel very nice they feel

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.000 
noriko wigs feel very nice they feel
very<00:03:58.940> silky<00:03:59.359> but<00:04:00.019> at<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.230> same<00:04:00.410> token<00:04:00.709> they

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
very silky but at the same token they

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.770 
very silky but at the same token they
tend<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.250> be<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.370> little<00:04:01.609> heavier<00:04:01.970> than<00:04:02.239> fibers

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
tend to be a little heavier than fibers

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.590 
tend to be a little heavier than fibers
from<00:04:02.900> other<00:04:03.109> brands<00:04:03.560> such<00:04:03.709> as<00:04:03.739> John<00:04:04.070> Renault

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
from other brands such as John Renault

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.900 
from other brands such as John Renault
and<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:06.380> fibers<00:04:06.829> themselves<00:04:06.950> are<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.850> a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
and the fibers themselves are of a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.870 
and the fibers themselves are of a
coarser<00:04:08.390> like<00:04:08.959> there<00:04:09.170> they're<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.410> little<00:04:09.680> bit

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
coarser like there they're a little bit

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.750 
coarser like there they're a little bit
wider<00:04:10.880> in<00:04:11.180> diameter<00:04:11.570> than<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.530> jar<00:04:12.709> no<00:04:12.920> fiber<00:04:13.190> so

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
wider in diameter than a jar no fiber so

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.099 
wider in diameter than a jar no fiber so
I<00:04:14.480> think<00:04:15.019> that<00:04:15.410> this<00:04:15.739> feels<00:04:16.579> very<00:04:17.090> nice<00:04:17.329> but<00:04:17.989> it

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
I think that this feels very nice but it

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.949 
I think that this feels very nice but it
is<00:04:18.260> not<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:19.489> same<00:04:19.700> as<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.000> John<00:04:20.659> Renault<00:04:20.930> or

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
is not the same as a John Renault or

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.770 
is not the same as a John Renault or
Velma<00:04:21.530> Dom<00:04:21.680> fiber<00:04:22.010> they<00:04:22.280> those

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
Velma Dom fiber they those

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.410 
Velma Dom fiber they those
much<00:04:22.990> finer<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:23.860> consistency<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.730> they<00:04:25.030> feel

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
much finer and consistency and they feel

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.300 
much finer and consistency and they feel
much<00:04:25.840> more<00:04:26.110> satiny<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.100> touch<00:04:29.100> but<00:04:30.100> this

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
much more satiny to the touch but this

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.840 
much more satiny to the touch but this
is<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.700> very<00:04:30.970> nice<00:04:31.240> fiber<00:04:31.770> slightly<00:04:32.770> shiny<00:04:33.100> but

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
is a very nice fiber slightly shiny but

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.220 
is a very nice fiber slightly shiny but
that's<00:04:34.000> easy<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.510> tame<00:04:34.750> with<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:34.960> little<00:04:35.110> bit<00:04:35.200> of

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
that's easy to tame with a little bit of

that's easy to tame with a little bit of
dry<00:04:35.440> shampoo<00:04:35.620> as<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.160> keep<00:04:36.340> saying<00:04:36.450> or<00:04:37.450> you

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
dry shampoo as I keep saying or you

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.909 
dry shampoo as I keep saying or you
could<00:04:37.630> hit<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:37.870> with<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.080> job<00:04:38.230> or<00:04:38.380> no<00:04:38.470> wig<00:04:38.680> wand

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
could hit it with the job or no wig wand

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.520 
could hit it with the job or no wig wand
which<00:04:39.730> is<00:04:39.910> pretty<00:04:40.150> much<00:04:40.210> magic<00:04:40.510> this<00:04:41.350> is<00:04:41.500> a

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
four and a half ounce wig so it's fairly

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.270 
four and a half ounce wig so it's fairly
heavy<00:04:45.250> for<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:45.820> wig<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.510> length<00:04:46.780> but<00:04:47.500> not

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
heavy for a wig of this length but not

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.430 
heavy for a wig of this length but not
uncomfortably<00:04:48.880> show<00:04:49.090> so<00:04:49.990> let<00:04:50.080> me<00:04:50.139> go<00:04:50.290> ahead
