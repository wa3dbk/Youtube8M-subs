00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.559 

all<00:00:03.899> right<00:00:04.140> I<00:00:04.350> bought<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.130> Belkin<00:00:05.819> laptop

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
all right I bought the Belkin laptop

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.280 
all right I bought the Belkin laptop
cooling<00:00:06.899> pad<00:00:07.080> from<00:00:07.950> Costco<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:09.019> think<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.139> was

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
cooling pad from Costco I think this was

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.959 
cooling pad from Costco I think this was
$18<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.599> bought<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:12.990> my<00:00:13.170> new<00:00:13.349> MacBook<00:00:13.980> which

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
$18 I bought it for my new MacBook which

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.460 
$18 I bought it for my new MacBook which
does<00:00:15.210> get<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.389> little<00:00:15.630> warm<00:00:15.900> especially<00:00:16.379> if

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
does get a little warm especially if

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.710 
does get a little warm especially if
it's<00:00:16.590> running<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.010> battery<00:00:17.600> the<00:00:18.600> battery

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
it's running on a battery the battery

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.830 
it's running on a battery the battery
gets<00:00:19.109> really<00:00:19.380> warm<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.699> figure<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.689> will

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
gets really warm so I figure this will

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.970 
gets really warm so I figure this will
make<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.080> more<00:00:22.199> comfortable<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.800> use

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
make it more comfortable to use

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.519 
make it more comfortable to use
especially<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> summer<00:00:23.880> time<00:00:24.350> so<00:00:25.350> let's

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
especially in the summer time so let's

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:38.420 
especially in the summer time so let's
get<00:00:25.890> started<00:00:35.809> it<00:00:36.809> runs<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.200> USB<00:00:37.739> he<00:00:37.920> says<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
get started it runs on USB he says the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:01:26.010 
get started it runs on USB he says the
USB<00:00:38.879> cables<00:00:39.329> in

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.389 

where's<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.130> USB<00:01:27.520> cable<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.280> is

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
where's the USB cable there it is

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:43.800 
where's the USB cable there it is
alright<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:32.670> see<00:01:33.670> it's<00:01:34.420> firmly<00:01:34.659> attached

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.130 

this<00:01:44.380> looks<00:01:44.650> ideal<00:01:45.660> for<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.720> size<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.080> the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
this looks ideal for the size of the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.800 
this looks ideal for the size of the
MacBook<00:01:47.410> probably<00:01:48.370> can<00:01:48.460> hold<00:01:48.610> larger<00:01:48.970> ones<00:01:49.150> 15

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
MacBook probably can hold larger ones 15

00:01:49.810 --> 00:02:00.420 
MacBook probably can hold larger ones 15
inch<00:01:49.960> macros<00:01:50.560> or<00:01:50.830> simply<00:01:51.820> niche<00:01:52.030> macros<00:01:52.660> I<00:01:59.430> did

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
inch macros or simply niche macros I did

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.060 
inch macros or simply niche macros I did
look<00:02:00.670> at<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.240> reviews<00:02:01.600> on<00:02:01.720> amazon.com<00:02:02.200> after

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
look at the reviews on amazon.com after

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.670 
look at the reviews on amazon.com after
I<00:02:03.100> had<00:02:03.280> already<00:02:03.460> picked<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:04.000> up<00:02:04.180> from<00:02:04.510> Costco<00:02:05.440> I

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
I had already picked it up from Costco I

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.969 
I had already picked it up from Costco I
guess<00:02:06.550> they<00:02:06.670> were<00:02:06.729> really<00:02:07.000> negative<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:07.979> we'll

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
guess they were really negative so we'll

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.889 
guess they were really negative so we'll
see<00:02:09.130> how<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.369> works<00:02:09.520> out<00:02:09.700> but<00:02:09.880> take<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.119> look<00:02:10.300> see

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
see how it works out but take a look see

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.780 
see how it works out but take a look see
see<00:02:11.260> what<00:02:11.890> other<00:02:12.040> people<00:02:12.310> are<00:02:12.340> saying<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.730> lot

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
see what other people are saying a lot

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.670 
see what other people are saying a lot
of<00:02:12.880> people<00:02:13.120> say<00:02:13.270> it's<00:02:13.390> noisy's<00:02:13.870> Oh

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
of people say it's noisy's Oh

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.400 
of people say it's noisy's Oh
we're<00:02:14.860> gonna<00:02:15.010> try<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.580> out<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.120> see<00:02:16.330> if<00:02:16.630> it's

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
we're gonna try it out and see if it's

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.060 
we're gonna try it out and see if it's
as<00:02:17.530> bad<00:02:17.560> as<00:02:17.770> he<00:02:17.980> say<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.560> see<00:02:20.739> if<00:02:20.860> it's

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
as bad as he say as you can see if it's

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.430 
as bad as he say as you can see if it's
on<00:02:23.100> like<00:02:24.100> that<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.120> I<00:02:25.150> guess<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.450> could<00:02:25.660> hold

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
on like that so I guess you could hold

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.290 
on like that so I guess you could hold
up<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.890> use<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.130> on<00:02:27.220> your<00:02:27.370> lap<00:02:27.610> as<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:27.910> shoulder

see how it feels on the lamp hey Dell
I'll<00:03:49.760> use<00:03:49.909> it<00:03:50.060> very<00:03:50.150> much<00:03:50.299> but<00:03:50.799> if<00:03:51.799> I<00:03:52.280> if<00:03:52.909> it's

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
I'll use it very much but if I if it's

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.360 
I'll use it very much but if I if it's
too<00:03:53.239> warm<00:03:53.329> in<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.569> summer<00:03:53.769> media<00:03:54.769> maybe<00:03:55.219> it's

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
too warm in the summer media maybe it's

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.280 
too warm in the summer media maybe it's
a<00:03:55.400> good<00:03:55.519> solution<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:57.040> that's<00:03:58.040> all
