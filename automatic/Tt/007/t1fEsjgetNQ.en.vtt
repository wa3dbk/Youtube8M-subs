00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
you make the block for this die you end

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.220 
you make the block for this die you end
up<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> little<00:00:26.220> piece<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:27.230> today

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
fabric put the green fabric over the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.170 
fabric put the green fabric over the
triangle<00:00:37.469> section<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> die<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.760> then

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
triangle section of the die and then

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.310 
triangle section of the die and then
you're<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.480> run<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.780> through<00:00:39.960> your<00:00:40.079> go

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you're going to put that on the triangle

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
you're going to put that on the triangle
section<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.410> has<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> straight<00:00:52.949> lines<00:00:53.160> on<00:00:53.460> it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
right kind of triangle pieces otherwise

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.050 
right kind of triangle pieces otherwise
you<00:01:10.290> won't<00:01:11.010> feel<00:01:11.369> will<00:01:11.549> sew<00:01:11.729> them<00:01:11.909> together

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
is you're going to have your triangle

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.130 
is you're going to have your triangle
like<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.970> you're<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.900> this

like this and you're going to have this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.899 
like this and you're going to have this
piece<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.650> will<00:01:19.740> go<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.189> you're<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
piece that will go there you're going to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
piece that will go there you're going to
lay<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.299> over<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.530> you're<00:01:23.100> going

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
lay this over like this and you're going

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.710 
lay this over like this and you're going
to<00:01:23.280> sew<00:01:23.460> from<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.630> will

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
to sew from here to here and that will

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.020 
to sew from here to here and that will
open<00:01:24.930> up<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
open up like that then you're going to

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.340 
open up like that then you're going to
get<00:01:27.180> your<00:01:27.390> other<00:01:27.600> piece<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:27.900> would<00:01:28.200> go<00:01:28.320> on

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
get your other piece that would go on

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.399 
get your other piece that would go on
this<00:01:28.680> side<00:01:28.979> you're<00:01:29.670> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.270> layer<00:01:31.079> that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
this side you're going to layer that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.679 
this side you're going to layer that
over<00:01:31.799> here<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.640> you're<00:01:32.850> seeing<00:01:33.119> from<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
over here so you're seeing from here to

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
other piece and then I just made a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.210 
other piece and then I just made a
little<00:03:06.830> headache<00:03:07.040> in<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:08.300> top<00:03:08.540> here<00:03:08.950> so<00:03:09.950> that

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
little headache in the top here so that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.590 
little headache in the top here so that
I<00:03:10.250> could<00:03:10.370> read<00:03:10.670> my<00:03:10.820> curtain<00:03:11.180> rod<00:03:11.360> through

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
I could read my curtain rod through

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.410 
I could read my curtain rod through
there<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.110> don't<00:03:12.950> have<00:03:13.100> it<00:03:13.250> real<00:03:13.459> gallery<00:03:13.730> so

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
there I don't have it real gallery so

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.020 
there I don't have it real gallery so
you'd<00:03:14.600> be<00:03:14.810> make<00:03:15.050> one<00:03:15.290> seam<00:03:15.590> here<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.130> one<00:03:16.670> seam

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
you'd be make one seam here and one seam

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.490 
you'd be make one seam here and one seam
here<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.450> then<00:03:17.540> you'd<00:03:17.690> run<00:03:17.900> your<00:03:18.019> curtain<00:03:18.350> rod

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
here and then you'd run your curtain rod
