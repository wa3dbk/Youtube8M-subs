00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
you the most realistic possible drop

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.880 
you the most realistic possible drop
test<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.330> involves<00:00:27.960> three<00:00:28.349> different

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
test so that involves three different

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.189 
test so that involves three different
drops<00:00:29.250> first<00:00:30.029> we're<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.750> drop<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.960> out

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
drops first we're going to drop it out

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.049 
drops first we're going to drop it out
of<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> pocket<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.130> pull<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.579> device<00:00:32.820> out

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
of a pocket as we pull the device out

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.700 
of a pocket as we pull the device out
which<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> most<00:00:33.870> typical<00:00:34.200> use<00:00:34.590> case

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
which is the most typical use case

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470 
which is the most typical use case
scenario<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.640> people<00:00:35.880> actually<00:00:36.030> drop<00:00:36.360> the

from<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.360> reverse<00:01:15.600> initial<00:01:15.990> drop<00:01:16.140> test<00:01:16.410> all

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
from the reverse initial drop test all

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
from the reverse initial drop test all
right<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.460> no<00:01:17.610> shattering<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> display<00:01:18.510> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
right so no shattering on the display a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.590 
right so no shattering on the display a
really<00:01:18.900> good<00:01:19.050> sign<00:01:19.260> but<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:21.090> looks<00:01:21.300> like<00:01:21.360> we

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
really good sign but it looks like we

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.910 
really good sign but it looks like we
have<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.750> little<00:01:22.020> bit<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.200> scratching<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.800> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
have a little bit of scratching to the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
have a little bit of scratching to the
side<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.120> does<00:01:24.300> seem<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.690> fared

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
side here but it does seem to have fared

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.530 
side here but it does seem to have fared
quite<00:01:24.990> well<00:01:25.460> other<00:01:26.460> than<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.760> very<00:01:27.240> minimal

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
quite well other than that very minimal

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.940 
quite well other than that very minimal
damage<00:01:27.690> all<00:01:27.960> things<00:01:28.140> considering<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.830> was

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
damage all things considering but it was

here<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.430> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> drop<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:08.970> from<00:02:09.060> mid

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
here we are going to drop it from mid

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.040 
here we are going to drop it from mid
height<00:02:09.479> from<00:02:09.810> 4<00:02:10.170> feet

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.200 

all<00:02:17.710> right<00:02:17.920> look<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.400> drop<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.820> side<00:02:19.000> but

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
all right look to drop on the side but

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.670 
all right look to drop on the side but
let's<00:02:19.390> see<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.600> moment<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.930> truth<00:02:22.050> okay<00:02:23.050> now

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
let's see the moment of truth okay now

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.280 
let's see the moment of truth okay now
in<00:02:23.800> terms<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.160> actually<00:02:24.490> how<00:02:24.580> unfair<00:02:25.290> all

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
in terms of actually how unfair all

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.860 
in terms of actually how unfair all
right<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:27.270> actually<00:02:28.270> relatively<00:02:28.600> minimal

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
right so actually relatively minimal

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.840 
right so actually relatively minimal

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
damage as we can see the point of impact

six<00:03:39.800> at<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.370> air<00:03:40.880> let's<00:03:41.510> see<00:03:41.660> how<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.780> goes

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.630 

you<00:03:50.350> know<00:03:50.440> I've<00:03:50.890> really<00:03:51.160> got<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> hand<00:03:51.520> it's

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
you know I've really got a hand it's

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.890 
you know I've really got a hand it's
Apple<00:03:52.080> device<00:03:53.080> itself<00:03:53.440> is<00:03:53.620> still<00:03:53.800> functioning

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
Apple device itself is still functioning

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.300 
Apple device itself is still functioning
let's<00:03:55.900> see<00:03:56.080> where<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.319> moment<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.680> point<00:03:57.220> of

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
let's see where the moment of point of

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.800 
let's see where the moment of point of
impact<00:03:57.400> was

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.750 

all<00:04:01.170> right<00:04:01.380> if<00:04:01.890> you're<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.340> yeah<00:04:02.700> you

all right if you're so yeah you
it's<00:04:04.360> a<00:04:04.450> really<00:04:04.569> line<00:04:04.810> cloud<00:04:05.019> device<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.530> just

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
it's a really line cloud device I just

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.960 
it's a really line cloud device I just
to<00:04:05.920> stay<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.099> little<00:04:06.250> bit<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.489> damage<00:04:06.610> on<00:04:06.879> the

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
to stay a little bit of damage on the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.759 
to stay a little bit of damage on the
side<00:04:07.150> we<00:04:07.720> had<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.959> first<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.439> second<00:04:08.709> point

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
side we had the first the second point

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.530 
side we had the first the second point
of<00:04:08.890> impact<00:04:09.010> was<00:04:09.340> here<00:04:09.610> and<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:10.150> first<00:04:10.360> point

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
of impact was here and the first point

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.990 
of impact was here and the first point
of<00:04:10.629> impact<00:04:10.720> was<00:04:11.159> actually<00:04:12.159> excuse<00:04:12.459> me<00:04:12.640> this

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
of impact was actually excuse me this

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.250 
of impact was actually excuse me this
appears<00:04:13.299> to<00:04:13.329> be<00:04:13.420> actually<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.989> point<00:04:14.230> of

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
appears to be actually the point of

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.050 
appears to be actually the point of
impact<00:04:14.409> and<00:04:14.890> whereas<00:04:15.549> you<00:04:15.700> know<00:04:15.730> from<00:04:15.970> the

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
impact and whereas you know from the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.719 
impact and whereas you know from the
galaxy<00:04:16.449> s3<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:17.079> smashed<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:18.190> iphone<00:04:18.489> 5

galaxy s3 is smashed the iphone 5
appears<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.870> sustain<00:04:20.260> relatively<00:04:20.889> minimal

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
appears to sustain relatively minimal

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.980 
appears to sustain relatively minimal
damage<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.970> LCD<00:04:22.360> itself<00:04:22.690> is<00:04:22.810> still

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
damage the LCD itself is still

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.659 
damage the LCD itself is still
completely<00:04:23.110> functioning<00:04:23.860> it's<00:04:24.280> just<00:04:24.490> minor

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
completely functioning it's just minor

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.670 
completely functioning it's just minor
aesthetic<00:04:25.060> damage<00:04:25.360> to<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.050> bezel<00:04:26.380> itself

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
aesthetic damage to the bezel itself

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.830 
aesthetic damage to the bezel itself
which<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.160> made<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.520> a<00:04:27.610> hard<00:04:28.120> composite<00:04:28.630> metal

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
which is made of a hard composite metal

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
again we're going to drop it from the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.000 
again we're going to drop it from the
height<00:04:37.000> of<00:04:37.030> my<00:04:37.210> ear<00:04:37.449> to<00:04:37.750> read<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:37.990> portrayal<00:04:38.620> a

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
stick drop test scenario will be five

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.320 
stick drop test scenario will be five
foot<00:04:41.229> six<00:04:41.440> at<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.680> year<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:42.850> let's<00:04:43.000> just<00:04:43.090> see

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
foot six at the year and let's just see

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.800 
foot six at the year and let's just see
how<00:04:43.449> it<00:04:43.600> fares

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.500 

alright<00:04:50.350> so<00:04:50.560> as<00:04:50.650> we<00:04:50.770> can<00:04:50.860> see<00:04:50.919> ya<00:04:51.790> just<00:04:52.389> from

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
alright so as we can see ya just from

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.940 
alright so as we can see ya just from
the<00:04:52.570> side<00:04:52.780> here<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.110> did<00:04:53.320> crack<00:04:53.560> a<00:04:53.590> little<00:04:53.770> bit

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
the side here it did crack a little bit

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.640 
the side here it did crack a little bit
more<00:04:54.270> it<00:04:55.270> appears<00:04:55.570> as<00:04:55.720> though<00:04:55.750> yeah<00:04:56.470> the

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
more it appears as though yeah the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.590 
more it appears as though yeah the
impact<00:04:56.950> was<00:04:57.070> here<00:04:57.280> on<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.490> side<00:04:57.700> which<00:04:58.419> caused

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
impact was here on the side which caused

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.970 
impact was here on the side which caused
the<00:04:58.630> glass<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.139> fracture<00:04:59.470> a<00:04:59.500> little<00:04:59.680> bit<00:04:59.770> more

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
the glass to fracture a little bit more

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.770 
the glass to fracture a little bit more
but<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:00.490> just<00:05:00.610> compounded<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.240> fractures<00:05:01.750> to

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
but it just compounded the fractures to

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.050 
but it just compounded the fractures to
the<00:05:01.960> point<00:05:02.230> where<00:05:02.470> they<00:05:02.860> extend<00:05:03.460> all<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:03.700> way

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
the point where they extend all the way

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.350 
the point where they extend all the way
down<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.690> device<00:05:04.960> itself<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.669> rear<00:05:06.880> yeah

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
down the device itself to the rear yeah

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.810 
down the device itself to the rear yeah
obviously<00:05:08.080> not<00:05:08.350> very<00:05:08.410> much<00:05:08.650> damage<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.610> case

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
obviously not very much damage the case

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.129 
obviously not very much damage the case
really<00:05:10.180> no<00:05:10.330> one<00:05:10.450> cares<00:05:10.660> about<00:05:10.780> it's<00:05:11.080> just

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
really no one cares about it's just

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.340 
really no one cares about it's just
cheap<00:05:11.530> plastic<00:05:11.740> really<00:05:12.160> anyway<00:05:12.690> but<00:05:13.690> yeah<00:05:13.810> The

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
cheap plastic really anyway but yeah The

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.600 
cheap plastic really anyway but yeah The
Scream<00:05:14.560> self<00:05:14.800> is<00:05:14.889> still<00:05:15.070> functioning<00:05:15.520> so

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
Scream self is still functioning so

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.860 
Scream self is still functioning so
that's<00:05:15.790> a<00:05:15.850> really<00:05:16.030> good<00:05:16.120> sign<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.480> internals

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
that's a really good sign the internals

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.770 
that's a really good sign the internals
are<00:05:16.930> obviously<00:05:17.290> okay<00:05:17.970> but<00:05:18.970> it<00:05:19.600> just

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
are obviously okay but it just

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.570 
are obviously okay but it just
compounded<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.320> impact<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:20.889> just<00:05:21.370> made<00:05:21.550> all

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
compounded the impact and just made all

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.980 
compounded the impact and just made all
the<00:05:21.760> cracks<00:05:22.000> just<00:05:22.210> go<00:05:22.360> down<00:05:22.510> a<00:05:22.540> little<00:05:22.660> farther

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
the cracks just go down a little farther

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.469 
the cracks just go down a little farther
down<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.560> length<00:05:23.919> of<00:05:24.070> the<00:05:24.190> display<00:05:24.580> so

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
down the length of the display so

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.690 
down the length of the display so
Samsung<00:05:26.229> as<00:05:26.380> three<00:05:26.590> unfortunately<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.490> in

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
Samsung as three unfortunately is in

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.610 
Samsung as three unfortunately is in
pretty<00:05:28.360> tough<00:05:28.540> shape<00:05:28.600> right<00:05:28.960> now<00:05:28.990> relative<00:05:29.530> to
