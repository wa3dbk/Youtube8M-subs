 I bring you one more video of gta online 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.460
 and good this time I'm going to 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.070
 show how to get the gas mask 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.680
 that they have the coveralls of colors 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.600
 that that mask was not getting its 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.460
 weapon and good after showing how 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.809
 place it also to a helmet style 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.210
 subway 2033 of that game and good if you 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.590
 You want to know how I got this costume 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.110
 police under the description I'm going to 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.600
 leave the video to get this 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.190
 suit and then do not have very easy and good 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.100
 what we will do to obtain the mask 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.210
 gas will be very easy we will come 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.580
 directly to a store we are going to go 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.799
 to the counter we're going to go to sets and 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.690
 let's find what is being the 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.940
 heavy combat strike sets 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.010
 here we are going to choose any of these 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.930
 four that you like and in this case 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.729
 I'm going to choose this strength because I 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.890
 I want my set to be black 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.070
 can put the gas mask and the 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.189
 helmet style as I tell you the game 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.020
 metro 2033 ok and good and from here we 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.600
 let's go directly to the area where 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.340
 are the helmets and we're going to get 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.560
 the cases 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.719
 of anti bullets here then let's choose 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.429
 which you want I say the most 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.189
 wild they chose but I'm going to 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:27.369
 choose this black bulletproof ok so that 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.170
 everything is black my characters and good 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.509
 from there we're going to go here it's optional if you 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.429
 they want to put some lens especially me 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.299
 I'm going to put some luxury lenses that 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:39.100
 would be the ones of is elvis orange I think 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.640
 that I'm going to place to give you a 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.590
 touch the mask like reddish good 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.470
 so it does not look like just the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.659
 mask and good and once we have 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.939
 the set that we want we are going to 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.560
 head back to the counter and we 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.479
 let's put what is being is 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.789
 this part here so I can save it and 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.619
 we are going to put the name that we want 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.140
 in this case he's going to put the subway 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.500
 2033 to differentiate them from any 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.360
 photo ok since we have saved 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.670
 it's been this set we left 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.879
 of this option and we are going to look for 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.819
 again in sets the sets 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.620
 of overalls of blow in another side I think that 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.750
 it may vary but I always think it says 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.639
 overalls and good we will choose any 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.210
 of these four colored coveralls that 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.610
 they bring 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.680
 it's expensive ok this so to get the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.170
 gas mask that is our goal 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.000
 well we already choose either we buy 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.350
 any if you have all the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.210
 suits that we just saw then 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.580
 they will simply go directly to 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.710
 department without coming to the store and 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.090
 good running here and do this 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.910
 we are going to address our 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.930
 department and since we are there we are going 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.360
 to go directly to the telescope ok and we 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.220
 let's stop in front of him 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.590
 well here we will need an activity 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.690
 of simeÃ³n the mark lester of all 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.220
 those campaign characters that's 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.380
 we must necessarily have it if not 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.180
 they have it ask for the call read the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.210
 contact or any campaign contact 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.440
 and they request an activity ok 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.390
 good as we have it and we are 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.410
 standing exactly opposite we're going to 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.210
 open the cell phone let's go to 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.000
 fast activities play a random 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.100
 then we're going to tell him he 's insecure 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.080
 and again we are going to take out the 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.840
 phone we will be any mission 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.170
 of campaign we get to see by the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.440
 telescope and here we are going to wait for 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.580
 we are charged the activity ok this can 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.520
 take 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.680
 I do not know 30 to 5 minutes but sometimes it's 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.270
 very fast since we are inside the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.790
 activity what we will do is simply 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.800
 let us confirm that we left and 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.030
 when we leave this activity 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.380
 we will notice that we are on this screen and 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.170
 here we are going to open the back let's go to 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.330
 accessories and we will go to select the 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.480
 whole and we put the whole that 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.190
 we call like metro 2033 and just 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.110
 we left people to get out of the 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.660
 what it has been to look at the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.670
 telescope and we'll have the mask with 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.150
 the lenses and the helmet and our attire 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.459
 full of metro 2000 and finally what 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.200
 What would be left to do is go save it to 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.910
 the goods and where the closet is 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.280
 where is the clothes our most clothes 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.200

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.290
