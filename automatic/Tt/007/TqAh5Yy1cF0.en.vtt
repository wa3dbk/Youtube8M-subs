00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 We will show below how 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.960
 multiply two numbers of two figures 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.750
 quickly without the need to use 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.330
 a calculator to understand the method 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.460
 let's see these three examples and the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.560
 let's develop let's say 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 quite slowly for us to understand 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
 well how it works then let's see 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.910
 three other examples where we're going to 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.980
 find the results using the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.170
 method but in a more agile way 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.920
 let's begin then by understanding how 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.800
 it works we have 33 by 21 we are going to take 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.940
 at 13 to 2 we will find your product 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.640
 3 for 2 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.309
 is 6 that's the first number of the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.149
 result then let's leave a space 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.870
 and let's multiply this 3 for this 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.809
 one 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.530
 that result is going to be the last number 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.570
 of our number or 3 by 1 which is 3 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.879
 that we are going to have in the middle we are going to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.500
 make the following products 3 by 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.780
 1 and 3 times 2 3 times 1 is 3 and 3 times 12 6 and 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 we do with that let's add the 3 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:13.259
 6 the result is 9 we have 693 which is 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.890
 the result of multiplying to 33 by 21 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.659
 let's see what is equal 25 by 48 we are going to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.860
 take this 2 and we will multiply it 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.470
 for this 4 the result is 8 then we go 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.750
 to take this 5 and we 're going to 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.720
 multiply by this 8 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.200
 the result is 40 then we are going to 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.110
 leave that 4 here because we're going to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.750
 write only the last number of that 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.840
 product then what are we going to do we are going to 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.700
 make this product and this product 2 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.700
 20 for 8 is 16 and 5 for 4 is 20 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.039
 the result is 36 that we are going to do with 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.440
 this 4 we are going to add to this 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.470
 result so we're going to have 40 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.979
 we put the zero and that 4 we add it to 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.830
 this 8 so we're going to have 48 12 with 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.840
 this pair of zeros 1200 if we multiply 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.600
 to 25 for 48 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.590
 the result is 1200 now let's see what 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.840
 it happens with 40 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:19.050
 for 54 we have 4 for 5 which is 20 I would 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.830
 we write full we leave the space and 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.400
 then we will have 7 by 4 which is 28 already 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.170
 we know we put the 8 and we leave the 2 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:33.420
 now then we are going to perform these 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.480
 4x4 products which is 16 + 7 by 5 which is 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.540
 35 if we add these two numbers the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.480
 result is 51 but we have to 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.239
 add this two so we have 53 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.819
 we are going to place the 3 here and we are going to add 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:54.720
 5 we have 20 plus 5 which is 25 and 38 that already 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:58.410
 we had written here 2,538 is going to be the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.379
 result of multiplying to 47 by 54 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.900
 now let's see three additional examples 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:09.540
 where are we going to do this same but from 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:13.319
 a faster way we have 35 x 31 45 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.630
 x 48 and 97 for 54 let's proceed more 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.100
 quick of what we did in the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.810
 previous examples 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:26.400
 for 339 we leave space 5 for 15 3 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.610
 for 1 is 3 and 5 for 3 is 15 3 + 15 18 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.120
 we leave the 8 and add 1 the result goes 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:37.950
 to be then 10 85 we go with the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:41.250
 second product 45 by 48 4 by 4 16 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.760
 we leave space 5 for 840 we leave the 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.960
 0 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:50.060
 we already know that we carry 4 4 for 8 32 and 5 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.100
 for 4 20 we have 52 plus 4 that we had 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.630
 56 we already know that here we add 5 the 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:03.060
 result of doing 21 60 2.160 we go with 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:07.890
 the last example 97 x 54 9 by 5 is 45 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:10.020
 and 7 times 4 is 28 we take only 8 we go 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:15.540
 to leave the 2 and we are going to make these 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:20.940
 products 9 times 4 is 36 7 times 5 is 35 already 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:24.120
 that we have 71 plus 273 let's add 7 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:29.250
 this will be equal to 52 30 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.440
 to 5,238 as long as we master the 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.050
 method will be very easy for us 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.780
 get to the results as we finish 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.060
 to show I invite you then now to 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:47.810
 that you find the following 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:47.810
 three products 45 x 33 15 x 38 and 77 x 94
