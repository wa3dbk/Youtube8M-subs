 I began to close and wear it in such 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.490
 here is the form 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.920
 it reminds me of something you know from 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.739
 haute couture show and shooting valentine what else 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.629
 sell when they have licked 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.540
 but at the same time whipped such 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.640
 sloppy tails and bundles like you 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.129

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.559
 No, I love this one very much 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.699
 asymmetrical haircut Well, how would I have it 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.170
 somewhere about two years old so she told me 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.149
 it was not that on and give me anyway 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.969
 I love but sometimes I want something 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.600
 of the other, and I've done this 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.549
 little thing 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.470
 body ask you how is she catching up 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.650
 I wanted to truly catch up to haute couture or 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.510
 only i'm so spirit lane because on 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.280
 in fact in america how would such a style 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.360
 worn quite rarely here in 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.490
 mostly american 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.520
 they have either a haircut or some 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.380
 strange chump on the head with a beam 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 these are hairstyles in style 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.970
 it is impossible even in chemistry in chemistry then braids 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.189
 weaving is still a little bit already 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.220
 a certain style but something 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.420
 more modest less florid 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.090
 style i don't know ruined noblewoman 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.610
 here is considered new nimeria in those 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.200
 the circles in which I appeal to those 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.619
 comments that are looking for 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.869

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.189
 long out of fashion 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.560
 but how he is not this does not go out of fashion 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.299
 before beautiful waves it is always beautiful but 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.500
 this is not such a few, too, became a clichÃ© 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.509
 and now the top notch in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.689
 hair styling medium length 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.680
 these are such incomprehensible ones and 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.440
 licked 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.130
 and at the same time sloppy semi tails 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.500
 semi bunches 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.300

 create some sort of impression with 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:39.390
 one side is elegant and at the same time 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.000
