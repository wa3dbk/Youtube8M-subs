about it can affect us a large myself my
husband<00:02:05.319> here<00:02:05.679> I<00:02:05.890> think<00:02:06.670> everything<00:02:06.909> is<00:02:07.090> going

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
husband here I think everything is going

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.180

to<00:02:07.420> affect<00:02:08.200> everybody<00:02:08.500> this<00:02:08.769> time<00:02:09.009> in<00:02:09.129> the

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
to affect everybody this time in the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.550 
to affect everybody this time in the
budget<00:02:09.519> I<00:02:09.670> can<00:02:10.360> what<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.629> solution<00:02:11.079> is<00:02:11.170> really

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
budget I can what the solution is really

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.720 
budget I can what the solution is really
I<00:02:11.590> think<00:02:11.709> what<00:02:11.950> they're<00:02:12.040> going<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.280> do<00:02:12.459> but<00:02:12.700> I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
I think what they're going to do but I

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.430 
I think what they're going to do but I
mean<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:13.239> have<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.840> get<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.049> money<00:02:14.170> somewhere

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
mean I have to get the money somewhere

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.840 
mean I have to get the money somewhere
but<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.769> camp<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.069> can<00:02:15.280> same<00:02:15.489> people<00:02:15.819> the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
but the camp you can same people the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.630 
but the camp you can same people the
whole<00:02:16.030> time

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
whole time

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.490 
whole time
to<00:02:17.450> be<00:02:17.540> honest<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.840> would<00:02:17.900> affect<00:02:18.200> me<00:02:18.290> alas

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
to be honest it would affect me alas

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.140

so<00:03:40.079> even<00:03:40.709> if<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.040> put<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.280> up<00:03:41.400> again<00:03:41.670> it'd<00:03:42.540> be

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
so even if you put that up again it'd be

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.229 
so even if you put that up again it'd be
more<00:03:42.930> pressure<00:03:43.170> on<00:03:43.290> Harper<00:03:43.440> licking<00:03:43.980> it

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
more pressure on Harper licking it

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.369 
more pressure on Harper licking it
that's<00:03:45.239> what<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.420> think<00:03:45.569> about<00:03:45.780> went<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.170> I'm

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
that's what I think about went in it I'm

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:47.750 
that's what I think about went in it I'm
not<00:03:46.500> even<00:03:46.560> think<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.920> most<00:03:47.040> other<00:03:47.459> people<00:03:47.700> to

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
not even think the most other people to

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.410 
not even think the most other people to
discipline<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:49.560> probably<00:03:50.159> good<00:03:50.340> min<00:03:51.150> if

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
discipline is it so probably good min if

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.990 
discipline is it so probably good min if
I<00:03:51.599> if<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.989> need<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.290> get<00:03:52.409> my<00:03:52.620> oil<00:03:52.920> tank<00:03:53.760> filled

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
I if I need to get my oil tank filled

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.339 
I if I need to get my oil tank filled
but<00:03:54.239> thankfully<00:03:54.720> I've<00:03:54.810> had<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.170> filled

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
but thankfully I've had it filled

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.309 
but thankfully I've had it filled
already<00:03:55.910> but<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.329> is<00:03:57.569> very<00:03:57.629> serious

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
already but it is very serious

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:05.630 
already but it is very serious
especially<00:03:59.220> for<00:03:59.370> all<00:03:59.519> people<00:03:59.940> on<00:04:00.030> pensions

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.680 

and<00:04:06.240> I<00:04:06.720> think<00:04:06.900> on<00:04:07.380> Friday<00:04:07.710> it's<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.630> Toy<00:04:09.630> Show

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
and I think on Friday it's the Toy Show

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.920 
and I think on Friday it's the Toy Show
and<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.650> think<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.310> he's<00:04:12.000> he'd<00:04:12.720> need<00:04:12.900> to

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
and I think you know he's he'd need to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.830 
and I think you know he's he'd need to
think<00:04:13.230> long<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.620> hard<00:04:13.830> about<00:04:14.190> sissy<00:04:14.580> I<00:04:14.880> don't

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
think long and hard about sissy I don't

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.590 
think long and hard about sissy I don't
see<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.109> point<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.680> him<00:04:17.280> coming<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.299> and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
see the point in him coming on and

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.860 
see the point in him coming on and
talking<00:04:18.660> about<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:20.070> budgets<00:04:20.459> beforehand<00:04:21.420> I

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
talking about the budgets beforehand I

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.820 
talking about the budgets beforehand I
think<00:04:22.590> they've<00:04:22.740> scared<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.280> people<00:04:23.640> enough<00:04:24.000> I

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
think they've scared the people enough I

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.100 
think they've scared the people enough I
think<00:04:25.830> this<00:04:25.980> would<00:04:26.250> only<00:04:26.370> further<00:04:26.840> put<00:04:27.840> fear

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
think this would only further put fear

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.500 
think this would only further put fear
into<00:04:28.380> people<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:29.070> know<00:04:29.790> really<00:04:30.090> what<00:04:30.360> they're
