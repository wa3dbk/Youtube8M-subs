00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
showed back in Los Angeles is not just a

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.139 
showed back in Los Angeles is not just a
fluke<00:01:48.619> it's<00:01:48.799> actually<00:01:49.130> how<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.460> game<00:01:49.700> is<00:01:49.909> it's

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
fluke it's actually how the game is it's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.419 
fluke it's actually how the game is it's
very<00:01:50.360> cinematic<00:01:50.750> right<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:51.350> full<00:01:52.280> of

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
very cinematic right and it's full of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:53.770 
very cinematic right and it's full of
choice<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:52.939> that's<00:01:53.210> what<00:01:53.329> we're<00:01:53.450> hoping<00:01:53.539> they

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
choice so that's what we're hoping they

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.819 
choice so that's what we're hoping they
take<00:01:53.990> away<00:01:54.110> from<00:01:54.319> this<00:01:54.439> that<00:01:54.619> it's

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
take away from this that it's

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.609 
take away from this that it's
reaffirming<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:56.119> abilities<00:01:56.539> of<00:01:56.569> 47<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.500> that

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
reaffirming the abilities of 47 and that

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:58.960 
reaffirming the abilities of 47 and that
it<00:01:57.740> is<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.860> very<00:01:58.100> cinematic<00:01:58.549> game<00:01:58.819> we're

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
it is a very cinematic game we're

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.819 
it is a very cinematic game we're
building<00:01:59.289> absolution<00:02:00.289> has<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.439> far<00:02:00.679> more

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
building absolution has a far more

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.620 
building absolution has a far more
personal<00:02:01.280> story<00:02:01.579> than<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.880> previous<00:02:02.390> games

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
personal story than the previous games

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.449 
personal story than the previous games
so<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.259> this<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:03.709> something<00:02:04.069> that's<00:02:04.220> been

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
so and this is something that's been

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.460 
so and this is something that's been
it's<00:02:05.360> been<00:02:05.450> tough<00:02:05.750> for<00:02:05.780> us<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.080> work<00:02:06.439> with

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
it's been tough for us to work with

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.139 
it's been tough for us to work with
because<00:02:06.799> it's<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.250> different<00:02:07.580> way<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.700> telling

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
because it's a different way of telling

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.440 
because it's a different way of telling
a<00:02:08.209> story<00:02:08.420> than<00:02:08.799> we<00:02:09.799> classically<00:02:10.160> did<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:11.209> also

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
a story than we classically did so also

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.900 
a story than we classically did so also
the<00:02:12.019> team<00:02:12.230> has<00:02:12.410> been<00:02:12.530> learning<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> lot<00:02:12.920> during

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
the team has been learning a lot during

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.970 
the team has been learning a lot during
the<00:02:14.269> years<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.870> how<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.230> kind<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.680> integrate

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the years to how to kind of integrate

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.030 
the years to how to kind of integrate
the<00:02:16.640> story<00:02:16.940> within<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.450> levels<00:02:17.750> without

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
the story within the levels without

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.130 
the story within the levels without
compromising<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.299> player<00:02:20.299> choice<00:02:20.599> for<00:02:21.019> me

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
compromising the player choice for me

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.259 
compromising the player choice for me
it's<00:02:21.349> really<00:02:21.470> important<00:02:22.099> that<00:02:22.130> they<00:02:22.400> see<00:02:22.819> just

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
it's really important that they see just

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.240 
it's really important that they see just
how<00:02:23.450> much<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.660> can<00:02:23.930> do<00:02:24.079> as<00:02:24.230> 1847<00:02:24.829> this<00:02:25.099> time

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
how much you can do as 1847 this time

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.120 
how much you can do as 1847 this time
around<00:02:25.370> which<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.209> why<00:02:26.360> we<00:02:26.540> built<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:27.620> way

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
around which is why we built a way

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.319 
around which is why we built a way
through<00:02:28.310> where<00:02:28.489> that<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.880> actually<00:02:29.180> two

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
through where that is actually two

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.030 
through where that is actually two
playthroughs<00:02:29.510> first<00:02:30.380> one<00:02:30.530> where<00:02:30.739> we<00:02:30.860> play<00:02:31.010> a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
playthroughs first one where we play a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.559 
playthroughs first one where we play a
more<00:02:31.220> professional<00:02:31.489> style<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.209> then<00:02:32.390> one

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
more professional style and then one

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.059 
more professional style and then one
where<00:02:32.780> we<00:02:32.810> play<00:02:32.989> a<00:02:33.019> more<00:02:33.170> freestyle<00:02:33.739> where<00:02:33.950> we

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
where we play a more freestyle where we

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.500 
where we play a more freestyle where we
end<00:02:34.190> up<00:02:34.250> killing<00:02:34.549> quite<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> few<00:02:34.970> people<00:02:35.269> and

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
end up killing quite a few people and

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.390 
end up killing quite a few people and
it's<00:02:35.959> all<00:02:36.109> kind<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.680> show<00:02:36.829> that<00:02:37.220> the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
it's all kind of to show that the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.880 
it's all kind of to show that the
Arsenal<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.910> now<00:02:38.060> kind<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.900> full<00:02:39.350> circle<00:02:39.680> it's

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
Arsenal is now kind of full circle it's

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
well rounded I think we are this time

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.870

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:07.450 
to change your gear you can do that
right<00:02:51.799> into<00:02:52.670> numbers

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.100 

it's<00:03:08.460> been<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> backbone<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.180> i/o<00:03:09.510> ever<00:03:09.810> since

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
it's been the backbone of i/o ever since

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.190 
it's been the backbone of i/o ever since
it<00:03:10.260> started<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:11.190> was<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:12.240> technology<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.050> was

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
it started it was the technology I was

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.870 
it started it was the technology I was
made<00:03:13.350> for<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> first<00:03:13.800> hitman<00:03:14.160> game<00:03:14.370> also<00:03:14.610> laid

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
made for the first hitman game also laid

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.970 
made for the first hitman game also laid
the<00:03:15.000> foundation<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.540> every<00:03:16.080> other<00:03:16.380> game<00:03:16.770> we

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the foundation for every other game we

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.490 
the foundation for every other game we
did<00:03:17.160> up<00:03:17.610> until<00:03:17.820> this<00:03:18.120> point<00:03:18.210> so<00:03:19.020> it's<00:03:19.140> only<00:03:19.260> now

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
did up until this point so it's only now

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.960 
did up until this point so it's only now
that<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:19.890> actually<00:03:20.010> got<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> opportunity<00:03:20.550> to

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
that we actually got the opportunity to

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.490 
that we actually got the opportunity to
make<00:03:21.120> completely<00:03:21.660> new<00:03:21.780> technology<00:03:22.380> from

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
make completely new technology from

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.800 
make completely new technology from
scratch<00:03:22.830> which<00:03:23.460> is<00:03:23.610> called<00:03:23.760> laser<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.270> which

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
scratch which is called laser to which

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.370 
scratch which is called laser to which
is<00:03:24.930> was<00:03:25.080> powering<00:03:25.440> absolution<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.580> made

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
is was powering absolution and it's made

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.540 
is was powering absolution and it's made
completely<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.680> fusion<00:03:29.130> with<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.400> game

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
completely in fusion with the game

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.220 
completely in fusion with the game
design<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.150> everything<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.900> mechanics

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
design so everything that the mechanics

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.680 
design so everything that the mechanics
needs<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.520> art<00:03:32.670> direction<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.360> sound

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
needs and the art direction and sound

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.480 
needs and the art direction and sound
needs<00:03:34.020> it's<00:03:34.470> been<00:03:34.650> made<00:03:34.800> custom<00:03:35.040> for<00:03:35.400> this

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
needs it's been made custom for this

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.630 
needs it's been made custom for this
game<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.030> very<00:03:36.660> excited<00:03:36.780> about<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:37.710> mean
