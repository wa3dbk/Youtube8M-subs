heavy<00:00:11.010> overdrive

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:40.380 

say<00:00:19.790> overdrive<00:00:20.150> channel<00:00:20.480> by<00:00:20.600> the<00:00:20.630> way

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.209 

it's<00:00:41.320> good<00:00:41.469> enough<00:00:41.710> that<00:00:41.859> it<00:00:41.949> could<00:00:42.070> have<00:00:42.190> been

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
it's good enough that it could have been

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:43.919 
it's good enough that it could have been
the<00:00:42.489> one<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:42.820> only<00:00:42.879> channel<00:00:43.359> on<00:00:43.449> the<00:00:43.570> amp<00:00:43.719> and

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
the one and only channel on the amp and

00:00:43.929 --> 00:01:28.250 
the one and only channel on the amp and
I<00:00:43.989> would<00:00:44.079> have<00:00:44.170> been<00:00:44.260> just<00:00:44.500> as<00:00:44.620> happy

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.410 

so<00:01:29.260> pretty<00:01:30.130> nice<00:01:30.310> pretty<00:01:30.910> nice<00:01:31.060> amount<00:01:31.300> of

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
so pretty nice pretty nice amount of

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.720 
so pretty nice pretty nice amount of
gain<00:01:31.600> in<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.900> end<00:01:32.080> you<00:01:32.980> know<00:01:33.100> it's<00:01:33.280> not<00:01:33.490> for

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
gain in the end you know it's not for

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.490 
gain in the end you know it's not for
the<00:01:34.020> hardcore<00:01:35.430> brutal<00:01:36.430> guys<00:01:36.910> but<00:01:37.330> um<00:01:37.480> event<00:01:38.380> it

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
the hardcore brutal guys but um event it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
definitely can hang with pretty much
