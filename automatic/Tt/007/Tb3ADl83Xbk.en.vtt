different optical digital audio outputs

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.470 
different optical digital audio outputs
too<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> full<00:01:02.670> high-definition

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and we'll also talk about the fact that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.510 
and we'll also talk about the fact that
it<00:01:31.350> connects<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:31.860> network<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.400> gives

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it connects to your network and gives

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.280 
it connects to your network and gives
you<00:01:32.670> access<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.540> different<00:01:33.659> information<00:01:34.259> that

the<00:01:45.060> world<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.960> see<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> menu<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.560> so

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the world but you can see the menu is so

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.039 
the world but you can see the menu is so
simple<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.880> got<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.479> number<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> different

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
simple it's got a number of different

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.929 
simple it's got a number of different
ways<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> get<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.159> content<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
ways to get the the content this is a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.280 
ways to get the the content this is a
hard<00:01:51.240> drive<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.600> plugged<00:01:51.869> right<00:01:51.930> into<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
hard drive that's plugged right into the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.600 
hard drive that's plugged right into the
front<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
front you can see it's one of the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.490 
front you can see it's one of the
Seagate<00:01:53.970> ones<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.990> bundle<00:01:55.170> actually

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
Seagate ones and the bundle actually

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.800 
Seagate ones and the bundle actually
comes<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.070> or<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.060> even<00:01:57.360> hook<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:57.630> in

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
comes with it or you can even hook up in

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.899 
comes with it or you can even hook up in
another<00:01:58.290> external<00:01:58.920> hard<00:01:59.100> drive<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
another external hard drive to this and

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.760 
another external hard drive to this and
like<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.360> said<00:02:00.540> there's<00:02:00.780> an<00:02:00.960> Ethernet<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:01.619> a

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
like you said there's an Ethernet or a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.620 
like you said there's an Ethernet or a
network<00:02:01.950> connection<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.240> wanted<00:02:03.570> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
network connection so if you wanted to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.929 
network connection so if you wanted to
it'll<00:02:04.020> actually<00:02:04.140> go<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.710> find<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.490> content

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
it'll actually go and find the content

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
it'll actually go and find the content
off<00:02:06.119> your<00:02:06.360> your<00:02:06.750> home<00:02:06.899> computer<00:02:07.110> yeah<00:02:07.530> it

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
off your your home computer yeah it
