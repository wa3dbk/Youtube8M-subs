is getting closer to the reference
uncontaminated<00:02:30.790> clean<00:02:31.390> fluid<00:02:31.870> which<00:02:32.170> comes

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
uncontaminated clean fluid which comes

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.230 
uncontaminated clean fluid which comes
right<00:02:32.560> out<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.740> the<00:02:32.800> bottle<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:33.940> it's<00:02:34.060> not

quite there yet so let's compare the

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.530 
quite there yet so let's compare the
latest<00:02:38.950> or<00:02:39.459> third<00:02:39.970> drain<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.230> fill<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:43.420> I'm

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
latest or third drain and fill and I'm

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.570 
latest or third drain and fill and I'm
still<00:02:43.780> at<00:02:43.900> sixty<00:02:44.320> under<00:02:44.860> sixty<00:02:45.160> thousand

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
still at sixty under sixty thousand

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.220 
still at sixty under sixty thousand
miles<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:45.910> I'm<00:02:46.000> going<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.209> sixty<00:02:46.600> sixty

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
miles so I'm going to sixty sixty

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.420 
miles so I'm going to sixty sixty
thousand<00:02:48.070> one<00:02:48.450> five<00:02:49.450> hundred<00:02:49.750> miles<00:02:49.900> or<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.430> so

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430

think there's a dirt inside the
transmission<00:04:12.650> case<00:04:13.129> that<00:04:13.340> needs<00:04:13.519> to<00:04:13.669> come<00:04:13.819> out
