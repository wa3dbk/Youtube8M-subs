00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.650
 given is that those who have a 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.280
 single box are the heroes that have 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.600

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.600

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.410
 who do not have suits have 2 boxes 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.880
 just like the normal heroes that 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.850
 they have suits in their normal suit seat 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.310

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.240

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.240
 over here it ends 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.159
 at level 2 and good you have to have it to 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.159
 more level for 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:51.790

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.440
 18 powerful empowered and have another 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.540
 bonus 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.220

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:05.850

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.000

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.810
 mocking bird like more forums in 200 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.950

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.950
 75 golds 75 golds 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.810
 and it's worth the first two two heroes 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.600
 of special operation and there we have them 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.100
 they are going to stay forever 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.280
 when the suits do not know what where with 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.820
 the other frost suits but good and 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.080
 we can recruit as well as 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:44.230
 mocking bird without being in a hurry 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.550
 of days left to recruit us 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.550
 that are going to stay forever 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:57.470
 good this day more good if we check 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.810
 the store as I had told you are 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.849
 the generic floors he had told us 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.800
 play down that was going to be for silver for 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:08.680
 buy them but now it turns out that you do not 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.680
 it's going to be by means of command points 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.690
 to trolle play doh and well then 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:17.030
 what are we going to do if we want these 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.980
 children or will have to take out the athletes 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.600
 I hope I have not tried like this or if 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.450
 not so you'll have to buy them here in 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.120
 the land in the store by cps but 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.960
 well let's see what 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.100
 that the roulettes give us 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.380
 bosses or 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.740
 the secret letters of any 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.740
 deployment 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:50.580
 well we also have in the stews that 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:53.180
 they are by class not the generalist 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.180
 strategist 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.180
 spy 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.340
 fighter 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:08.430
 and as I mentioned these 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:11.310
 Restricted class flats are going to be 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.520
 half gold we're going is not going to 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.870
 be on ballots or anything like that 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.069
 we just have to buy them in 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.690
 the store by means of gold 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:25.330
 another thing that puts play doh for 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:28.000
 get more money but good 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.479
 must be used and therefore the 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.479
 let's do 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.910
 to the triggers good and how it has 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.020
 said here there are no objects because they are the 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.030
 specific for this is that you have to 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.950
 win them in heroic battles 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.580
 in each workshop or there's that of the season 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:53.979
 2 we will have the opportunity to 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.919
 to be able to earn us in each of the 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.409
 heroic battles well then this is what 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.419
 of chapter 2 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.960
 of season 2 that is already 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:08.620
 unlocked 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:12.169
 the new weapon the golden weapon 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.800
 and well, well 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:17.659

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:25.180
 the epic boss is the sugar man 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:31.030
 and then the weapons that they give us 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:34.510
 we can take out in that roulette 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:37.870
