00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.620
 good morning friends martin moro here 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.019
 again with a little like lay like 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.700
 already said I was corrected because 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.570
 I said in the blog earlier earlier 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.570
 when she was younger 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 who commanded the whole blog now says 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.180
 apparently okay again you have or 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.220
 Some have written to me that times 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.640
 I'll do some unboxing with it again 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.830
 should 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.679
 that is of course i do a whole 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.050
 time reviews why do you still want to see 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.140
 how it unpacked itself and outside degree 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.149
 hollow but good for the people with it 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.399
 the car wheels are satisfied 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:48.149
 I got in the package and out 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.910
 I ordered the wwe euroshop 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.840
 simply because there are many things 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.039
 what duty and what extra again 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.710
 steer and so on 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.879
 That saves you everything and everything 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.949
 that's why I thought okay 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.860
 Do not need so much I want three 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.900
 t shirts ordered 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.030
 and you can also like that one 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.860
 buy euro shop and then you need 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.790
 is that I have extra over from america 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.470
 let sail 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.390
 we'll look at the whole thing first 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.299
 strange I found that the whole in 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.549
 the amazon package was sent here 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.770
 This is where you actually get Amazon 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.650
 packages have been issued 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.780
 but apparently because the work 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.430
 probably very close together with Amazon 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.720
 not only what the packaging is about 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.740
 but you can even get a euro 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.600
 shop with his amazon account 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.500
 is not such a stupid idea because the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.610
 But most have such an account and 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.229
 that's why it should be too 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.820
 work so i catch the whole thing 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.180
 team out 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.600
 a bit garbage like the kid 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.480
 Look what else we here without 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.680

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.470
 Two buddies of mine have that now 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.270
 I do not want to advertise 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.369
 I get it for unfortunately goes two 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.899
 I have pals from me as well 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.220
 I have already thought about it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.900
 but that's what I have for something like that 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.320
 me because money because all my money 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.330
 That's why winds get here before me 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.140
 they 're worse off boxing so so 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.140
 looks available 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.750
 four times the title 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.340
 rather it is not yes so I would have 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.900
 i also just be the t shirts 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.070
 then we could have each other 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.840
 case a bit must be saved 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.170

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.580

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:49.590
 and gas what we ordered so carton 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:54.730
 I ordered that for the turner 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:59.489
 here com t-shirt by john cena left here 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.780
 I actually found blue really cool 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.459
 as well as china that i had 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.190
 thought you can do 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:11.680
 then I have the t-shirt of course 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.260
 westermann and the kempinski awesome 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.459
 pacted and shows so ultimately 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.269
 I have now unpacked and here 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:25.860
 spread out we see here 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:31.060
 keycorp t shirt i found myself really cool 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:34.840
 because it is simple and is okay 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:39.760
 far but sometimes was also then 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.209
 part of the cancer campaign here 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.769
 breast cancer campaign kinda like that though 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.590
 also in general I think that's very 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.380
 good slogan and therefore you can 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.790
 The quietly treat back between 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.000
 brittle the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.280
 should she just stand you only have direct 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.660
 get in the bus insurance one 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.000
 kitchen looks like shit how good that 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.910
 depict 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.540
 the guy anyway really hammer at 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.450
 his debut just by view so if he 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.870
 do not know where I was so special 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.030
 event is also similar to the nx thilo 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.410
 with the ewe shirts here is that with the 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.370
 ding again ran 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:31.820
 I can only recommend it 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:34.340
 In any case, I'm looking forward back 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.280
 Looks like it stands for bella 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.540
 every case really cool thing 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.520
 cameraman team and also have kevins 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.229
 and that looks cool when she thought 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.780
 because in the lap is somehow so im 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.210
 plus silver so a bit silvery 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.850
 but they are relatively good here 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.280
 yes so a bit reduced that way 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.440
 bit edited as well as tire marks 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.680
 his no idea looks definite 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:08.080
 so a bit like kevin wood 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:08.080
 or for knock out or for orderly and 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.090
 is the well again with the msc logo 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.490
 also a bit silver on that 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.450
 same design that I already real 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:25.010
 cool, yes, definitely my new 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:27.380
 Three t shirts makes me happy for what's in 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.210
 I will spend the next wm news 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.100
 which certainly also register 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.530
 if you are 100 years old 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.240
 how do they sit like that on you when 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.060
 He certainly in the next issues 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.650
 see 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.380
 that's it then already as I said 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.360
 at airbus the unboxing what some 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.930
 have wished of you if so 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.760
 11 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.060
 because like to give a thumb after 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.190
 above 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.169
 but I'll talk to the rest of you 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.040
 karts and so on the memory in the blogs 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:57.290
 level though because that's really here 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.940
 just such a little thing again 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.510
 in between such a little treat 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.510
 and
