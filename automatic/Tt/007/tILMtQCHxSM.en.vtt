to the same character flaws as anyone

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.080 
to the same character flaws as anyone
else<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:36.140> when<00:01:36.679> tests<00:01:37.310> of<00:01:37.429> faith<00:01:37.580> come<00:01:37.850> along

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
else so when tests of faith come along

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.809 
else so when tests of faith come along
for<00:01:38.360> me<00:01:38.509> on<00:01:39.380> going<00:01:40.039> to<00:01:40.130> act<00:01:40.280> accordingly

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
for me on going to act accordingly

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.880 
for me on going to act accordingly
according<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.479> my<00:01:41.659> own<00:01:41.690> gifts<00:01:42.289> and<00:01:42.500> according

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
according to my own gifts and according

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.670 
according to my own gifts and according
to<00:01:42.979> my<00:01:43.069> own<00:01:45.009> anemic<00:01:46.009> work<00:01:46.280> style

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.340 

so<00:01:50.840> how<00:01:51.840> does<00:01:51.900> one<00:01:52.730> handle<00:01:53.960> test<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> faith

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
so how does one handle test the faith

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.790 
so how does one handle test the faith
they're<00:01:55.620> all<00:01:55.770> individuals<00:01:56.550> so<00:01:56.940> it's<00:01:57.900> very

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
they're all individuals so it's very

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.010 
they're all individuals so it's very
difficult<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.490> say<00:01:59.880> how<00:02:00.270> you're<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.930> to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
difficult to say how you're going to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.640 
difficult to say how you're going to
handle<00:02:01.170> yours<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:03.050> didn't<00:02:04.050> handle<00:02:04.170> mine<00:02:04.440> so

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
handle yours I didn't handle mine so

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.590 
handle yours I didn't handle mine so
well<00:02:04.830> at<00:02:04.950> first<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.729> tend<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.360> very

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.979 
from around I tend to react in very
emotional<00:02:22.140> ways<00:02:23.209> which<00:02:24.209> can<00:02:24.540> seem<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.900> other

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
and it's not it's darn near impossible

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.409 
and it's not it's darn near impossible
to<00:04:17.709> try<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.190> explain<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.519> somebody<00:04:18.789> how<00:04:19.060> their
