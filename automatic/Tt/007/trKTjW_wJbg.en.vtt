00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.470
 Hello 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:33.100
 today is February 16, 2003 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.050
 We are in the port of Tarragona 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.899
 Tarragona is a wonderful city les 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.960
 I invite you to come and meet and here 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:46.100
 in tarragona also his things and I'm going 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.470
 to refer to an interview that was going to be 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.000
 an interview but that was almost a 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.970
 shouting coop on antenna 3 of 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.190
 television of spain in madrid and that 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.500
 also corresponds to other aspects that 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.020
 we have cited in other notes what 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.890
 it was the sixth 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.500
 there I saw how two doctors know that 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.220
 they faced laura tous that the only 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.550
 person in this world that has healed 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.940
 of chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia and in 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.300
 multiple chemical sensitivity that now 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.720
 has been increased with the pol problem of 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.520
 the all this from the electricity of the 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.890
 whiskeys 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.190
 computer in the blood 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.180
 all that causes the same effects and as 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:40.260
 says the work all that sensitivity to a 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.600
 amount of phenomena that you do not have 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.380
 electronics that is creating problems 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.470
 very serious in good humanity the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.680
 Most doctors 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.560
 here we give not to say almost everything if 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.980
 restrictions apply unaware of the subject 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.560
 of the sea water we are working 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.810
 the first thing that he does not know 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.689
 who were the Nobel prizes or 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.750
 towards noble prize that discovered the 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:17.660
 cellular respiration in 1931 another tree 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:20.200
 Nobel Prize twice in 1952 1964 and what 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.920
 more serious is that academics 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.319
 especially that's what they're called 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.099
 biological sciences that science does not 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:31.250
 they have nothing those implicit ones are about 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.880
 ladies who ignored rené quintón a 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.450
 person who led to discover that all 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.989
 vertebrates including academics 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.849
 and all marine mammals and us 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:50.299
 we are sea water and good sotol which is 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:54.019
 what all these people who think so 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.410
 wise and so knowledgeable of quantity of 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.780
 formulas 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.970
 there are a number of things that I also 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.010
 I studied all that I hope I do not 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.350
 interested and has not entered my head 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.590
 because what you have to do is observe 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.630
 the facts of nature under the 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.930
 commonsense prism that fails to 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.450
 the academic restrictions apply already 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.360
 all for the people who are in the 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.390
 guilds and that are the culprits that 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.740
 it's better business to take care of the disease 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.780
 to take care of my health and I'm going to tell you 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.170
 most of these people when they 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.000
 they name the sea water is horrified 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.870
 they say barbarities like those that said 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.760
 in the program 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.780
 public mirror antenna 3 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.549
 in the sixth where they told me everything 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.159
 I want to tell you that you do not know 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.010
 fundamentals of what are the laws of 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.739
 the constancy of the internal environment and they 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.470
 they say to start that the sea water 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.810
 is contaminated that is for the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:01.560
 meetings that produce failure 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.340
 renal and second or fran or baby 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.019
 he goes crazy and then he dies all that is 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.540
 false 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.170
 false 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.590
 false 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.019
 and are unable to come and discuss it 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.180
 personally with us because it is 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.150
 impossible that it should be added 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.910
 pollute something else in the pollution with 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.850
 the germs of terrestrial origin 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.280
 that dare to entertain that the water of 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:35.639
 sea ​​is diuretic that people who are going to 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.849
 urinate more against all the barbarities 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.849
 what the academics say 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.610
 medical restrictions apply that 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.949
 The kidneys have no idea 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.929
 have never tasted what water is 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.409
 have not done all the 

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:55.169
 investigations that we have done 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.209
 under the ethics protocols of the 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.029
 European Community 

00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:04.229
 we have practiced them all in tenerife 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:07.139
 with the university of tenerife in tenerife 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.939
 a hospital in the lagoon then 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.339
 we have been shipwrecked 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:14.179
 volunteers we have shown that we can 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:16.800
 survive in the sea ​​water in the 

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:19.409
 completely over there in the ocean drinking 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.849
 only seawater and we have 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.209
 survived 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.850
 let's say forgiveness in the word to 

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:31.420
 any of the scientists 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:34.750
 programs that are a psychiatrist and a 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.180
 doctor nutritionist of the doctor sum 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:42.110
 cum laude in the complutense of which I 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:44.839
 I'm also a PhD student besides being 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.870
 belonging to the American association 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:49.460
 of nutritionists 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.440
 and that is not the case of coming here to 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.770
 to presume is the case of saying that what 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.250
 I have behind is a place where 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.280
 slices of tarragona flow into the 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.470
 port and I have the way to prove it and 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.850
 like the beach we need another day 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:11.960
 It was full of poop and people have not 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.450
 dead for being bathing in everything 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.670
 what they say would be salmonella 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.689
 alcohol and all those stories are going to 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.219
 burn 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.219
 after water of grace
