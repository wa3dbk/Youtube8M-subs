from the other mechanics it's very

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.080 
from the other mechanics it's very
important<00:00:29.289> for<00:00:29.320> people<00:00:29.619> to<00:00:29.830> be<00:00:30.010> honest<00:00:30.939> to

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
each other the reason it's hard is that

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.329 
each other the reason it's hard is that
people<00:00:35.170> don't<00:00:35.320> want<00:00:35.530> to<00:00:35.590> Barrett<00:00:35.890> each<00:00:36.040> other

people to take chances save people to
tell<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> truth<00:00:52.019> I<00:00:52.350> know<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.949> people<00:00:53.100> try<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
tell the truth I know that people try to

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.780 
tell the truth I know that people try to
do<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> right<00:00:56.100> thing<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:57.570> will<00:00:57.720> try<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.790> avoid

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
do the right thing you will try to avoid

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.930 
do the right thing you will try to avoid
taking<00:01:00.089> big<00:01:00.570> risks<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:02.309> things<00:01:02.610> can

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
taking big risks because that things can

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.210 
taking big risks because that things can
happen<00:01:03.259> so<00:01:04.259> they<00:01:04.409> try<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.040> safe<00:01:05.909> path<00:01:07.130> or<00:01:08.130> if

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
happen so they try to a safe path or if

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.660 
happen so they try to a safe path or if
they<00:01:08.369> Harvey<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.090> Harvey<00:01:09.740> said

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
they Harvey or Harvey said

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.149 
they Harvey or Harvey said
so<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.960> keeps<00:01:13.229> trying<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.650> safe<00:01:13.860> all<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
so one keeps trying to be safe all the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.220 
so one keeps trying to be safe all the
time

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
time

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.920

before it's done what if everybody does
it<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.390> then<00:02:24.570> get<00:02:24.660> used<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
it and then get used to it and the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.190 
it and then get used to it and the
environment<00:02:26.130> becomes<00:02:26.580> more<00:02:26.820> creative<00:02:27.420> then

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
environment becomes more creative then

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.580 
environment becomes more creative then
the<00:02:28.350> other<00:02:28.470> thing<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:30.060> group<00:02:30.590> has

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the other thing is that that group has

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.370 
the other thing is that that group has
to<00:02:31.860> trust<00:02:32.160> each<00:02:32.370> other<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:33.060> be<00:02:33.209> honest<00:02:33.630> and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
to trust each other to be honest and

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.170 
to trust each other to be honest and
that<00:02:34.590> takes<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:35.010> while<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.370> develop<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.820> trust

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
that takes a while to develop that trust

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.530 
that takes a while to develop that trust
they<00:02:36.660> have<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.900> go<00:02:37.020> through<00:02:37.050> several<00:02:37.470> projects

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
they have to go through several projects

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.860 
they have to go through several projects
deleting<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:40.440> everything<00:02:41.190> they<00:02:41.310> do<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.870> is

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
deleting that everything they do is is

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.330 
deleting that everything they do is is
for<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.380> interest<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> other<00:02:44.100> person

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
for the interest to the other person

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.699 
for the interest to the other person
Tommy<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.510> put<00:02:45.780> your<00:02:45.900> tension<00:02:46.290> hai

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
Tommy then you put your tension hai

Tommy then you put your tension hai
should<00:02:46.920> wait<00:02:47.070> without<00:02:47.220> either<00:02:47.550> one<00:02:47.700> part<00:02:48.230> did

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
should wait without either one part did

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.810 
should wait without either one part did

you go to the neighbor bunny judge

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.479 
you go to the neighbor bunny judge
 mum<00:02:51.709> but<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.830> culture<00:02:53.160> we've<00:02:53.310> had

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
 mum but the culture we've had

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.600 
 mum but the culture we've had
is

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
is

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.120 
is
there<00:02:55.210> is<00:02:55.360> not<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.600> strong<00:02:55.930> competition<00:02:56.560> with

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
there is not a strong competition with

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.480 
there is not a strong competition with
each<00:02:57.160> other<00:02:58.050> because<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.410> realization<00:03:00.190> is

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
each other because the realization is

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.490 
each other because the realization is
that<00:03:00.910> we<00:03:02.010> succeed<00:03:03.010> or<00:03:03.550> fail<00:03:04.260> ultimately<00:03:05.260> with

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
that we succeed or fail ultimately with

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.540 
that we succeed or fail ultimately with
our<00:03:05.650> film<00:03:06.150> depend<00:03:07.150> upon<00:03:07.390> whether<00:03:07.630> not<00:03:07.930> leave

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
our film depend upon whether not leave

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.010 
our film depend upon whether not leave
so<00:03:10.550> if<00:03:10.910> anybody<00:03:11.240> has<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.420> notion<00:03:11.930> that

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
so if anybody has the notion that

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.810 
so if anybody has the notion that
they're<00:03:12.230> competing<00:03:12.740> for<00:03:12.920> something<00:03:13.520> against

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
they're competing for something against

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.860 
they're competing for something against
somebody<00:03:14.090> else

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
somebody else

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.340 
somebody else
ultimately<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.040> film
