00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.330
 Well congratulate the actor with a victory I 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:19.550
 I think that the era of heat was very 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:21.800
 nice fast goals exchanged and 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.919
 ira was in the markets on the swing who will score 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.230
 second ball but we missed the mistakes 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.599
 there is a second ball and then it would start 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.509
 I had to risk it at all 2 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.690
 attackers tried to make a difference 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:40.120
 Well, they missed a counterattack. 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.120
 the same as 21 that 3164 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:48.260
 Overall I am very satisfied with the team 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.320
 one simple reason because faith is not 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.570
 had enough time for teamwork to 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.949
 of understanding 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.690
 if this era would be a week through 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.699
 two probably would have been better 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.469
 why because we are just like 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.220
 Russian doesn't have enough time for 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.930
 teamwork we have five new players 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.040
 well it's okay i think that 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.070
 the progress is visible in the team 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.460
 so here I am, on the whole, satisfied 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:22.310
 although lost 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:24.500
 the harmonica was torn there by new well yes there 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.340
 when with the ball hit he stretched it 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.870
 just ugly when I'm a football player 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.820
 let's say lama core football player meal 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.670
 fit and shake hands with each other and 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.040
 glad that they killed Yarmolenko che 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.760
 rejoice and last want to talk about 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.700
 judging 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.560
 i never talked about judging but 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.460
 excuse me first they said that 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.610
 mixed up surkis was president 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.560
 federation it was judging favor 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.850
 brother 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.960
 now say mihilovich probably not 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.550
 involved in this process but such 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.740
 judging I think it is not 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.780
 Corresponds to the level of probably that heat 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.600
 this fight of those teams which today 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.560
 went to the football field 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.369
 the judge honestly didnâ€™t impress 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.369
 let's talk so softly
