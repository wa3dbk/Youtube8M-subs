00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.160 
castor oil every night and I Flatiron my
hair<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:30.970> know<00:03:31.000> whenever<00:03:31.300> he<00:03:31.600> starts<00:03:31.960> waving

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
hair you know whenever he starts waving

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.530 
hair you know whenever he starts waving
up<00:03:32.500> or<00:03:32.950> looking<00:03:33.340> frizzy<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.180> guess<00:03:34.390> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
up or looking frizzy and I guess the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.270 
up or looking frizzy and I guess the
castor<00:03:34.930> oil<00:03:34.960> keeps<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.650> from<00:03:35.800> getting<00:03:35.950> heat

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
castor oil keeps it from getting heat

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.050 
castor oil keeps it from getting heat
damaged<00:03:36.730> um<00:03:37.890> but<00:03:38.890> for<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.160> most<00:03:39.310> part<00:03:39.460> with

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
damaged um but for the most part with

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.180 
damaged um but for the most part with
the<00:03:40.210> flat<00:03:40.450> iron<00:03:40.480> my<00:03:40.810> hair<00:03:41.110> just<00:03:41.260> gets<00:03:41.470> like
