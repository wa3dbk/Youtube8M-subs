actually one is that we give a lot of

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.260 
actually one is that we give a lot of
performance<00:03:07.200> opportunity<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.069> don't<00:03:09.060> know<00:03:09.150> of

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
performance opportunity I don't know of

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.559 
performance opportunity I don't know of
any<00:03:09.450> other<00:03:09.569> school<00:03:10.050> where<00:03:10.349> the

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
any other school where the

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.780 
any other school where the
dancers<00:03:10.959> perform<00:03:11.469> as<00:03:11.709> often<00:03:12.010> as<00:03:12.219> our<00:03:12.370> dancers

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
dancers perform as often as our dancers

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.879 
dancers perform as often as our dancers
do<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.329> becomes<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:14.049> little<00:03:14.079> overwhelming<00:03:14.829> but

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
do it becomes a little overwhelming but

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.119 
do it becomes a little overwhelming but
I<00:03:15.010> think<00:03:15.249> it's<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.430> great<00:03:15.959> opportunity<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:18.040> sort

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
I think it's a great opportunity to sort

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:19.440 
I think it's a great opportunity to sort
of<00:03:18.280> prepare<00:03:18.639> yourself<00:03:19.030> from<00:03:19.209> what<00:03:19.329> it's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
of prepare yourself from what it's

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.420 
of prepare yourself from what it's
really<00:03:19.749> like<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.230> can<00:03:20.349> be<00:03:20.439> very<00:03:20.469> grueling<00:03:21.040> the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
really like it can be very grueling the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.610 
really like it can be very grueling the
rehearsal<00:03:21.969> process<00:03:22.090> can<00:03:22.480> be<00:03:22.569> grueling<00:03:22.810> but

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
rehearsal process can be grueling but

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.530 
rehearsal process can be grueling but
that's<00:03:24.459> what<00:03:24.549> dancers<00:03:24.939> do<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.269> that's<00:03:25.389> what

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
that's what dancers do and that's what

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.360 
that's what dancers do and that's what
we<00:03:25.629> love<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.840> do<00:03:26.139> so<00:03:26.950> there<00:03:27.069> are<00:03:27.129> a<00:03:27.189> lot<00:03:27.340> of

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.649 
we love to do so there are a lot of
opportunities<00:03:28.120> there's<00:03:28.359> also<00:03:28.510> an

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
opportunities there's also an

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.809 
opportunities there's also an
expectation<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.379> professionalism<00:03:30.099> which<00:03:30.670> i

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
expectation of professionalism which i

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.759

think<00:03:30.879> is<00:03:31.269> very<00:03:31.329> valuable<00:03:31.959> when<00:03:32.439> college

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
think is very valuable when college

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:33.839 
think is very valuable when college
students<00:03:33.040> go<00:03:33.129> out<00:03:33.250> into<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.579> real

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849

behave as professionals and then there's

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.179 
behave as professionals and then there's
also<00:03:39.999> this<00:03:40.299> idea<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.810> diversity<00:03:41.439> one<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.069> our
