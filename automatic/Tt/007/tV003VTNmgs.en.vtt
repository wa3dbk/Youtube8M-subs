in<00:00:04.740> one<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.040> previous<00:00:05.430> chapters<00:00:05.879> we're

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
in one of the previous chapters we're

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.909 
in one of the previous chapters we're
here<00:00:06.390> at<00:00:06.480> this<00:00:06.600> location<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:07.440> were<00:00:07.500> talking

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
here at this location we were talking

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.770 
here at this location we were talking
about<00:00:07.980> composition<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.240> how<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.570> could

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
about composition and how we could

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.020 
about composition and how we could
create<00:00:09.960> different<00:00:10.500> images<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.280> context

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
create different images in this context

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.089 
create different images in this context
well<00:00:12.690> because<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.559> thought<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.009> would

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
well because of that I thought it would

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.250 
well because of that I thought it would
be<00:00:14.219> fitting<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.910> talk<00:00:15.120> about<00:00:15.420> how<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.929> work

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
be fitting to talk about how we can work

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.740 
be fitting to talk about how we can work
with<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.740> handle<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.430> hold<00:00:17.730> our<00:00:17.970> camera<00:00:18.449> when

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
with and handle and hold our camera when

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.750 
with and handle and hold our camera when
we're<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.050> location<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.189> location<00:00:20.550> like

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
we're on location in a location like

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.090 
we're on location in a location like
this<00:00:21.240> one<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> first<00:00:22.619> things<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.010> you

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
this one of the first things that you

this one of the first things that you
want<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.310> consider<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.779> when<00:00:24.990> you're

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
want to consider is that when you're

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.769 
want to consider is that when you're
shooting<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:26.519> want<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:27.119> create<00:00:27.449> or

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
shooting you want to really create or

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
hold your camera in a way so you can

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.730 
hold your camera in a way so you can
create<00:00:29.640> sharp<00:00:30.060> photographs<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:31.410> if<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.619> have

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
create sharp photographs now if I have

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.530 
create sharp photographs now if I have
my<00:00:31.890> camera<00:00:32.160> way<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:32.669> here<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.120> gonna<00:00:33.239> shake

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
my camera way out here it's gonna shake

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.090 
my camera way out here it's gonna shake
a<00:00:33.600> little<00:00:33.840> bit<00:00:34.050> there's<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> lot<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.680> strain<00:00:35.070> on

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
a little bit there's a lot of strain on

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.119 
a little bit there's a lot of strain on
my<00:00:35.370> arm<00:00:35.579> yet<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.600> i<00:00:36.840> anchor<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.680> top<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
my arm yet if i anchor it in the top of

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.160 
my arm yet if i anchor it in the top of
my<00:00:38.250> ribcage<00:00:38.460> there<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.059> chest<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.960> going

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
my ribcage there in my chest it's going

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.080 
my ribcage there in my chest it's going
to<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.710> solid<00:00:40.980> position<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> can

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
to be a really solid position so I can

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.990 
to be a really solid position so I can
hold<00:00:42.390> my<00:00:42.629> camera<00:00:42.770> firmly<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.760> create

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
hold my camera firmly I can then create

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.569 
hold my camera firmly I can then create
sharp<00:00:45.510> photographs<00:00:46.020> another<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.399> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
sharp photographs another way to do this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.110 
sharp photographs another way to do this
is<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.000> wrap<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:49.739> camera<00:00:50.250> strap<00:00:50.879> around

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
is to wrap your your camera strap around

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.060 
is to wrap your your camera strap around
your<00:00:51.360> hand<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.840> by<00:00:51.930> wrapping<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.530> around<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
your hand and by wrapping it around that

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.619 
your hand and by wrapping it around that
and<00:00:53.280> creating<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.820> anchor<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.449> can

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and creating that anchor you can

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.150 
and creating that anchor you can
one-hand<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.410> camera<00:00:55.770> much<00:00:55.920> more

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
one-hand your camera much more

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.099 
one-hand your camera much more
effectively<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.420> will<00:00:57.570> prevent<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.079> from

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
effectively this will prevent you from

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.349 
effectively this will prevent you from
dropping<00:00:58.800> your<00:00:58.920> camera<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.789> also<00:00:59.879> will<00:01:00.210> give

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
dropping your camera it also will give

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.760 
dropping your camera it also will give
you<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.780> bit<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> an<00:01:01.079> edge<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.559> can

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you a little bit of an edge so you can

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.439 
you a little bit of an edge so you can
move<00:01:01.949> around<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.399> some<00:01:02.579> unique<00:01:02.850> ways<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.359> then

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
move around in some unique ways and then

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.109 
move around in some unique ways and then
anchor<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.140> fire<00:01:04.439> away<00:01:04.760> what<00:01:05.760> about<00:01:05.970> those

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
anchor and fire away what about those

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.109 
anchor and fire away what about those
situations<00:01:06.470> when<00:01:07.470> you're<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.860> shooting<00:01:08.189> well

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
situations when you're not shooting well

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.700 
situations when you're not shooting well

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
is pointing outward well that is an

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.569 
is pointing outward well that is an
accident<00:01:28.500> waiting<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.009> happen<00:01:29.100> eventually

so that it points into the small of your
back<00:01:39.110> another<00:01:40.110> thing<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.829> to

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
back another thing that you can do to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.819 
back another thing that you can do to
protect<00:01:41.159> your<00:01:41.549> camera<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.290> use<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.619> lens

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
protect your camera is to use the lens

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.340 
protect your camera is to use the lens
hood<00:01:44.100> now<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> lens<00:01:45.030> hood<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.540> intended<00:01:46.320> to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
hood now the lens hood is intended to

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.590 
hood now the lens hood is intended to
stop<00:01:46.890> light<00:01:47.250> from<00:01:47.579> hitting<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.090> lens<00:01:48.329> so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
stop light from hitting the lens so

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.690 
stop light from hitting the lens so
there<00:01:48.750> isn't<00:01:49.020> any<00:01:49.140> kind<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.439> strange

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
there isn't any kind of strange

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.800 
there isn't any kind of strange
refraction<00:01:50.700> or<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.000> don't<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> lens<00:01:51.540> flare

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
refraction or you don't get a lens flare

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749 
refraction or you don't get a lens flare
so<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.500> use<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.890> typically<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.399> those

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
so you use this typically for those

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.120 
so you use this typically for those
reasons<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.869> keep<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.619> camera<00:01:55.979> all

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
reasons but I keep this on my camera all

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.280 
reasons but I keep this on my camera all
the<00:01:56.189> time<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.850> here's<00:01:57.030> why<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.600> almost

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the time and here's why I almost

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.219 
the time and here's why I almost
consider<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.130> lens<00:01:59.430> cap<00:01:59.780> because<00:02:00.780> with

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
consider it my lens cap because with

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.230 
consider it my lens cap because with
this<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.979> camera<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.610> front<00:02:03.000> lens

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
this on the camera that front lens

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.260 
this on the camera that front lens
element<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.409> protected<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.880> my<00:02:06.030> case

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
element is so protected and in my case

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.389 
element is so protected and in my case
I've<00:02:06.479> unfortunately<00:02:06.780> dropped<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.979> couple<00:02:08.310> of

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
I've unfortunately dropped a couple of

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.749 
I've unfortunately dropped a couple of
my<00:02:08.520> lenses<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> few<00:02:09.239> times<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.110> has<00:02:10.349> seen

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
my lenses a few times and this has seen

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.640 
my lenses a few times and this has seen
leave<00:02:10.849> those<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.569> while<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:11.810> dropped<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.409> again

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
leave those so while I dropped it again

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.679 
leave those so while I dropped it again
it<00:02:12.769> hit<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.400> scratched<00:02:14.090> or<00:02:14.360> broke<00:02:14.540> the

it hit that and scratched or broke the

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.460 
it hit that and scratched or broke the
lens<00:02:14.900> hood<00:02:15.170> rather<00:02:15.980> than<00:02:16.189> the<00:02:16.340> lens<00:02:16.579> itself

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
lens hood rather than the lens itself

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.530 
lens hood rather than the lens itself
the<00:02:18.470> last<00:02:18.709> little<00:02:19.159> extra<00:02:19.579> kind<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.909> bonus<00:02:20.269> tip

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
the last little extra kind of bonus tip

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.210 
the last little extra kind of bonus tip
that<00:02:21.170> I've<00:02:21.319> learned<00:02:21.620> from<00:02:21.860> some<00:02:22.069> of<00:02:22.099> my

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
that I've learned from some of my

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.580 
that I've learned from some of my
friends<00:02:22.700> for<00:02:22.790> our<00:02:22.849> journalists<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:24.349> try<00:02:24.560> to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
friends for our journalists is to try to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.339 
friends for our journalists is to try to
make<00:02:24.860> my<00:02:25.099> camera<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.939> bit<00:02:26.329> more<00:02:26.540> nondescript

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
make my camera a bit more nondescript

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:28.930 
make my camera a bit more nondescript
and<00:02:27.650> there's<00:02:27.769> a<00:02:27.860> couple<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.280> ways<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.459> we<00:02:28.700> can

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
and there's a couple of ways that we can

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.180 
and there's a couple of ways that we can
do<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.360> one<00:02:29.629> is<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:30.260> could<00:02:30.440> use<00:02:30.470> some<00:02:30.829> gaffer

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
do that one is we could use some gaffer

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.699 
do that one is we could use some gaffer
tape<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.579> cover<00:02:31.819> up<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.209> logo<00:02:32.629> so<00:02:32.659> again<00:02:33.140> it's

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
tape to cover up the logo so again it's

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.589 
tape to cover up the logo so again it's
just<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:34.099> camera<00:02:34.579> you're<00:02:34.760> not<00:02:34.970> really<00:02:35.239> paying

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
just a camera you're not really paying

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.990 
just a camera you're not really paying
attention<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:36.110> what<00:02:36.379> brand<00:02:36.709> or<00:02:37.129> model<00:02:37.760> it<00:02:37.849> is

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
attention to what brand or model it is

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.569 
attention to what brand or model it is
but<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.599> makes<00:02:38.629> it<00:02:38.930> more<00:02:39.079> nondescript<00:02:39.769> another

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
but it makes it more nondescript another

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.970 
but it makes it more nondescript another
way<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.849> do<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.239> is<00:02:41.480> how<00:02:41.810> we<00:02:41.870> interact<00:02:42.829> with

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
way to do that is how we interact with

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.280 
way to do that is how we interact with
our<00:02:43.129> camera<00:02:43.700> sometimes<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:45.019> bring<00:02:45.170> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
our camera sometimes you can bring a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.599 
our camera sometimes you can bring a
camera<00:02:45.530> out<00:02:45.739> so<00:02:45.920> you're<00:02:46.069> really<00:02:46.340> drawing

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
camera out so you're really drawing

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.330 
camera out so you're really drawing
attention<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:47.239> it<00:02:47.510> or<00:02:48.109> you<00:02:48.829> can<00:02:48.980> kind<00:02:49.159> of<00:02:49.220> hide

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
attention to it or you can kind of hide

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.309 
attention to it or you can kind of hide
it<00:02:49.519> behind<00:02:49.639> your<00:02:49.909> back<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.480> that's<00:02:50.900> what<00:02:51.109> some

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
it behind your back and that's what some

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.899 
it behind your back and that's what some
of<00:02:51.349> those<00:02:51.470> great<00:02:51.799> journalists<00:02:52.370> do<00:02:52.489> they<00:02:52.670> talk

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
of those great journalists do they talk

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.160 
of those great journalists do they talk
with<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.359> don't<00:02:53.450> even<00:02:53.690> really<00:02:53.810> know<00:02:53.989> they

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
with you you don't even really know they

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.020 
with you you don't even really know they
have<00:02:54.379> a<00:02:54.409> camera<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.159> then<00:02:55.489> they<00:02:55.579> bring<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.940> out

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
have a camera and then they bring it out

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.610 
have a camera and then they bring it out
take<00:02:56.359> a<00:02:56.389> couple<00:02:56.659> pictures<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:57.530> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
take a couple pictures and then the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.160 
take a couple pictures and then the
camera<00:02:58.010> goes<00:02:58.190> away<00:02:58.549> so<00:02:59.510> we<00:02:59.690> want<00:02:59.870> to<00:02:59.959> try<00:03:00.109> to

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
camera goes away so we want to try to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.930 
camera goes away so we want to try to
figure<00:03:00.440> out<00:03:00.590> how<00:03:00.859> it<00:03:01.040> can<00:03:01.159> work<00:03:01.370> with<00:03:01.879> our

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
figure out how it can work with our

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.240 
figure out how it can work with our
camera<00:03:02.480> of<00:03:02.599> course<00:03:02.629> to<00:03:03.200> create<00:03:03.440> sharp<00:03:03.739> images

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
camera of course to create sharp images

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.780 
camera of course to create sharp images
but<00:03:05.030> also<00:03:05.170> how<00:03:06.170> we<00:03:06.200> can<00:03:06.349> handle<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.220> hold<00:03:07.489> our

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
but also how we can handle and hold our

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.210 
but also how we can handle and hold our
camera<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:08.989> it<00:03:09.139> can<00:03:09.290> help<00:03:09.500> us<00:03:09.680> connect

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
camera so that it can help us connect

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.069 
camera so that it can help us connect
with<00:03:10.340> our<00:03:10.549> subjects<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.239> we<00:03:11.329> can<00:03:11.480> draw<00:03:11.780> our

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
with our subjects so we can draw our

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.289 
with our subjects so we can draw our
subject<00:03:12.530> out<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.010> create<00:03:13.670> interesting

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
subject out and create interesting
