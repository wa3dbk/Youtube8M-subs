00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.859
 maxim hi hi all hi hamachi 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.809
 say hi andryukha hi all 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.440
 start max let's take off by 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.650
 I tell everyone hello, which means my 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.890
 studio that sound bear city reutov 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:23.640
 late late evening late evening this 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.010
 two vaz 2114 one of the cars which 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.330
 participates in the top 10 loudest systems 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.340
 Moscow and Moscow region 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.090
 at the moment this car is on 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 tenth place which means here we have 2 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.020
 tag for two or three means here now 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 It is worth it as if we were but narrow 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.660
 12k audio yes that means you can 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.870
 animate on the form that there are disabled and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.410
 terminals that go to the subs and this 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.440
 due to the fact that we are testing today 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:04.110
 new this is an amplifier kings olgerd tcp 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:06.420
 one nice little amplifier is very 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.790
 cute watch case harmonious 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.740
 copy 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.990
 12 graphics reduce it gave exactly 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.180
 like a reduced copy of 12 kilowatts on you 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.520
 but actually we decided right away 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.680
 put it in that car 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.170
 test itself in his work 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.990
 first in 05 mind but here real 06 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.210
 it turns out the resistance of the coils and how 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.479
 See what man gives such a cut in 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.799
 this system is closely related to the system 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.490
 calculated under the power of the leader 20 amps 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.840
 mehman or three batteries reaches them 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.909
 xp 2000 up for now small stock 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.220
 so say about what result we 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.689
 was with channel 12 from nickname 152 there are 152 and 6 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.890
 so accordingly today we 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.939
 we test its copy in the reduced format 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.490
 Yes, that is, the manufacturer request 1800 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.040
 water watt 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.689
 at 14 volts oh i think we will 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.619
 very close to this application 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.870
 but here are hours of sleep for making a video like this 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:27.800
 you will have to happen so keep 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:33.650
 the camera so so and still we have to ticks 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.530
 are there any accounts of luck on this floor machines 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.370
 performed at the top 10 will also be 50 to 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.370
 me tight 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:55.549
 help in the same pose as on the top 10 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:55.549
 crown can be plus decibel 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.250
 well that's what we have we have a hundred forty 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.280
 seven and seven 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:17.130
 let's go 50 slowly 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:24.480
 let's see what there is with the power voltage 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:30.300
 like 477 by 23 4 means we look at the amplifier 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.050
 gave one and three things but what 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:38.790
 resistance 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:41.569
 let's get 47 23 4 and now focus on 2 and 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.569
 3 kilowatts 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.900
 ok something per hour . 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.950
 it turns out if we turn the little books 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:01.500
 manufacturer which gives us the alphabet 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:03.299
 here we have written means 2 ohm y 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.570
 So it turns out to us up to 2 or ohm 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.250
 amplifiers they gave 950 from us she gave 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.859
 well yes but whether it is bids themselves 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.780
 publish on 12 here we have our 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.890
 nutrition canada we need to refer here 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:19.229
 it will be for 14 volts that is 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:23.400
 I get an amplifier, I think it's 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:25.260
 one of the successful amplifiers well we are shorter 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.000
 happy with this amplifier yes we are very 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.010
 satisfied come on maybe be over 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.350
 the club are trying to lower the Avars try 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.350
 lower 35 is the same as come on 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.960
 so what is honest then 30 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.960
 or 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.310
 this 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:36.360
 so on 35 chair 47.3 stick-tree again 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.650
 normally 140 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:45.930
 hear me guys do not understand the dishes 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:50.400
 you are cheating you are cheating a little bit like something on 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:55.199
 a2 a2 this smoothie mites 40 and five 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:06:02.449
 vampire same excellence 205 by 46 and 240 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:05.009
 . 540. 5 to improve 240 6.2 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:06.330
 Well , he and his own girls 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.509
 miracle you definition full 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:16.169
 resistance 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:24.259
 hours 6 2 no 40.5 Andryukh bloody 46. 2 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:24.259
 divided by 40. 546. 2 divide by 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:37.400
 separate 111 this promises but the court 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.560
 projectile here it is the most real 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.050
 the result is less because we shot 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:47.600
 not and but not combat it is clear this is food 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:50.420
 it's nines voiced okay what is it 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:55.900
 the stock is past the mulch come on 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.900
 test this video okay good
