00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:19.669
 To paint carnations we will use round brushes 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.490
 We can choose two ways 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.769
 one of them 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.119
 is to load 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.409
 all that is the brush minus the tip in white 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.320
 and the tip in red 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.870
 we are situated 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.200
 the brushstroke 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.600
 we place it again in vertical 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.660
 we go back a little 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.350
 we move to both sides 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.260
 right left and you can see how your hair is opening 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.360
 now 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.670
 ascend 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.710
 and when descending we will raise the brush 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.990
 This is with the white inside and the red tip 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.380
 let's do the opposite now 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.400
 we load first 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.130
 red without touching the tip 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.760
 we load the tip of white 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.810
 again 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.550
 we put ourselves in vertical 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.610
 we go back a little 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.260
 we move to the left 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.570
 we move forward and when we go back we raise the brush 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.150
 everything will depend on which fund we are going to use if the fund is clear if the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.049
 dark background 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.970
 the carnation we are going to paint it in profile and we are going to put five petals 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.030
 we put 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.230
 let's do for example the red with the white tip 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.230
 let's go 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.110
 three petals then two and then one 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.630
 then we start with the center 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.110
 we are situated 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.669
 we go down a bit we open 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.989
 we advance 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.259
 and we raise 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.439
 we reload 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.399
 for the next brushstroke we make it 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.359
 on the left 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.159
 we put here 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.979
 we go back a bit, we move forward 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.079
 and we go back 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.799
 we reload 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.259
 trying not to touch the tip 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.699
 the tip of white color 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.609
 and now we are on the right 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.829
 we are here we go back a little 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.559
 we move 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:54.579
 we advance and we go back to back we have three, between each two we will put one 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:02.419
 we reload 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:06.159
 minus the tip is charged all 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.139
 the white tip 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.609
 and we are between the two on the left 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.179
 a little lower 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.269
 we go back a bit, we open, right, left 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.969
 we advance if we raise again we load red again 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:29.879
 we raise again 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.779
 we download a little 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.859
 white tip 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.399
 we are on this side 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:41.870
 we go back 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.870
 to the right and to the left the brush hairs are opened we advance and again we rewrite it makes sense to continue working 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.679
 and now the last petal we will put between these two 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:58.399
 again below 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:03.189
 the white tip and we stand a little lower 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:09.599
 we go back a little we open to the right we move forward and we go back 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:16.090
 how are the leaves of the carnations 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.319
 They are green and thin 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:22.419
 let's put two tones 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.919
 a light green 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.159
 dark green forgiveness and light green 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.400
 in this case 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.979
 we continue with the round brush 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.969
 but instead of charging as we have done before, we charge 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:41.449
 on the right the clear 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.610
 to the left the dark 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.550
 the sepals of the carnation 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.809
 encloses 

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:50.849
 to the key 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.809
 let's leave the right the clear 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:54.249
 we place the 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:55.319
 we support apalstamos 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:02.319
 and we are raising 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:12.360
 and now we come to the other side 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.759
 we give and raise 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.009
 again 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:25.009
 we place crush 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:36.249
 let's go 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:38.139
 now let's make the stem 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.409
 the same 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:47.409
 download and reload 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:50.199
 it's longer we need more paint 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:55.349
 let's go 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.249
 to make the leaves 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.960
 we continue using the round brush 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.430
 we are going upwards 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.059
 crushing it 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:10.529
 we stopped 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.639
 we change sense 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:20.639
 and we ended up on tip 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.789
 now to the other side 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:33.789
 we are leaving the light color on the right 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:35.339
 we raise 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:37.490
 a little 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:44.490
 we make a change of direction 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.080
 this is the carnation 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.389
 the fast tolosarra to internet indigenous dances what interests me is to win 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.479
 we can choose two famous one of them 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.839

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:07.149
 everything I've felt the route 5 paco 

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:10.180
 the tip in color 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.059
 we put the brushstroke 

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.319
 lula cited both in this case 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.369

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:29.389
 ascend 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:34.430
 and when descending they will go further raising the 15 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.599
 this time with the front bow the pointed pile indicated 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:44.110
 let's do the opposite 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.129
 we earn money 

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:50.839
 working without touching the tip 

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:54.499
 we won the tip yes 

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:55.520

 encloses 

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.330
 to the key 

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.310
 let's leave the right clarified 

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.740
 we place the tip 

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.690
 we support here we are pulling 

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:36.880

 downloading your little 

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:46.130
 and now we came with the tri 

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.770
 for the central table 

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:10.770

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.880
 years in this sense
