00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the actual notes in them are as I'm

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.080 
the actual notes in them are as I'm
doing<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.350> I'll<00:00:52.559> play<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> bit<00:00:53.100> quickly

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
doing this I'll play a bit quickly

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.240 
doing this I'll play a bit quickly
charted<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.660> play<00:00:55.020> bit<00:00:55.199> more<00:00:55.440> quickly<00:00:55.800> charted

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
charted I play bit more quickly charted

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.220 
charted I play bit more quickly charted
aight<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.610> lot<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.480> songs<00:00:57.690> have<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> lot<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
aight a lot of songs have a lot of

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.319 
aight a lot of songs have a lot of
repetition<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:59.100> them<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.059> write<00:01:00.180> up

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
repetition in them so you can write up

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.849 
repetition in them so you can write up
the<00:01:00.420> chord<00:01:00.660> progression<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.350> then<00:01:01.530> figure

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the chord progression and then figure

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
the chord progression and then figure
out<00:01:01.890> how<00:01:02.039> many<00:01:02.100> times<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.609> repeats<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.530> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
out how many times it repeats on the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 
out how many times it repeats on the
third<00:01:04.769> listen<00:01:05.250> I'll<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.909> check<00:01:06.180> my<00:01:06.420> chart<00:01:06.720> so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
third listen I'll just check my chart so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.080 
third listen I'll just check my chart so
I'll<00:01:07.260> play<00:01:07.500> along<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> chart<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> make

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
I'll play along with the chart and make

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.520 
I'll play along with the chart and make
sure<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:09.510> I've<00:01:09.600> written<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.110> correct

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
sure that what I've written is correct

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.250 
sure that what I've written is correct
for<00:01:10.619> what<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:10.920> hearing<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> track<00:01:12.260> it's
