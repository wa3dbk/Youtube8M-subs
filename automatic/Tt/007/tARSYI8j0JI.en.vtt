with<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> handle<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> help<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.440> move<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> bike

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
with a handle to help you move the bike

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.910 
with a handle to help you move the bike
around<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.190> little<00:00:41.280> bit<00:00:41.460> easier<00:00:42.680> one<00:00:43.680> thing<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
around a little bit easier one thing I

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.279 
around a little bit easier one thing I
really<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.309> about<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.789> epic<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
really like about the epic is the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.250 
really like about the epic is the
control<00:00:46.620> system<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> lot<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.989> other

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
control system and like a lot of other

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.880 
control system and like a lot of other
bikes<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.100> full<00:00:50.280> pedelec<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:52.440> throttle

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
bikes it's a full pedelec and a throttle

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.010 
bikes it's a full pedelec and a throttle
bike<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> throttle<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.480> we

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
bike so we got the throttle here and we

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.000 
bike so we got the throttle here and we
can<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.320> actually<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.039> mode<00:00:57.649> see<00:00:58.649> these<00:00:58.800> ones

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
can be actually in a mode see these ones

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.889 
can be actually in a mode see these ones
here<00:00:59.190> right<00:00:59.399> here<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.629> our<00:01:00.719> three

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
here right here so we can have our three

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.709 
here right here so we can have our three
levels<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.230> pedelec<00:01:02.000> or<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.239> can<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.539> have

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
levels of pedelec or we can just have

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.320 
levels of pedelec or we can just have
the<00:01:03.899> handler<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> throttle<00:01:05.610> so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the handler and that's the throttle so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.170 
the handler and that's the throttle so
it<00:01:06.450> gives<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.689> throttle<00:01:07.049> only<00:01:07.320> hard<00:01:07.560> pedaling

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
it gives you throttle only hard pedaling

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.590 
it gives you throttle only hard pedaling
now<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:09.750> bikes<00:01:09.990> hold<00:01:10.259> up<00:01:10.380> nice<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.619> small

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600

hijos got a pretty nice thing going they

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.179 
hijos got a pretty nice thing going they
have<00:01:28.570> some<00:01:28.750> other<00:01:28.869> bikes<00:01:29.170> too<00:01:29.439> and<00:01:29.799> I<00:01:30.009> will

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
have some other bikes too and I will

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.050 
have some other bikes too and I will
definitely<00:01:32.310> show<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.369> what<00:01:33.580> else<00:01:33.759> they<00:01:33.909> have

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
definitely show you what else they have

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.020 
definitely show you what else they have
here<00:01:34.090> before<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.780> days<00:01:34.960> up<00:01:35.200> I<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:36.460> notice<00:01:36.759> that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
here before the days up I do notice that

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.760 
here before the days up I do notice that
throttle<00:01:37.270> there's<00:01:37.570> an<00:01:37.689> awful<00:01:38.020> responsive

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
throttle there's an awful responsive

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.980 
throttle there's an awful responsive
when<00:01:38.890> I<00:01:38.920> hit<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:40.270> wants<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.540> take<00:01:40.780> off

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
when I hit it really wants to take off

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.800 
when I hit it really wants to take off
so<00:01:41.290> I<00:01:41.350> could<00:01:42.250> see<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.549> throttle<00:01:43.420> control

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
so I could see the throttle control

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.550 
so I could see the throttle control
being<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.289> little<00:01:44.560> bit<00:01:44.649> smoother<00:01:45.039> on<00:01:45.159> this

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
being a little bit smoother on this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.660 
being a little bit smoother on this
they've<00:01:47.560> modified<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.250> latching<00:01:48.640> mechanism

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
they've modified the latching mechanism

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.330 
they've modified the latching mechanism
for<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.360> folding<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:50.350> also<00:01:50.649> this<00:01:50.799> front<00:01:51.070> fold

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
for the folding it also this front fold

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.950 
for the folding it also this front fold
folding<00:01:52.000> latch<00:01:52.210> is<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> little<00:01:52.600> different<00:01:52.869> but

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
folding latch is a little different but

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.730 
folding latch is a little different but
they're<00:01:53.619> still<00:01:53.770> working<00:01:53.920> on<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.220> nice

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
they're still working on a nice

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.760 
they're still working on a nice
