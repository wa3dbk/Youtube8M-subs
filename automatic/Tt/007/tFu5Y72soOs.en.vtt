00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.060
 Hey guys 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.560
 if you happen to be on the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.280
 willingness to write because several other 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.380
 tips 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.910
 I keep hearing on the channel all the time. 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.590
 video that I basically wanted to talk about 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.509
 about something very simple that many 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.850
 people do not know then you know 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.789
 You do not know how to use it correctly is 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.080
 you basically squeeze 16 playing 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.720
 Playstation 3 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.849
 or you will train by playing xbox for 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 pass the ball under the leg to 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.849
 The best way to do this is 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.980
 when you turn your back on the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.110
 goalkeeper today back of the quarterback near the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.120
 large area and resuming these two 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.040
 clips a very fallible thing is very 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.719
 simple I have to press r 1 and the more 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.850
 important is you to know the team at 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.860
 time to do this and I'm 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.420
 showing here today left river insured 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.250
 at the time the ball passes under the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.260
 leg you hit the kick button 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.180
 immediately after always will get the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.550
 keeper off guard and it's something that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.930
 It will really help you a lot. 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 with difficulty to mark bag then 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.010
 tight is a phenomenal tactic. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.140
 because I do not know if you know but when 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.940
 we are within the big area the chance 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.920
 you make the goal is much bigger 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.320
 so who I passed the ball was a little 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.750
 space with alexandre duck and achieve 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.119
 make a goal so without necessarily 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.799
 back to the goal but if you have to 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.930
 back to the defender and back to pro 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.549
 background from your opponent's area to your 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.860
 chances of getting a space within the 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.530
 the big area and make a goal 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.960
 Easy is very very very very good 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.759
 then you can also use in 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.280
 other motorcycles, not even for example 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.750
 wanted that I used closer to the middle 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.210
 field and to make room for 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.040
 go running here too I used to leave 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 the ball goes through and then continue and do 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.270
 a touch then has several variations that 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.340
 you can do in the snow test what 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.070
 You think it's going to help. 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.810
 Quite you mainly if you 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.399
 have any difficulty against a team 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.920
 very defensive 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.270
 this is basically a very quick tip 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.460
 expects in many others that neither is 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.530
 so you can not use it here so much in 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.570
 large area in the small area also for 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.740
 to set up plays and which are currently 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.420
 showing if you can use almost the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.280
 field to get a little space 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.869
 and make a beautiful one of a goal that's it 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.600
 I hope I have a course from this video. 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.539
 here very fast here is as usual the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.539
