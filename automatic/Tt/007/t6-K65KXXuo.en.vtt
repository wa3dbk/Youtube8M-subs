00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.970
 Hello dear friends with you vulture 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.250
 today will tell you about matic which 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.220
 allow you to become a batman yes yes it is 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.400
 they though not completely the first thing 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.150
 adds this mod this clothes batman but 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.580
 or armor first in this dress is a mask 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.680
 batman here so here she looks 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:57.150
 she adds one and a half armor units 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:01.000
 then we have batman 's armor she 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.970
 hangs up dilute strength he will last 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.310
 infinitely as you can see it is 0 when 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.680
 swim something 01 he adds armor 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.350
 quite a lot almost a quarter or 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.610
 even half 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:22.149
 then we have pants and boots like 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.479
 see the armor scale filled up completely 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:30.899
 And you can say that this is Batman's armor. 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:35.560
 it looks like a diamond armor but not the view 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:38.140
 units about wrong but this is armor 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.170
 adds only this power buff 3 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.810
 which is pretty good following this 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.950
 Batman watch I do not know what they are for 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.590
 but maybe they show if you could 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.990
 notice that in the same corner arrows from 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.520
 this clock but they don't seem to move 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.400
 I argue I will fall from this mountain without inflicting 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.630
 yourself no damage being in mode 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.259
 survival I have no problem in this us 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.579
 will help 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.370
 a cloak that will allow you to flit 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.829
 say and so in the sky do you have him 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.630
 be able to fly and jump great heights 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:25.350
 Here is such a raincoat, let's 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.990
 get and move on further from us 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.930
 there is a set of explosive bombs the first bomb 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.180
 allow you to slow down your opponent 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.540
 let's try it on pigs kine 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.250
 new in her this bomb and how you see on 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.610
 it appeared such a buff as a slowdown 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:47.040
 when we knock her she will run like 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.100
 slop but push my and we can be done 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.660
 this buff is about 8 seconds or even 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:58.130
 10 second bomb is a mini bomb though not 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.570
 I will say that she has me when you and I throw 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:06.590
 it will explode about 4 or 3 times and 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:12.210
 It can be used in the structure of mines 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:15.170
 so the next bomb is a smoke bomb well 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.640
 or just smoke bombs that will create 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.980
 will create smoke but not us but slightly 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:28.590
 about a second at 2 3 and you also have 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:32.030
 padla bends sorry it's not long 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.960
 time but oh well the last bomb is 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.480
 bomb stick 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.740
 or bromo velcro she will 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.670
 attach to any block and even to 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.880
 mob but could die immediately when you 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.510
 step on this god as you see it 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.730
 the place exploded 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.920
 and further we have a set of two weapons 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.400
 who are always with him the same batman 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.640
 the first is we have a betarang yes there is something 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.659
 similar to a boomerang but it is much 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.709
 mortal 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.930
 he is homing that is me today him 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.230
 run somewhere in the sky how 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.250
 see this air and it happens with one 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.949
 kick 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:23.910
 but not all mobs let's say we take a spider 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:26.430
 so let's run this betarang into it 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:31.160
 what body on him but not killed but inflicted 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.630
 quite a lot of damage as much as 14 damage 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.810
 the next is a hook according to the idea it should 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.060
 act like a rope that is if on 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.040
 Right click it should 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.440
 fly such a rope and we can 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.370
 whether to teleport toli climb on 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.360
 but that it is not right here, and probably 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.650
 it is a bug but you can take advantage of it 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:58.100
 With this sound, how are you going to be like a weapon ? 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.920
 apply 4 lessons 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.130
 Badly I cook but nothing for 4 for 5 damage 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.780
 but quite interesting and cool 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.600
 retinue you download it and put on 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.960
 server to mess with your friend 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.880
