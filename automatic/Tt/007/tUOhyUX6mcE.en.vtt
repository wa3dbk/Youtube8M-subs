 make sure of course that your iphone 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.340
 is off and we will start with 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 remove both pentalobe vices in 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.240
 form canvases that are right and 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.490

 they are noted a1 and a2 on the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.210
 plate of the assembly here it is removed 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.450
 simply these two screws with the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.430
 pentalobe screwdriver we go now 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.430
 to proceed to the opening of 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.340
 iphone 5 so it's the block 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.810
 screen and simply clip on the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.729
 chassis of the iphone so we will place 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.820
 a sucker just above the button 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.040
 home and then we will shoot the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.799
 suction cup and the iphone 5 it's must 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.180
 open up of itself as a book if 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.129
 your screen is broken you landed 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.649
 simply scotch so that the 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.150
 sucker can take 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.980
 on your screen this is it really 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.879
 very simple to open your iphone 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.980
 for the opening we could also 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.569
 opted for opening with a tool is 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.090
 the focused a small double clamp 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.840
 cupping this is affixed and it opens 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.370
 all alone now we will open 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.349
 the iphone so be careful 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.209
 the screen should not make an angle of 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.870
 more than 90 degrees otherwise you risk 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.079
 to damage the tablecloths 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.939
 the screen are hidden behind a small 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.560
 protective pad and wafer 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.950
 protection is maintained by davis 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.420
 that we numbered from b1 to b4 this is 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.629
 will just remove them with a 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.340
 cruciform screwdriver then the b3 she 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.780
 is not loving and so she will leave 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.299
 not with the screwdriver 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.439
 and so here it is on the wafer is 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.060

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.220
