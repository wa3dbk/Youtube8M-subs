00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
Oh what's up guys so I want to make a

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.050 
Oh what's up guys so I want to make a
quick<00:00:17.910> video<00:00:18.260> into<00:00:19.260> regards<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.609> question

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
quick video into regards to a question

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.950 
quick video into regards to a question
that<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.240> get<00:00:21.300> asked<00:00:21.689> quite<00:00:21.840> often<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.930> so<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
that I get asked quite often and so I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.660 
that I get asked quite often and so I
figured<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.350> make<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> video<00:00:25.890> based<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.550> it

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
figured I just make a video based on it

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.679 
figured I just make a video based on it
because<00:00:26.880> it's<00:00:27.029> kind<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.210> hard<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.390> explain

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
because it's kind of hard to explain

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.550 
because it's kind of hard to explain
when<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.080> reply<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:28.949> forms<00:00:29.460> or<00:00:30.439> facebooking<00:00:31.439> out

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980

way<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.500> not<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.750> beneficial<00:01:48.750> as

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
way is not going to be as beneficial as

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.179 
way is not going to be as beneficial as
smart<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.710> accurate<00:01:50.460> as<00:01:50.640> other<00:01:51.299> ways<00:01:51.509> as

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
smart and as accurate as other ways as

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.170 
smart and as accurate as other ways as
counting<00:01:53.189> your<00:01:53.280> macros<00:01:53.640> every<00:01:53.820> single<00:01:54.060> day

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
counting your macros every single day

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.289 
counting your macros every single day
but<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> benefits<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:57.270> don't

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
but the benefits of this is you don't

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.020 
but the benefits of this is you don't
have<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.310> feel<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.790> kind<00:01:59.969> of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
have to you can feel like you kind of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
have to you can feel like you kind of
have<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> life<00:02:00.390> again<00:02:00.689> because<00:02:00.869> after<00:02:01.740> counting

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
have a life again because after counting

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.060 
have a life again because after counting
macros<00:02:02.460> forever<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.420> gets<00:02:03.600> old<00:02:03.689> and

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
macros forever it just gets old and

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.410 
macros forever it just gets old and
especially<00:02:05.070> during<00:02:05.340> show<00:02:05.759> season<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.240> Diet

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
especially during show season and Diet

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.300 
especially during show season and Diet
season<00:02:06.750> or<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.740> gets<00:02:08.009> old

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
season or not it just really gets old

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.290 
season or not it just really gets old
and<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.950> doing<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.190> way

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
and so doing it this way
