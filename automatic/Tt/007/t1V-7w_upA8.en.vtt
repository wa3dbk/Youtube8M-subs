your<00:02:01.920> foots<00:02:02.189> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.640> more<00:02:02.909> flat<00:02:03.780> really<00:02:04.290> than

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
your foots kind of more flat really than

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.800 
your foots kind of more flat really than
in<00:02:04.680> normal<00:02:04.860> heels<00:02:05.340> your<00:02:05.579> foots<00:02:06.119> not<00:02:06.329> much<00:02:06.570> more

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
in normal heels your foots not much more

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.510 
in normal heels your foots not much more
raised<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.320> guess<00:02:07.590> when<00:02:08.009> my<00:02:08.129> foot<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.399> really

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
raised so I guess when my foot is really

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
raised so I guess when my foot is really
raised<00:02:08.819> I'm<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> three<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.629> guess<00:02:10.020> I'm<00:02:10.170> really

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
raised I'm a three I guess I'm really

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.320 
raised I'm a three I guess I'm really
three<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> half<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.220> black<00:02:11.790> liters

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
three and a half and my black liters

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.720 
three and a half and my black liters
or<00:02:12.390> three<00:02:13.020> they're<00:02:13.680> fine<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.340> there's<00:02:14.490> a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
or three they're fine but there's a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.970 
or three they're fine but there's a
little<00:02:15.180> bit<00:02:15.300> tight<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:16.260> right<00:02:16.470> foot<00:02:16.800> like

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
little bit tight on the right foot like

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.920 
little bit tight on the right foot like
along<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.250> toast<00:02:17.610> say<00:02:18.240> when<00:02:18.450> I've<00:02:18.570> worn<00:02:18.780> them

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
along the toast say when I've worn them

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.870 
along the toast say when I've worn them
for<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.110> very<00:02:19.170> long<00:02:19.290> day<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:20.010> kind<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.520> can't<00:02:20.760> wait

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
for a very long day I kind of can't wait

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.520 
for a very long day I kind of can't wait
to<00:02:20.970> get<00:02:21.060> out<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.300> them<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.720> measured<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> heel

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
to get out of them I measured the heel

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.790 
to get out of them I measured the heel
the<00:02:23.250> heel<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.910> almost<00:02:24.480> 5<00:02:24.810> inches<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.590> was<00:02:25.680> like

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
the heel is almost 5 inches it was like

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.020 
the heel is almost 5 inches it was like
4<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.490> 3/4<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.800> platform<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.610> here

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
4 and 3/4 and and the platform is here

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.330 
4 and 3/4 and and the platform is here
and<00:02:30.270> that's<00:02:30.360> 2<00:02:30.720> inches<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.410> these<00:02:31.800> did<00:02:32.070> feel<00:02:32.310> a

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
and that's 2 inches and these did feel a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.440 
and that's 2 inches and these did feel a
bit<00:02:32.640> more<00:02:32.820> comfortable

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
bit more comfortable

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.140 
bit more comfortable
straightaway<00:02:34.380> than<00:02:34.800> my<00:02:35.310> original<00:02:35.460> litres

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
straightaway than my original litres

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.910 
straightaway than my original litres
because<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.840> original<00:02:36.960> litres<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.620> leathers

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
because the original litres the leathers

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.060 
because the original litres the leathers
re<00:02:38.070> stiff<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.730> inside<00:02:39.600> use<00:02:39.900> leather<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:40.890> then

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
re stiff and inside use leather but then

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.010 
re stiff and inside use leather but then
it's<00:02:41.400> obviously<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.030> hat<00:02:42.300> tapestry<00:02:42.720> on<00:02:42.810> top

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
it's obviously this hat tapestry on top

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.010 
it's obviously this hat tapestry on top
so<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.800> feels<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.400> lot<00:02:44.880> thinner<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.870> lot

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
so it feels a lot thinner and it's a lot

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.620 
so it feels a lot thinner and it's a lot
more<00:02:46.260> flexible<00:02:47.190> when<00:02:47.520> I<00:02:47.580> first<00:02:48.030> wore<00:02:48.180> my<00:02:48.390> black

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
more flexible when I first wore my black

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.510 
more flexible when I first wore my black
liters<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.470> was<00:02:49.590> going<00:02:49.800> down<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> stairs<00:02:50.280> I

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
liters and I was going down the stairs I

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.250 
liters and I was going down the stairs I
laced<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.820> up<00:02:50.880> really<00:02:51.090> tightly<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.780> they

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
laced it up really tightly and they

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.900 
laced it up really tightly and they
didn't<00:02:52.500> really<00:02:52.650> give<00:02:52.830> around<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.160> ankles<00:02:53.580> so

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
didn't really give around the ankles so

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.030 
didn't really give around the ankles so
rather<00:02:54.150> than<00:02:54.450> my<00:02:54.600> foot<00:02:54.870> bending<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:55.890> went

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
rather than my foot bending as I went

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.920 
rather than my foot bending as I went
down<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.280> stairs<00:02:56.490> they<00:02:56.820> didn't<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.720> was

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
down the stairs they didn't and I was

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.550 
down the stairs they didn't and I was
kind<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.230> sliding<00:02:58.740> down<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> stairs<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.560> these

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
kind of sliding down the stairs so these

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.010 
kind of sliding down the stairs so these
are<00:03:01.740> straightaway<00:03:02.160> kind<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:03.210> material<00:03:03.390> is

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
are straightaway kind of the material is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.900 
are straightaway kind of the material is
obviously<00:03:04.410> softer<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.430> they<00:03:05.640> were<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.760> lot

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
obviously softer so they were a lot

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.420 
obviously softer so they were a lot
easier<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.390> walk<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.870> heel<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.440> wooden<00:03:08.070> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
easier to walk in the heel is wooden and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.240 
easier to walk in the heel is wooden and
I<00:03:08.610> believe<00:03:08.970> these<00:03:09.210> are<00:03:09.480> hand<00:03:09.990> stained<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:11.040> I

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
I believe these are hand stained and I

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.550 
I believe these are hand stained and I
had<00:03:11.430> seen<00:03:11.640> ones<00:03:11.940> with<00:03:12.210> a<00:03:12.240> perspex<00:03:12.960> gradient

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
had seen ones with a perspex gradient

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.500 
had seen ones with a perspex gradient
heel<00:03:13.770> that's<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.670> little<00:03:14.820> bit<00:03:14.970> too<00:03:15.090> much<00:03:15.210> for<00:03:15.390> me

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
heel that's a little bit too much for me

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.300 
heel that's a little bit too much for me
so<00:03:15.810> I'm<00:03:15.960> glad<00:03:16.080> I<00:03:16.170> went<00:03:16.350> for<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.709> kind<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.070> the
