the sequence with 275 grain Parker's we

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.829 
the sequence with 275 grain Parker's we
had<00:00:48.980> one<00:00:49.219> misfire<00:00:49.699> there<00:00:49.999> with<00:00:50.179> a<00:00:50.210> winchester

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
had one misfire there with a winchester

had one misfire there with a winchester
W<00:00:51.140> 209<00:00:51.679> so<00:00:52.129> I'm<00:00:52.280> going<00:00:52.730> back<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.120> Federals<00:00:53.569> it

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
W 209 so I'm going back to Federals it

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.700 
W 209 so I'm going back to Federals it
was<00:00:54.530> not<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.920> gun<00:00:55.159> because<00:00:55.899> no<00:00:56.899> fire<00:00:57.199> came<00:00:57.530> out

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
was not the gun because no fire came out

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.180 
was not the gun because no fire came out
of<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.890> primer<00:00:58.219> although<00:00:58.699> it<00:00:58.879> had<00:00:58.999> a<00:00:59.030> good

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
of the primer although it had a good

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.149 
of the primer although it had a good
heavy<00:01:01.190> dent<00:01:02.149> right<00:01:02.600> in<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.809> center<00:01:03.170> very<00:01:03.979> odd

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
heavy dent right in the center very odd

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.250 
heavy dent right in the center very odd
so<00:01:04.670> I<00:01:04.699> had<00:01:05.180> problems<00:01:05.630> with<00:01:05.720> Winchester

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
so I had problems with Winchester
