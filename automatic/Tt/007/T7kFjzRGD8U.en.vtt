catch the hoop underneath after you have
release<00:03:05.560> hill<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.340> you<00:03:06.430> can<00:03:06.609> lead<00:03:06.790> with

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
release hill so that you can lead with

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.330 
release hill so that you can lead with
your<00:03:07.150> thumb<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.660> have<00:03:08.350> some<00:03:08.500> more<00:03:08.590> variations

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
your thumb I have some more variations

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.789 
your thumb I have some more variations
to<00:03:09.459> add<00:03:09.760> into<00:03:10.150> another<00:03:10.389> tutorial<00:03:10.810> which<00:03:11.500> leads

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
to add into another tutorial which leads

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.319 
to add into another tutorial which leads
with<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.130> little<00:03:12.430> finger<00:03:12.609> but<00:03:13.000> they'll<00:03:13.180> add

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
with the little finger but they'll add

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.330 
with the little finger but they'll add
extra<00:03:13.720> beats<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.590> if<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.799> want<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.069> do<00:03:15.190> without

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
extra beats so if you want to do without

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.340 
extra beats so if you want to do without
any<00:03:15.639> extra<00:03:16.030> beats<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.569> have<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.930> do<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.200> this

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
any extra beats you have to do it this

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.229 
any extra beats you have to do it this
way<00:03:17.620> watch<00:03:18.100> well<00:03:18.430> there<00:03:18.549> are<00:03:18.579> many<00:03:18.819> other<00:03:19.030> ways

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
way watch well there are many other ways

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.090 
way watch well there are many other ways
but<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.900> way<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.260> I'm<00:03:20.410> teaching<00:03:20.709> it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
but this is the way that I'm teaching it

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.420 
but this is the way that I'm teaching it
in<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.730> tutorial<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.560> although<00:03:23.859> you<00:03:24.040> catch

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
in this tutorial so although you catch

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.090 
in this tutorial so although you catch
the<00:03:24.670> hoop<00:03:24.880> underneath<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.959> pass<00:03:26.230> off<00:03:26.530> occurs

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
the hoop underneath the pass off occurs

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.390 
the hoop underneath the pass off occurs
with<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.639> hand<00:03:27.880> is<00:03:28.120> on<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.359> side<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:29.319> top<00:03:29.400> of

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
with the hand is on the side on top of

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.280 
with the hand is on the side on top of
the<00:03:30.730> hoop<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.209> that's<00:03:31.359> all<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.690> leading<00:03:31.900> with

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
the hoop and that's all the leading with

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.370 
the hoop and that's all the leading with
the<00:03:32.440> thumb<00:03:32.739> here's<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.489> view<00:03:33.639> from<00:03:34.239> behind<00:03:34.690> so

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
the thumb here's a view from behind so

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.620 
the thumb here's a view from behind so
that<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.680> can<00:03:35.889> see<00:03:36.160> what<00:03:36.819> it<00:03:36.940> looks<00:03:37.150> like<00:03:37.359> and

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
that you can see what it looks like and

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.270 
that you can see what it looks like and
how<00:03:37.780> much<00:03:37.959> you<00:03:38.170> have<00:03:38.349> to<00:03:38.380> move<00:03:38.680> from<00:03:38.859> side<00:03:39.069> to

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
how much you have to move from side to

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.370 
how much you have to move from side to
side<00:03:39.310> again<00:03:39.819> for<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.450> successfully<00:03:41.139> work

side again for this to successfully work
good<00:03:42.280> luck<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.870> may<00:03:44.049> be<00:03:44.169> useful<00:03:44.380> to<00:03:44.799> note<00:03:45.040> the

good luck it may be useful to note the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.030 
good luck it may be useful to note the
