 that is, we did not do it 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.929
 when you have to do it well 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:26.060

 a trophy chems to resources is 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.460
 common therefore he distinguished the two 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.809
 chance stride that is offered to me but 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.840
 both can be used for this 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.739
 who does the same thing he says we do 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.979
 two to four blades for one or for 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.979

 yamani at 15.15 school guarantees them a 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.070
 mansion where she works in every 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.439
 unit there are two station stations 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.530
 standing and two recline positions 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.000
 in each arm because what makes the bottom 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.710
 as if you were doing how many grams 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.710
 as if you were doing 4 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:57.759

 he would do it long bed compliance 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:15.930
 gives us deafening prostration 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.400
 without the prostrations in the sense that 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:26.800
 prostration is not going to be long 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:29.140
 like the other no other battle and he 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.440
 swearing after like that is going 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.440
 pay 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.430
 each picture 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:52.220
 whereas to the facts chems it is the prayer 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:57.470
 and the wings and es10 urns and rosso 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.440

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.010
 too much except it's a night prayer so 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.010
