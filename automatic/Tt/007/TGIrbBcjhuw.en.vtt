the<00:00:17.250> double<00:00:17.580> loop<00:00:17.670> stitch<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.119> more<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.510> an

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
the double loop stitch is more of an

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.570 
the double loop stitch is more of an
intermediate<00:00:18.869> stitch<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.250> because

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
intermediate stitch and this is because

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.040 
intermediate stitch and this is because
the<00:00:20.730> stitch<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.390> little<00:00:21.720> bit<00:00:21.900> more

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the stitch is just a little bit more

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.259 
the stitch is just a little bit more
challenging<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> isn't<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.730> bad<00:00:24.029> once

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
challenging but it isn't that bad once

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.730 
challenging but it isn't that bad once
you<00:00:24.449> learn<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> basics<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> little

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
you learn the basics and have a little

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.880 
you learn the basics and have a little
practice<00:00:26.840> okay<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.109> usually<00:00:28.289> crochet

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
practice okay so when I usually crochet

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.339 
practice okay so when I usually crochet
this<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> how<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> hold<00:00:29.760> my<00:00:29.970> yarn<00:00:30.269> now<00:00:30.960> everyone

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
this is how I hold my yarn now everyone

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.870 
this is how I hold my yarn now everyone
is<00:00:31.439> different<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.980> how<00:00:32.099> they<00:00:32.250> hold<00:00:32.460> their<00:00:32.640> yarn

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
is different on how they hold their yarn

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.819 
is different on how they hold their yarn
but<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> way<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.780> hold<00:00:34.140> my<00:00:34.350> yarn<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.800> not

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
but the way that I hold my yarn is not

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.680 
but the way that I hold my yarn is not
going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.370> work<00:00:35.520> well<00:00:35.790> when<00:00:36.090> crocheting<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
going to work well when crocheting the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.869 
going to work well when crocheting the
double<00:00:36.989> loop<00:00:37.110> stitch<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.370> I'm<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> have

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
double loop stitch so I'm going to have

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.940 
double loop stitch so I'm going to have
to<00:00:39.000> change<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.540> hold<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.170> order<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.469> make<00:00:40.739> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
to change my hold in order to make this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.209 
to change my hold in order to make this
stitch<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.300> may<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.989> well<00:00:43.219> so

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.650 
stitch and you may have to as well so
what<00:00:44.340> I'm<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:44.820> instead<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.210> wrapping

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
what I'm going to do instead of wrapping

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.090 
what I'm going to do instead of wrapping
the<00:00:45.750> yarn<00:00:45.780> around<00:00:46.050> my<00:00:46.230> pinky<00:00:46.410> finger<00:00:46.620> I'm

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the yarn around my pinky finger I'm

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
the yarn around my pinky finger I'm
going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> place<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> yarn<00:00:48.270> under<00:00:48.570> my<00:00:48.719> pinky

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
going to place the yarn under my pinky

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.569 
going to place the yarn under my pinky
and<00:00:49.320> over<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> top<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> rest<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.489> my

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and over the top of the rest of my

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.970 
and over the top of the rest of my
fingers<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.930> works<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.410> me<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.860> this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
fingers now this works for me but this

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.170 
fingers now this works for me but this
may<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.280> work<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
may not work for you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.939 
may not work for you
so<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> quickly<00:00:55.110> show<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.530> another

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
so I'm going to quickly show you another

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.240 
so I'm going to quickly show you another
way<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.190> might<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.789> better<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.390> so

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
way that might be better for you so

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.500 
way that might be better for you so
instead<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.399> may<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> place<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> yarn

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
instead you may want to place the yarn

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.569 
instead you may want to place the yarn
on<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> palm<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.199> hand<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.890> then<00:01:02.340> pull

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
on the palm of your hand and then pull

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.009 
on the palm of your hand and then pull
it<00:01:02.670> around<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> front<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.539> your<00:01:03.629> index

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it around to the front of your index

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
it around to the front of your index
finger<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.220> grip<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.549> yarn<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.820> your

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
finger then just grip the yarn with your

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.520 
finger then just grip the yarn with your
fingers<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.840> works<00:01:07.080> really<00:01:07.170> well<00:01:07.470> for

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
fingers and this works really well for

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.219 
fingers and this works really well for
some<00:01:07.860> crochet<00:01:08.070> errs<00:01:08.689> okay<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.750> once<00:01:10.080> you've

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
some crochet errs okay so once you've

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
some crochet errs okay so once you've
decided<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> grip<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> double<00:01:11.670> loop

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
decided on the grip for the double loop

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.330 
decided on the grip for the double loop
stitch<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.869> next<00:01:13.170> thing<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.409> do<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.920> wrap<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
stitch the next thing you do is wrap the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.130 
stitch the next thing you do is wrap the
yarn<00:01:14.369> around<00:01:14.610> your<00:01:14.939> index<00:01:15.180> finger<00:01:15.450> two<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.110> a

yarn around your index finger two and a
half<00:01:16.290> times<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.619> two<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.159> there's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
half times so that's one two and there's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.039 
half times so that's one two and there's
your<00:01:21.000> half<00:01:21.150> right<00:01:21.420> there<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.869> you're<00:01:21.960> not

would yarn over the hook from the bottom
of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> yarn<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.810> then<00:01:34.380> grab<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.680> yarn<00:01:34.979> from

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
of the yarn and then grab the yarn from

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190 
of the yarn and then grab the yarn from
the<00:01:35.250> top<00:01:35.579> with<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.000> hook<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the top with your hook like this and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.929 
the top with your hook like this and
then<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.920> would<00:01:38.040> bring<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> yarn<00:01:38.490> through<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
then we would bring the yarn through the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.170 
then we would bring the yarn through the
stitch<00:01:39.650> but<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.979> stitch<00:01:41.310> we're<00:01:41.790> instead

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
stitch but for this stitch we're instead

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.030 
stitch but for this stitch we're instead
going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> yarn<00:01:42.780> over<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> hook<00:01:43.140> from<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> top

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
going to yarn over the hook from the top

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.639 
going to yarn over the hook from the top
of<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> yarn<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.200> now<00:01:46.200> after<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
of the yarn like this now after you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.289 
of the yarn like this now after you
place<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> yarn<00:01:47.220> over<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.579> hook<00:01:47.700> from<00:01:48.180> the

around your index finger watch all three

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.990 
around your index finger watch all three
loops<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.409> hook<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> pull<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.729> three

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.020 
loops with your hook and pull all three
loops<00:01:57.149> through<00:01:57.540> only<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.110> stitch

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.880 

there<00:02:01.810> will<00:02:01.930> now<00:02:02.049> be<00:02:02.110> four<00:02:02.440> loops<00:02:02.650> on<00:02:02.830> your

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
there will now be four loops on your

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.910 
there will now be four loops on your
hook<00:02:03.900> now<00:02:04.900> it<00:02:05.049> still<00:02:05.290> looks<00:02:05.440> like<00:02:05.530> there<00:02:05.830> are

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
hook now it still looks like there are

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.830 
hook now it still looks like there are
three<00:02:06.100> loops<00:02:06.400> on<00:02:06.580> your<00:02:06.610> index<00:02:07.030> finger<00:02:07.479> but

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
three loops on your index finger but

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.139 
three loops on your index finger but
really<00:02:08.110> there<00:02:08.259> are<00:02:08.350> only<00:02:08.380> two<00:02:08.830> loops<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.490> then

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
really there are only two loops and then

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.430 
really there are only two loops and then
you<00:02:10.240> have<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.539> working<00:02:10.840> strand<00:02:11.050> of<00:02:11.230> yarn

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
you have the working strand of yarn

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.860 
you have the working strand of yarn
that's<00:02:11.950> over<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.340> top<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.550> your<00:02:12.819> hand<00:02:13.120> so

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
that's over the top of your hand so

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.510 
that's over the top of your hand so
leave<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.230> two<00:02:14.380> loops<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.800> your<00:02:14.860> finger<00:02:15.310> and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
leave the two loops on your finger and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.430 
leave the two loops on your finger and
only<00:02:16.060> yarn<00:02:16.270> over<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.690> working<00:02:16.900> strand<00:02:17.260> of

only yarn over the working strand of
yarn<00:02:18.450> pull<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.600> yarn<00:02:19.810> through<00:02:19.900> all<00:02:20.290> four

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
yarn pull the yarn through all four

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.220 
yarn pull the yarn through all four
loops<00:02:20.770> on<00:02:21.010> your<00:02:21.069> hook<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:25.420> as<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:25.690> turn<00:02:25.900> my<00:02:26.050> hand

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
loops on your hook now as I turn my hand

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.380 
loops on your hook now as I turn my hand
over<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:27.130> still<00:02:27.370> see<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.700> two<00:02:27.910> loops<00:02:28.180> on

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
over you can still see the two loops on

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.750 
over you can still see the two loops on
my<00:02:28.600> finger<00:02:29.050> now<00:02:29.860> take<00:02:30.130> your<00:02:30.280> finger<00:02:30.459> out<00:02:30.610> of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
my finger now take your finger out of

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.190 
my finger now take your finger out of
the<00:02:30.910> loops<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.569> move<00:02:31.959> on<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.350> next<00:02:32.530> stitch

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
the loops and move on to the next stitch

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.240 
the loops and move on to the next stitch
okay<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:35.260> I'm<00:02:35.380> going<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.620> show<00:02:35.769> you<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.010> stitch

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
okay so I'm going to show you the stitch

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.710 
okay so I'm going to show you the stitch
again<00:02:36.580> but<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:36.880> time<00:02:36.940> I'm<00:02:37.180> going<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.450> show

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
again but this time I'm going to show

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.300 
again but this time I'm going to show
you<00:02:37.780> how<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.110> adjust<00:02:38.320> your<00:02:38.680> loops<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.280> make

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
you how to adjust your loops to make

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.699 
you how to adjust your loops to make
them<00:02:39.610> shorter<00:02:40.030> or<00:02:40.209> longer

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
them shorter or longer

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.960 
them shorter or longer
okay<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:41.769> again<00:02:42.130> we're<00:02:42.280> going<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.519> wrap<00:02:42.790> our

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
okay so again we're going to wrap our

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.910 
okay so again we're going to wrap our
yarn<00:02:43.030> around<00:02:43.450> our<00:02:43.750> index<00:02:44.110> finger<00:02:44.320> two<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:44.890> a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
yarn around our index finger two and a

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.840 
yarn around our index finger two and a
half<00:02:45.100> times<00:02:47.220> insert<00:02:48.220> your<00:02:48.310> hook<00:02:48.489> into<00:02:48.550> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
half times insert your hook into the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.620 
half times insert your hook into the
next<00:02:48.880> stitch<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:52.030> yarn<00:02:52.300> over<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.600> hook

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
next stitch and then yarn over the hook

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.009 
next stitch and then yarn over the hook
from<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.140> top<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.769> yarn<00:02:54.870> answer<00:02:55.870> your

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
from the top of the yarn answer your

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.540 
from the top of the yarn answer your
hook<00:02:56.200> into<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.590> two-and-a-half<00:02:56.950> loops<00:02:57.370> on

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
hook into the two-and-a-half loops on

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.270 
hook into the two-and-a-half loops on
your<00:02:57.580> finger

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.130 

and<00:03:03.400> then<00:03:03.910> this<00:03:04.060> is<00:03:04.240> when<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.510> want<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.840> pull

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
and then this is when you want to pull

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.470 
and then this is when you want to pull
the<00:03:05.290> yarn<00:03:05.320> in<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.280> make<00:03:06.430> your<00:03:06.580> loop<00:03:06.760> smaller<00:03:07.180> or

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
the yarn in to make your loop smaller or

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.810 
the yarn in to make your loop smaller or
out<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.470> make<00:03:08.620> them<00:03:08.830> longer<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:09.460> I'm<00:03:09.580> going<00:03:09.760> to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
out to make them longer so I'm going to

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.420 
out to make them longer so I'm going to
pull<00:03:10.060> mine<00:03:10.210> out<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:10.870> show<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
pull mine out and show you the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.160 
pull mine out and show you the
difference<00:03:12.790> between<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.690> loops<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.020> did

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
difference between the loops I did

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.130 
difference between the loops I did
before<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.740> loop<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.010> I'm<00:03:15.070> doing<00:03:15.280> now<00:03:16.140> okay

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
before in the loop so I'm doing now okay

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.450 
before in the loop so I'm doing now okay
so<00:03:17.200> when<00:03:17.440> you're<00:03:17.560> happy<00:03:17.770> with<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.040> length<00:03:18.310> of

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
so when you're happy with the length of

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.670 
so when you're happy with the length of
your<00:03:18.610> loops<00:03:18.880> pull<00:03:19.360> all<00:03:19.570> three<00:03:19.960> through<00:03:20.500> only

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
your loops pull all three through only

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.040 
your loops pull all three through only
