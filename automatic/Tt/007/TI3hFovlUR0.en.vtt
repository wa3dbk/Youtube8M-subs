00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.460
 in every game because I owe it to the club 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.719
 or to this shirt and treatment is not only 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.920
 possible in each match commented that 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.240
 we come from san martÃ­n san juan in 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.880
 apple equipment in 100 are osama 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.310
 six goals in part for the cup and not for 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.050
 we classify first and come to your 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.000
 court in four with full stadium 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.340
 with the people who encourage you at 90 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.340
 minutes and it seems to me that all of that 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090
 here 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.560
 if the nba are here and they are big and 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:21.000
 with the generalists you will get all the 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 action in each match 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.619
 do not forget space 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.159
 Mars 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.790
 taking us and stealing the balls that 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.790
 they are to see 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.850
 young people who are key can not 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.520
 play in barcelona 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.560
 It does not give you space the choke or 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.659
 up or in the middle of the court or 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.700
 when you cross three rooms there are 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.690
 the red shirts the truth so that 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.680
 can the cupbearer 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.680
 but he's not going to take it out 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.720
 aitor true 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:01.800
 the rejection of the soul 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.800
 So boten was looking for months 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.770
 what's up that comes for messi 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 but he is thrown directly 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.930
 flip it 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.709
 then directly flip it back 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.709
 is that 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.330
 the direction 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.520
 decided what is Barcelona does not play 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.530
 versionar does not have space to Barcelona 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.220
 we treat it in this way they have already 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.819
 given too much space to others already 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.719
 removed with many 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.200
 com is immense he threw the trailer 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.760
 over messi and cut the attack already 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.590
 arm again the bayern munich I think that 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.269
 If it had been fine, I would tell you 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.460
 it seems to me that by variable effect 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.050
 He finally asked Messi how he was 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.920
 you have the last object of the thumb 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.920
 Sirs 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.640
 the small building with Governor Mario 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.380
 gomez especially has grandparents of 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.760
 Grain breeders from Spain 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.500
 patxi lopez giant colors and if more 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.500
 substance gives a hand pedro 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.590
 the metro 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.850
 in the language 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.480
 but insulza 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.480
 I am 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.020
 good 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.020
 in this section 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.489
 and 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.520
 in the months milestones the two 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.220
 from phoenix 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:07.690
 flows particularly so with 100% 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:11.380
 of beer said what 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.480
 this is very real those above you already have 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.310
 an interesting piece very special in 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.709
 your hands if someone had told me 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.690
 that today an original blue dog 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.940
 signed I was going to enter my store 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.130
 you would have said they were crazy but 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.080
 now that it is within my reach the only 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.220
 What remains is how much is going to me 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.620
 cost how much the damage is going to affect 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.370
 its value I think a good estimate 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.389
 would be the seller of 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.389
 3000 dollars 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.789
 I thank you very much that you have sold 

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:47.129
 now we will continue with our only are 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.749
 that's saying thank you when you wait 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.749
 ask for 2800 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.940
 I really hate that it's damaged I thought 

00:04:54.049 --> 00:04:58.430
 1750 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.930
 Last Monday my youngest son turned 18 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.930
 years and he likes guitars
