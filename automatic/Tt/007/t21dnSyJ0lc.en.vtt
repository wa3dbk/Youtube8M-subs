00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that it has a translucent sheet

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.320 
that it has a translucent sheet
protecting<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.500> tackiness<00:01:44.500> of<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.010> tattoo

protecting the tackiness of the tattoo

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.120 
protecting the tackiness of the tattoo
so<00:01:46.330> we<00:01:46.960> will<00:01:47.140> apply<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.590> right<00:01:48.430> below<00:01:50.130> the

so<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:57.130> standpoint<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.790> application<00:01:58.600> there

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
so the standpoint of application there

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.930 
so the standpoint of application there
is<00:01:59.230> really<00:01:59.560> isn't<00:01:59.950> any<00:02:00.130> difference<00:02:00.700> between

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
kind of a setting agent this will also

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.920

eliminate<00:02:40.690> some<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.350> initial<00:02:41.830> shine
