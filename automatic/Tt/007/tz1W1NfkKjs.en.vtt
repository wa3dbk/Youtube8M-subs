 Hello my name is Sergey and you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.720

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.939
 hello again dear friends 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:26.220
 Today, smoking in the kitchen again and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.189
 try to cook a small 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.000
 brand new salad with crab sticks 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.040
 cabbage and corn most recently at 8 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.989
 March I will cook an identical salad and 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.530
 it seemed to me that my experiment 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.290
 a success and i would like to share it with you 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.550
 for this we need a pack of crab 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:56.949
 chopsticks 200 grams fresh cabbage 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:59.760
 grams 400 corn in a jar of mayonnaise and 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.140
 if desired, you can still add onions and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.500
 what else spices 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:11.100
 Well, let's start so here's our spoon 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 finely chop 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:51.250
 now you can eat in small cubes 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.250
 chop our ship chopsticks 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.030
 so we pashin cavalli our bone 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:42.500
 sliced crab sticks now 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:46.390
 a little salted our cabbage and remember 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.390
 but that she became a little softer 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.750
 spare no effort and imagine the noise of the river 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:18.590
 neck 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:21.769
 Beloved girl cover and so now 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.330
 it's time to mix everything up and fill up 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:33.170
 mayonnaise and serve everything 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:36.440
 pour out our saucepan well or big 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:44.530
 other that you have and pour our 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:49.989
 I hope the corn is not overdone 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.989
 I don't know how to become a little bit 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.340
 mix the best 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.019
 in principle, on the corn bank is enough 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:16.949
 200 grams of crab sticks and half a fork 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:20.970

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:42.600
 add corn sorry so now 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:46.700
 we take mayonnaise very easy taxi and so 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.700
 not to advertise . So 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.920
 Tax is not advertising was so think 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.790
 that I advertise took the first available with 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.390

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:12.350

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:20.900

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.520
 say the taste on the export is not enough 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.520
 mayonnaise to add more 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:44.890

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.820
 if you serve in a beautiful vase 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.990

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.310
