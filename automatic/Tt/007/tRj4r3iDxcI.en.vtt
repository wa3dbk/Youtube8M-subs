00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.250 
closely as possible then going into the
painted<00:02:22.520> stage<00:02:22.790> it's<00:02:23.630> almost<00:02:23.810> like<00:02:23.959> I've<00:02:24.080> got

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
painted stage it's almost like I've got

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.690 
painted stage it's almost like I've got
a<00:02:24.290> picture<00:02:24.560> in<00:02:24.770> my<00:02:24.890> mind<00:02:25.160> where<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.459> know

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
a picture in my mind where I know

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.460 
a picture in my mind where I know
exactly<00:02:26.180> what<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.420> should<00:02:26.450> turn<00:02:26.720> out<00:02:26.930> like<00:02:27.170> and

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
exactly what it should turn out like and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.350 
exactly what it should turn out like and
I'm<00:02:27.590> comfortable<00:02:28.280> now<00:02:28.790> with<00:02:28.820> where<00:02:29.240> it's

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
I'm comfortable now with where it's

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.230 
I'm comfortable now with where it's
going<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.540> go

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.930 

I<00:02:32.410> try<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.470> use<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.860> airbrush<00:02:33.980> sparingly<00:02:34.640> so

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
I try and use the airbrush sparingly so

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.430 
I try and use the airbrush sparingly so
it<00:02:35.060> doesn't<00:02:35.360> really<00:02:35.570> overwhelm<00:02:36.230> our

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
it doesn't really overwhelm our

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.160 
it doesn't really overwhelm our
completely<00:02:36.890> take<00:02:37.130> away<00:02:37.400> from<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.330> human<00:02:38.870> hand

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
completely take away from the human hand

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.010 
completely take away from the human hand
side<00:02:39.830> of<00:02:40.070> things<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.610> that's<00:02:41.330> hopefully<00:02:41.990> what

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
side of things and that's hopefully what

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.960 
side of things and that's hopefully what
I'm<00:02:42.260> completing<00:02:43.100> at<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> end<00:02:43.550> is<00:02:43.670> something

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
I'm completing at the end is something

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.810 
I'm completing at the end is something
that<00:02:44.060> feels<00:02:44.300> like<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.840> was<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.340> process<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.550> an

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
that feels like it was the process of an

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.880 
that feels like it was the process of an
organic<00:02:47.210> gestation<00:02:48.200> something<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.680> feels

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
organic gestation something that feels

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.820 
organic gestation something that feels
very<00:02:49.250> natural<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.970> real<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:54.530> was<00:02:54.650> very

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
very natural and real it was very

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.500 
very natural and real it was very
pleased<00:02:55.130> with<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.400> result<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.210> final

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
pleased with the result of the final

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.059 
pleased with the result of the final
piece
