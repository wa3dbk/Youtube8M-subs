although<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.870> does<00:00:13.080> have<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.349> similar<00:00:13.920> design

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
although it does have a similar design

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.740

looks<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.320> intact<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:17.130> only<00:00:17.340> difference

looks to be intact the only difference

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.730 
looks to be intact the only difference
is<00:00:17.730> between<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.270> one<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.600> verizon's<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.619> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
is between this one and verizon's is the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.189 
is between this one and verizon's is the
fact<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.369> sports<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:21.000> 149<00:00:21.810> 99

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
contract price at the same time it's

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.660 
contract price at the same time it's
also<00:00:25.050> missing<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.650> mobile<00:00:25.980> hotspot<00:00:26.099> feature

also missing the mobile hotspot feature
that's<00:00:27.060> prevalent<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.800> verizon's<00:00:28.800> version

that's prevalent on verizon's version
the<00:00:30.060> from<00:00:30.240> design<00:00:30.510> aspect<00:00:31.050> remains<00:00:31.529> faithful

the from design aspect remains faithful

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.590 
the from design aspect remains faithful
to<00:00:32.219> pretty<00:00:32.489> much<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:32.850> already<00:00:33.000> saw<00:00:33.360> on

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
to pretty much what we already saw on

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.569 
to pretty much what we already saw on
verizon's<00:00:34.200> version<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.399> compare

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
verizon's version but when you compare

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.250 
verizon's version but when you compare
to<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.180> original<00:00:36.210> palm<00:00:36.690> pre<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> only

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to the original palm pre the only

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
to the original palm pre the only
difference<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.040> course<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.850> missing

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
difference is of course the it's missing

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.880 
difference is of course the it's missing
the<00:00:39.210> physical<00:00:40.020> hardware<00:00:40.320> button<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the physical hardware button in the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.920 
the physical hardware button in the
gesture<00:00:41.280> area<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:42.149> do<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.510> fact<00:00:42.629> that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
gesture area we do like the fact that

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410 
gesture area we do like the fact that
has<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> clean-looking<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.579> know<00:00:44.700> look<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.270> it

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
has a clean-looking you know look to it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
has a clean-looking you know look to it
in<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> front<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.710> gesture<00:00:47.039> area<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.399> now

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
in the front the gesture area is now

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.220 
in the front the gesture area is now
touch<00:00:47.879> sensitive<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.510> button<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.050> press

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
touch sensitive the button is you press

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.260 
touch sensitive the button is you press
in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.469> middle<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> piano

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
in the middle and we do like the piano

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
do like the the snapping mechanism it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.080 
do like the the snapping mechanism it
has<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> relatively<00:01:19.470> good<00:01:19.650> response<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.640> so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
has a relatively good response to it so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.310

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.330 
the platform I'm going to say it's quite
refreshing<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:11.319> use<00:03:11.500> just<00:03:11.829> because<00:03:12.129> it's

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
refreshing to use just because it's

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.920 
refreshing to use just because it's
quite<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:12.940> different<00:03:13.389> versus<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:13.900> other

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
quite so different versus the other

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.960 
quite so different versus the other
platforms<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:14.680> are<00:03:14.799> available<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.790> biggest

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
platforms that are available the biggest

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.699 
platforms that are available the biggest
thing<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.420> focuses<00:03:16.599> on<00:03:17.049> is<00:03:17.319> multitasking

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
thing that it focuses on is multitasking

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.159 
thing that it focuses on is multitasking
with<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.430> cards<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:18.879> are<00:03:19.030> open<00:03:19.090> up<00:03:19.389> if<00:03:19.989> it

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
with the cards that are open up if it

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.020 
with the cards that are open up if it
essentially<00:03:20.829> run<00:03:20.980> multiple<00:03:21.370> applications

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
essentially run multiple applications

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.569 
essentially run multiple applications
and<00:03:22.299> it<00:03:22.540> pretty<00:03:22.870> much<00:03:22.989> runs<00:03:23.199> really<00:03:23.739> quick<00:03:24.160> we

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
and it pretty much runs really quick we

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.520 
and it pretty much runs really quick we
didn't<00:03:25.090> notice<00:03:25.209> too<00:03:25.480> much<00:03:25.629> of<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.840> lag<00:03:26.019> or<00:03:26.230> slow

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
didn't notice too much of a lag or slow

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.050

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
pause every now and then the experience

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.330 
pause every now and then the experience
is<00:03:30.040> pretty<00:03:30.250> good<00:03:30.400> with<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.819> palm<00:03:31.180> pre<00:03:31.419> plus
