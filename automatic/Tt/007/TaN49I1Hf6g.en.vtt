00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.190
 pgx teen 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:31.800
 It is what also say so myself that eating Kedomo every time you play every time in playing this game 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:36.690
 When there are very few things that the same result will be 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.670
 There is a new discovery every time you are on your second trip, even on your first pass 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.870
 Because that the enemy will come out at the timing that you do not imagine in that or there is a surprise 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.180
 There are many 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.350
 So I'm just going to check on my own sister Carla Kumah I'm surprised to be playing in the water 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.440
 To 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.530
 It has a pretty 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:58.060
 It is said that there is a difference with that car immediately 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:03.490
 I think it's a very big attraction 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.840
 When the I to those that do is I Well Rachel and Sukyagudeddo of struggle Yes 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.050
 I 'm saying 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.310
 In particular, it is around the time of Rachel students 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:16.750
 Although Well this is it's strong towards the Ettoano voice 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.490
 The bgm 4 also has an image that seems to be the strongest music in the series 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.780
 Opened in Well Tempo is another one part 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.280
 The pitch of the instrument becomes irresistible and the pitch of the instrument 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.830
 It Nemaa have so kind of policy 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.930
 Expressing the meaning of strength 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.850
 I'm sorry to hear that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:40.140
 I think you can enjoy it 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:44.820
 Yes Well it's also leads to a place called here is Hey Well origin regression even though 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.790
 Of course the space being reduced in tax is like a place to explore above 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.800
 Well, I kinda thought that if there is to that contains the look 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:58.080
 Of course , there are a lot of scenes that I am surprised, of course songs 8 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:04.280
 Not you are in a dare is it uneasy atmosphere 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:06.030
 So from Well item in the strong music without changing the evaluation 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.020
 It will be the outside 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.410
 Is not it has become a well to look at Tteyuu such a high gradually the Reference 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.410
