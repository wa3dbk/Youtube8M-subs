00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.070

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.720
 mini format and the tax quasi one 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.800
 but also your pc or 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.570
 TV I have the whole one already 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.910
 connected for you 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.540
 that means we can get started right away 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.850
 Can via the call list directly 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.399
 set up a telephone call 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.329
 Of course I can also mine 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.670

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.690
 Just answer it for a moment 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.520

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.410
 meanwhile, my big phone is 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.410
 for example, all the time in the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.399
 Briefcase and I have the little one 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.229

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.710

 Presentations before that look back 

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:37.679
