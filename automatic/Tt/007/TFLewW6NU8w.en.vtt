00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.620
 happy birthday channel happy 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.809
 canada birthday will make nano friends 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.269
 I'm not crazy what happens is that 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.540
 as you can read in the title meets a 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.630
 year on youtube and on the 21st I was actually 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.159
 extra not for as long as they were 21 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.900
 November to be able to celebrate my 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:24.419
 first anniversary on youtube here in my 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.189
 channel in Spanish that the truth is that 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.140
 when the melody came, not even 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.630
 I remembered what that was, if I remembered 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.489
 It was 21 but what happened to me was 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.850
 the mere day then then we are already 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.860
 22 or 23 or so and still friends 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.440
 I say no problem the fact is that it makes 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.420
 two days to complete a year here and I want 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.120
 take advantage of in this comment 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.360
 tell them more or less how it was that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.800
 all this came up a little bit about 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.230
 after my stay here on youtube 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 on this channel in this case my second 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.130
 channel in fact and everything because I do not know 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.870
 tell you a little about this friends 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.270
 then I will start nothing else 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.610
 telling them that this is a very 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.739
 very dynamic very fast I liked it 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.340
 that's why I chose 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.170
 I'm playing with the m 27 in terms of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.930
 the tips that could power them from this weapon 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.360
 Well, I can tell you, friends, it 's a 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.189
 weapon that I've been using with the sights of 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.220
 iron sites that is to say if a red dot 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.340
 or anything with fast mac like they can also 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.470
 see in this video and just like I am 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.780
 using it has worked quite well for me 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.520
 I am seen that I just love fast 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.460
 that's why they see also what position and position and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.409
 charge but I believe that if it is 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.869
 definitely as if I recommend them 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.670
 I have used it with red dot also and not 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.350
 it has worked for me as he is very much 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.959
 people who kill too much with a dot 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.659
 red but in my case I do not know 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.250
 then give me friends then in this 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.100
 occasion will not be the subject of 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.049
 conversation as you have already assumed and 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.090
 let me tell you that lately I've 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.530
 I enjoyed a lot black ops 2 me 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.439
 I dare say that after each tour 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.450
 and 4 is a game that wow friends do not know 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.909
 like him as enjoyed in everything 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.649
 is the bad thing about making comments with the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.420
 first impressions that as a nothing 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.220
 more has played very little time sometimes 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.440
 like criticizing a lot the game that was 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.490
 what happened to me there were even those who 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.800
 they asked room voucher 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.560
 in the game and flat out I said no no no 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.650
 no and then now I regret it because 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.210
 Believe me, I do not know, I do not know how 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.000
 explain it I just enjoyed it 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.810
 You will tell me enough what you think 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.760
 but good friends to see to see ok now 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.250
 yes talking about my first anniversary 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.770
 let me tell you that I a year ago 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.920
 I was very hesitant to wish 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.470
 I do not do it I do it I do not do it 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.900
 In the end I decided to do it and what 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.210
 I did then it was just to mention 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.590
 about my channel to some friends that 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.030
 you will know about coverage and four 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.340
 I said they know that after he's on a channel 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.890
 in Spanish because they do not support me, they subscribe 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.490
 etcetera then I started on my first 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.610
 day I started with 20 subscribers nothing more 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.680
 this little by little I was acquiring more in 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.750
 how about my walk here on youtube I 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.080
 I think it was very important also 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.220
 help that some youtubers gave me 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.460
 first of all they made me a 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.150
 interview that made me give wealth 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.340
 unfortunately , the interview is not 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.880
 they may vary because they took away their 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.990
 youtube channel took it away then 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.420
 first he did an interview with me 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.340
 then even though I had it many 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.200
 subscribers that is many speaking as 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.290
 of thousands and thousands but he had a good 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.150
 This amount helps me a lot because 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.940
 many people went to my channel was 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.300
 supporting and all time later also 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.850
 receives the support of the Álex capon 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.320
 no friend álex el este 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.730
 So he sent me a message that if I wanted 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.130
 an interview and I said you know it was 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.640
 if we let it be amazing too 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.100
 go through one reason and another but it came out 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.110
 of the episode of helping on youtube in 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.570
 his channel then was when I turned 500 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.570
 subscribers that I sent my video was 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.220
 when I had the interview I'm 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.930
 talking friends that when he made it to me 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.640
 had 500 subscribers and after 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.070
 inta of the interview come as to the 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.130
 800 900 subscribers in two days 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.500
 then it was very much support from 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.940
 some also like the charro halo 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.470
 Estela of the Ag el I met him 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.870
 when he had about a thousand subscribers 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.320
 2000 subscribers and that's when we decided 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.050
 exchange your product or not this 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.880
 for his fate his box for his box ie 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.220
 I add it to my PSUV box and 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.840
 yours then then greetings are several 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.740
 the youtubers that have supported me in this 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.270
 path with friends is that let me overcome 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.980
 I tell mom to turn down the TV 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.980
 because I think you hear it up here 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.970
 forgive friends forgiveness for this now 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.920
 if I'm not going to heal because then that 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.930
 I was going to say friends is that it has also 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.700
 been several neighborhoods this much support 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.500
 from other youtubers for example also 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.230
 I sent my Mexican video gameplay 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.420
 then also there this this one was not 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.640
 sorry I had several interviews the 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.350
 first was good I had those two and apart 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.780
 I sent my Mexican video gameplay and 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.750
 it was also there as in my channel began 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.270
 to grow up then friends like that was a 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.130
 little bit of how I was going up and how 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.010
 I consider that this year has been very 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.960
 good because it almost reaches 100,000 to 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.610
 100,000 channel views and 2 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.410
 thousand subscribers I'm like 50 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.900
 subscribers more or less than 2000 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.970
 I think for a year I was pretty 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.460
 well and more if we put to consideration 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.970
 that I was out as of three or 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.320
 four months then still come back 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.120
 upload a video I said I was on 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.610
 come back and it was still like another month that 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.200
 I was absent because if we put all that 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.600
 in consideration I think it's been a year 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.190
 excellent I want first of all because 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.810
 to thank god because without him 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.640
 would have been impossible and also to 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.300
 you forced your real support really 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.940
 what 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.349
 thank you very much friends and good friends 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.909
 I have to hurry because nothing else 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.500
 there are two minutes to talk about this 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:07.139
 so important that about the raffle that 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.430

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.289
 be the next I'll enough 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.569
 some questions are very complicated other 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.919
 more or less and others are easy and the 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:16.110
 first inbox that I get with the 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.750

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.110

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.370

 then please mentioned that in 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.969
 the comments of this video do not 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.409

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:49.949

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.699
 moment in three maybe some are going to 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:58.830
 hate for this maybe havana 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.990

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.719
 the fairest for all those who have 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.560
 been therefore always supporting me then 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:07.260
 and later 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.030
 and also another raffle that simply because 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.100
 be it like the raffles that all 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.340
 we know not that you leave your comment and 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.110
 in a raffle then to see who wins not in 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.850
 this occasion in which also make 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.650
 this way because how many do not we 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.380
 We complain that we say there, never 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.180
 won nothing in those draws because I do not know 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.430
 how nothing ever won and so on 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.889
 then here, then, simply with 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.210
 put a little bit of desire and read the 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:32.850
 titles of the videos that are going to be 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.310
 keys read the descriptions all 

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.050
 you can earn nothing more as tip if you 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.610
 I give that friends that they put a lot 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.710
 attention to the titles because as such 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.720
 it does not come but it's going to be key so 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.060
 so they can find the answer 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.410
 correct of some of the questions 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.870
 so then I say goodbye here to 

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.030
 I'm going to leave the questions and 

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.770
 this and then also all those who 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.290
 are watching this video listening to this 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.840
 tomorrow because of work or even 

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.400
 the night the mood can participate 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.460
 still because the questions are not 

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:05.990
 So so easy then I wish you 

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.990
 the best and thank you for all your support
