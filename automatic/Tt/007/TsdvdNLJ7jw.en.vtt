then that tail will move on for the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.520 
then that tail will move on for the
balancing<00:02:28.280> operation<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.810> balanced<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.440> it

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530

the<00:02:58.760> tyre<00:02:58.970> fitters<00:02:59.390> need<00:02:59.630> somewhere<00:03:00.020> to<00:03:00.260> to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
the tyre fitters need somewhere to to

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.500 
the tyre fitters need somewhere to to
get<00:03:01.130> their<00:03:01.310> food<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.580> their<00:03:01.850> brakes<00:03:02.180> because

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
we run with two options at the moment we

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:31.930 
we run with two options at the moment we
have<00:03:30.890> three<00:03:31.160> for<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.459> beginning<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.850> the

a<00:03:34.880> medium<00:03:35.390> tyre<00:03:35.570> and<00:03:35.750> a<00:03:35.780> hard<00:03:35.989> tyre<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:37.340> then

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
a medium tyre and a hard tyre and then

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.910 
a medium tyre and a hard tyre and then
they<00:03:37.880> have<00:03:38.030> one<00:03:38.269> choice<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:39.170> intermediate

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
they have one choice of intermediate

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.190 
they have one choice of intermediate
tire<00:03:40.130> it's<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.550> molded<00:03:40.940> intermediate<00:03:41.540> for<00:03:41.840> if

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
tire it's a molded intermediate for if

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.550 
tire it's a molded intermediate for if
you<00:03:42.380> like<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:43.030> conditions<00:03:44.030> between<00:03:44.420> a<00:03:45.050> fully

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
you like and conditions between a fully

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.560 
you like and conditions between a fully
wet<00:03:45.800> track<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.640> dry<00:03:46.820> track<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.420> then

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
wet track and a dry track and then

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.870 
wet track and a dry track and then
there's<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> full<00:03:48.110> rein<00:03:48.709> tire<00:03:48.980> option<00:03:49.489> which<00:03:49.850> is

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
there's a full rein tire option which is

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.000 
there's a full rein tire option which is
obviously<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.330> very<00:03:50.510> soft<00:03:50.720> compound<00:03:51.049> and<00:03:51.709> with

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
obviously a very soft compound and with

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.280 
obviously a very soft compound and with
a<00:03:52.040> heavily<00:03:52.370> tread<00:03:52.880> pattern<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.810> purpose<00:03:54.200> of

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
a heavily tread pattern the purpose of

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.520 
a heavily tread pattern the purpose of
which<00:03:54.440> is<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.709> clear<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.670> water<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.530> the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
which is to clear the water and the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.990 
which is to clear the water and the
reason<00:03:57.799> that<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:58.010> compound<00:03:58.340> is<00:03:58.400> very<00:03:58.549> soft<00:03:58.790> is

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
reason that the compound is very soft is

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.240 
reason that the compound is very soft is
to<00:03:59.090> generate<00:03:59.330> heat<00:03:59.660> which<00:03:59.930> is<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:00.860> best<00:04:01.040> way

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
to generate heat which is the best way

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:14.710 
to generate heat which is the best way
of<00:04:01.280> providing<00:04:01.670> grip<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.269> right<00:04:02.420> up

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.270 

and<00:04:15.290> address<00:04:15.740> they're<00:04:15.980> all<00:04:16.190> back

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
and address they're all back

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.400 
and address they're all back
