we<00:01:21.310> have<00:01:21.459> compression<00:01:22.060> which<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.600> ratio

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
we have compression which is the ratio

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.099 
we have compression which is the ratio
threshold<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.969> amount<00:01:25.209> of<00:01:25.359> compression<00:01:25.719> and

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
threshold the amount of compression and

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.149 
threshold the amount of compression and
we<00:01:26.380> have<00:01:26.770> gained<00:01:27.130> which<00:01:27.780> has<00:01:28.780> 20<00:01:29.259> decibels<00:01:29.679> of

delay<00:01:45.929> so<00:01:46.929> here<00:01:47.349> is<00:01:47.500> my<00:01:47.739> clean<00:01:48.039> signal

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.540 

has<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.040> very<00:02:43.220> warm<00:02:43.819> quality<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.550> it

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
has a very warm quality to it and it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.640 
has a very warm quality to it and it
just<00:02:46.610> really<00:02:47.150> fattens<00:02:47.599> up<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:47.959> warms<00:02:48.290> up<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
just really fattens up and warms up the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.229 
just really fattens up and warms up the
guitar<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.280> levels<00:02:50.000> things<00:02:50.209> out<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:52.239> here's

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
guitar and levels things out and here's

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.030 
guitar and levels things out and here's
the<00:02:54.760> GC<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.000> with<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.989> clean<00:02:57.260> signal<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:57.890> then

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the GC to with the clean signal and then

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.160 
the GC to with the clean signal and then
we'll<00:02:58.280> engage<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.790> clon<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.360> hear<00:02:59.930> how<00:03:00.110> the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
we'll engage the clon and hear how the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.910 
we'll engage the clon and hear how the
GC<00:03:00.769> -<00:03:01.060> compressor<00:03:02.060> interacts<00:03:02.560> with<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.680> claun

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
GC - compressor interacts with the claun

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.710 
GC - compressor interacts with the claun
and<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.459> running<00:03:04.670> before<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.120> clon<00:03:05.450> so

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
and it's running before the clon so

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.930 
and it's running before the clon so
we're<00:03:06.470> leveling<00:03:06.980> out<00:03:07.130> the<00:03:07.370> signal<00:03:07.760> and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
we're leveling out the signal and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.820 
we're leveling out the signal and
fattening<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.450> up<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.959> overdrive<00:03:09.410> sounds

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
fattening it up so the overdrive sounds

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:42.009 
fattening it up so the overdrive sounds
much<00:03:19.840> let's<00:03:20.840> engage<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.349> claw<00:03:40.780> here's<00:03:41.780> the

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
much let's engage the claw here's the

00:03:42.019 --> 00:04:02.770 
much let's engage the claw here's the
client<00:03:42.410> by<00:03:42.500> itself

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.120 

now<00:04:03.780> let's<00:04:04.050> turn<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.410> compression<00:04:04.890> down<00:04:05.099> a

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
now let's turn the compression down a

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.780 
now let's turn the compression down a
bit

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
bit

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.210 
bit
and<00:04:06.560> we<00:04:07.560> can<00:04:07.709> hear<00:04:08.810> how<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:09.870> can<00:04:10.110> just<00:04:10.319> subtly

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
and we can hear how you can just subtly

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.220 
and we can hear how you can just subtly
compress<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.150> guitar<00:04:12.450> or<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.780> can<00:04:12.930> kind<00:04:13.170> of

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
compress the guitar or you can kind of

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.500 
compress the guitar or you can kind of
go<00:04:13.380> really<00:04:13.769> squashing<00:04:14.430> just<00:04:14.670> really<00:04:15.300> have

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
go really squashing just really have

00:04:15.510 --> 00:06:06.159 
go really squashing just really have
that<00:04:15.690> spongy<00:04:16.260> sound

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.100 

I<00:06:06.400> like<00:06:07.400> how<00:06:07.610> it<00:06:07.759> sounds<00:06:07.969> pretty<00:06:08.360> transparent

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
I like how it sounds pretty transparent

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.309 
I like how it sounds pretty transparent
even<00:06:09.289> with<00:06:09.879> cranked<00:06:10.879> up<00:06:10.999> settings<00:06:11.960> like<00:06:12.080> that

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 
even with cranked up settings like that

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.379 
even with cranked up settings like that
let's<00:06:13.129> add<00:06:13.279> some<00:06:13.550> delay<00:06:13.729> and<00:06:13.879> hear<00:06:14.210> how<00:06:14.330> that

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
let's add some delay and hear how that

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:32.310 
let's add some delay and hear how that
sounds<00:06:14.870> like

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.380 

you
