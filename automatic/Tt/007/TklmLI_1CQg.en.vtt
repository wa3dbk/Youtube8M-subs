00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.550
 aesthetically striking 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.550
 but fast and furious 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.779
 how fast are you welcome to consult doctor gildo 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.150
 insfrÃ¡n aboard the mitsubishi lancer 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.070
 this time we have men of that age for now 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.599
 not easy 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.979
 the first thing that catches the attention of this vehicle is it packs five 

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:29.269
 stars concluded few we have also aerodynamic elements 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.920
 overturned in the lower part of the vehicle practically its entire perimeter 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.680
 we have with side air intakes of the parents 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.610
 to facilitate the counts 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.580
 and we also have 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.100
 standards could placed in the back 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
 situation that can limit slightly the difficult 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.420
 later we find good as part of your equipment or the matter 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.190
 awoke safe electric demand crystals 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.350
 we have controls on the steering wheel for the sound equipment we also have 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.320
 Cruise control speed 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.780
 i of this millionaire who always differentiates from the person is that we have 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.730
 a travel computer 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.119
 they have to investigate color situation that facilitated a lot 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.330
 or it will be that we are found 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.510
 in this sense 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.960
 the snapshot performance bar that changes color depending on whether 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.680
 we are up or down 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.380
 said fuel average 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.990
 Miter of course we have a 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 this sound equipment with him 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.870
 It is very nice the performance we have also 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.479
 the legislators say in the name of freedom 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.649
 if you congratulate 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:33.630
 the textiles 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.530
 the one covered by those present 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.990
 minetti if you wonder if it will be enough to cover 20% of 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.880
 difference between each other that is 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.670
 between the version of that gps analysis 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.540
 well we can also better we have a 20% more remote we have a 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.620
 2-point motor 4 liters 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.790
 as soon as its displacement with 2 20 percent greater 2 73% very arrogant 14% 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.580
 more torque 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.220
 and that it will not mean salts front wheels 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.980
 according to the controversy between 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.860
 of celestial team that has programmed six steps that can be operated 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.210
 of the gear lever 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.289
 as it said the finding of worms pallets that are behind the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.479
 steering wheel 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:12.979
 with these characteristics 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.279
 michel ancel can have acceleration from zero to one hundred kilometers per hour 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:19.719
 in question Beijing 12 seconds 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.049
 yes we try to recover that is to say it does a good order of march from 80 to 120 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.299
 kilometers per hour we will find figures of seven and a half 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.749
 seconds 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.739
 figures that take us away 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.789
 much of the week version with 2-liter engine 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.639
 however it is important to say that we find 18-inch wheels and 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.219
 also percent finding in this my fault 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:44.219
 the sport suspension as it marks his technical sheet 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.900
 emilio very trite entered two local automotive mitsubishi 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.570
 lancer 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.819
 of the fcse 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.009
 Make sense 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.149
 what do I mean with west of mosul 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:57.279
 vehicles with outstanding handling it is important to mention that the 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.919
 management perception 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.919
 to the already in itself the sensation that the sentence 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.689
 to achieve the goal 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.569
 before the work party 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.889
 the steering wheel came off 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.429
 portillo is leaving 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.679
 easy to go 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:20.009
 Well of course you will have an excellent promotion to import how long a 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:24.609
 acts that have clues when you get the approval of the tlc vehicle offer 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.449
 a very nice driving sensation 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.699
 expired puts the association was initially detected say 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:34.729
 coupled with this the outstanding dynamic behavior 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.729
 of course we have cd 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.079
 this allowed the palettes behind the wheel that allow us 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.229
 still make the driving more agile, so we can solve the 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.769
 Opera vehicle or allow accelerations 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.489
 jan brewer trained by fao as a button shows and of course the 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.019
 path allows it 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.849
 the arrests of this vehicle is one kilometers per hour but good for the 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.339
 44 meters 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.019
 flat tolima 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.149
 case of compostela so far 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.469
 here we have system followed 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.399
 the fuel efficiency 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:08.049
 for desserts 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.900
 is very similar to the one we got in the session of this manual with a 2-motor 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.429
 liters of 10 kilometers per liter is all percent 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:19.410
 interestingly, it happens thanks to the fact that this engine is bigger than ever 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.869
 priest who at all times using fuel efficiency 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:27.350
 however it is also important to mention that stanford 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.570
 2 points 4 liters is much more sensitive to the pressure we exert on the 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.509
 pedal 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.949
 have important variations as a forum 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.110
 therefore we do not accept as controversial after getting rid of 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.699
 well just because this vehicle is that they allow us 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:44.509
 Recovery 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:45.569
 there very agile 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.729
 it is important to say that 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.939
 skaters rim so to speak skid drift of the current forward to the 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.379
 moment of acceleration in addition to that of the whole motors company thinking 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.379
 the protection of the min system 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.330
 of this mine that is always focused towards where 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.809
 that's impossible 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:07.399
 happy and 'night 10' it is important to mention that the best of this vehicle 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.970
 its driving is related to the level of adequate equipment without 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.139
 a proportions inner peace 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:16.969
 adequate also in his day 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.029
 inside the museum a complete basic security thanks to some seats 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.240
 they hold well 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.020
 and seven airbags located inside 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.930
 the best part to the bottom definitely women who have outstanding that 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.540
 mitsubishi lancer no matter what he presumes we are talking about is control 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:33.999
 of stability 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.529
 mccalebb in Turkey is practically standard in all 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.189
 vehicles of its own 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:41.469
 intervals of three 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:42.870
 very good friends this 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.889
 all this happens a fool of these indigenous peoples in their pdf version 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.400
 It is worth mentioning that 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.270
 efe - oxfam 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.150
 in the comments section for anything that is offered 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.169
 thanks and see you soon
