us<00:02:42.290> by<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.740> sea<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.490> some<00:02:43.790> sea<00:02:44.030> horses<00:02:44.420> a

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
us by the sea and some sea horses a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.500 
us by the sea and some sea horses a
sailboat<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.790> ek<00:02:47.450> success<00:02:48.380> punch

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
sailboat and this is a ek success punch

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.140 
sailboat and this is a ek success punch
so<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.540> just<00:02:50.840> layered<00:02:51.260> it<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.700> meaning

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
so I just layered it and the the meaning

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.960 
so I just layered it and the the meaning
for<00:02:53.330> this<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.720> also<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:54.980> can<00:02:55.220> be<00:02:55.400> taken

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
for this is also that it can be taken

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.750 
for this is also that it can be taken
with<00:02:56.240> you<00:02:56.510> in<00:02:56.720> your<00:02:56.930> bag<00:02:57.290> or<00:02:57.530> anything<00:02:58.430> so

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
with you in your bag or anything so

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.150 
with you in your bag or anything so
that's<00:02:59.000> why<00:02:59.330> I<00:02:59.360> haven't<00:03:00.020> popped<00:03:00.380> anything<00:03:00.980> up

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
that's why I haven't popped anything up

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.970 
that's why I haven't popped anything up
and<00:03:01.459> glued<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.390> all<00:03:02.630> down<00:03:02.840> with<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:03.170> multi<00:03:03.800> mat

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
and glued it all down with a multi mat

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.199 
and glued it all down with a multi mat
so<00:03:04.850> it's<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:05.300> safe<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.840> carry<00:03:06.290> with<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.790> this

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
so it's a safe to carry with you so this

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.199 
so it's a safe to carry with you so this
is<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.450> build<00:03:08.930> up<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.290> same<00:03:09.530> way<00:03:09.739> as<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.340> ATC

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
is a build up the same way as the ATC

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.380 
is a build up the same way as the ATC
yeah<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.750> can't<00:03:12.530> hold<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.920> wallet<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.850> book<00:03:14.209> I

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
yeah I can't hold a wallet the book I

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.440 
yeah I can't hold a wallet the book I
made<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:16.010> if<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.370> haven't<00:03:16.700> seen<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.270> will

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
made so if you haven't seen it I will

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.990 
made so if you haven't seen it I will
link<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.020> it<00:03:18.290> below<00:03:18.590> it's<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.190> bit<00:03:19.400> smaller<00:03:19.850> so

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
link to it below it's a bit smaller so

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.460 
link to it below it's a bit smaller so
you<00:03:20.660> can<00:03:20.870> make<00:03:21.080> this<00:03:21.290> any<00:03:21.650> size<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.489> like

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
you can make this any size you like

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.710 
you can make this any size you like
so<00:03:24.470> remember<00:03:25.010> here<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.400> says<00:03:25.670> Pollin<00:03:26.540> and

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
so remember here it says Pollin and

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.880 
so remember here it says Pollin and
that's<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.739> name<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.760> cabin<00:03:29.090> and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
that's the name of the cabin and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.620 
that's the name of the cabin and
lighthouse<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.370> just<00:03:31.700> get<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.090> plane<00:03:32.360> on

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
lighthouse and I just get the plane on

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.380 
lighthouse and I just get the plane on
the<00:03:32.930> back<00:03:33.110> here<00:03:33.410> for<00:03:33.650> another<00:03:34.390> lighthouse

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
the back here for another lighthouse

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.420 
the back here for another lighthouse
here<00:03:35.690> it's<00:03:36.620> no<00:03:36.739> seagulls

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
here it's no seagulls

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.330 
here it's no seagulls
so<00:03:38.689> and<00:03:39.689> it<00:03:39.810> opens<00:03:40.200> here<00:03:40.260> it<00:03:40.739> holds<00:03:41.129> together

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
so and it opens here it holds together

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.030 
so and it opens here it holds together
with<00:03:41.790> magnets<00:03:42.269> here<00:03:42.719> so<00:03:45.109> here<00:03:46.109> are<00:03:46.439> the<00:03:46.829> photo

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
with magnets here so here are the photo

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.490 
with magnets here so here are the photo
mats<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.579> maybe<00:03:47.819> I<00:03:48.120> need<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.659> zoom<00:03:49.019> out<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.290> bit

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
mats and maybe I need to zoom out a bit

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:57.949 
mats and maybe I need to zoom out a bit
here<00:03:53.450> here<00:03:54.450> about<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.909> opens<00:03:57.269> this<00:03:57.719> way

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
here here about so it opens this way

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.250 
here here about so it opens this way
them<00:03:58.260> this<00:03:58.799> way<00:03:59.060> so<00:04:00.060> here<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.420> can<00:04:00.659> keep<00:04:00.870> at

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
them this way so here you can keep at

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.179 
them this way so here you can keep at
least<00:04:01.290> 60<00:04:02.219> photos<00:04:02.549> I<00:04:03.030> think<00:04:03.299> I<00:04:03.480> counted<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:04.139> him

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189 
least 60 photos I think I counted to him

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.759 
least 60 photos I think I counted to him
so<00:04:05.189> it's<00:04:05.730> so<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.689> can<00:04:06.900> see<00:04:07.079> here<00:04:07.290> it's<00:04:07.439> a<00:04:07.590> bit

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
so it's so you can see here it's a bit

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.440 
so it's so you can see here it's a bit
dimensional<00:04:08.730> here<00:04:08.939> so<00:04:09.780> if<00:04:10.879> so<00:04:11.879> we<00:04:12.060> can<00:04:12.209> build

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
dimensional here so if so we can build

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.310 
dimensional here so if so we can build
up<00:04:12.659> a<00:04:12.840> bit<00:04:13.019> here<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.379> also<00:04:13.739> have<00:04:13.950> some<00:04:14.340> leftover

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
up a bit here I also have some leftover

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.069 
up a bit here I also have some leftover
firstly<00:04:16.320> cut<00:04:16.470> from<00:04:17.150> there's<00:04:18.150> some<00:04:18.389> shell<00:04:18.720> some

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
firstly cut from there's some shell some

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.589 
firstly cut from there's some shell some
different<00:04:19.590> things<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:20.130> then<00:04:20.880> she<00:04:21.060> can<00:04:21.239> pop<00:04:21.419> it

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
different things and then she can pop it

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.790 
different things and then she can pop it
up<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:21.959> there<00:04:22.229> so<00:04:22.889> its<00:04:23.039> place<00:04:23.370> here<00:04:23.509> too<00:04:24.800> to

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
up and there so its place here too to

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.100 
up and there so its place here too to
make<00:04:26.550> something<00:04:26.820> dimensional<00:04:28.160> so<00:04:29.160> yeah<00:04:30.110> just

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
make something dimensional so yeah just

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.710 
make something dimensional so yeah just
pull<00:04:31.320> up<00:04:31.349> and<00:04:31.710> show<00:04:31.949> you<00:04:32.009> here<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:32.849> I<00:04:32.880> didn't

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
pull up and show you here so I didn't

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.510 
pull up and show you here so I didn't
add<00:04:33.870> anything<00:04:34.229> on<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.620> back<00:04:34.800> edge<00:04:35.009> so<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:35.250> can

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
add anything on the back edge so you can

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.089 
add anything on the back edge so you can
do<00:04:35.669> some<00:04:35.880> journaling<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:40.080> frontiers<00:04:40.620> she

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
do some journaling and the frontiers she

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.760 
do some journaling and the frontiers she
can<00:04:41.310> add<00:04:41.849> some<00:04:42.210> photos<00:04:42.659> maybe<00:04:42.960> even<00:04:43.289> just<00:04:43.500> one

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
can add some photos maybe even just one

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.659 
can add some photos maybe even just one
on<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.099> side<00:04:44.340> or<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.550> four<00:04:45.349> 4x6<00:04:46.349> a<00:04:46.620> photo<00:04:46.889> so

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
on the side or a four 4x6 a photo so

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.600 
on the side or a four 4x6 a photo so
these<00:04:47.909> photo<00:04:48.479> mats<00:04:48.810> are<00:04:49.130> six<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.430> quarter

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
these photo mats are six and a quarter

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.180 
these photo mats are six and a quarter
by<00:04:51.150> four<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.840> quarter<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.650> matting<00:04:53.010> is

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
by four and a quarter and the matting is

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.290 
by four and a quarter and the matting is
four<00:04:53.520> by<00:04:53.729> six<00:04:55.130> so<00:04:56.130> now<00:04:56.370> they<00:04:56.520> are<00:04:56.550> all<00:04:56.669> filled

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
four by six so now they are all filled

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.469 
four by six so now they are all filled
up<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.720> same<00:04:57.960> here<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:59.340> this<00:04:59.580> slides<00:04:59.970> in<00:05:00.210> here

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
up the same here so this slides in here

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.110 
up the same here so this slides in here
so<00:05:00.840> this<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.229> added<00:05:01.979> some<00:05:02.250> of<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.610> mat<00:05:02.760> so<00:05:03.000> we

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
so this I added some of the mat so we
