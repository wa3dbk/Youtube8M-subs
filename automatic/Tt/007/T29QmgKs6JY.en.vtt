00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello you love we get now 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.069
 finally the requested bee sting 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.810
 I have him for me now 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.760
 cooked well and shows now briefly 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.340
 it's easy to get trained 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.820
 he needs some ingredients first 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.310
 start with 50 grams of wheat as 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.900
 next we need 150 grams raw 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.980
 cane sugar also minutes like one 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.760
 pinch salt a piece of yeast must be one 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.320
 whole pack of some oil I take here 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.040
 sunflower if it is more neutral 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.420
 Soy milk wallpaper soy rice taken 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.559
 or another vegan margarine and 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.149
 then finally planed 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.789
 almonds namely 300 grams 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.800
 we give it to the fall gram 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.860
 give flour into a bowl to give 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.340
 then 100 grams of powdered sugar from the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.949
 The whole thing first and then goes 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.000
 Add a pinch of salt to it 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.620
 around 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.730
 Next, press my trough in the 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.730
 middle and crumble the help in there 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.470
 that's what it looks like next 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.329
 we take the 250 milliliter milk on 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.329
 best first grab a measuring cup 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.630
 then he gives that means if and warmed up 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.460
 That should be together with three tablespoons 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.550
 nice to be lukewarm later 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.550
 there is that the yeast and dissolves 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.560
 when it is warm, that gives you that 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.140
 yeast and thus the highest easier 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.500
 on whom have entered all this then 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.400
 that would be pretty good and leaves so 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.890
 also the preliminary work for the 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.420
 kitchen machine later if you like the whole 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.790
 a bit mixed well what did it 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.530
 does not have to be perfect 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.350
 The whole comes with a knethaken in 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.450
 a stirrer and returned the whole 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 good by so that afterwards a nice 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.960
 supple dough arises 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.000
 it can also sting the looks 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.030
 and that's why I just give it 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.270
 lid on the kitchen not supplied 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.730
 becomes 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.440
 the day is good think well of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.880
 kneading hooks do not solve themselves in part 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.489
 is great what ever you see 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.200
 works well for me then I crow 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.520
 again with the hand through the soli for 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.520
 tag likes to learn hand as well 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.019
 and then in the next step if that 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.989
 a player klum - I give about 30 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.480
 minutes to bypass bowl as 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.790
 next, a bit of flour and 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.129
 There would be something on the worktop 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.870
 knead the day through again and that me 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.299
 comes a little bit on a poodle 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.359
 wood then the carpet is rolled out 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.549
 as well as later on a baking tray 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.639
 Pope is then on a baking sheet with 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.709
 Baked paper designed each still so 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.510
 to the sides in the why best as 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.829
 possible to fill in and in the next 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.709
 step I make a small holes 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.829
 The world later received the mass 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.409
 the on top of it is stuck in there 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:10.739
 then I take as a fair 50 grams raw 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.540
 cane sugar and give it all together in 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.909
 a pot has melted in here 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.359
 and then you already have the mission 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:20.730
 The dream comes up that gives you 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.879
 just on your dough and distributed that 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.010
 good if all corners so looks the whole 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.260
 then that gives the ten minutes in 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.079
 Preheat the oven and then 20 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.060
 minutes of land in the oven at 200 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.340
 Grad is heated 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.379
 I hope you would have liked that and 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.180
 You try it and I am very much 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.509
 then please give me a change 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.509
 high
