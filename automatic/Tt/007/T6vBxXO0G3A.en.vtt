00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.730
 2 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.870
 4 minutes 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.970
 This car wins at the circuit 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.970
 It is a car with the theme of such places 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:32.080
 The output looks different from the previous r 1 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.760
 Let me make one of the next generation from pl 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:43.500
 There's a design concept that mountain Speed Racer that I thought 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:48.150
 It was already clear and I was worried about the speed race. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:52.310
 To say I represent the speed began to think more deeply because what it 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.310
 That's where it was so difficult 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:05.060
 The memory I decided in the moment I saw the sketch I will go with this sketch no matter who says 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.060
 There is 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.890
 I've made that sketch by accident 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.320
 It is the moment when your judgment turns into conviction at the moment it becomes three-dimensional 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.700
 Boo Boo 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.570
 This car is a car with the theme of those places where you compete in the circuit 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:30.320
 So the weight reduction was also Daiei . 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:37.900
 Occupy a large factor in the weight and Dorabebi 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.900
 Especially the wheel I wanted to lighten this was the best wishes of the development team 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:48.320
 The first generation was developed with a slogan that says that only the number of pros now 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.870
 So when I developed this car, I thought it was not enough 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.870
 No excuses for pesticides 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:03.880
 Very and above meeting Kedomo I know only two words 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.880
 I think it was a heavy word for manufacturing 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:25.230
 This has especially raised the number of revolutions of the opposing mainstay of the engine in 1000 because more m 1 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.230
 I think you can hear the sound in the near rotation range 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.550
 I would like to focus on competition with rivals on such circuits 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.240
 Because it is a dead car 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.890
 If it is already input, it is a brake that works only for the amount entered 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.890
 We make a record in its place 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.540
 Here a do Kedomo is why riders to strengthen 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.130
 If you look at the face of the rider's student when you came back, you can see roughly 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:07.810
 It is so easy to handle that it is so easy to handle bonito and there is actually such a place that everyone can ride 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:13.980
 I often come to talk 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.980
 So it's not difficult to ride just because you 've kept good behavior 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.930
 The biggest excitement is 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:25.030
 I think that it is to go beyond yesterday's self 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:28.200
 That partner is this car I think it would be the best excitement 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.200
 It is a car that can do that
