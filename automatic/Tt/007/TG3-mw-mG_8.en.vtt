not entirely convinced about the design
of<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.489> cabin<00:00:57.909> basically<00:00:58.809> it<00:00:58.900> doesn't<00:00:59.049> quite

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
of the cabin basically it doesn't quite

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.340 
of the cabin basically it doesn't quite
feel<00:00:59.710> as<00:00:59.890> if<00:00:59.979> it's<00:01:00.390> 158,000<00:01:01.390> quids<00:01:01.600> worth<00:01:01.690> it's

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
feel as if it's 158,000 quids worth it's

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.560 
feel as if it's 158,000 quids worth it's
good<00:01:02.619> the<00:01:03.280> architecture<00:01:03.879> is<00:01:03.940> fine<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:04.390> the

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
good the architecture is fine and the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.680 
good the architecture is fine and the
ergonomics<00:01:05.530> are<00:01:05.650> very<00:01:05.830> very<00:01:06.040> sound<00:01:06.430> but<00:01:06.760> it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
ergonomics are very very sound but it

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.030 
ergonomics are very very sound but it
just<00:01:07.840> doesn't<00:01:08.110> quite<00:01:08.200> feel<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.530> million<00:01:08.860> bucks

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
just doesn't quite feel a million bucks

just doesn't quite feel a million bucks
inside<00:01:09.460> here<00:01:09.729> but<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.869> drive<00:01:11.140> I<00:01:11.619> really<00:01:12.220> like

very obviously rear-wheel drive you sit
a<00:01:23.170> long<00:01:23.440> way<00:01:23.590> back<00:01:23.860> it<00:01:24.100> almost<00:01:24.310> feels<00:01:24.670> as<00:01:24.790> if

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
a long way back it almost feels as if

a long way back it almost feels as if
you're<00:01:25.060> sitting<00:01:25.360> right<00:01:25.390> over<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.020> rear<00:01:26.200> axle

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230

you're sitting right over the rear axle
which<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:26.860> nice

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
which is nice

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.070 
which is nice

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
because the feel from the rear axle is

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.110 
because the feel from the rear axle is
really<00:01:29.350> good<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.830> steering<00:01:30.180> excellent

overall dynamic capability this thing
will<00:01:42.710> go<00:01:42.890> around<00:01:43.070> corners<00:01:43.670> really<00:01:44.540> really

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260

fast<00:01:45.560> if<00:01:45.980> you<00:01:46.160> try<00:01:46.400> hard<00:01:46.640> enough<00:01:46.760> you<00:01:46.940> can<00:01:47.150> just

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
fast if you try hard enough you can just

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.600 
fast if you try hard enough you can just
about<00:01:47.840> hang<00:01:48.050> on<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.380> 911<00:01:48.890> turbo<00:01:49.070> which<00:01:49.460> is

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
about hang on to a 911 turbo which is

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.410 
about hang on to a 911 turbo which is
full<00:01:49.820> wheel<00:01:49.970> drive<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.540> as<00:01:51.290> we<00:01:51.440> know<00:01:52.420> handles

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
full wheel drive and as we know handles

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.350 
full wheel drive and as we know handles
a<00:01:53.450> lot<00:01:53.570> of<00:01:53.720> golf<00:01:53.960> it's<00:01:54.290> also<00:01:54.820> flamin<00:01:55.820> fast<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.300> a

a lot of golf it's also flamin fast in a

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.610 
a lot of golf it's also flamin fast in a
straight<00:01:56.390> line<00:01:56.840> we<00:01:57.080> haven't<00:01:57.290> actually<00:01:57.380> done

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
straight line we haven't actually done

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.460

the<00:01:57.770> roads<00:01:57.950> figures<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.550> it<00:01:58.580> yet<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:59.000> it<00:01:59.090> feels

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
the roads figures on it yet but it feels

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.810 
the roads figures on it yet but it feels
not<00:02:00.470> far<00:02:00.770> off<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.070> Lamborghini<00:02:01.580> in<00:02:01.760> a

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
not far off the Lamborghini in a

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.730 
not far off the Lamborghini in a
straight<00:02:02.090> line<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:02.630> impressive<00:02:03.440> for<00:02:03.590> a

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
straight line that is impressive for a

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.930 
straight line that is impressive for a
1600<00:02:04.700> kilogram<00:02:05.380> front<00:02:06.380> engine<00:02:06.800> v8<00:02:07.010> GT<00:02:07.640> car

1600 kilogram front engine v8 GT car
basically

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
basically

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.750 
basically
and<00:02:09.990> then<00:02:10.350> you've<00:02:10.470> got<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.680> gearbox<00:02:11.070> it's<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
and then you've got the gearbox it's a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.490 
and then you've got the gearbox it's a
double<00:02:12.060> clutch<00:02:12.240> it's<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> pre-selected

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
double clutch it's not a pre-selected

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.530 
double clutch it's not a pre-selected
double<00:02:13.950> clutch<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.850> it's<00:02:15.030> kind<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.360> halfway

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
double clutch so it's kind of halfway

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.420 
double clutch so it's kind of halfway
between<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.200> two<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.710> works<00:02:16.920> again

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
between the two but it works again

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.490 
between the two but it works again
really<00:02:17.940> well<00:02:18.210> there's<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.510> slight<00:02:18.900> delay<00:02:19.170> when

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
really well there's a slight delay when

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.410 
really well there's a slight delay when
you<00:02:19.590> flick<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.830> paddles<00:02:20.310> but<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.150> actual

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
you flick the paddles but the actual

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.870 
you flick the paddles but the actual
machination<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.470> change<00:02:22.770> itself<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
machination is of the change itself and

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.320 
machination is of the change itself and
brilliant<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.550> go<00:02:29.700> back<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.210> original

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
brilliant so to go back to that original

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.320 
brilliant so to go back to that original
question<00:02:30.810> as<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.410> what<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.890> SLS<00:02:32.370> actually<00:02:33.120> is

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
question as to what the SLS actually is

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.420 
question as to what the SLS actually is
I<00:02:33.630> think<00:02:33.990> it's<00:02:34.320> time<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.830> tried<00:02:35.070> some<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
I think it's time we tried some of the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.630 
I think it's time we tried some of the
opposition

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
opposition

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.120 
opposition
first<00:02:38.640> up<00:02:38.850> Porsche<00:02:39.270> 911<00:02:39.750> Turbo<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.650> SLS

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
first up Porsche 911 Turbo is the SLS

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.670 
first up Porsche 911 Turbo is the SLS
anything<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.570> well<00:02:43.230> they're<00:02:43.560> both

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
anything like it well they're both

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.470 
anything like it well they're both
German<00:02:44.220> they<00:02:44.370> both<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:44.730> over<00:02:44.940> 500

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
German they both have over 500

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.150 
German they both have over 500
horsepower<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.140> they<00:02:46.230> both<00:02:46.410> have<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> flappy

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
horsepower and they both have a flappy

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.890 
horsepower and they both have a flappy
paddle<00:02:47.520> gear<00:02:47.700> shifts<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.540> beyond<00:02:48.870> that

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
paddle gear shifts but beyond that

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.440 
paddle gear shifts but beyond that
there's<00:02:49.410> no<00:02:49.920> comparison<00:02:50.760> between<00:02:50.910> these<00:02:51.240> two

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
there's no comparison between these two

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.240 
there's no comparison between these two
cars<00:02:51.890> which<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.070> faster<00:02:53.850> more<00:02:54.360> comfortable

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
cars which is faster more comfortable

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.480 
cars which is faster more comfortable
massively<00:02:56.250> more<00:02:56.490> agile<00:02:56.970> no<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:58.590> SLS<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.280> not

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
massively more agile no the SLS is not

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.250 
massively more agile no the SLS is not
an<00:02:59.580> either<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.910> turbo<00:03:00.300> rival<00:03:00.720> no<00:03:00.990> way

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.570 

so<00:03:05.920> it's<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.879> SLS<00:03:07.390> remotely<00:03:08.290> like<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:09.400> new

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
so it's the SLS remotely like the new

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.920 
so it's the SLS remotely like the new
Lamborghini<00:03:10.239> Gallardo<00:03:11.220> Superleggera

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930

no<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.629> accident<00:03:23.110> Vantage<00:03:23.560> v12<00:03:23.909> and

no this is the accident Vantage v12 and

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.800 
no this is the accident Vantage v12 and
it<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:26.049> by<00:03:26.379> far<00:03:26.409> the<00:03:27.099> closest<00:03:27.519> in<00:03:27.730> kind<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.659> the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
it is by far the closest in kind to the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.339 
it is by far the closest in kind to the
SLS<00:03:29.250> why<00:03:30.250> well<00:03:31.000> we've<00:03:31.540> got<00:03:31.750> an<00:03:31.870> engine<00:03:32.140> in<00:03:32.230> the

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
SLS why well we've got an engine in the

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.199 
SLS why well we've got an engine in the
front<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.920> it's<00:03:33.159> rear-wheel<00:03:33.400> drive<00:03:33.610> just

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
front and it's rear-wheel drive just

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.850 
front and it's rear-wheel drive just
like<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.599> SLS<00:03:35.220> same<00:03:36.220> kind<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.579> hairy-chested

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
like the SLS same kind of hairy-chested

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.470 
like the SLS same kind of hairy-chested
slightly<00:03:38.860> old-fashioned<00:03:39.579> sports<00:03:39.879> car<00:03:40.180> kind

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
slightly old-fashioned sports car kind

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.380 
slightly old-fashioned sports car kind
of<00:03:40.599> feel<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.019> it<00:03:41.140> as<00:03:41.230> well<00:03:41.409> but<00:03:41.980> actually<00:03:42.430> when

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
of feel to it as well but actually when

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.000 
of feel to it as well but actually when
it<00:03:43.480> comes<00:03:43.720> right<00:03:43.930> down<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.379> the<00:03:44.590> essence

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
it comes right down to it the essence

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.910 
it comes right down to it the essence
personality<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.840> quite<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.260> lot<00:03:47.409> warmer<00:03:47.680> than

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
personality is quite a lot warmer than

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.430 
personality is quite a lot warmer than
the<00:03:48.159> Mercedes<00:03:48.700> it's<00:03:48.970> not<00:03:49.180> as<00:03:49.269> fast<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:50.319> was

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
the Mercedes it's not as fast that was

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.740 
the Mercedes it's not as fast that was
dynamic<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.180> certainly<00:03:52.420> doesn't<00:03:52.599> go

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
dynamic and it certainly doesn't go

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.140 
dynamic and it certainly doesn't go
around<00:03:52.840> corners<00:03:53.379> as<00:03:53.590> as<00:03:54.099> clinically<00:03:54.700> as<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
around corners as as clinically as the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.530 
around corners as as clinically as the
Mercedes<00:03:55.659> but<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.639> think<00:03:57.639> I<00:03:57.730> actually<00:03:57.940> prefer

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
Mercedes but I think I actually prefer

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.860 
Mercedes but I think I actually prefer
its<00:03:59.579> demeanor<00:04:00.579> over<00:04:01.090> it's<00:04:01.389> just<00:04:01.629> a<00:04:01.720> bit

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
its demeanor over it's just a bit

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.460 
its demeanor over it's just a bit
friendly<00:04:02.409> is<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.040> better<00:04:03.400> than<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.670> Mercedes

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
friendly is it better than the Mercedes

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.949 
friendly is it better than the Mercedes
not<00:04:05.470> sure<00:04:05.680> that's<00:04:05.920> too<00:04:06.190> close<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.609> call<00:04:09.959> so

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
not sure that's too close to call so

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.440 
not sure that's too close to call so
we've<00:04:11.109> established<00:04:11.260> at<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:11.920> SLS<00:04:12.450> is

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
we've established at the SLS is

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.289 
we've established at the SLS is
definitely<00:04:14.019> not<00:04:14.139> a<00:04:14.200> 911<00:04:14.409> rival<00:04:15.159> is<00:04:15.790> clearly

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
definitely not a 911 rival is clearly

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.860 
definitely not a 911 rival is clearly
not<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.660> Lamborghini<00:04:16.930> rival<00:04:18.209> it's<00:04:19.209> kind<00:04:19.690> of

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
not a Lamborghini rival it's kind of

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.930 
not a Lamborghini rival it's kind of
similar<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.350> an<00:04:20.590> Aston<00:04:20.919> Martin<00:04:21.280> Vantage<00:04:21.519> v12

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
similar to an Aston Martin Vantage v12

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.700 
similar to an Aston Martin Vantage v12
but<00:04:22.479> actually<00:04:23.020> is<00:04:23.260> a

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
but actually is a

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.400 
but actually is a
unto<00:04:24.069> itself<00:04:24.669> and<00:04:24.819> actually<00:04:25.030> in<00:04:25.479> fact<00:04:25.509> it's<00:04:26.289> a

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
unto itself and actually in fact it's a

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.860 
unto itself and actually in fact it's a
very<00:04:26.650> good<00:04:26.919> law<00:04:27.069> unto<00:04:27.340> itself<00:04:27.789> I<00:04:28.120> think<00:04:28.479> if<00:04:28.750> we

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
very good law unto itself I think if we

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.110 
very good law unto itself I think if we
were<00:04:28.990> ranking<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.560> SLS<00:04:30.069> in<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.430> road<00:04:30.610> test<00:04:30.819> it

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
were ranking the SLS in a road test it

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.450 
were ranking the SLS in a road test it
would<00:04:31.210> have<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.810> get<00:04:31.990> four<00:04:32.319> out<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.530> five<00:04:32.889> it's

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
would have to get four out of five it's

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.290 
would have to get four out of five it's
that<00:04:33.819> good
