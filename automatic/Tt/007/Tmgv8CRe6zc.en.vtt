00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
this by Chris well we designed this to

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.769 
this by Chris well we designed this to
be<00:00:17.250> an<00:00:17.369> aggressive<00:00:17.699> trail<00:00:18.090> bike<00:00:18.359> really

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
be an aggressive trail bike really

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.290 
be an aggressive trail bike really

duro rider and some of the things we've

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.460 
duro rider and some of the things we've
done<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.789> first<00:00:24.029> it's<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> bike

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
done on this is first it's it's a bike

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.320 
done on this is first it's it's a bike
that's<00:00:25.710> designed<00:00:26.189> from<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.550> ground<00:00:26.580> up<00:00:27.029> for

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
that's designed from the ground up for

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.430 
that's designed from the ground up for
27<00:00:28.050> 5<00:00:28.230> 650b<00:00:29.160> wheels<00:00:30.560> to<00:00:31.560> optimize<00:00:32.009> them<00:00:33.440> we

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
27 5 650b wheels to optimize them we

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.799 
27 5 650b wheels to optimize them we
wanted<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> make<00:00:35.160> sure<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
wanted to make sure that the that the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.740 
wanted to make sure that the that the
bike<00:00:37.110> had<00:00:37.730> didn't<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.850> any<00:00:38.969> compromises

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
bike had didn't have any compromises

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.030 
bike had didn't have any compromises
with<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> bigger<00:00:40.200> wheels<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.860> were<00:00:40.980> able

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
with the bigger wheels so we were able

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.010 
with the bigger wheels so we were able
to<00:00:41.309> come<00:00:41.460> up<00:00:41.489> with<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> new<00:00:42.000> upper<00:00:42.660> linkage

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to come up with a new upper linkage

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.410 
to come up with a new upper linkage
design<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.800> allowed<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:44.789> more<00:00:45.030> control

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
design that allowed for more control

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.000 
design that allowed for more control
over<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.809> suspension<00:00:46.350> through<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> travel

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
over the suspension through the travel

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.979 
over the suspension through the travel
but<00:00:47.160> also<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.789> opened<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> clearance

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
but also really opened up the clearance

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.479 
but also really opened up the clearance
in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> back<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.649> we<00:00:49.739> could<00:00:49.890> keep<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.250> chain

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
in the back so we could keep the chain

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.869 
in the back so we could keep the chain
stays<00:00:50.730> under<00:00:51.510> 17<00:00:52.020> inches<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.590> also<00:00:53.219> clear<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
stays under 17 inches and also clear the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
6.1 inches of travel and in a really

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.670 
6.1 inches of travel and in a really
tight<00:01:04.949> compact<00:01:05.729> package<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.260> sea<00:01:07.439> tubes

tight compact package all the sea tubes

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.140 
tight compact package all the sea tubes
shrunk<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.130> little<00:01:08.159> bit<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> top<00:01:08.850> tubes

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
shrunk a little bit the top tubes

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
shrunk a little bit the top tubes
lengthened<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> head<00:01:10.200> tube<00:01:10.409> shortened

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
lengthened and the head tube shortened

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.070 
lengthened and the head tube shortened
on<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.820> Mach<00:01:12.000> 6<00:01:12.240> versus<00:01:12.720> some<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.960> our

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
on on the Mach 6 versus some of our

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.020 
on on the Mach 6 versus some of our
other<00:01:13.110> bikes<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> line<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.729> gives

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
other bikes in the line and that gives

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
other bikes in the line and that gives
you<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.390> long<00:01:15.720> low<00:01:16.080> trail<00:01:16.439> bike<00:01:16.710> that

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
you a really long low trail bike that

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.640 
you a really long low trail bike that
when<00:01:17.880> you're<00:01:18.030> descending<00:01:18.509> steep<00:01:19.140> gnarly

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
when you're descending steep gnarly

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950 
when you're descending steep gnarly
stuff<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.220> keeps<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.180> control<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
stuff it keeps you in control but the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
stuff it keeps you in control but the
short<00:01:22.229> chain<00:01:22.439> stays<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.950> DW<00:01:23.400> link<00:01:23.610> suspension

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
short chain stays the DW link suspension

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600 
short chain stays the DW link suspension
all<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.890> make<00:01:26.070> sure<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> bike

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
all of that also make sure that the bike

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
all of that also make sure that the bike
climbs<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.330> nothing<00:01:27.750> else<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.229> get

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
climbs like nothing else so you get

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.050 
climbs like nothing else so you get
almost<00:01:28.860> cross-country<00:01:29.490> climbing

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
almost cross-country climbing

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.319 
almost cross-country climbing
performance<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.460> downhilling<00:01:32.460> capabilities

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
performance and downhilling capabilities

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.330 
performance and downhilling capabilities
that<00:01:33.540> rivals<00:01:33.990> are<00:01:34.200> nearly<00:01:34.619> 7<00:01:35.009> inch<00:01:35.159> travel

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that rivals are nearly 7 inch travel

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.520 
that rivals are nearly 7 inch travel
firebird<00:01:35.939> bike<00:01:36.150> yeah<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.110> one<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> things

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
firebird bike yeah so one of the things

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410 
firebird bike yeah so one of the things
we've<00:01:37.829> done<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.189> internal<00:01:38.640> cable<00:01:38.820> routing<00:01:39.060> for

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
we've done is internal cable routing for

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
we've done is internal cable routing for
the<00:01:39.450> dropper<00:01:39.840> post<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.680> tube<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.220> runs

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the dropper post it's a tube that runs

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.120 
the dropper post it's a tube that runs
all<00:01:41.880> inside<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.689> very<00:01:43.020> easily<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.710> clean

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
all inside so it's very easily and clean

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.670 
all inside so it's very easily and clean
to<00:01:44.310> route<00:01:44.490> without<00:01:44.930> having<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.020> fish<00:01:46.200> cables

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
to route without having to fish cables

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.770 
to route without having to fish cables
or<00:01:46.890> worry<00:01:47.070> about<00:01:47.340> any<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.670> internal<00:01:48.600> top

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
or worry about any of that internal top

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.600 
or worry about any of that internal top
tube<00:01:49.110> routing<00:01:49.560> keeps<00:01:49.770> things<00:01:50.040> clean<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.369> out

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
tube routing keeps things clean and out
