focus<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.469> tile

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.890 
focus on the tile
start<00:02:14.370> screen<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.000> they<00:02:15.090> say<00:02:15.300> oh<00:02:15.480> my<00:02:15.660> gosh

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900

that's<00:02:16.200> operating<00:02:16.680> systems<00:02:17.070> all<00:02:17.250> about<00:02:17.640> touch

that's operating systems all about touch

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.270 
that's operating systems all about touch
screens<00:02:18.300> I've<00:02:18.600> had<00:02:18.990> people<00:02:19.050> even<00:02:19.560> say<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.010> it

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
screens I've had people even say that it

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.660 
screens I've had people even say that it
requires<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:21.000> touch<00:02:21.330> screen<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.960> does<00:02:22.530> not<00:02:23.040> it

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
requires a touch screen it does not it

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.630 
requires a touch screen it does not it
works<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.180> fine<00:02:25.020> on<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.350> traditional<00:02:26.010> desktop

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
works just fine on a traditional desktop

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.990 
works just fine on a traditional desktop
with<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.940> mouse<00:02:27.560> like<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.710> said<00:02:28.770> that's<00:02:29.580> how<00:02:29.850> I'm

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
with a mouse like I said that's how I'm

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.200 
with a mouse like I said that's how I'm
using<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.250> other<00:02:32.460> complaint<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.060> I

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
using it so the other complaint that I

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.910 
using it so the other complaint that I
often<00:02:33.450> hear<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:36.500> hardware<00:02:37.500> isn't<00:02:37.620> being

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
often hear is that hardware isn't being

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.900 
often hear is that hardware isn't being
supported<00:02:38.690> now<00:02:39.690> that's<00:02:40.290> almost<00:02:41.070> but<00:02:41.880> not

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
supported now that's almost but not

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.820 
supported now that's almost but not
quite<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.570> red<00:02:43.290> herring<00:02:43.640> it's<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.820> valid<00:02:45.300> concern

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
quite a red herring it's a valid concern

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.160 
quite a red herring it's a valid concern
but<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.980> issue<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.460> what<00:02:48.060> most<00:02:48.420> people<00:02:48.900> don't

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
but the issue is what most people don't

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.920 
but the issue is what most people don't
get<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.490> valid<00:02:51.000> concern<00:02:51.210> for

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
get is that it's a valid concern for

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.410 
get is that it's a valid concern for
every<00:02:52.620> new<00:02:53.070> version<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.270> operating

each new version of Windows has always

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.110 
each new version of Windows has always
dropped<00:03:00.150> support<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.980> something<00:03:01.980> they<00:03:02.700> have

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
dropped support for something they have

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.240 
dropped support for something they have
to<00:03:03.150> there's<00:03:04.020> just<00:03:04.230> no<00:03:04.560> way<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:04.830> they<00:03:05.190> can

to there's just no way that they can

to there's just no way that they can
cart<00:03:05.820> along<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.750> actually<00:03:07.500> support<00:03:08.010> all<00:03:08.190> of

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
that old hardware that's ever been

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.840 
that old hardware that's ever been
developed<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:12.570> yes<00:03:13.320> absolutely<00:03:13.820> there<00:03:14.820> are

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850

developed so yes absolutely there are
hardware<00:03:15.570> issues<00:03:15.960> there<00:03:16.140> are<00:03:16.260> things<00:03:16.530> that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
hardware issues there are things that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.750 
hardware issues there are things that

aren't going to be supported with
windows<00:03:18.240> 8<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:19.260> bet<00:03:19.470> if<00:03:19.650> that's<00:03:19.920> a

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
windows 8 and you bet if that's a

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
to deal with that whether that means not

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.680 
to deal with that whether that means not

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
version of Windows so like I said if you

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.820 
version of Windows so like I said if you
have<00:03:50.130> unsupported<00:03:51.060> hardware<00:03:51.510> yes<00:03:52.200> that's<00:03:52.620> a

have unsupported hardware yes that's a

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.970 
have unsupported hardware yes that's a
very<00:03:52.880> real<00:03:53.880> issue<00:03:54.210> I<00:03:54.510> get<00:03:54.930> that<00:03:55.170> I'm<00:03:55.410> not

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
very real issue I get that I'm not

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.830 
very real issue I get that I'm not
trying<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.400> say<00:03:56.610> it's<00:03:56.760> not<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.970> problem<00:03:57.450> for<00:03:57.480> you

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
trying to say it's not a problem for you

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.520 
trying to say it's not a problem for you
it<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.260> all<00:03:59.220> I'm<00:03:59.730> trying<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.180> say<00:04:00.270> is<00:04:00.510> that<00:04:00.720> with

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
it is all I'm trying to say is that with

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.250 
it is all I'm trying to say is that with
Windows<00:04:02.070> 8<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:03.000> simply<00:04:03.540> behaving<00:04:04.110> like

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
Windows 8 it's simply behaving like

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.410 
Windows 8 it's simply behaving like
pretty<00:04:04.590> much<00:04:04.680> every<00:04:05.340> other<00:04:05.460> version<00:04:06.240> of

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
pretty much every other version of

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.780 
pretty much every other version of
Windows<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.020> came<00:04:07.260> before<00:04:07.790> hardware

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
Windows that came before hardware

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.430 
Windows that came before hardware
support<00:04:09.270> of<00:04:09.420> some<00:04:09.840> sort<00:04:10.200> was<00:04:10.860> dropped<00:04:11.420> so<00:04:12.440> yeah

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
support of some sort was dropped so yeah

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.010 
support of some sort was dropped so yeah
you<00:04:13.680> know<00:04:13.830> ultimately<00:04:14.130> we<00:04:15.120> shouldn't<00:04:15.570> have<00:04:15.810> to

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
you know ultimately we shouldn't have to

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.990 
you know ultimately we shouldn't have to
turn<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.320> things<00:04:16.739> like<00:04:16.950> third-party<00:04:17.730> software

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
turn to things like third-party software

what they did with Windows 8 I think

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.810 
what they did with Windows 8 I think
like<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:25.090> said<00:05:25.360> it<00:05:25.510> was<00:05:25.810> the<00:05:26.440> wrong
