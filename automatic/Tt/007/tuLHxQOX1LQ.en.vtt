i've been using the famas for a while I

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.450 
i've been using the famas for a while I
used<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:12.990> pretty<00:00:13.170> much<00:00:13.349> every<00:00:13.650> gun<00:00:13.889> so

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
used just pretty much every gun so

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.740 
used just pretty much every gun so
basically<00:00:14.759> I'm<00:00:14.910> covered<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.269> for<00:00:15.299> mice<00:00:15.570> in

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
video and then I'll probably try to add

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.029 
video and then I'll probably try to add
the<00:00:21.449> l85<00:00:22.020> because<00:00:22.410> I'm<00:00:22.560> trying<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.800> cover<00:00:22.949> all

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
the l85 because I'm trying to cover all

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.800

the assault rifles that were patched and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.870 
the assault rifles that were patched and
how<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.470> feel<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.740> how<00:00:26.010> they<00:00:26.130> work<00:00:26.430> after

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880

the<00:00:26.970> patch<00:00:27.210> now<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.140> far<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.800> famas<00:00:29.160> it's

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the patch now so far for the famas it's

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.939 
the patch now so far for the famas it's
been<00:00:29.670> um<00:00:30.170> not<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.289> too<00:00:31.500> big<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.800> change

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
been um not really too big of a change

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
been um not really too big of a change
for<00:00:32.160> my<00:00:32.279> last<00:00:32.550> remember<00:00:33.000> from<00:00:33.149> my<00:00:33.270> last<00:00:33.510> video

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
for my last remember from my last video

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.229 
for my last remember from my last video
about<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.620> famas<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.250> still<00:00:35.700> feels<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> same

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
about the famas it still feels the same

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.479 
about the famas it still feels the same
even<00:00:36.540> though<00:00:36.600> slightly<00:00:36.989> reduced<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.920> recoil

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
even though slightly reduced on recoil

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.520 
even though slightly reduced on recoil
which<00:00:39.090> doesn't<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.960> know<00:00:39.989> make<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> bit

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
which doesn't really you know make a bit

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.380 
which doesn't really you know make a bit
of<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.680> difference<00:00:41.040> because<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.489> gun<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.700> very

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
of a difference because this gun is very

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.500 
of a difference because this gun is very
very<00:00:42.690> good<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.200> close<00:00:43.610> medium<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.850> mean<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
very good up close medium I mean I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.819 
very good up close medium I mean I
wouldn't<00:00:45.690> take<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.930> anywhere<00:00:46.320> else<00:00:46.559> than<00:00:46.770> that

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
wouldn't take it anywhere else than that

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.560 
wouldn't take it anywhere else than that
you<00:00:47.219> know<00:00:47.250> there's<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.820> gun<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.030> not<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you know there's this gun is not that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.049 
you know there's this gun is not that
bad<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.500> has<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> very<00:00:50.160> long<00:00:50.460> recoil

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
bad it's just it has a very long recoil

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.650 
bad it's just it has a very long recoil
or<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.930> long<00:00:52.199> arm<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:53.129> reload<00:00:53.520> speed<00:00:54.000> which

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
or very long arm have reload speed which

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.270 
or very long arm have reload speed which
kills<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.410> know<00:00:55.500> kills<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.100> close

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
kills it you know kills it in close

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
kills it you know kills it in close
range<00:00:56.430> engagements<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.239> kill<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:58.079> or<00:00:58.140> two

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
range engagements if you kill one or two

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.170 
range engagements if you kill one or two
guys<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.160> third<00:00:59.370> guy<00:00:59.550> you're<00:00:59.760> probably<00:01:00.000> gonna

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
guys at once if they're just lined up

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.320 
guys at once if they're just lined up
perfectly<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.030> very

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
perfectly you know it's if it's very

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.670 
perfectly you know it's if it's very
hard<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> hit<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.080> two<00:01:13.260> enemies<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
hard to hit you know two enemies that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.130 
hard to hit you know two enemies that
aren't<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> same<00:01:14.340> exact<00:01:14.760> spot<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.810> other

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
aren't in the same exact spot but other

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.690 
aren't in the same exact spot but other
than<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.680> my<00:01:16.830> sister<00:01:17.070> feels<00:01:17.310> really

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
than that for my sister feels really

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.460 
than that for my sister feels really
like<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> viable<00:01:18.540> weapon<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.990> more<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.350> more

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
like a viable weapon like more and more

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.080 
like a viable weapon like more and more
people<00:01:19.619> need<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> start<00:01:20.280> using<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.729> that's<00:01:20.909> why

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
people need to start using it that's why

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.120 
people need to start using it that's why
I<00:01:21.360> think<00:01:21.990> dice<00:01:22.170> patched<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:22.950> bit

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I think dice patched it a little bit

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340 
I think dice patched it a little bit
just<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.210> everyone<00:01:24.570> off<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
just to get you know everyone off the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.749 
just to get you know everyone off the
rest<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> other<00:01:25.860> guns<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.549> only

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
rest of the other guns but the only

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.210 
rest of the other guns but the only
thing<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.750> keeps<00:01:28.380> players<00:01:28.619> from<00:01:28.829> using<00:01:29.159> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
thing that keeps players from using it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.310 
thing that keeps players from using it
is<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> long<00:01:29.790> reload<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.479> mean<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.110> you're

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
is a long reload I mean if you're

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.870 
is a long reload I mean if you're
sitting<00:01:31.619> there<00:01:31.650> reloading<00:01:32.400> when<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.729> have

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
sitting there reloading when you have

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.520 
sitting there reloading when you have
enemies<00:01:33.390> rushing<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.930> you're<00:01:34.140> more<00:01:34.380> than

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
enemies rushing you you're more than

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
enemies rushing you you're more than
likely<00:01:34.590> gonna<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.280> killed<00:01:35.520> over<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.360> over

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
likely gonna get killed over and over

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.730 
likely gonna get killed over and over
again<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.750> that's<00:01:37.020> what<00:01:37.170> happens<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
again and that's what happens and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.289 
again and that's what happens and
happened<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.549> me<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.880> know<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.000> couple<00:01:39.090> of

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
times especially in rush where the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.730 
times especially in rush where the
enemies<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.250> always<00:01:41.759> coming<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.740> you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
know reloading at three and a half

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.600 
know reloading at three and a half
seconds<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> gun<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.130> pretty<00:01:47.340> bad

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
seconds for a gun is you know pretty bad

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.969 
seconds for a gun is you know pretty bad
but<00:01:48.270> other<00:01:48.479> than<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.720> I'm<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.259> recoil<00:01:49.710> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
but other than that I'm the recoil it

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.440 
but other than that I'm the recoil it
still<00:01:50.250> feels<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> same<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.909> ricoh<00:01:51.180> feels

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
still feels the same the ricoh feels

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.359 
still feels the same the ricoh feels
great<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.020> doesn't<00:01:52.500> make<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> hard<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> use

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
great it doesn't make it hard to use

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.160 
great it doesn't make it hard to use
other<00:01:53.670> than<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.360> long-range<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.020> can

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
other than you know long-range you can

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.600 
other than you know long-range you can
use<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.380> weapon<00:01:55.590> at<00:01:55.829> all<00:01:55.979> at<00:01:56.219> long<00:01:56.399> range

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
use this weapon at all at long range

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.209 
use this weapon at all at long range
unless<00:01:56.759> you're<00:01:57.000> single<00:01:57.360> shouting<00:01:57.719> um<00:01:58.219> that

unless you're single shouting um that
that's<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.759> probably<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.329> only<00:02:00.479> way<00:02:00.659> you're

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
that's the probably the only way you're

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.510 
that's the probably the only way you're
gonna<00:02:00.869> kill<00:02:01.170> your<00:02:01.320> enemy<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.770> other<00:02:02.399> than

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
gonna kill your enemy but other than

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
that the famas is the famas it's still

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.450 
that the famas is the famas it's still
the<00:02:04.140> same<00:02:04.170> weapon<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.740> still<00:02:04.950> feels<00:02:05.100> great

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the same weapon it still feels great

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.760 
the same weapon it still feels great
here<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> was<00:02:06.570> using<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.170> red<00:02:07.350> dot<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
here I was using it with the red dot and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.369 
here I was using it with the red dot and
flash<00:02:08.459> suppressor<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.119> did<00:02:09.629> use<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.840> silencer

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
flash suppressor I did use the silencer

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.240 
flash suppressor I did use the silencer
on<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.830> that's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
on it and that's

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250 
on it and that's
answer<00:02:11.610> was<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:11.970> horrible<00:02:12.300> see<00:02:12.600> if<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.020> felt

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
answer was just horrible see if it felt

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.920 
answer was just horrible see if it felt
like<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.680> couldn't<00:02:14.640> hit<00:02:14.850> anything<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.810> know

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930

like I couldn't hit anything you know
beyond<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.590> 15<00:02:17.460> meters<00:02:17.820> which<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.360> know

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
beyond like 15 meters which you know

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.510 
beyond like 15 meters which you know
kind<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.750> sucked<00:02:18.990> but<00:02:19.620> some<00:02:19.950> other<00:02:20.250> than<00:02:20.340> that

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
kind of sucked but some other than that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.280 
kind of sucked but some other than that
the<00:02:20.640> recoil<00:02:21.030> like<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.300> said<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.690> very<00:02:21.750> good<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
the recoil like I said is very good and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.960

know<00:02:37.890> kind<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.220> crazy<00:02:38.750> but<00:02:39.750> that<00:02:39.990> was<00:02:40.680> covered

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
know kind of crazy but that was covered

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.410 
know kind of crazy but that was covered
in<00:02:41.010> last<00:02:41.250> patch<00:02:41.490> about<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.880> famas<00:02:42.209> so

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.000 
basically offered a new patch it's
pretty<00:02:45.090> much<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.300> same<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.989> operates<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
pretty much the same it operates the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.070 
pretty much the same it operates the
same<00:02:47.040> on<00:02:47.550> your<00:02:47.610> slightly<00:02:48.180> reduced<00:02:48.600> recoil<00:02:48.810> as

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
same on your slightly reduced recoil as

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.600 
same on your slightly reduced recoil as
you<00:02:49.200> guys<00:02:49.320> can<00:02:49.470> see<00:02:49.530> here<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.130> single<00:02:50.459> shot

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
you guys can see here as I single shot

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
you guys can see here as I single shot
that<00:02:50.760> guy<00:02:50.940> slightly<00:02:51.870> reduce<00:02:52.230> recoil<00:02:52.500> um<00:02:53.630> it's

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
that guy slightly reduce recoil um it's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.660 
that guy slightly reduce recoil um it's
a<00:02:54.720> little<00:02:54.959> bit<00:02:55.110> better<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.890> long-range<00:02:56.370> if

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
a little bit better for long-range if

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.130 
a little bit better for long-range if
you're<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.090> sniping<00:02:57.390> if<00:02:57.750> you're<00:02:57.959> just

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140

fast and the 93r does so so that's why I

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.460 
fast and the 93r does so so that's why I
use<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.580> mostly<00:03:36.030> as<00:03:36.180> my<00:03:36.330> starter<00:03:36.660> for<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:36.959> arm

highly recommend it with this gun as

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.710 
highly recommend it with this gun as
well<00:03:47.190> because<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.150> will<00:03:48.390> find<00:03:48.630> yourself

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
well because you will find yourself

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.690 
well because you will find yourself
running<00:03:49.049> out<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.290> ammo<00:03:50.010> as<00:03:50.220> soon<00:03:50.340> as<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.579> get

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
running out of ammo as soon as you get

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.090 
running out of ammo as soon as you get
on<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.880> nice<00:03:51.120> little<00:03:51.299> kill<00:03:51.570> streak<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.769> I<00:03:52.860> kills

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
on a nice little kill streak and I kills

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.949 
on a nice little kill streak and I kills
three<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:53.459> soon<00:03:53.670> as<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:53.820> get<00:03:54.000> on<00:03:54.269> a<00:03:54.510> good<00:03:54.720> in

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
three but soon as you get on a good in

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.660 
three but soon as you get on a good in
your<00:03:55.079> streak<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:56.190> know<00:03:56.310> when<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.519> take

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
your streak of you know when you take

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.979 
your streak of you know when you take
out<00:03:56.760> your<00:03:56.820> enemies<00:03:57.299> you're<00:03:57.480> gonna<00:03:57.600> start<00:03:57.900> to

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
out your enemies you're gonna start to

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.810 
out your enemies you're gonna start to
run<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.170> am<00:03:58.440> well<00:03:58.709> fairly<00:03:59.070> quickly<00:03:59.370> because<00:03:59.700> it

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
run I am well fairly quickly because it

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.630 
run I am well fairly quickly because it
just<00:03:59.940> shows<00:04:00.390> through<00:04:00.690> ammo<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.290> every<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.890> mean

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
just shows through ammo for every I mean

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.550 
just shows through ammo for every I mean
a<00:04:02.700> couple<00:04:02.880> shots<00:04:03.209> that<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.570> shoot<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:04.440> know

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
a couple shots that you shoot you know

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.680 
a couple shots that you shoot you know
it's<00:04:05.160> it's<00:04:05.400> got<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.730> thousand<00:04:06.090> Brown<00:04:06.510> per

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
it's it's got a thousand Brown per

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.180 
it's it's got a thousand Brown per
minute<00:04:06.930> fire<00:04:07.079> rate<00:04:07.290> so<00:04:07.470> you're<00:04:07.709> gonna<00:04:07.860> expect

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
minute fire rate so you're gonna expect

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.860 
minute fire rate so you're gonna expect
it<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.459> run<00:04:08.670> out<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:08.820> ammo<00:04:09.060> fairly<00:04:09.390> quickly<00:04:09.600> but

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
it to run out of ammo fairly quickly but

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.900 
it to run out of ammo fairly quickly but
then<00:04:10.320> that<00:04:10.470> I'm<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.890> know<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.160> far<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.549> think<00:04:11.790> it

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
then that I'm you know so far I think it

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.360 
then that I'm you know so far I think it
just<00:04:12.120> feels<00:04:12.450> pretty<00:04:12.750> much<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:13.140> same<00:04:13.370> not

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
just feels pretty much the same not

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.949 
just feels pretty much the same not
really<00:04:14.640> much<00:04:14.760> has<00:04:14.940> changed<00:04:14.970> reduce<00:04:15.660> recoil

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
really much has changed reduce recoil

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.479 
really much has changed reduce recoil
and<00:04:16.229> that's<00:04:16.380> about<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.650> which<00:04:17.070> makes<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.430> a

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
and that's about it which makes it a

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.550 
and that's about it which makes it a
little<00:04:17.640> bit<00:04:17.760> easier<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.239> arm<00:04:18.479> you<00:04:18.630> know<00:04:18.660> handle

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
little bit easier to arm you know handle

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.810 
little bit easier to arm you know handle
but<00:04:19.950> other<00:04:20.099> than<00:04:20.160> that<00:04:20.220> hopefully<00:04:20.549> guys<00:04:20.669> did

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
but other than that hopefully guys did

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.919 
but other than that hopefully guys did
