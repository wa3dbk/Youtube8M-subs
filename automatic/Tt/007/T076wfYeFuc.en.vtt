00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.930
 will you be lucky European card 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.950
 which is about to play 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.960
 Ukraine 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.389
 certainly no one knows but it is important and 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.030
 another now the rule of geopolitical 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.369
 the games identified happened this eve in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.109
 Minsk is considered here as the main result 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.789
 summits 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.550
 the fact that Ukraine and the country of customs 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.410
 union put an end to relationships not 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 intend however in case 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.000
 signing an association agreement with 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.489
 the European Union in late November, Kiev will have 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.660
 forget about the benefits and discounts on the market 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.969
 customs union 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.520
 many Ukrainian goods to European 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.140
 qualities to put it mildly do not reach out if 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.120
 Ukraine will try in large quantities 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.750
 fuse your products near 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.149
 neighbors 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.610
 Belarus Russia then and will 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.829
 turn on protection mechanisms being discussed 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 introduction of a common customs tariff for 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.270
 Ukrainian exports now keep about it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.670
 warned if agreement will be 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.379
 signed association with and take effect 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.189
 the Ukrainian enterprises almost 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.860
 will lose and inside the Ukrainian market even 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.869
 very good feelings no one will 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.460
 leave your markets for a hero 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.320
 industry just because she 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.150
 lost all others including my 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.890
 own this year because of trading 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.810
 conflicts mainly with Russia 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.369
 the Ukrainian economy was short of three 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.650
 a half billion dollars 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.049
 justice for the sake of trading 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.820
 Kiev is not always the affected party in 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.259
 Ukraine has repeatedly tried to close the road 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.570
 Belarusian product Belarusian 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.150
 fuel but still knew how to side 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.610
 negotiate hope to be able to find 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.860
 compromise and after signing the agreement 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.930
 about the association for example Kiev already 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.630
 proposed the creation of an advisory board 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.000
 who would solve such disputes but even 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.610
 this experts believe is unlikely to soften 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.770
 a blow to the Ukrainian economy and wallets 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.600
 ordinary citizens I would like to wish 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.640
 Customs Union only successes on 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 in fact, I suppose that the more 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.820
 there will be more success there will be countries 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.310
 who will wish 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.260
 wish to unite for Ukraine of course 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.270
 there is a period in general of such such 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.520
 very serious tests really 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.620
 serious tests i would probably 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.470
 compared this situation of the Ukrainian choice 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.970
 here and its consequences of that situation for now 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.430
 I probably was in the ninety first year 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.860
 repeated for Ukrainians in the nineties 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.810
 many politicians do not hide European 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.810
 ambitions of Ukraine in the literal sense of the word 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.940
 will cost much for now 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.310
 Kiev declares the desire to cooperate with 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.050
 Commonwealth states except 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.810
 Ukraine from next year becomes 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.300
 Country Chair in the CIS in Minsk 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.910
 interaction documents were signed 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.600
 energy security areas to combat 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.850
 terrorism 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.070
 another question is whether these plans will get 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.950
 real fill or stay on 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.170
 paper choice for Ukraine Galina was born 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.170
