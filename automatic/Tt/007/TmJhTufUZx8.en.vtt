00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.350
 good friends 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.330
 In the delivery of the bird I will tell you about 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.440
 extended batteries for mobile 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.710
 the first thing is that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.870
 up to the original batteries 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.869
 just like this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.610
 batteries that are not but are from 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.680
 look similar to batteries 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.170
 originals and we do not have to worry 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.820
 because the batteries are in all their 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.820
 aspects similar to the original 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.030
 and then another type of batteries 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.550
 which are capable many times 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.720
 similar transfers lower I'll see 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.550
 the example of a battery that is 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.600
 moment I do not have present in the battery 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.160
 from the same cell phone that was showing 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.140
 what was to navigate ex 13 2 and did not have then 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.040
 for another type of cell phone but 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.260
 they are also manufactured by the s2 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.510
 when the battery has this kind of 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.699
 label 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.190
 joan it is clear that the battery is very 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.190
 good quality very bad quality 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.990
 many times 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.750
 have the one a load capacity 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.700
 similar can keep the similar load 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.850
 a duration similar to batteries 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.610
 originals but not always many times 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.430
 they even ironically place a load 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.120
 greater if for example if the battery of a 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.890
 galaxy s2 is one thousand 650 thousand empires the 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.690
 original battery can make the copy 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.540
 generally to place this type of 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.000
 labeling genre and place two thousand 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.390
 milliamp or even more is a great 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.390
 lie 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.870
 On the other hand there 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.740
 there are batteries that last a little longer 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.110
 they really last a little longer really 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.950
 last a little longer can have this guy 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.880
 of labels 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.310
 or they can be similar to these 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.409
 these are good if they have this 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.100
 kind of labels are good they are good 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.470
 batteries but they can really give a 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.440
 you have 15 maybe 20% more charge not 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.739
 much more because because this kind of 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.739
 batteries 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.819
 and then a battery of dean foods by 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.980
 example that is a type of galaxy 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.590
 they must corpse anyway inside the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.829
 cell to fit has to have a 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.829
 width 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.760
 because if it's worth then it's for the cell phone 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.190
 already on top of that you have to go inside 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.500
 of the cell phone then we realize 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.610
 that being the matter of doing 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.830
 Lithium-ion batteries it is impossible to be able 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.860
 be a much larger capacity battery and 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.050
 that they can inside the cell phone if 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.940
 then this here that if you 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.950
 they want to have a battery of really 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.400
 of greater capacity for you have to 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.720
 resort to a battery like this but the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.720
 I will remove because you are the best 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.020
 this battery 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.580
 are 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.040
 Wider than batteries 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.900
 originals we are comparing two 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.750
 batteries for galaxy s2 sequels the 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.620
 width difference if you can 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.569
 perfectly 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:26.830
 and so he told them to provide their own 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:31.840
 back cover your new rear stage this 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.350
 back stage what it does is a kind 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.020
 of jorobita 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:41.310
 and that allows to better accommodate 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.360
 and accommodate better 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.770
 a larger capacity battery 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.500
 it says solve problems for you 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.349
 have greater capacity and the battery each 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.290
 day inside the clear cell is a cover 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.940
 bigger if the lord weighs a little 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.890
 more yes 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.180
 it can be a little less ergonomic 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.800
 it depends on who says that the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.570
 cell phones are sometimes too thin 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:11.380
 and that is more possible is more pleasant 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.940
 have a battery wider than your 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.500
 bench in the taste of each person that 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.840
 it depends on the work that each one does is 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.400
 a fieldwork in this lacks 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.950
 Miami sees the nothing with this a battery of 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.050
 longer duration the more you can give us 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.240
 these batteries is double the duration 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.340
 I said this long long battery 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.720
 duration they give the double that the batteries 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.720
 originals up to double 

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:38.659
 makes a battery of 1650 thousand euros 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:42.059
 it could be about 3500 milliamps 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:43.469
 real but we believe that much more so 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.679
 that if they start saying that the 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:49.319
 battery of a galaxy s2 for example 

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:51.300
 has an axis 5000 milliamps since it is 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.909
 A big lie 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.379
 that's all friends until the next 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.840
 occasion where we will continue talking 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:01.159
 of cell phone lithium batteries and 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.159
