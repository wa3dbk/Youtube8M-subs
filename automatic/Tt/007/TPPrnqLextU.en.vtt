00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.380
 or worse 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.380
 ah 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.270
 very good everything goes up here as always 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.730
 as photo fil 4 playing still a little 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.710
 more than final are I have some of 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.660
 gameplay I still think there to use 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.980
 but what I want to talk to you today 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.029
 it does not have much to do with the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.619
 gameplay that we will be seeing in 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.540
 screen but it has to do with the 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.790
 new initiative that is preparing the 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.009
 jce in the ct client called the 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.079
 initiative of the timple or of the game in 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.940
 equipment that is obviously based 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.500
 around that improve the experience 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.450
 of team play for all 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.130
 players improve the experience to the 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.990
 time to not only play as a team 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.660
 play in patrol play the goal 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.750
 help your classmates get to the 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.280
 victory etcetera etcetera but if okay 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.530
 as you can see this video is a bit 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.390
 shorter because the initiative just 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.100
 is starting while there are many ideas 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.410
 there is a large list of ideas that have 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.030
 suggested good probably many of 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.770
 They have seen that they need a 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.989
 change and many have been suggested by 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.360
 part of the community has not yet been 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.009
 implemented nothing that I know of any that 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.439
 another very, very minimal change in the 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.000
 ct client this is since this 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.189
 initiative will not be part of the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.360
 next patch that will come out late 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.330
 of this month and that I calculate that it's going to 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.170
 leave on 3 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.450
 On September 30 we are on September 30 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.730
 sorry that probably when the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.040
 patch with the big changes create 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.770
 of the client the ct but that is who is going to 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.390
 come out with the final lcd are the same 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.160
 date does not mean that it comes out 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.020
 only for premium users or for 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.970
 users that have endings so but 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.120
 that the patch will come out in the same 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.410
 date that the dlc but what I wanted them 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.630
 ask you what you would like 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.580
 have changed with respect to the game in 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.400
 team that they would like to have added or 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.400
 changed improved that because basically 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.550
 what goes around this initiative 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.110
 is to encourage team play and that the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.330
 person who plays on a team that plays 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.310
 with your patrol have a reward 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.229
 greater as for example some of the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.570
 ideas that had suggested was that when 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.610
 one uses the ballistic shield to 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.410
 cover your bullet mates be 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.700
 rewarded for points like when 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.290
 we save someone who is being 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.880
 shot by an enemy us 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.800
 we killed that enemy and some points 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.540
 extras for having saved the person who 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.070
 I was about to die because of that 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.730
 enemy that was shooting him too 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.550
 ideas from 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.890
 give points either by using grenades 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.530
 of flashback or blinding or grenades 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.690
 smoke the desire to box that for now if 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.700
 well they are very useful in the ct the grenade 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.830
 the flashback if it hits you directly on 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.420
 the face leaves you blind for a good 10 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.400
 seconds if I'm not wrong you can not see 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.470
 absolutely nothing is a very change 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.090
 necessary for that type grenade but the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.379
 problem is still practically the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.849
 same I can have a grenade 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.069
 mower throw it inside the room 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.390
 leave the 10 completely blind 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.400
 enemies that are defending that 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.560
 last base in a game of russo 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.690
 assault for example my team enters the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.640
 kill everyone we all win less happy 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.650
 I did not receive a single point for 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.840
 have practically opened the way 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.239
 towards our last mission and towards 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.739
 our victory not in addition to that 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.510
 example that I say obviously there is a 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.160
 lots of other examples that can be 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.290
 get to give and what happen today in 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.760
 any game of 2004 but as they 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.920
 I said earlier I would like to hear 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.510
 what are your ideas or do you think that 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.590
 they would have to put aside completely 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.720
 this initiative and keep trying 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.430
 improve what the netbook theme is and 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.290
 some other more mechanical problem of 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.640
 game and as always I hope that there 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.480
 liked the video see you next 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.480
 bye
