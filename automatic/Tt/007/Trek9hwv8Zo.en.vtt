 the hotmail accounts previously 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.209

 the mail is like 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.450
 as a motor 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.910
 hot 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.910
 mail.com 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.530
 we make sure the mail is fine 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.450
 as a dotcom down engine and 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.130
 now we add the password I'm going to 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.750
 cover the password here to not have 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.750
 who edit this video 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.030
 and ready as the password and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.490
 we just click here 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.880
 where it is next he will make a process 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.710
 verification check will verify 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.330
 the existence of the mail and then 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.040
 will check the password there they saw 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.920
 several chulitos that indicated that he 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.230
 is that it confirms that the data is good 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.330
 in this case I'm going to deactivate 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.580
 calendars I do not want to synchronize 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.500
 calendars I do not want to synchronize 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.020
 reminders everything that followed me and 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.130
 run like that we give you save 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:09.340

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.240
 know how that vote is added this 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.580
 start button here on the screen 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.610
 that this video is also in our 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.800
 page is very useful as it avoids 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.080
 wear of the original button button 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.870
 physical 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.210
 then as we saw earlier already 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.310
 the added account was left and when I 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.520
