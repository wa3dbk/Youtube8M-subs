hey<00:00:00.570> everybody<00:00:00.930> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.199> Paul<00:00:01.530> so<00:00:01.949> in<00:00:02.070> this

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hey everybody this is Paul so in this

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.830 
hey everybody this is Paul so in this
tutorial<00:00:02.370> I'm<00:00:02.909> going<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.240> show<00:00:03.389> you<00:00:03.570> guys<00:00:03.780> how

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
tutorial I'm going to show you guys how

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.950 
tutorial I'm going to show you guys how
we<00:00:04.230> can<00:00:04.470> represent<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:05.100> whole<00:00:05.490> number<00:00:05.730> as<00:00:06.060> an

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
we can represent a whole number as an

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.230 
we can represent a whole number as an
unsigned<00:00:07.529> binary<00:00:08.450> number<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:10.639> basically<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
unsigned binary number so basically the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.680 
unsigned binary number so basically the
thing<00:00:12.450> about<00:00:12.630> an<00:00:12.780> unsigned<00:00:13.259> binary<00:00:13.679> number<00:00:14.370> is

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
thing about an unsigned binary number is

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.609 
thing about an unsigned binary number is
it<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.870> only<00:00:16.049> use<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.980> numbers<00:00:17.340> 1<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.210> 0<00:00:18.869> to

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
it can only use the numbers 1 and 0 to

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.769 
it can only use the numbers 1 and 0 to
represent<00:00:20.029> basically<00:00:21.029> all<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.630> whole

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
represent basically all of the whole

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.099 
represent basically all of the whole
numbers<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:24.150> whole<00:00:24.300> numbers<00:00:24.689> remember

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
numbers so the whole numbers remember

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.589 
numbers so the whole numbers remember
are<00:00:25.289> 0<00:00:25.730> 1<00:00:26.730> 2<00:00:27.710> 3<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.250> basically<00:00:30.000> all<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
are 0 1 2 3 and basically all the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.560 
are 0 1 2 3 and basically all the
integers<00:00:30.960> keeps<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.390> need<00:00:33.510> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
integers keeps on going but we need to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.080 
integers keeps on going but we need to
be<00:00:33.690> able<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> represent<00:00:34.469> all<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.710> these<00:00:35.579> whole

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
be able to represent all of these whole

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.840 
be able to represent all of these whole
numbers<00:00:36.510> by<00:00:37.170> simply<00:00:37.559> using<00:00:37.620> ones<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.489> zeros

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
numbers by simply using ones and zeros

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270 
numbers by simply using ones and zeros
so<00:00:39.750> how<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> world<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
so how in the world are we going to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.819 
so how in the world are we going to
accomplish<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.870> let's<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:43.350> ahead<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
accomplish that so let's go ahead and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.700 
accomplish that so let's go ahead and
just<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.370> look<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.559> couple<00:00:46.559> little

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
just kind of look at a couple little

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.310 
just kind of look at a couple little
cases<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.239> let's<00:00:48.719> look<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> binary

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
cases here so let's look at the binary

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.569 
cases here so let's look at the binary
number<00:00:50.510> 1<00:00:51.559> 0<00:00:52.559> 1<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.899> if<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.949> unsigned

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
number 1 0 1 so if this is unsigned

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.779 
number 1 0 1 so if this is unsigned
binary<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.680> represents<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
binary then this actually represents the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.900 
binary then this actually represents the
number<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.270> we're<00:01:00.449> used<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> seeing<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.320> 5<00:01:01.949> so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
number that we're used to seeing as 5 so

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.210 
number that we're used to seeing as 5 so
5<00:01:03.239> would<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.539> base<00:01:03.960> 10<00:01:04.379> that's<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> numbers

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
5 would be base 10 that's the numbers

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.609 
5 would be base 10 that's the numbers
that<00:01:05.369> we're<00:01:05.549> used<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.290> need<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> be

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that we're used to but we need to be

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.550 
that we're used to but we need to be
able<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> represent<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.490> 5<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:09.299> an<00:01:09.990> unsigned

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
able to represent the 5 as an unsigned

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.250 
able to represent the 5 as an unsigned
binary<00:01:10.830> number<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.729> only<00:01:11.970> use<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> 0<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
binary number so we can only use a 0 and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.100 
binary number so we can only use a 0 and
1<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.740> accomplish<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.360> how<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.869> get

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
1 to accomplish this so how do we get

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.149 
1 to accomplish this so how do we get
from<00:01:16.380> 1<00:01:16.650> 0<00:01:16.680> 1<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> number<00:01:18.450> 5<00:01:18.770> well<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:19.979> want

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
from 1 0 1 to the number 5 well we want

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.310 
from 1 0 1 to the number 5 well we want
to<00:01:20.250> think<00:01:20.460> about<00:01:20.610> these<00:01:21.330> numbers<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:22.200> when

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
to think about these numbers here when

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
to think about these numbers here when
we're<00:01:22.500> dealing<00:01:22.770> with<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.009> binary<00:01:23.220> numbers<00:01:23.759> we

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
we're dealing with the binary numbers we

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.260 
we're dealing with the binary numbers we
want<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> think<00:01:24.270> about<00:01:24.570> them<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:25.820> powers<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.850> 2

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
want to think about them as powers of 2

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.980 
want to think about them as powers of 2
so<00:01:28.259> for<00:01:28.710> example<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.210> wanted<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.780> kind

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
so for example if we wanted to just kind

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.450 
so for example if we wanted to just kind
of<00:01:31.049> start<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> right<00:01:31.799> right<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.310> we'll

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
of start at the right right here we'll

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.940 
of start at the right right here we'll
start<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.909> number<00:01:33.299> 1<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.799> right

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
start at this number 1 so this one right

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.920 
start at this number 1 so this one right
here<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.700> represent<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.240> power<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.689> 2

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
here is going to represent a power of 2

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.620 
here is going to represent a power of 2
and<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:38.100> power<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.000> represent<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
and the power it's going to represent is

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.649 
and the power it's going to represent is
the<00:01:39.869> 0<00:01:40.229> power<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.100> 2<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.119> one's<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.540> to

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the 0 power of 2 so this one's going to

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.280 
the 0 power of 2 so this one's going to
represent<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.619> 2<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> 0<00:01:44.369> position<00:01:45.290> now

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
represent the 2 to the 0 position now

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.200 
represent the 2 to the 0 position now
this<00:01:46.470> one<00:01:46.619> right<00:01:46.799> here<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:47.970> to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
this one right here is going to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.899 
this one right here is going to
represent<00:01:48.840> another<00:01:49.020> power<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.829> 2<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.670> going

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
represent another power of 2 it's going

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.710 
represent another power of 2 it's going
to<00:01:51.030> represent<00:01:51.210> 2<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> first<00:01:52.950> power<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
to represent 2 to the first power and

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.270 
to represent 2 to the first power and
then<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.799> just<00:01:56.040> kind<00:01:56.219> of

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
then this one right here we just kind of

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.389 
then this one right here we just kind of
keep<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.420> did<00:01:57.600> 0<00:01:58.110> 1<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.070> now

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
keep on going up we did 0 1 and so now

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.609 
keep on going up we did 0 1 and so now
we're<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.759> do<00:01:59.909> 0<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.899> sorry<00:02:01.079> 2<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
we're going to do 0 to the or sorry 2 to

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.649 
we're going to do 0 to the or sorry 2 to
the<00:02:01.770> 2<00:02:03.079> 2<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> 2<00:02:04.590> power<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.909> if<00:02:06.090> we<00:02:06.210> kept<00:02:06.479> on

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
the 2 2 to the 2 power so if we kept on

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.050 
the 2 2 to the 2 power so if we kept on
going<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.259> next<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:08.039> 2<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
going the next one would be 2 to the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.490 
going the next one would be 2 to the
third<00:02:09.390> power<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:09.929> would<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:10.200> keep<00:02:10.349> on

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
third power and we would just keep on

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.860 
third power and we would just keep on
going<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.069> way<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:12.090> now<00:02:12.330> if<00:02:12.510> we<00:02:12.540> want<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
going that way and so now if we want to

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.640 
going that way and so now if we want to
kind<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.110> think<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
kind of think of the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.270 
kind of think of the
one's<00:02:14.040> as<00:02:14.540> basically<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.959> switches<00:02:16.709> so<00:02:17.189> we'll

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
one's as basically on switches so we'll

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.399 
one's as basically on switches so we'll
put<00:02:17.459> one<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:18.150> equal<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:21.599> zeros<00:02:21.989> are

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
put one is equal to on and the zeros are

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.030 
put one is equal to on and the zeros are
basically<00:02:23.010> off<00:02:23.810> switches<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.829> can<00:02:25.950> either

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
basically off switches so you can either

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.089 
basically off switches so you can either
switch<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:27.480> power<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.959> two<00:02:28.170> on<00:02:28.409> or<00:02:28.799> off

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
switch this power of two on or off

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.220 
switch this power of two on or off
depending<00:02:29.489> on<00:02:29.879> what<00:02:30.299> representation<00:02:31.109> you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
depending on what representation you

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.910 
depending on what representation you
have<00:02:31.260> right<00:02:31.620> here<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.959> basically<00:02:33.959> two<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
have right here so basically two to the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.309 
have right here so basically two to the
zero<00:02:34.950> power<00:02:35.640> anything<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.659> zero<00:02:36.870> power<00:02:37.109> is

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
zero power anything to the zero power is

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.369 
zero power anything to the zero power is
simply<00:02:37.620> equal<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.159> one<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.900> has<00:02:40.049> an<00:02:40.200> on

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
simply equal to one and that has an on

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.740 
simply equal to one and that has an on
switch<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:41.159> ahead<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.370> keep<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.750> now

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
switch so we go ahead and keep that now

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.599 
switch so we go ahead and keep that now
two<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.319> first<00:02:43.500> power<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:43.920> equal<00:02:44.159> to<00:02:44.310> two

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
two to the first power is equal to two

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.610 
two to the first power is equal to two
but<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.299> an<00:02:45.450> off<00:02:45.720> switch<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.409> we're<00:02:46.590> just

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
but we have an off switch so we're just

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.259 
but we have an off switch so we're just
going<00:02:46.829> to<00:02:46.859> write<00:02:47.069> zero<00:02:47.099> since<00:02:47.819> we<00:02:47.970> have<00:02:48.120> that

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
going to write zero since we have that

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.300 
going to write zero since we have that
off<00:02:48.480> switch<00:02:49.730> now<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:51.090> have<00:02:51.269> an<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.569> switch<00:02:51.780> here

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
off switch now we have an on switch here

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.580 
off switch now we have an on switch here
two<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.700> second<00:02:54.090> power<00:02:54.239> is<00:02:54.540> two<00:02:55.079> times<00:02:55.319> two

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
two to the second power is two times two

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.970 
two to the second power is two times two
which<00:02:55.799> is<00:02:55.859> equal<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.310> four<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.620> now<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:58.769> have

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
which is equal to four so now we have

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.460 
which is equal to four so now we have
four<00:02:59.340> plus<00:03:00.329> zero<00:03:01.340> plus<00:03:02.420> 1/4<00:03:03.420> plus<00:03:03.750> zero<00:03:04.260> plus

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
four plus zero plus 1/4 plus zero plus

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.599 
four plus zero plus 1/4 plus zero plus
one<00:03:04.829> is<00:03:05.069> equal<00:03:05.159> to<00:03:05.970> five<00:03:06.859> so<00:03:07.859> basically<00:03:08.310> an

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
one is equal to five so basically an

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.720 
one is equal to five so basically an
unsigned<00:03:09.480> binary<00:03:09.870> number<00:03:10.650> an<00:03:10.859> unsigned

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
unsigned binary number an unsigned

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.789 
unsigned binary number an unsigned
binary<00:03:11.970> number<00:03:12.510> with<00:03:12.840> one<00:03:13.139> zero<00:03:13.200> one

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
binary number with one zero one

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.089 
binary number with one zero one
represents<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.939> whole<00:03:15.150> number<00:03:15.569> five<00:03:16.109> so

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
represents the whole number five so

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.309 
represents the whole number five so
let's<00:03:17.129> go<00:03:17.310> ahead<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.549> try<00:03:17.790> another<00:03:18.030> example

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
let's go ahead and try another example

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:25.460 
let's go ahead and try another example
so<00:03:19.319> what<00:03:19.620> about<00:03:19.739> one<00:03:20.629> zero<00:03:21.629> zero<00:03:22.069> one<00:03:24.109> so<00:03:25.109> once

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
so what about one zero zero one so once

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.080 
so what about one zero zero one so once
again<00:03:25.620> let's<00:03:26.099> just<00:03:26.250> go<00:03:26.370> ahead<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.669> write<00:03:26.910> this

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
again let's just go ahead and write this

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.250 
again let's just go ahead and write this
out<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.299> guess<00:03:27.510> I'll<00:03:27.599> use<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.810> different<00:03:28.049> color

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
out I guess I'll use a different color

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.210 
out I guess I'll use a different color
here<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.180> right<00:03:30.180> here<00:03:30.540> we're<00:03:30.930> looking<00:03:31.109> at<00:03:31.440> one

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
here so right here we're looking at one

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.890 
here so right here we're looking at one
power<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.730> two<00:03:32.940> we're<00:03:33.269> going<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.449> do<00:03:33.540> two<00:03:33.750> to

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
power of two we're going to do two to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.599 
power of two we're going to do two to
the<00:03:34.049> zero<00:03:34.079> just<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.739> we<00:03:34.859> did<00:03:35.010> last<00:03:35.040> time<00:03:35.459> we

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
the zero just like we did last time we

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.849 
the zero just like we did last time we
started<00:03:35.909> at<00:03:36.000> two<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.419> zero<00:03:36.449> and<00:03:36.959> then<00:03:37.739> this

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
started at two to the zero and then this

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.369 
started at two to the zero and then this
one<00:03:38.040> right<00:03:38.190> here<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.579> going<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.879> represent<00:03:39.510> two

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
one right here is going to represent two

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.640 
one right here is going to represent two
to<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.799> first<00:03:41.040> power<00:03:41.479> this<00:03:42.479> one<00:03:42.750> would<00:03:43.169> be<00:03:43.199> two

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
to the first power this one would be two

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.719 
to the first power this one would be two
to<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.549> second<00:03:45.000> power<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:46.430> then<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.549> last

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
to the second power and then the last

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.670 
to the second power and then the last
one<00:03:48.000> we<00:03:48.359> go<00:03:48.510> up<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.810> two<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.560> third<00:03:49.739> power

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
one we go up to two to the third power

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.960 
one we go up to two to the third power
so<00:03:52.680> two<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.340> zero<00:03:53.459> power<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.239> equal<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.139> one

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
so two to the zero power is equal to one

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.550 
so two to the zero power is equal to one
two<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.180> first<00:03:57.329> power<00:03:57.449> equals<00:03:57.750> two<00:03:58.260> but

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
two to the first power equals two but

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.289 
two to the first power equals two but
this<00:03:58.680> has<00:03:58.889> an<00:03:59.040> off<00:03:59.250> switch<00:03:59.519> since<00:03:59.909> we<00:04:00.030> have<00:04:00.150> the

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
this has an off switch since we have the

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.930 
this has an off switch since we have the
zero<00:04:00.510> there<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:00.989> we'll<00:04:01.139> just<00:04:01.260> put<00:04:01.409> zero<00:04:01.819> two<00:04:02.819> to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
zero there so we'll just put zero two to

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.909 
zero there so we'll just put zero two to
the<00:04:03.060> second<00:04:03.389> power<00:04:03.419> is<00:04:03.720> equal<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.139> four<00:04:04.260> but

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
the second power is equal to four but

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.879 
the second power is equal to four but
that's<00:04:05.099> off<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.760> we'll<00:04:05.879> put<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.090> 0<00:04:06.150> here<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.889> two

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
that's off so we'll put a 0 here and two

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.770 
that's off so we'll put a 0 here and two
to<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.099> third<00:04:08.370> power<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.790> two<00:04:09.150> times<00:04:09.540> two

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
to the third power is two times two

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.649 
to the third power is two times two
times<00:04:09.810> two<00:04:10.169> which<00:04:11.159> equals<00:04:11.370> eight<00:04:11.819> so<00:04:12.540> we'll

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
times two which equals eight so we'll

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.479 
times two which equals eight so we'll
put<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:12.959> eight<00:04:13.349> right<00:04:13.709> here<00:04:14.209> so<00:04:15.209> eight<00:04:15.510> plus

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
put in eight right here so eight plus

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.940 
put in eight right here so eight plus
zero<00:04:17.489> plus<00:04:18.329> zero<00:04:18.859> plus<00:04:19.859> one<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.549> equal<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.599> nine

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
zero plus zero plus one is equal to nine

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.170 
zero plus zero plus one is equal to nine
so<00:04:22.950> if<00:04:23.010> we<00:04:23.099> wanted<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.430> represent<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:24.029> number

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
so if we wanted to represent the number

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.410 
so if we wanted to represent the number
nine<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:25.460> unsigned<00:04:26.460> binary

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
nine in unsigned binary

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.690 
nine in unsigned binary
notation<00:04:27.870> we<00:04:28.380> simply<00:04:28.800> write<00:04:29.010> 1<00:04:29.910> 0<00:04:30.870> 0<00:04:31.230> 1<00:04:31.500> if<00:04:31.980> we

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
notation we simply write 1 0 0 1 if we

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.310 
notation we simply write 1 0 0 1 if we
want<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:32.970> represent<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.480> number<00:04:33.510> 5<00:04:33.990> an

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
want to represent the number 5 an

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.190 
want to represent the number 5 an
unsigned<00:04:34.860> binary<00:04:35.190> notation<00:04:35.610> we<00:04:36.600> simply<00:04:36.990> write

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
unsigned binary notation we simply write

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.420 
unsigned binary notation we simply write
1<00:04:37.890> 0<00:04:38.490> 1<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:40.530> anyway<00:04:40.800> there<00:04:40.980> was<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.130> couple

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
1 0 1 so anyway there was a couple

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.730 
1 0 1 so anyway there was a couple
examples<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:42.030> how<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.240> can<00:04:42.570> convert<00:04:42.990> whole

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
examples of how you can convert whole

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.680 
examples of how you can convert whole
numbers<00:04:44.220> into<00:04:44.790> unsigned<00:04:45.480> binary<00:04:46.080> numbers
