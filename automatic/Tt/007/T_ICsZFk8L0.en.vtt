00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
actually I think there are a couple

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.479 
actually I think there are a couple
reasons<00:02:13.810> why<00:02:14.260> people<00:02:14.470> go<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.800> starbucks<00:02:15.280> I

reasons why people go to starbucks I

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.979 
reasons why people go to starbucks I
think<00:02:15.730> some<00:02:15.940> people<00:02:16.239> go<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.450> Starbucks

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
think some people go to Starbucks

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.930 
think some people go to Starbucks
because<00:02:17.380> they<00:02:17.739> need<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:17.980> caffeine<00:02:18.370> and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
because they need the caffeine and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.240 
because they need the caffeine and
that's<00:02:19.720> their<00:02:20.020> primary<00:02:20.260> reason<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.980> think

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
that's their primary reason I think

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.059 
that's their primary reason I think
other<00:02:21.400> people<00:02:21.760> go<00:02:21.910> because<00:02:22.470> they<00:02:23.470> like<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
other people go because they like the

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.510 
other people go because they like the
