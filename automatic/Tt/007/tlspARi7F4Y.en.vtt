multiplayer<00:00:40.440> mmm<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:42.690> just

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
multiplayer mmm like it's just it's just

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.799 
multiplayer mmm like it's just it's just
a<00:00:43.230> different<00:00:43.440> way<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.739> doing<00:00:43.950> health<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.809> it's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
a different way of doing health and it's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.790 
a different way of doing health and it's
not<00:00:45.989> good<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:46.440> bad<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.680> single<00:00:47.550> player<00:00:47.670> mm-hmm

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
not good or bad for single player mm-hmm

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.619 
not good or bad for single player mm-hmm
but<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.070> would<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.370> huge<00:00:50.730> improvement<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:51.510> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
but it would be a huge improvement if it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.840 
but it would be a huge improvement if it
was<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.020> multiplayer<00:00:52.500> now<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> haven't<00:00:53.699> played

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
that they they mix it up with the rookie

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.600 
that they they mix it up with the rookie
mission<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.909> then<00:01:27.080> crazy<00:01:28.250> halo<00:01:29.250> mission<00:01:29.520> that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
mission and then crazy halo mission that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.100 
mission and then crazy halo mission that
you've<00:01:29.759> played<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> million<00:01:30.420> times<00:01:30.570> before<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
you've played a million times before and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.219 
you've played a million times before and
then<00:01:31.409> back<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.860> rookie<00:01:32.220> missions<00:01:33.229> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
then back to the rookie missions and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.920 
then back to the rookie missions and
that<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.710> wouldn't<00:01:35.040> mind<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.090> aim<00:01:36.689> was

which<00:04:06.300> would<00:04:06.780> probably<00:04:07.200> never<00:04:07.350> happen<00:04:07.650> but

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
which would probably never happen but

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.610 
which would probably never happen but
theoretically<00:04:08.910> mm-hm<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.870> then<00:04:10.110> they<00:04:10.290> get<00:04:10.470> to

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
theoretically mm-hm and then they get to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.470 
theoretically mm-hm and then they get to
rights<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.220> right<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.910> then<00:04:12.030> like<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.209> big

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
rights and right and then like a big

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.479 
rights and right and then like a big
soup<00:04:12.840> still<00:04:13.290> has<00:04:13.500> soft<00:04:13.920> right<00:04:15.200> um<00:04:16.340> what<00:04:17.340> else

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
soup still has soft right um what else

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.160 
soup still has soft right um what else
could<00:04:17.609> make<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.910> die<00:04:18.090> like

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
could make it die like

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.610 
could make it die like
