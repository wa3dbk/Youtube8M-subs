00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.790
 This is a beautiful story that puts you 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:11.590
 reflect on who you are called the 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.280
 hen and the condom and says well 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.040
 Once upon a time there was a family of birds 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.310
 conformed by potatoes called morgan mom 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.640
 called Dina and a little neighbor who 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.770
 I thought differently called julia julia 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.940
 I always looked at the sky and dreamed 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.550
 fly many times dad said dad 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.220
 dad want to fly 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.010
 morgan looked at her and told her what's wrong 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.070
 we do not fly then the 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.280
 Little girl ran to where Mommy was telling her 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.300
 Mommy I want to fly and Dinah replied 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.210
 you're crazy the hens we do not fly july 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.120
 she felt sad but sure that 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.969
 I could fly 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.230
 suddenly it was visited by another bird 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.960
 called Andrew and Julia fell in love with him 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.659
 Julia thought that Andre would teach her 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.690
 fly but when they reached the nest of 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.110
 André Julián was not well received by 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.440
 they looked different 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.170
 however, Julia never stopped dreaming 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.110
 with flying 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.380
 spent some time july and andrey 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.799
 they had four chicks 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.560
 julia insisted on flying but now not 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.750
 I was alone 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.840
 he wanted his chicks to fly with 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.090
 she then when andré was given 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.990
 account of this raised a great fence 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.020
 July was very sad because this one was 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.770
 very tall I still did not know how to fly 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.859
 - your chicks feeling locked 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.810
 Julia opened a small hole where 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:58.990
 it came out clear hurting its wings 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.840
 at the moment July came out andrés 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.770
 and the other birds in the nest got angry and 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.740
 they expelled her from this one 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.250
 among them they commented he has never been 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:14.269
 happy here is a weirdo is very 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.000
 different from us that always leaves 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.310
 and when you do not take the chicks 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.340
 telling him andrés 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.010
 July was devastated and with its wings 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.040
 broken - could try to fly 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.739
 time later Julia found 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.099
 another bird called happy and although at 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.060
 first he fell badly as he says 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.939
 her name with her happiness fell in love 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.790
 She smiled then suddenly she 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:46.970
 he said he just wanted to fly for this 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.560
 had been expelled from her nest and that 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.560
 there were his chicks 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.590
 happy told him I also want to fly 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.650
 but I do not know how to do it 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.530
 from his union was born another chick named 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.800
 bird despite his pain by the absence 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.650
 of his other chicks Julian had 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.090
 returned to live and with the motivation of 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.380
 abbey happy and julia tried to fly 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:20.350
 teaching his skillful little girl 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.280
 Suddenly one day Julia saw her 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.770
 These chicks were looking for it 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.980
 just like her they also had 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.400
 the desire to fly 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.250
 Julia was very happy because they were 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.280
 gathered all their chicks together with 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.940
 the love of his life 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:44.310
 these with their immense desire to fly if 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.010
 they were flying but not so high 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.400
 one day a couple of condors saw them 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.520
 flying and descended one of these you 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.080
 julia and ask you why you fly so 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.400
 low 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.160
 Julia answered under you tell me if the 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.910
 chickens do not fly and we fly a 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.830
 little one of these condors answered him 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:14.680
 but if you are not a chicken or you 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.590
 said happy and less your chicks 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.060
 surprised July I ask him why what 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.900
 you say and the condor replied you have not 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.389
 never looked 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.670
 the condor brings July and his family to 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.740
 the riverbank 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:34.590
 amazed julia to see a reflection in 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.110
 the water discovered that it was equal to 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:42.760
 condors and told these then I 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.130
 I'm not a chicken 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.169
 smiling the condors replied 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:52.009
 no, you're not 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.900
 I asked Julia, so she can fly 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.090
 like you 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.500
 to which the condors responded 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:03.130
 yes clear and your family too 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.960
 if you want we can teach you 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:10.529
 like you have always known 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.030
 and julián excited answered yes 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:17.710
 and I knew it 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:22.810
 julia happy and her family flew very very 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:28.210
 high and they were very very happy 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:30.670
 and you are a chicken or a condor 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.470
 maybe you know how to fly 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.470
 but you prefer to be in a chicken coop
