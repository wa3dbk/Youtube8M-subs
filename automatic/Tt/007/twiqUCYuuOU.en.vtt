but it says it became squishy than
before<00:01:34.670> I'm<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.909> sure<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.360> means<00:01:36.509> it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
before I'm not sure that it means it

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:48.050

it's<00:01:52.110> here's<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> image<00:01:54.259> um<00:01:55.259> these<00:01:56.159> are<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
it's here's the image um these are the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.609 
it's here's the image um these are the
bread<00:01:56.729> rolls<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.750> kind<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.079> remind<00:01:58.200> me

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
bread rolls and they kind of remind me

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.959 
bread rolls and they kind of remind me
of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.399> uh<00:02:00.770> I'm<00:02:01.770> clinics<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> bakery<00:02:02.759> one

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
of the uh I'm clinics and the bakery one

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.330 
of the uh I'm clinics and the bakery one
so<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:03.360> are<00:02:03.450> many<00:02:03.680> colors<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.040> vanilla

so there are many colors of this vanilla
which<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.180> white<00:02:06.390> strawberry

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
which is I think it's white strawberry

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the croissant looks like these the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.880 
the croissant looks like these the
vanilla<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.900> really<00:02:13.140> hard<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.380> see<00:02:13.560> kind<00:02:13.770> of

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
vanilla is really hard to see kind of
