to make letters with a router with most
of<00:00:11.730> my<00:00:11.849> router<00:00:12.120> jigs<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.750> templates<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.349> tend

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
of my router jigs and templates I tend

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.720 
of my router jigs and templates I tend
to<00:00:13.650> make<00:00:13.830> them<00:00:14.009> myself

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
to make them myself

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.120 
to make them myself
I<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:15.509> make<00:00:15.630> them<00:00:15.719> fit<00:00:15.960> exactly<00:00:16.410> what<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.590> need

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
but when working with letters I think

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.710 
but when working with letters I think
it's<00:00:20.490> best<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.820> go<00:00:20.939> with<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.180> commercial

and we'll go for about a quarter of an
inch<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.920> case<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.119> measure<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.509> and
