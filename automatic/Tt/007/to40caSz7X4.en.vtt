00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello today I'll show you how to make it 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.740
 a small painting with a tablet of 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.840
 plywood and maps of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.740
 Chocolates 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.960
 let's see how we proceed 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.320
 retrieved a small samp the sentences with 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.189
 sensible here it is and then recovered 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.039
 these maps from an old collection 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.949
 choose the bad ones according to your tastes 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.090
 and in the right quantity to cover all 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.090
 the tablet surface 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.440
 now begins to arrange the maps on the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.059
 surface trying to find the right 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.260
 equilibrium 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.260
 for example chromatic 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.659
 you can also slightly overlap edges 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.089
 of the maps in such a way as to 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:12.310
 create an even more composition 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:14.720
 different if you overlap the maps 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.580
 choose to overlap those parts 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.030
 which are less graphic for example with 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.030
 of the writings 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.259
 Now let's move on to the next phase 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:39.280
 we have to paste the maps start at 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.280
 paste the papers on the support 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.860
 hot-melt rounder to make in 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.269
 so that no sandwiches are formed 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.720
 we must be very fast in 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:28.030
 stick the map otherwise we would have 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.030
 sketches that will be difficult to finish 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:18.930
 after pasting all the maps e 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.249
 flattened at the edges 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.249
 here is the final result
