00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.710
 a statement of Christian angel that 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.440
 I was half annoying and others are 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.710
 starting to fight I notice him fighter in 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.330
 the statements for a long time more to 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.330
 Christian in the in Madrid 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.119
 but it would take us to see what 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.220
 Christian in his time to me helped me 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.410
 to choose in the club 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.320
 now that I left he also threw 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.990
 fighting so that he loves me and 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.990
 it was on my side good 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.180
 how much do you have to endure as soon as 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.240
 what do you want to do 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:55.260
 but no 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:58.640
 is a difficult man this Florentine 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.500
 112 I do not know why not at any time 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.080
 I had a long dialogue with him 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.690
 coli ko and when the madrid arrives 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.060
 has my contract was never present 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.940
 When I renewed my contract, it was not 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.600
 so 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.600
 I do not have it 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.110
 another thing that I listen to and also 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.210
 of the client was that he never brought 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.210
 because I wanted to go 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.190
 I do not know if at any time in some 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.670
 newspaper came out of my mouth and I wanted 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.880
 I never said it 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.590
 nor in any tradition did I say it 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:42.240
 I never wanted to go Christian to town 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.240
 of those who knew because he always supported me 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.960
 we remember the vast majority of 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.210
 players that are 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.369
 in captains and they are the biggest in 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.100
 tribute that they have known for longer 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.030
 that I wanted but good 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.689
 things that happen and good you bring me 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.840
 other players and I think they say what 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.200
 let them say the 75 million that he sold me 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.810
 it was very good for Madrid to be able to 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.900
 recover everything he was spending and 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.410
 I think that it came very well but 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.520
 well you see that I talk to another person 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:26.920
 that is neither my representative nor I the 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.410
 true that the offer bosch angel wanted 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.519
 play the final yes or yes although you were at 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.350
 limit 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.870
 the technician did not put you only not 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.019
 you played that final because he knows not you 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.000
 put an interference from real madrid 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.850
 gives a warning that if he played if he 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.260
 they broke something was happening 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.480
 a letter from madrid that good then 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.170
 11 in the morning of the day of the match 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.830
 we play at 4 and at 11 a letter I 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.380
 I was trying to just 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.530
 adapting a little and good so that what 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.830
 what happens could the 90 risk that 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.530
 I hurt again but good the letter 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.220
 It is as I gave it tore 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.230
 internally I did not pay attention to it 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.990
 same if what happens happens but good 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.700
 Then I spoke with Alejandro and he gave 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.700
 decisions I did not want to put you 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.310
 no requirement to have to put 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.170
 meters and only tells you what what 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.610
 was thought and what good what was going to 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.800
 be for being able to play but I did not want to 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.440
 leave the team within five minutes of 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.720
 food with at least so we have 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.550
 to make a change in such a match 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.930
 important and then you talked to 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.489
 someone from madrid after this 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.010
 because ultimately they are because you 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.269
 in a revolver in the head 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.970
 but I do not care dead I did not care 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.430
 whatever happens 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.480
 I suffered a lot during the whole morning 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.300
 Then I knew I was not going to play 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:07.890
 very much was the worst thing that could happen to me 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.930
 in life because politically they reach 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.430
 another end of the world 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.620
 at the end and get to 2 I still think it's 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.930
 impossible obvious that one tries to make 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.479
 everything always to be able to be in a 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:27.060
 final but but good are things that 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:28.650
 happen and the Togolese world I was 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.509
 just thinking about the world cup in 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.190
 no time I spoke cable with any 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.320
 journalist was only once to the 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.500
 press conference and it kept coming out 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.389
 the one who will measure himself and the things I do not know about 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.100
 where they come out I do not know where they put in the 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.400
 marks the things that are in now that 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.160
 that's my idea no no no me with people 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.320
 the truth that management that I had the best 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.479
 relationship always supported me always 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.250
 active from my side at the last moment 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.289
 when everyone said he told me 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.810
 that went between 10 minutes with the 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.310
 athletic of madrid and gave me half said 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.910
 and what sergio told me they have 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.710
 789 call ten years in the club and I 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.000
 I want you never heard an ovation 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.930
 as big as those who have heard 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.980
 with me 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.290
 the people with me were to death 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.300
 I did not have the thought of what came out 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.600
 in the newspapers of the newspapers but 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.450
 good are things that happen to you are like this and 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.670
 good once you have to go for another 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.350
 side when when they do not want it and you do not 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.060
 it would have been the same had you stayed 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.800
 in madrid if there yes yes yes no 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.660
 because the truth is that with this tremendous 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.850
 offer man of course there will be 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.340
 put the stained glass more or less for those 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.650
 values this for you from having chosen 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.480
 what would or would not have been left 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.930
 to die like that 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.580
 what is normal when one has 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:48.150
 proposals like those that were like 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.790
 Paris sick as Monaco 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.490
 Manchester United as the city that 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.950
 he was also circling is normal 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.990
 that the club does want to sell you in 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:01.560
 assisted standards of renewing yourself in a 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.780
 no one said anything to me or to me 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.390
 representative so our 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.700
 thought was that the club thinking 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.970
 only in selling me the bonus was what 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.300
 He passed 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.610
 sure fine and what he said who was 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.560
 iniesta or xavi that I do not remember 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.150
 here in argentina good had 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.040
 transcended the possibility of what 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.190
 barÃ§a really existed or not 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.280
 I do not know anything has come off 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.920
 if I listened here and I think I'm talking to you 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:32.120
 they asked him if he would notice me and 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.120
 it was there as a medium in doubt
