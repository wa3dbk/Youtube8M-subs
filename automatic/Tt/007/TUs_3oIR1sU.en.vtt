facetime calls this would have been
great<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> front

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
millimeters thick this is very thin but

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.090 
millimeters thick this is very thin but
it<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> little<00:01:37.110> thicker<00:01:37.470> than<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:37.680> iPad<00:01:37.920> 2

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
it is a little thicker than your iPad 2

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700 
it is a little thicker than your iPad 2
surprisingly<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.299> ipad<00:01:39.600> 2<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.020> eight<00:01:40.290> point

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
surprisingly the ipad 2 is eight point

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.289 
surprisingly the ipad 2 is eight point
eight<00:01:40.860> millimeters<00:01:41.340> thick<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.180> I

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
eight millimeters thick and this is as I

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.289 
eight millimeters thick and this is as I
said<00:01:42.360> 9.41<00:01:43.220> it's<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> tad<00:01:44.729> thicker<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.240> I

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
said 9.41 it's just a tad thicker and I

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.840

think you'll even notice this because if

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.190 
think you'll even notice this because if
you<00:01:48.000> watch<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.240> comparison<00:01:48.899> video<00:01:49.110> between

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.630 
be able to get on camera the difference
so<00:01:54.570> yeah<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.869> pretty<00:01:55.020> unnoticeable<00:01:55.640> talking

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
so yeah it's pretty unnoticeable talking

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.819 
so yeah it's pretty unnoticeable talking
about<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> weight<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> new<00:01:57.600> ipad<00:01:57.899> 3<00:01:58.200> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
about the weight of the new ipad 3 it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.740 
about the weight of the new ipad 3 it
actually<00:01:59.100> weighs<00:01:59.430> once<00:01:59.820> again<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:00.600> more

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
actually weighs once again a little more

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.530 
actually weighs once again a little more
than<00:02:00.869> your<00:02:00.990> ipad<00:02:01.229> 2<00:02:01.409> surprisingly<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.759> ipad<00:02:03.240> 3

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
than your ipad 2 surprisingly the ipad 3

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.920 
than your ipad 2 surprisingly the ipad 3
it<00:02:03.780> weighs<00:02:04.159> 652<00:02:05.159> grams<00:02:05.610> whereas<00:02:06.600> i<00:02:06.689> believed

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
it weighs 652 grams whereas i believed

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 
it weighs 652 grams whereas i believed
the<00:02:07.020> ipad<00:02:07.290> 2<00:02:07.500> ways<00:02:07.710> bright<00:02:07.979> around<00:02:08.190> 600<00:02:08.700> grams

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the ipad 2 ways bright around 600 grams

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.540 
the ipad 2 ways bright around 600 grams
so<00:02:09.660> once<00:02:09.840> again<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.440> minimal<00:02:10.890> 50<00:02:11.280> grams

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
so once again this is minimal 50 grams

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.020 
so once again this is minimal 50 grams
is<00:02:11.790> next<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> nothing

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
is next to nothing

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.070 
is next to nothing
and<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.300> couldn't<00:02:13.720> even<00:02:13.780> tell<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.050> difference

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
and I couldn't even tell the difference

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.230 
and I couldn't even tell the difference
between<00:02:15.180> my<00:02:16.180> ipad<00:02:16.480> 2<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.200> new<00:02:17.319> ipad<00:02:18.240> now

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
between my ipad 2 and the new ipad now

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.730 
between my ipad 2 and the new ipad now
let's<00:02:19.450> talk<00:02:19.660> about<00:02:19.720> whatever<00:02:20.080> I<00:02:20.350> wants<00:02:20.620> to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
let's talk about whatever I wants to

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.830 
let's talk about whatever I wants to
know<00:02:20.860> about<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.240> course<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
know about and that is of course the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.680 
know about and that is of course the
retina<00:02:23.290> display<00:02:23.800> now<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:24.790> display<00:02:25.180> has<00:02:25.480> an

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
retina display now this display has an

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.980 
retina display now this display has an
insane<00:02:26.080> resolution<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.830> 2048<00:02:27.610> x<00:02:27.790> 1536<00:02:28.240> and

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
insane resolution of 2048 x 1536 and

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.390 
insane resolution of 2048 x 1536 and
that<00:02:29.770> is<00:02:30.569> 264<00:02:31.569> pixels<00:02:31.930> per<00:02:32.470> inch<00:02:32.500> now<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.340> is

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
that is 264 pixels per inch now this is

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.030 
that is 264 pixels per inch now this is
insane<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.270> teenage<00:02:34.569> panel<00:02:34.930> it's<00:02:35.620> far

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
insane on a teenage panel it's far

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.520 
insane on a teenage panel it's far
higher<00:02:36.280> than<00:02:36.310> 1080p<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.930> right<00:02:38.230> around<00:02:38.350> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
higher than 1080p it's right around the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.800 
higher than 1080p it's right around the
same<00:02:38.709> resolution<00:02:38.980> as<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.340> 27<00:02:39.880> monitor<00:02:40.150> its<00:02:40.420> kind

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
of in that ballpark around there so they

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.270

viewing it on different angles the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.120 
viewing it on different angles the
colors<00:03:13.360> will<00:03:13.510> not<00:03:13.690> degrade<00:03:13.980> particularly<00:03:14.980> bad

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130
