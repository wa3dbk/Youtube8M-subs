but with you I mean this guitar to my
ear<00:01:11.340> sounds<00:01:11.759> much<00:01:12.090> better<00:01:12.119> than<00:01:12.509> it<00:01:12.749> makes<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:13.319 
ear sounds much better than it makes it

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.249 
ear sounds much better than it makes it
D<00:01:13.609> even<00:01:14.609> have<00:01:14.759> a<00:01:14.789> really<00:01:15.119> good<00:01:15.270> 50s<00:01:15.689> D<00:01:15.840> 18<00:01:16.140> it

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
D even have a really good 50s D 18 it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.200 
D even have a really good 50s D 18 it
makes<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:16.619> D<00:01:16.679> 18<00:01:17.219> seem<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.579> little<00:01:17.850> dull

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
makes my D 18 seem a little dull

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.330 
makes my D 18 seem a little dull
sounding<00:01:18.689> there's<00:01:19.289> more<00:01:19.619> air<00:01:19.829> around<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
sounding there's more air around the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760 
sounding there's more air around the
notes<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.759> these<00:01:20.880> small<00:01:21.179> body<00:01:21.390> guitars<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
notes in these small body guitars you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.249 
notes in these small body guitars you
get<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> better<00:01:23.130> overtone<00:01:23.759> series

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.830 

better<00:01:26.829> mid-range<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.969> if<00:01:28.299> you<00:01:28.390> look<00:01:28.570> at<00:01:28.689> I

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
better mid-range and if you look at I

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.719 
better mid-range and if you look at I
really<00:01:29.229> think<00:01:29.409> this<00:01:29.560> top<00:01:29.770> isn't<00:01:30.100> much<00:01:30.250> older

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
really think this top isn't much older

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.270 
really think this top isn't much older
it<00:01:30.850> sure<00:01:31.030> sounds<00:01:31.420> older<00:01:31.659> than<00:01:31.810> 68<00:01:32.380> or<00:01:32.530> 69<00:01:32.649> to<00:01:33.130> me

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
it sure sounds older than 68 or 69 to me

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.520 
it sure sounds older than 68 or 69 to me
great<00:01:34.060> soaking<00:01:34.479> patterns<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:35.049> pads<00:01:35.289> will<00:01:35.439> go

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
great soaking patterns the pads will go

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.069 
great soaking patterns the pads will go
across<00:01:35.710> this<00:01:36.009> way<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:37.479> is<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.630> hell<00:01:37.869> of<00:01:37.899> a

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
across this way this is a hell of a

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.660 
across this way this is a hell of a
guitar<00:01:38.409> I<00:01:38.590> mean<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:38.770> even<00:01:39.159> think<00:01:39.310> it<00:01:39.369> sounds

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
guitar I mean I even think it sounds

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.550 
guitar I mean I even think it sounds
better<00:01:39.729> than<00:01:40.000> like<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.390> Oh<00:01:40.420> 17<00:01:41.049> all<00:01:41.229> mahogany

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
better than like the Oh 17 all mahogany

00:01:41.560 --> 00:02:00.390 
better than like the Oh 17 all mahogany
