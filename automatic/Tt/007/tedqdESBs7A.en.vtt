00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:56.950
 turned upside down and in divination 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.940

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:05.549
 watering just turned over pour some water 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:11.160
 and the plant takes as long as necessary 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.160

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:59.440
 with eggplants you always have to plant porcelain 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.440
 so that they are healthy
