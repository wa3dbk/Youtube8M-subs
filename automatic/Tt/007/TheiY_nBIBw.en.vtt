00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.300
 and it is already 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.910
 my friends from youtube as they are here 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.190
 peek uriz telling them two tricks that 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.219
 they are going to serve me a lot I am playing 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.410
 here I was playing the black ops of 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.160
 zombie in transit mode in mode 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.590
 just be redundant and the truth is 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.380
 that in some occasions I had left 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.769
 the electric zombie and he could not 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.449
 kill him he would shoot with the 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.309
 mustang and I came out improved but I could not 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.290
 kill him and here I was foolish 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.660
 looking through the floor heads arms of the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.070
 zombies until suddenly I get the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.989
 electric zombie 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 my idea that the mind came because it was going 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.670
 to kill with the corporal but in the lords 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.320
 here I 'm struck by lightning, it shocks me 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.270
 a moment and I throw those grenades 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.399
 that do not go out on the street ready that's the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.070
 only way 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.230
 apart from those like knuckles that have 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.149
 to kill these stunt brakes gentlemen 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 then they know with the grenades or with 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.190
 the crickets can kill you solved 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.320
 electric the second trick is like 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.960
 teleport around the map of 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.950
 zombie transit and it's very easy 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.020
 we have to have the turbine equipped 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.640
 to put it in the moment we hear 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.310
 that is going to attack these little bugs 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
 flying these little bugs friends of 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.960
 forest because they are friends to me 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.270
 because they teleport along along 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.880
 all the map of the different public 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.490
 of messengers here comes I put the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.240
 turbine and he creates the portal where 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.520
 we are going to simply jump 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.979
 and we are going to go out in a different place 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.680
 of the map there is always going to be these 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.040
 headlights with green light where we can if it is 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.020
 that we do not want or do not like in the 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.420
 in the part of the map where they placed us 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.950
 when teleporting us simply because 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.979
 we can wait like I'm doing 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.659
 me until I come out again this 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.130
 little friend of the forest 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.770
 let's call him friend of the forest 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.490
 sustained and we put the turbine back 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.799
 and we are going to go to another place 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.250
 where is in this example I wanted to get 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.410
 at the last stop to the bar to finish 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.950
 to build in here metro him 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.709
 theft from the bus driver 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.360
 meter read and run over me as I said 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.120
 I want to get to the last stop at 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.640
 bar to finish building the law 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.920
 apply that I have in the part but not 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.150
 I could not do it all so I had a 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.080
 little of following passions of 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.060
 intendants of until in the last 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.120
 in the last attempt that is this that what 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.370
 they will see below 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:43.120
 again create the jump and jump portal 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.950
 and look except at the last stop I'm 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.200
 here perfectly it came to me very well 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.390
 then these two tricks of their lords 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.920
 I hope you have served them and I am sending you 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.549
 a big hug for all the gamers 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.810
 of the world 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.810
 until the next goodbye
