00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.599
 i 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.340
 hello the beginning of autumn is the time 

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:11.530
 ideal for renewing nutrients 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.750
 lost during the summer season that 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.099
 It was the time of greatest growth in 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.050
 way that our plants that are 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.360
 prepared for winter and arrive in 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.490
 good conditions to spring for 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.769
 This work is essential to avoid 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.330
 nitrogen fertilizers and privilege 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.330
 to those rich in phosphorus and potassium 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.550
 ideal for trees and shrubs is the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.949
 phosphate that will stimulate flowering in 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.479
 spring and fruit trees will avoid 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.479
 Late ripening of fruits 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.930
 well 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.189
 potassium for its part is responsible 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.750
 of cell multiplication what 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.490
 promotes the formation of tissue 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.110
 frost resistant 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.360
 this is essential for bushes 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.460
 sensitive as the teleras is a shrub 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.390
 tropical that resists temperatures by 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.390
 about 13 degrees 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.540
 omar soto writes to our site 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.340
 telling us that with spikes in the store 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.920
 he took him to his house and this one started 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.690
 throw away their green leaves omar the ficus 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.700
 suffering from a disorder known as the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.290
 syndrome of the new house and this has 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.330
 what to do with the adaptation of the individual 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.160
 of a new space the normal thing is that 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.260
 vote the sheets and then go back to 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.850
 generate new sheets if you want to help 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.420
 this process you can apply a bio 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.420
 stimulating 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.280
 or not 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.680
 in your garden you have acid plants and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.050
 comas ale as camelias hortencias and lives 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.910
 in the center-north of the country this is 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.070
 a good time to apply sulfate 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.270
 iron that prevents erika chlorosis 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.370
 which is when the leaves are put 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.860
 yellow if I have any doubt 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.840
 can visit at a point cl and make us 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.350
