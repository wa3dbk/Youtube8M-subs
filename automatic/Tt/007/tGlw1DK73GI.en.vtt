of the 5s but i have the 5s here you

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.039 
of the 5s but i have the 5s here you
know<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.490> right<00:01:29.640> here<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.880> my<00:01:30.180> table<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.899> i

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
know it's right here on my table and i

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.990 
know it's right here on my table and i
do<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.680> fingerprint<00:01:32.310> sensor<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> was

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
do like the fingerprint sensor I was

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.319 
do like the fingerprint sensor I was
kind<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.270> hoping<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:34.380> ipad<00:01:35.250> mini<00:01:35.280> would<00:01:36.149> come

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
kind of hoping the ipad mini would come

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.940 
kind of hoping the ipad mini would come
with<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.719> fingerprint<00:01:37.229> sensor<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.619> well<00:01:37.829> as

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
with the fingerprint sensor as well as

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.340 
with the fingerprint sensor as well as
the<00:01:38.070> air<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.670> did<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.270> I'm<00:01:40.020> guessing

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the air but it did not so I'm guessing

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.279 
the air but it did not so I'm guessing
that's<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.829> they'll<00:01:40.979> do<00:01:41.130> next<00:01:41.159> year<00:01:42.289> so

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
that's what they'll do next year so

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:50.149 
that's what they'll do next year so
pretty<00:01:44.070> simple<00:01:44.579> straightforward<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:49.350> I've

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
pretty simple straightforward and I've

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.499 
pretty simple straightforward and I've
already<00:01:50.340> taken<00:01:50.609> the<00:01:50.850> liberty<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.240> going

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
already taken the liberty of going

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.859 
already taken the liberty of going
through<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.109> setting<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:53.060> but<00:01:54.060> uh<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
through and setting it up but uh here it

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.120 
through and setting it up but uh here it
is<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.679> very<00:01:55.710> very<00:01:56.280> sharp<00:01:58.130> crystal

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
is and it's a very very sharp crystal

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.310 
is and it's a very very sharp crystal
clear<00:01:59.640> display<00:02:00.000> let<00:02:00.479> me<00:02:00.600> try<00:02:00.840> i<00:02:00.869> don't<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.229> if

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
clear display let me try i don't know if

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.169 
clear display let me try i don't know if
that<00:02:01.350> could<00:02:01.590> translate<00:02:02.070> due<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> fact

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
that could translate due to the fact

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.230 
that could translate due to the fact
that<00:02:03.329> my<00:02:03.539> camera<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.140> not<00:02:04.399> high<00:02:05.399> definition<00:02:06.060> I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
that my camera is not high definition I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.010 
that my camera is not high definition I
don't<00:02:07.049> want<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.530> my<00:02:07.679> password

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
don't want you to see my password

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.520 
don't want you to see my password
anyways<00:02:10.020> there<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:12.840> solid<00:02:13.380> I

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
anyways there you go and it's solid I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.350 
anyways there you go and it's solid I
could<00:02:13.950> say<00:02:14.100> it's<00:02:14.220> got<00:02:14.370> some<00:02:14.580> weight<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:15.090> I

very very close

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.710 
very very close

that's<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.570> pretty<00:03:26.870> much<00:03:27.140> straightforward<00:03:27.580> I

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
that's it pretty much straightforward I

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.490 
that's it pretty much straightforward I

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
noticed the difference in resolution

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
noticed the difference in resolution
from<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.630> regular<00:03:32.630> non<00:03:33.320> retina<00:03:33.710> mini<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.340> this

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
from the regular non retina mini to this

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.710 
from the regular non retina mini to this
one<00:03:34.730> but<00:03:35.050> I<00:03:36.050> can<00:03:36.200> definitely<00:03:36.350> say<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.720> old

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
one but I can definitely say the old

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.380 
one but I can definitely say the old
mini<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.950> non<00:03:40.100> retina<00:03:40.370> display<00:03:40.820> is<00:03:41.030> lighter

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
mini the non retina display is lighter

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.930 
mini the non retina display is lighter
is<00:03:42.040> definitely<00:03:43.040> lighter<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.400> was<00:03:43.520> holding<00:03:43.700> my

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
is definitely lighter I was holding my

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.330 
is definitely lighter I was holding my
girlfriends<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.600> you<00:03:45.410> know<00:03:45.590> side<00:03:45.920> by<00:03:46.100> side

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
girlfriends and you know side by side

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.070 
girlfriends and you know side by side
and<00:03:46.520> this<00:03:46.670> one<00:03:46.850> definitely<00:03:47.030> has<00:03:47.450> more<00:03:47.840> weight

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
and this one definitely has more weight

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.800 
and this one definitely has more weight
but<00:03:48.320> I<00:03:48.350> love<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.920> portability<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.510> form

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
but I love the portability and the form

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
but I love the portability and the form
factor<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:52.790> ipad<00:03:53.270> mini<00:03:53.300> so<00:03:54.200> that's<00:03:54.620> it
