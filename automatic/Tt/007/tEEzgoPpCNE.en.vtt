about to start mission 5 and just
finished<00:00:11.130> construction<00:00:12.530> so<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.490> 40

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120

so I can get it right I've filled with
volume<00:00:42.059> settings<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.480> bit<00:00:42.510> more<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:44.149> hopefully

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
volume settings a bit more and hopefully

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.450 
volume settings a bit more and hopefully
it'll<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.510> good<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.840> time<00:00:47.660> what<00:00:48.660> else<00:00:49.460> is

thanks to Starfire for suggesting that I
build<00:00:57.899> some<00:00:58.140> assault<00:00:58.469> frigates<00:00:58.859> which<00:00:59.520> allows

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
build some assault frigates which allows

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.080 
build some assault frigates which allows
me<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.420> build<00:01:00.870> something<00:01:01.199> besides

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090

suggested<00:01:12.740> interceptors<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:14.250> only

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
suggested interceptors at only

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.179 
suggested interceptors at only

on some assault frigates and nobody

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.130 
on some assault frigates and nobody
seemed<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.710> want<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.040> dissent<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:22.110> have

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
seemed to want to dissent so I now have

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.880 
seemed to want to dissent so I now have
a<00:01:22.320> lot<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.680> interceptors<00:01:24.710> hopefully<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
a lot of interceptors hopefully that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.710 
a lot of interceptors hopefully that
will<00:01:25.979> work<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.490> don't<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.330> doesn't

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
will work out I don't know if it doesn't

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.969 
will work out I don't know if it doesn't
I'll<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.650> start<00:01:29.549> over<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.060> try<00:01:31.020> again<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I'll just start over and try again and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.359 
I'll just start over and try again and
if<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> still<00:01:32.340> doesn't<00:01:32.369> work<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.880> will

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
if it still doesn't work I will

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.100 
if it still doesn't work I will
disregard<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.610> build<00:01:35.850> orders<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.390> build<00:01:36.900> my

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
disregard the build orders and build my

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.649 
disregard the build orders and build my
own<00:01:37.140> fleet<00:01:37.820> will<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:39.000> hopefully<00:01:39.509> it'll<00:01:39.869> work

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
own fleet will see hopefully it'll work

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.120 
own fleet will see hopefully it'll work
but<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:42.780> anyone<00:01:43.079> else<00:01:43.170> ever<00:01:43.409> has<00:01:43.530> any<00:01:43.950> other

let's<00:06:42.050> see<00:06:44.800> what<00:06:45.800> a<00:06:45.830> dust<00:06:46.220> clouds

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.510 

I<00:06:49.690> thought<00:06:50.200> is<00:06:50.350> a<00:06:50.380> nice<00:06:50.740> touch<00:06:52.890> blue<00:06:53.890> when

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
I thought is a nice touch blue when

Bombers<00:07:08.500> research<00:07:09.390> we<00:07:10.390> technically<00:07:10.780> already

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
Bombers research we technically already

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.180 
Bombers research we technically already
have<00:07:11.500> plasma<00:07:11.890> bomb<00:07:12.250> technology<00:07:13.320> it's<00:07:14.320> used<00:07:14.890> on

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.190 
have plasma bomb technology it's used on

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.610 
have plasma bomb technology it's used on
the<00:07:15.610> assault<00:07:15.910> frigates<00:07:17.400> these<00:07:18.690> two<00:07:19.690> guns<00:07:19.930> well

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
the assault frigates these two guns well

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.900 
the assault frigates these two guns well
looks<00:07:21.010> like<00:07:21.100> before<00:07:21.490> but<00:07:21.610> I<00:07:21.670> think<00:07:21.820> it's

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:21.910 
looks like before but I think it's

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.190 
looks like before but I think it's
actually<00:07:22.150> only<00:07:22.420> two<00:07:23.340> here<00:07:24.340> and<00:07:24.520> here<00:07:25.030> and<00:07:25.200> on

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.200 
actually only two here and here and on

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.050 
actually only two here and here and on
the<00:07:26.230> type<00:07:26.560> danny<00:07:27.040> is<00:07:27.190> so<00:07:27.760> forget<00:07:29.160> it's<00:07:30.160> here

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
the type danny is so forget it's here

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.270 
the type danny is so forget it's here
and<00:07:31.300> here<00:07:31.960> but<00:07:33.900> the<00:07:34.980> plasma<00:07:35.980> bomb<00:07:36.130> launcher

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280

research<00:07:36.790> gets<00:07:37.000> you<00:07:37.180> a<00:07:37.210> smaller<00:07:37.570> version<00:07:37.750> you

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990 
research gets you a smaller version you

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.060 
research gets you a smaller version you
can<00:07:38.080> put<00:07:38.290> on<00:07:38.380> a<00:07:38.410> fighter<00:07:40.500> which<00:07:41.500> is<00:07:41.860> a<00:07:41.920> good

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.070 
can put on a fighter which is a good

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.880 
can put on a fighter which is a good
thing<00:07:42.130> kiss<00:07:42.930> plasma<00:07:43.930> bombs<00:07:44.110> do<00:07:44.500> pretty<00:07:44.830> good

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:44.890 
thing kiss plasma bombs do pretty good

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.580 
thing kiss plasma bombs do pretty good
damage

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:49.590 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.290 

maybe<00:07:50.220> we'll<00:07:50.400> build<00:07:50.640> some<00:07:50.820> of<00:07:50.880> those

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:52.300 
maybe we'll build some of those

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.260 
maybe we'll build some of those
I<00:07:53.370> have<00:07:54.370> to<00:07:54.580> salvage<00:07:54.819> Corvettes<00:07:55.360> left<00:07:55.750> which
