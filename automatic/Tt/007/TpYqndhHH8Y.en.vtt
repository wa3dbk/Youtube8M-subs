00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.199
 so let's start for example hard 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:26.230
 so it's not so foolish so 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.929
 we will need 25 g butter 1 100 g 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.640
 of sugar 25 gr of flour and 50 g of 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:35.350
 chocolate and then work once 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.820
 you have all the ingredients he's going 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.350
 preheat your oven to 200 Â° 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.300
 then you'll put the chocolate and 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.980
 the butter in a dish that goes to the microphone 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.980
 waves to be able to melt 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.860
 we 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.860
 so 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.480
 so once he's out I mix 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.300
 a bit to have a substance well 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.070
 smooth to be able to incorporate it after 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:14.060
 so in a salad bowl I'm going to mix 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:17.860
 the egg with the sugar and the flour and 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.860
 after I will come mix all that 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.929
 so once I kept getting a 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.850
 well smooth paste julien still trimmed the 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.729
 chocolate and the melted butter that I had 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.210
 better micro right before and I'm coming 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.210
 still mixed 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.170
 and here is the preparation is already 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.150
 completed so we'll start with 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.530
 butter the silicone mold of 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.540
 preference it will be much simpler 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.540
 for mussels and after 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.709
 using a spoon or whatever 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.810
 you want to come and fill in the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.379
 molds three-quarters with 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.379
 repair 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.610
 2 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.560
 once you have filled in the three 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.450
 quarters or come put two squares of 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.250
 chocolate inside that's what's going 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.250
 give the flowing founan 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.520
 of course we end up covering the 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.970
 piece of chocolate by still a small 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.970
 little paste 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.299
 not to bring that we just put the 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.489
 fondant baked a careful 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:41.319
 do not burn yourself and we will 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.319
 bake for about 10 minutes 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.660
 so once the finances are cuiv 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.340
 take them out katmandu delhi dufour without 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.960
 you burn and you let them rest 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.120
 until they cool down a 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.120
 little bit that's the result 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:20.139
 for this sake I was trying to take some 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.190
 fruits that everything can have at home 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:40.389
 you will need an apple and 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:42.250
 of an orange is also a kiwi so well 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.470
 sure to start the smoothie it takes 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.440
 first peeled all the cops and the 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.090
 cut into pieces like that the blender 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.090
 dear friends his work 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.110
 and 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.640
 once all the fruits have been 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.130
 cut and peeled I mean the 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.060
 put in the blender and after and well 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.060
 I come blend and 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.190
 falls once you're done you 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.660
 can add a fair bit and which me 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.980
 I added orange juice even you 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.100
 can also add apple juice 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:54.460
 to make it a bit more liquid and 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.920
 after I'm going to organize so jelly 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.170
 put in a big glass but could 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.790
 put otherwise jazz medicines and also 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.680
 I just add a straw because I 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.930
 find it much simpler for the 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.450
 drink and that's it over I hope that 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.740
