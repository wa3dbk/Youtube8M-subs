00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.080
 Hello Mr. Pink Panther and I have one 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:08.420
 a training video made what shows where 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.030
 we're going to give you a shot training 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.990
 the skills in it are fast 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.750
 aim for fast and ninja aim it 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.480
 is about a 1 firearm whether 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.730
 Secondary or main weapon if the enemy 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.740
 you look at him immediately and look 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.949
 shoot it's not about meeting 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.090
 but about the reaction speed 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.530
 in the second part 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.749
 then you take the secondary weapon in the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.269
 third part then run with the 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:40.760
 main watch and when you see the enemy 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.120
 around the corner jumps or freer 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.479
 lie down before the shot and lie down 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.659
 while lying down or during the 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:53.839
 Jump aiming at the enemy search 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.530
 and close then we come to 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.929
 fourth part then with the main watch 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.199
 Three wrote that means three times completely 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.509
 click on the mouse in quick succession 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.280
 so you give three shots that 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.829
 Afterwards, for example, if we are with 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.469
 the ump then plays with it 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:15.140
 more accurate since the weapons warp 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:18.140
 not so much of course now 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.890
 also made with the secondary weapon and 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 now comes 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.229
 the next one has the next phase 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.770
 we aim at a trick 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.420
 if you with the mouse to the opponent 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.720
 you are inaccurate 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.570
 but if you are with aa and after 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.530
 adjusted you are much more accurate that 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.900
 just see a tip now 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.690
 not by the grass that is for the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.160
 opponent audible that means he can you 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.860
 Accurately locate by the acoustics and 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.660
 Of course that is not so good when he is 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.210
 For example, the enemy is coming from 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.610
 left you have heard as advised 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.240
 just a corner you can not him 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.429
 to meet 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.369
 we go a little further still 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.700
 still difficult and now I have the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.690
 speed of the opponent and mine 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.090
 reaction rate involved 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.209
 and accordingly further away from the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.640
 corner and that's how it works 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.269
 Now we come to the topic in cover 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.100
 always try to stay in one if you stay 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.870
 the other direction is aimed and the opponent 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.570
 but could come from the right now 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.690
 he does not see me easily because of this 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.760
 post has covered me yes has a look 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.459
 a little bit about what can I do 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.540
 so that the enemy does not see me immediately 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.930
 just as he came to see because 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.750
 I follow the post 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.359
 on the other hand, I always try this one 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.930
 a bit the paths of my opponents 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.269
 to keep an eye on 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.879
 always try a little bit 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:02.000
 targeted opponents to look for and if 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.230
 it is you who tells your people where he is 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.750
 was shot down 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.510
 so that then react immediately 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.379
 could he have done that, I would have been 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.620
 been dead 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:15.379
 now comes the study that believes 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.439
 in itself I know the opponent wants into 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.989
 plane so indicated 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.250
 shot down that's it you have to 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.159
 always a bit as an example 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.139
 take which runway you take and from 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.980
 So you know where the enemy is 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:33.980
 In that case, it could also be long-running 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.400
 It is also a matter of sighting from the surfaces 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.349
 very important always tries in the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.689
 direction of the opponent to look and then 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.579
 does that work too i'm not pro 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.799
 but i hope i can give you a few 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.019
 give tips if you have liked the 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.729
 write in the comments that you 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.709
 you may want to see more of them 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:55.299
 I thank you for watching and 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.299
 say bye your pink panther
