00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.950
 Hi there, it's Masha, soon Halloween and 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.830
 today show you how to become not a witch 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.720
 not a vampire but how to become johnny depot for 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.910
 start apply your favorite tonal 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.270
 cream and evenly distribute it 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.280
 wipe off all makeup and add concealer 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.350
 on the places that we will paint 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.350
 most of all and it's almost the whole face 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.980
 after that select browser and hard 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.500
 blush brush 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.500
 attention of the whole brush I pointed out under the video 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.929
 and so we draw a school and if you don't have 

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:14.210
 your cheekbones like me then fold your lips 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:16.759
 tube to at least see where 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.969
 they should be and we draw a line from 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.299
 ear to the chin and do not shade and and 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.859
 continue to take light concealer and 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.599
 draw the jaw for we have it 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:31.359
 a little bit brighter and so 

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:31.359
 the lower part of the face begins to appear wider 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.210
 I need to create a rough man 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.430
 chin so i flash it to 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.860
 he stood out and I did it 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.840
 straight lines and again nothing 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.670
 I shade that chin was 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.829
 square plus as we want 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.200
 add masculinity something a little 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.100
 tighten the bottom of the chin make 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.100
 such a dimple 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.750
 now the hardest for me lips 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.460
 will have to work very hard to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.189
 shade them i use concealer 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.530
 neatly sketching lips and on top with 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.119
 powdery dark powder or browser 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.119
 make it look natural 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.110
 now we draw new lips and i 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.990
 I use my favorite pencil from 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.450
 chanel that will soon end yes y 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.090
 johnny's plump lower lip and me this 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.110
 really like it and not only because of her 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.840
 easy to draw 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.850
 but not over the lip will be much 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.300
 more problems so i draw her 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.300
 tassel 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.340
 I think I got too 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.230
 big upper lip 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.359
 if you're not sure of something either 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.250
 take a small brush and a little 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.400
 correct and and this is nothing 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.290
 scary when draw cubes join 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.790
 notice that he has a little 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.310
 lowered corners of lips 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.310
 so he very often looks sad 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.210
 for this image I need a nose clearly 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.140
 bigger and longer so i'm drawing 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.370
 lift up 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.950
 it's weird but it is really 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.980
 works ie the nose is lengthened and 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.050
 visually looks bigger 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.150
 so we begin to draw the nose the main thing is that 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.220
 wanna say be very attentive and 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.100
 review many photos to 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:29.710
 understand what you are doing the upper part 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.290
 nose bridge johnny much worse than 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.900
 lower so we add shadows to the top 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:40.870
 next we draw the nostrils like this 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.870
 way and light corrector we 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.510
 select the tip of the nose and the upper part 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.230
 nostrils don't know what to call it top 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.230
 part of the nostrils 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.530
 most likely if you will be diligent 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.810
 compete then we succeed 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.390
 unnatural me here turned out very 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.700
 dumb nose so i take a fluffy 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.650
 Mr. Brush and shade all borders 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.440
 also draw here such bands 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.940
 that go from the corners of the eyes and along 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.820
 nose and be sure to darken the lower eyelid 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.130
 a bit of course but no 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.190
 johnny depp by the way I added a little 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.800
 dark shadows in the corners of the eyes to the eyes 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.530
 were more burning so if you 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.570
 round such simple eyes too 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.820
 add some dark shadows to the corners 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.430
 You can also add it to the outside and all 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.860
 now we are beveled with small brush 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.960
 strokes start drawing eyebrows be 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.720
 very neat and don't overdo it better 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.750
 then draw the gel for 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.840
 eyebrows and comb all the eyebrows down to 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.460
 that eyebrows were lower and on the contrary 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.460
 cover all concealer 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.580
 so we make forehead bigger 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.580
 and lower eyebrows 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.860
 my favorite part is take the same 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.439
 blend brush and dark shadows 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.240
 for example black brown and start 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.240
 draw facial hair 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.699
 draw very neatly but at the same time 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:54.469
 somewhere press by force and 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.279
 but somewhere weaker so that everything looked 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.279
 naturally 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:07.259
 also decided to draw a little fold 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.229
 century and draw a forehead like that of joe not 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.849
 If you have long hair make sure you 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.339
 hide them under your hat 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:21.389
 otherwise you will look very strange 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:22.349
 and just like that you hat 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.539
 need i say 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.759
 put like if you like and 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.529
