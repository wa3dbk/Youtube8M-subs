but<00:01:32.000> its<00:01:32.180> heavier<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:33.159> it'll<00:01:34.159> be<00:01:34.280> more<00:01:34.549> for

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
but its heavier and it'll be more for

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.670 
but its heavier and it'll be more for
this<00:01:35.450> time<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.720> year<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.200> wintertime

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
this time of year the wintertime

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.210 
this time of year the wintertime
conditions<00:01:37.369> and<00:01:38.560> it's<00:01:39.560> only<00:01:39.740> about<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:40.009> pound

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
conditions and it's only about a pound

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.160 
conditions and it's only about a pound
heavier<00:01:40.549> than<00:01:40.909> this<00:01:41.060> lightweight<00:01:41.329> one<00:01:41.810> so<00:01:42.049> if

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
heavier than this lightweight one so if

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.149 
heavier than this lightweight one so if
not<00:01:42.320> bad<00:01:43.090> also<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.270> kelty<00:01:45.259> gunnison<00:01:45.799> 3.1<00:01:46.960> tent

not bad also the kelty gunnison 3.1 tent

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.109 
not bad also the kelty gunnison 3.1 tent
excited<00:01:49.159> about<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.610> I've<00:01:49.790> heard<00:01:49.909> really

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
excited about that I've heard really

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.760 
excited about that I've heard really
good<00:01:50.390> things<00:01:50.450> about<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.500> went<00:01:51.710> ahead

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
good things about it and I went ahead

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.490 
good things about it and I went ahead
and<00:01:51.890> picked<00:01:51.979> up<00:01:52.189> a<00:01:52.340> footprint<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.570> go<00:01:54.110> under<00:01:54.409> it

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
and picked up a footprint to go under it

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.340 
and picked up a footprint to go under it
instead<00:01:54.740> of<00:01:54.799> just<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.670> know<00:01:55.880> getting<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:56.990> tarp

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
instead of just you know getting a tarp

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.440 
instead of just you know getting a tarp
I<00:01:57.619> decided<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.219> go<00:01:58.460> ahead<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:58.820> get<00:01:58.969> one<00:01:59.240> that

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
I decided to go ahead and get one that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.840 
I decided to go ahead and get one that
matched<00:01:59.689> the<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.799> footprint<00:02:01.430> of<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.549> tent

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
matched the the footprint of the tent

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.139 
matched the the footprint of the tent
exactly<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:03.710> those<00:02:04.100> are<00:02:04.130> some<00:02:04.310> camping<00:02:04.880> items

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
exactly so those are some camping items

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.789 
exactly so those are some camping items
