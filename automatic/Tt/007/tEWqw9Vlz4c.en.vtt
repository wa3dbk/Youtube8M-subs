00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.140
 for days gamers and subscribers of 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.139
 youtube you know we 've been 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.490
 playing a lot and more 5 and a lot of you 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.469
 they realize that gabriel and I have 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.209
 a different configuration in this 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.070
 video I want to tell you about the 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.020
 configuration that I use in truth this 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.300
 You can do it from outside but from 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.340
 inside gives you more options and basically 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.840
 is what you want to teach from outside 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.730
 you will not see you will not be able to see the 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.789
 pop that from the control like who says 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.920
 so I'm going to go here to pau you will see 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.920
 I'm going to give you here in controls I have 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.079
 this selected auto sprint i what 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.480
 I have because I like to press the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.149
 button to run ok 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.920
 that's that and in hop this is where you 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.260
 will control this control that you 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.239
 you have here you can realize that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.489
 here you can change how opaque I go 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.770
 to raise the opacity but I always 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.290
 I have zero but I'm going to upload 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.840
 so that you here understand 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.239
 basically this one to shoot is more 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.770
 small and I do not have bigger for 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.210
 you know he is not playing and one 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.520
 wants to give it to wherever 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.159
 and I shoot here I have the knife that 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.990
 I almost do not use it I never get the pumps 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.490
 here I have it basically configured 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.810
 as I did not have the modern combat 4 you 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.400
 You can put any vote if you 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.530
 he wants we can see you put it more 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.810
 by bigger bigger smaller but 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.909
 and I 'm going to leave you here so you never 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.130
 fail me I know I do not use it depends on that 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.070
 you use this is the spring one of 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.570
 here below this I use it to run 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.119
 I like to press the track now I have 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.060
 a little bit down instead of using it 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.810
 I said to be opacity and they already killed me not 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.910
 I have this one this one comes like this but I 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.190
 Sometimes I get very confused if I use it that way 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.590
 because I do not use much to move myself 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.660
 I move touching the screen so it's 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.399
 I move to crouch almost not what 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.530
 use I also do not have there but 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.710
 basically this is the configuration that 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.289
 I use I will show again how it is 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.940
 that works well there is very clear 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.030
 I'm going to visit 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.730
 because I do not like it so clear that save 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.160
 I have dark time resume 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.870
 although they can already see the game of 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.430
 that way I'm finding here 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:15.280
 because I wanted to show you something else I did not 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.280
 agreement that was a joke 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.720

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.760
