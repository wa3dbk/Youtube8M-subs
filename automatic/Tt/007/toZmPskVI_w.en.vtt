00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.300
 hello people here is working again 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.870
 and today I want to show you how 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.639
 you make an application with yes 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.379
 You can really do an application 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.660
 make many things more beautiful 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.760
 or just get up and that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.189
 special is that it is so easy 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.260
 to do something because there are so many 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.590
 driver combinations and shapes and what knows 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.090
 i dont know what but enough i show now 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.380
 you first the couple in things you 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.489
 So it takes some time 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.129
 fabric of your choice 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.230
 it really does not matter that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.340
 what you like the amount of fabric depends 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.489
 then only together with the big one 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 should be application then once fli 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.809
 so fix fli so fix has the special 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 property that if one is lying 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.340
 Silent hand picks up and the shiny one 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.800
 side on a piece of fabric iron that 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.399
 the game so fix his stickiness 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.750
 I transfer to the fabric, so to speak 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.760
 I hope I could do it reasonably well 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.640
 explain otherwise write a question 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.680
 just in the comments 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.030
 so then we need it again 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.369
 an application before 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.650
 we have now for a warm welcome 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.170
 decided the classic so to speak 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.979
 we also printed it out 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.439
 but no need 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.450
 So if you can draw well you can 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.729
 Just do something yourself 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.479
 then another fabric for one 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:33.219
 Paper scissors a pen and pins 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.200
 and last but not least the iron yes 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.539
 then we start right now 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.429
 First you carry with you 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.069
 pencil on the shiny side of iso 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.479
 fix your application form for us 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:50.649
 they want to leave afterwards 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:54.299
 also iron on it somewhere 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.299
 cutters whole of course 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.670
 and then cuts again roughly 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:16.060
 Match the fabric to your application 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:18.280
 size and once you're done with it 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.010
 do you like the shiny side on yours? 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.630
 so really here so long 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.320
 iron until the edges are right on the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.320
 glue fabric 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.990
 now you can apply the fabric to yours 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.990
 shape trim 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.959
 then you see it fell off so fast and 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.190
 ironing it has a bag or t shirt 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.190
 or whatever you want 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.870
 all the more durable now 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.670
 we have the video in the video here 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.330
 still need an application 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.650
 stich or saturn is so easy 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.750
 so when washing virtually not again 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.700
 going 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.690
 and then that is you can also 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.690
 already finished 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.750
 As you can see, the whole thing is totally easy 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.310
 and also makes a lot of what I think 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.060
 fun 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.560
 Maybe you can do that too 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.140
 to make your children or have them 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.030
 It's also fun to do otherwise 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.220
 I hope I can help you with that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.680
 could help a little further and one 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.660
 if you could ask , could make you happy 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.730
 or groundwater simply into the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.040
 comments so I'll get them then 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.690
 answer 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.829
 otherwise I wish you much much 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.829
 more pleasure and see you next video 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.829
 in order to
