00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.110
 fish 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:17.900
 like riuki our heading storm mystic 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.909
 due to large body size content in 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.529
 aquarium 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:24.349
 problematic then there is something at least on 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.439
 two fish will need 100 liters also 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.380
 must be done regularly once a week 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.620
 water change 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.739
 good aeration and good filtration 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:39.320
 feed plan is not a fastidious model 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.929
 big extra me even earthworms 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.359
 You can give and day porridge dressing but 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:46.339
 very inhospitable jurassic was like the most 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.620
 the main thing is not to overfeed them all 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.879
 species of fish goldfish most important 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.789
 do not overfeed they suffer 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:56.089
 distillery. thrown let's say dry 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.789
 feed if 3-4 minutes have passed remember not 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.350
 stayed you overfed mean those fish 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.270
 Canada will give next time 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.129
 smaller aquarium decoration 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.740
 he must be some tick 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.180
 rolled that is not necessary with sharp edges 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.330
 because goldfish are all 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.850
 goldfish species 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.650
 a long time ago how can you say then 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.390
 vacuum if some are sharp 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.170
 stones are like you want you can 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.110
 just get stuck in your mouth 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.330
 when choosing plants 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.300
 living need to choose hard forest 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.729
 from a good root system as they 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.530
 love to eat live plants if they 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.950

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.310
 what kinds of harder such fishing line will be in 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.229
 principle is quite normal in terms of parameters 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:53.149
 water is a cold fish from 15 to 25 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.630
 degrees celsius water hardness 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.630
 about 20 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.220
 Relkin fish due to its size 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.140
 more suitable for labor retention or 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.570
 there in the orange bieber offensive pools 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.460
 and although in aquarium conditions Vilkin 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.710
 rarely reaches its maximum 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.780
 size they are still as they grow 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.610
 fairly quickly begin to experience 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.550
 the lack of space is so interesting 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.810
 gold fish 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.120
 most people call them 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.080
 gold that they are planted still round 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.630
 aquarium 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.600
 many many where to show it planted 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.070
 10 liters round gold aquarium 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.900

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.520
 Lyubka suffers there it can even 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.650
 mockery of fish because on 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.230
 one fish recommended at least 50 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.190
 liters of it given her even 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.170
 cramped ideas will be that is if in 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.650
