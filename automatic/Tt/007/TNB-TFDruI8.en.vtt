00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
in this game enemies are a lot different

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.140 
in this game enemies are a lot different
like<00:00:17.550> humans<00:00:18.000> take<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.420> guy<00:00:18.600> for<00:00:18.750> example

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
like humans take this guy for example

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.120 
like humans take this guy for example
he's<00:00:21.150> doesn't<00:00:22.080> look<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.470> he<00:00:22.560> has<00:00:22.680> much<00:00:22.830> armor

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
he's doesn't look like he has much armor

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.950 
he's doesn't look like he has much armor
on<00:00:23.250> him<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:23.550> he<00:00:23.760> has<00:00:23.910> armor<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.630> that's<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
on him but he has armor that that's a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.500 
on him but he has armor that that's a
new<00:00:25.109> quality<00:00:25.529> though<00:00:26.119> enemies<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.449> this

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
new quality though enemies have in this

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.109 
new quality though enemies have in this
game<00:00:27.689> their<00:00:27.869> armor<00:00:28.109> actually<00:00:28.410> counts<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.730> if

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
game their armor actually counts so if

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
game their armor actually counts so if
you're<00:00:30.210> shooting<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.660> enemy<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.859> shield

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
you're shooting in enemy this on shield

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.130 
you're shooting in enemy this on shield
symbol<00:00:32.910> will<00:00:33.030> appear<00:00:33.120> near<00:00:33.600> their<00:00:33.719> health<00:00:33.930> bar

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
symbol will appear near their health bar

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.049 
symbol will appear near their health bar
if<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.010> appears<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.460> means<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.910> their

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
if that appears it means that their

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.959 
if that appears it means that their
armor<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.510> being<00:00:36.750> damaged<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.790> they<00:00:38.790> have

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
armor is being damaged or they have

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.250 
armor is being damaged or they have
armor<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.540> it's<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> make<00:00:39.960> them<00:00:40.079> really

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
armor and it's going to make them really

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.889 
armor and it's going to make them really
hard<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.680> kill<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.129> haven't<00:00:42.090> forgot<00:00:42.360> anyway<00:00:42.570> um

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
hard to kill I haven't forgot anyway um

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.750 
hard to kill I haven't forgot anyway um
I<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.500> just<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.920> shoot<00:00:44.730> them

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
I think you just have to shoot them

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.490 
I think you just have to shoot them
until<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.239> breaks<00:00:45.450> or<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:46.140> that's<00:00:46.350> how<00:00:46.440> you

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
until it breaks or just that's how you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.799 
until it breaks or just that's how you
have<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.739> kill<00:00:46.969> but<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.030> figure<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.450> any<00:00:48.600> ways

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
have to kill but I figure out any ways

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.500 
have to kill but I figure out any ways
around<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.590> sure<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:49.860> are

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
around that I'm pretty sure there are

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.240 
around that I'm pretty sure there are
that's<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.719> new<00:00:51.870> thing<00:00:52.050> another<00:00:53.039> new<00:00:53.190> thing

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that's one new thing another new thing

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.729 
that's one new thing another new thing
that<00:00:53.489> um<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.480> will<00:00:54.660> hide<00:00:54.899> some<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that um they will hide some of the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.830 
that um they will hide some of the
enemies<00:00:55.980> will<00:00:56.160> run<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.520> cover<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.329> annual

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
enemies will run for cover or on annual

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.569 
enemies will run for cover or on annual
stimpacks<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.590> their<00:00:59.280> health<00:00:59.460> will

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
stimpacks and their health will

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.830 
stimpacks and their health will
regenerate<00:00:59.850> over<00:01:00.149> time<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.510> you're<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.750> to
