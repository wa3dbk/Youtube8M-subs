00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.960

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.910
 what we need are cocochas as a 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:25.480
 quarter of a kilo per person half onion 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:29.300
 2 large garlic cloves 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:33.120
 abundant parsley a little olive oil 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.940
 olive and a glass of white wine 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.449
 we have peeled the garlic and now the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.190
 onion with a grater 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.180
 we have also peeled it and grated it 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.180
 in the same swimsuit 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.660
 we pricked abundant parsley very minced 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.430
 in a weak fire we put a casserole 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.790
 of clay that holds the heat of fire 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.970
 and we cover the bottom of the pan with 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.790
 olive oil and we let it go 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.130
 warming up 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.070
 when the oil is hot we add 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.550
 the onion and garlic minced and stir 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.550
 all right 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.600
 and we also add the parsley that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.600
 we also have very minced 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.580
 and let it go by until 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.320
 the onion take a transparent color 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.020
 when the onion is already poached 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.460
 has that color a little bit transparent 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.460
 we throw our wine glass 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.440
 and a little water 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.440
 and we wait for it to break to boil 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.720
 When the sauce begins to boil 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.220
 we let it boil for 5 minutes and 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.220
 that starts to reduce a bit 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.560
 and now that our sauce has already reduced 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.530
 a little bit we add the cocochas of 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.110
 the cod are putting the cover 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.110
 well the sauce caldito 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.740
 look at cod cookers is very 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.840
 gelatinous and when it starts to boil 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.270
 release a caldo that will thicken us 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.970
 a lot of sauce so what we have 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.390
 What to do is let it boil on fire 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.400
 Slow for 5 minutes moving from time to time 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.790
 in when our casserole so that it does not 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.790
 hit and as I say in 5 minutes 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.340
 this dish will be ready 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.159
 good kitchens have already passed the 5 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.489
 cooking minutes and these things already 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.799
 they are made to look at the salsita how it has 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.560
 caught a little body by the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:58.310
 salsita that releases the cod itself 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.310
 that we have finished nothing good
