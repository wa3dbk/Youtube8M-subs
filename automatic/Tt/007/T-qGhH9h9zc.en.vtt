00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.320
 hello everyone how are you I'm erika I 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.840
 I want to share a video that are 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.610
 golden barbecue taquitos I've 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.980
 had a little forgotten because I've 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.010
 had a little work but now 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.840
 we started 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.050
 here are the ingredients are very 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.780
 simple here I have beef barbecue that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.150
 I no longer over there are plenty of 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.730
 specific I bought about 25 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.380
 pesos 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.670
 and this does not depend on all 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.640
 tacos that are going to make you 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.120
 we also have what is the sauce that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.320
 is what they give when they buy barbecue 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 Necessary oil sauce to accompany 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.280
 tortillas that the tortillas are reached 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.820
 to see to see if I remove a little light 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.890
 is in this still warm 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.110
 that's how we have them here peak of 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.690
 cock that is how we are going to accompany what 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.869
 first thing we're going to do is in a 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.869
 pan let's put enough oil 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.060
 oil to start browning the tacos in 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.170
 what is the oil we are going to do 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.450
 tacos here what we are going to do 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.570
 is to start making the sacks 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.600
 we 're going to start doing that here 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.110
 the barbecue and the position we are going to 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.479
 put a muddy of the same sauce 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.189
 who give them where they sell the barbecue and 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.909
 we try to put the most in between 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.100
 can the meat because afterwards I do not know to 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.580
 what is owed but it jumps a lot and 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:51.590
 let's start making the flutes 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:54.190
 so to do the amount of tacos that 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.190
 you like 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.490
 and wait while in what is the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.070
 oil here I finished the flutes now 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.230
 then we will see that the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.920
 oil I put it more or less in this 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.440
 address 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.540
 and if it already reaches the heat is that already 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.959
 is 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.890
 then let's put the flutes to 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.290
 gild 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.560
 and when they are already removed and the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.459
 we put on an absorbent paper here 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.069
 and those who use the oil we leave 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.460
 that are donated by each side more or less 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.800
 some 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.010
 that will be three to five minutes to 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.010
 to take a golden color here is already 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.290
 they are not red and I am leaving them 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.900
 that slip away I have other years in the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.800
 look at the difference of those that already 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.790
 they are golden to those that are raw 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.110
 So now what we have left is 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.200
 plating 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.020
 here they are already finished the tacos nothing 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.840
 more on top we add what is the 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.870
 pico de gallo and you like with the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.430
 same sauce that they were given to take advantage of 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.790
 or they can also use sauces that 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.790
 Do you sell 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.099
 to put him then this is all 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.280

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.150
