there really glitches a big glitch which

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.550 
there really glitches a big glitch which
which<00:07:30.100> is<00:07:30.250> cool<00:07:30.460> because<00:07:30.580> then<00:07:30.760> we<00:07:30.880> know<00:07:31.540> -<00:07:31.600> we

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 
which is cool because then we know - we

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.409 
which is cool because then we know - we
can<00:07:32.680> clean<00:07:32.919> that<00:07:33.040> out<00:07:33.190> there's<00:07:34.120> various<00:07:34.390> ways

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:34.419 
can clean that out there's various ways

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.390 
can clean that out there's various ways
we<00:07:34.690> can<00:07:34.840> do<00:07:34.960> that<00:07:35.110> so<00:07:35.830> it<00:07:35.890> just<00:07:36.100> means<00:07:36.220> that

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 
we can do that so it just means that

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.100 
we can do that so it just means that
some<00:07:36.730> air<00:07:36.970> of<00:07:37.120> the<00:07:37.210> quadrant<00:07:37.630> of<00:07:37.750> your<00:07:37.780> of<00:07:38.080> your
