pretty much wipe out your opponent with
her<00:02:10.289> own<00:02:10.410> effect<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.879> said<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.360> my

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
her own effect and like I said in my

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.820 
her own effect and like I said in my
past<00:02:12.840> video<00:02:13.170> pedic

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
past video pedic

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.410 
past video pedic
really<00:02:14.190> helps<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.580> get<00:02:14.760> around<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.180> field

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
really helps to get around the field

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.420 
really helps to get around the field
faster<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.440> these<00:02:16.560> are<00:02:16.710> two<00:02:16.740> cards<00:02:17.190> really

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
faster so these are two cards really

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.310 
faster so these are two cards really
going<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.670> want<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.880> watch<00:02:18.030> out<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.320> basically

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
going to want to watch out for basically

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.340 
going to want to watch out for basically
because<00:02:19.460> Freese<00:02:20.460> makes<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.940> deck<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.390> cam<00:02:22.020> is

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
because Freese makes the deck and cam is

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.280 
because Freese makes the deck and cam is
the<00:02:22.710> draw<00:02:22.980> power<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.460> the<00:02:23.580> deck<00:02:24.170> she<00:02:25.170> was<00:02:25.260> a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the draw power of the deck she was a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.170 
the draw power of the deck she was a
very<00:02:25.500> viable<00:02:25.860> card<00:02:26.310> when<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.670> deck<00:02:26.940> first

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
very viable card when the deck first

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.880 
very viable card when the deck first
came<00:02:27.420> out<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.900> think<00:02:28.350> she's<00:02:28.560> going<00:02:28.740> to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
came out and I think she's going to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.550 
came out and I think she's going to
still<00:02:29.490> be<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:30.030> very<00:02:30.540> important<00:02:31.050> part<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
still be a very important part of the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.790 
still be a very important part of the
deck<00:02:31.770> pretty<00:02:32.520> much<00:02:32.700> shuffle<00:02:33.090> two<00:02:33.210> cards<00:02:33.540> back

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
price a little while ago I think she was

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.250 
price a little while ago I think she was
originally<00:03:41.730> around<00:03:42.030> ten<00:03:42.420> dollars<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.110> now<00:03:43.230> I

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
originally around ten dollars and now I

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.860 
originally around ten dollars and now I
think<00:03:43.590> she's<00:03:43.769> at<00:03:43.950> least<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.489> 20s<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.120> I

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
think she's at least in the 20s and I

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.479 
think she's at least in the 20s and I
think<00:03:46.080> she's<00:03:46.230> gonna<00:03:46.380> stick<00:03:46.739> there<00:03:46.980> for<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> good

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.690 
think she's gonna stick there for a good
while<00:03:47.780> if<00:03:48.780> not<00:03:49.260> go<00:03:49.320> up<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.680> little<00:03:49.769> more<00:03:50.070> because

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
the return of the duelist set the pack

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.800 
the return of the duelist set the pack
that<00:03:52.260> she<00:03:52.440> came<00:03:52.590> out<00:03:52.800> of<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:54.030> no<00:03:54.209> longer<00:03:54.510> in

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.850 
cards and maybe just think of new
different<00:05:18.840> plays<00:05:19.080> they<00:05:19.290> can<00:05:19.470> do<00:05:19.590> with<00:05:19.710> the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
different plays they can do with the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.590 
different plays they can do with the
deck<00:05:20.070> so<00:05:20.520> definitely<00:05:20.820> recommend<00:05:21.210> picking<00:05:21.330> up

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
deck so definitely recommend picking up

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.330 
deck so definitely recommend picking up
a<00:05:21.660> couple<00:05:21.870> glad<00:05:22.110> beasts<00:05:22.470> as<00:05:22.560> well<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:23.010> know

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
a couple glad beasts as well I know

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.060 
a couple glad beasts as well I know
there<00:05:23.580> are<00:05:23.670> a<00:05:23.700> bunch<00:05:23.880> of<00:05:23.970> other<00:05:24.680> deck<00:05:25.680> support

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
there are a bunch of other deck support

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.890 
there are a bunch of other deck support
in<00:05:26.250> primal<00:05:26.790> origins<00:05:27.180> for<00:05:27.390> a<00:05:27.450> bunch<00:05:27.630> of<00:05:27.750> old

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
in primal origins for a bunch of old

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.020 
in primal origins for a bunch of old
debts<00:05:28.110> as<00:05:28.320> well<00:05:28.530> but<00:05:29.070> I<00:05:29.130> feel<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.460> these<00:05:29.730> four

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
debts as well but I feel that these four

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.020 
debts as well but I feel that these four
decks<00:05:30.300> are<00:05:30.540> the<00:05:30.750> major<00:05:30.930> ones<00:05:31.260> of<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:32.250> topic<00:05:32.640> so

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
decks are the major ones of the topic so

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.520 
decks are the major ones of the topic so
