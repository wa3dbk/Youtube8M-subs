00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:08.620
 in some so many there at home then here 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.900
 we are going to present you some small 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.570
 decorations for a salad that 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.610
 you can plant in house we are going to 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.580
 show our ingredients here already 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.160
 we have a pre-prepared salad already 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.050
 with some assembly as lettuce and a 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.940
 half cucumber moons and 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.670
 decorations that we are going to make the day of 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.430
 today they are going to do with a purple onion 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.370
 with some cherry tomatoes we are going to take 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.820
 I'm going to teach you a molt knife 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.030
 step by step how are we going to do the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.460
 figure is a very simple figure is a 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.560
 figure of is of a flower on a 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.110
 purple onion we can also do it 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.050
 on of a white onion 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.110
 we are inserting 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.110
 in the form of triangles if you can see it 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.530
 to give it shape and we are going to put the 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.859
 finger to the middle of our knife 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:06.130
 editor to be the top as 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:09.520
 can see what is going to be immersed in 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.220
 the part with which we are going to cut in 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.530
 this case is a straight mondadori knife 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.490
 it can be any other knife 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.979
 other dimensions 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.610
 we're giving everything around we're going 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.240
 going on the same line 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.110
 and the idea is to find us on the other side 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.900
 with what we started 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.140
 we can give it more height 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.760
 or we can make them shorter 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.160
 depending on the creativity of there 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.010
 that we have as you can see here already 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.100
 we arrive we make our last cut 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.299
 to find each other 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.299
 with the other side 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.460
 we separate it here we already have our 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.010
 figure 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.409
 from the part of the onion that does not have 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.409
 Union 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.780
 because here we have the other side is already 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.429
 we will not be able to modify this what 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.079
 we can put on some salad or 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.450
 some dish that we want 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.280
 give you more view and more presence can 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.250
 to be on a white rice a rice 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.410
 yellow and with the other part that we can 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.019
 handle or manipulate let's do what 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.019
 next we are going to separate the layers 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.700
 and we are going to rearrange them to give you another 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.700
 dimension to our flower 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.989
 here we have three layers, we go through the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.500
 fourth and we are interspersing the 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.590
 way to make it 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.960
 as in third dimension that gives us 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.410
 another perspective then here we have 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.410
 one and here we have the other flower 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.230
 we can not ride on our salad 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.540
 here we are going to put it on this side and 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.120
 I will also show you how to make a 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.130
 decor 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.630
 a flower 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.630
 with a cherry tomato 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.400
 let's cut to make two cuts for 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:15.500
 let's stay like this and then 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:20.870
 We'll cut each end in half 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.420
 let's try to get 8 petals 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.879
 on the other hand we have a container with 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.400
 water to do the following we are going to 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.980
 rinse the seeds to give us 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.530
 a better presentation 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.569
 and be more colorful our salad or 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.900
 our dish in which we go to 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.900
 eat 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.970
 As you can see it is very simple and here 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.190
 we have our flower 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.110
 we can also mount it on 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.970
 our salad or any other 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.950
 dish that is to our liking 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.400
 nothing else we clean here lorÃ­a of our 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.129
 dish and we have 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.750
 a salad decorated and very easy to 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.520
 elaboration 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.940
 we are seeing ourselves in the next 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.940
 week 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.860
 d 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.860
 yes 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.039
 Y
