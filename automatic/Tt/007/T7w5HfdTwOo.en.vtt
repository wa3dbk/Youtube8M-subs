definitely play it the easiest way to
play<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.899> you<00:00:42.899> know<00:00:42.989> sounding

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
play it and have it be you know sounding

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.729 
play it and have it be you know sounding
like<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.399> matches<00:00:44.550> up<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> recording<00:00:45.539> is

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
like it matches up with the recording is

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.360 
like it matches up with the recording is
to<00:00:46.739> actually<00:00:47.129> put<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> capo<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.370> first

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.299 
to actually put the capo on the first
fret<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.270> basically<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.809> makes<00:00:51.989> all<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
