00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.729 
wouldn't really do that actually spray a
little<00:03:57.120> bit<00:03:57.299> of<00:03:57.389> wd-40<00:03:58.049> right<00:03:58.680> along<00:03:59.010> here<00:04:00.739> so

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
little bit of wd-40 right along here so

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.479 
little bit of wd-40 right along here so
I'll<00:04:01.829> dip<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:03.109> just<00:04:04.109> a<00:04:04.230> little<00:04:04.379> bit<00:04:04.560> just<00:04:05.069> not

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
I'll dip that just a little bit just not

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.059 
I'll dip that just a little bit just not
too

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.680 

have<00:04:12.580> it<00:04:12.700> position<00:04:13.120> maybe<00:04:13.450> around<00:04:13.659> there<00:04:15.690> take

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
have it position maybe around there take

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.950 
have it position maybe around there take
your<00:04:16.870> channellock<00:04:17.320> ranches<00:04:21.660> have<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.810> right

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
your channellock ranches have it right

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.320 
your channellock ranches have it right
here<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:24.449> just<00:04:25.449> pry<00:04:25.960> it<00:04:25.990> off<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.030> have<00:04:28.210> to

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
here and just pry it off and I have to

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.870 
here and just pry it off and I have to
put<00:04:28.570> a<00:04:28.600> little<00:04:28.870> bit<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.050> pressure<00:04:29.260> just<00:04:29.880> like

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
put a little bit of pressure just like

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.879 
put a little bit of pressure just like
that<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:34.600> blade<00:04:34.750> adapter<00:04:35.139> just<00:04:35.620> comes

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
that and the blade adapter just comes

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.909 
that and the blade adapter just comes
right<00:04:36.100> off<00:04:36.840> no<00:04:37.840> problem<00:04:38.229> at<00:04:38.320> all<00:04:38.350> whatsoever

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
right off no problem at all whatsoever

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.129 
right off no problem at all whatsoever
just<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:42.550> way<00:04:42.699> you<00:04:42.760> won't<00:04:43.000> have<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.180> bang<00:04:44.020> it

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
just that way you won't have to bang it

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.450 
just that way you won't have to bang it
with<00:04:44.199> a<00:04:44.260> hammer<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.860> risk<00:04:45.699> bending<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:47.460> plate

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
with a hammer and risk bending the plate

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.810 
with a hammer and risk bending the plate
adapter

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.330 

well<00:04:53.360> reason<00:04:53.690> while<00:04:53.840> reason<00:04:54.710> why<00:04:54.830> doing<00:04:55.190> all

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
well reason while reason why doing all

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.090 
well reason while reason why doing all
this<00:04:55.520> just<00:04:56.300> so<00:04:56.360> that<00:04:56.600> way<00:04:56.860> like<00:04:57.860> if<00:04:57.980> your

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
this just so that way like if your

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.460 
this just so that way like if your
muffler<00:04:58.370> gets<00:04:58.670> clogged<00:04:58.970> up<00:04:59.240> because<00:05:00.140> every

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
muffler gets clogged up because every

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.280 
muffler gets clogged up because every
once<00:05:00.680> in<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:00.890> while<00:05:01.510> these<00:05:02.510> mufflers<00:05:02.840> will<00:05:03.170> get

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
once in a while these mufflers will get

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.530 
once in a while these mufflers will get
clogged<00:05:03.590> up<00:05:03.800> on<00:05:04.070> these<00:05:04.760> two-stroke<00:05:05.300> blonde

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
clogged up on these two-stroke blonde

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.860 
clogged up on these two-stroke blonde
boys<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:09.490> how<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.550> take<00:05:10.790> these<00:05:10.940> mufflers<00:05:11.240> off

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
boys and how to take these mufflers off

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.930 
boys and how to take these mufflers off
there's<00:05:12.530> just<00:05:12.680> three<00:05:12.890> bolts<00:05:13.490> right<00:05:13.640> here

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
there's just three bolts right here

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
the exhaust ports - also one thing to

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.830 
the exhaust ports - also one thing to
look<00:05:48.710> at<00:05:48.950> which<00:05:49.460> is<00:05:49.490> usually<00:05:49.940> common<00:05:50.480> on<00:05:50.600> lawn

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
look at which is usually common on lawn

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.760 
look at which is usually common on lawn
boys<00:05:51.610> check<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.760> see<00:05:52.940> if<00:05:53.810> your<00:05:54.110> crankshaft<00:05:54.590> is

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
boys check to see if your crankshaft is

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.840 
boys check to see if your crankshaft is
wet<00:05:54.980> which<00:05:55.340> this<00:05:56.000> one<00:05:56.210> is<00:05:56.240> not<00:05:57.310> it<00:05:58.310> used<00:05:58.520> to<00:05:58.640> be

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
wet which this one is not it used to be

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.630 
wet which this one is not it used to be
wet<00:05:59.060> if<00:06:00.050> it<00:06:00.260> is<00:06:00.470> that<00:06:01.010> means<00:06:01.160> your<00:06:01.400> lower

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
wet if it is that means your lower

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:08.790 
wet if it is that means your lower
crankcase<00:06:02.540> seal<00:06:02.870> is<00:06:03.250> bad<00:06:06.550> so<00:06:07.550> basically<00:06:07.910> on

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
crankcase seal is bad so basically on

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.410 
crankcase seal is bad so basically on
how<00:06:09.800> to<00:06:09.860> replace<00:06:10.130> that<00:06:10.490> you<00:06:11.060> have<00:06:11.180> to<00:06:11.300> take

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
how to replace that you have to take

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.590 
how to replace that you have to take
them<00:06:11.600> off<00:06:11.720> or<00:06:11.870> off<00:06:12.050> and<00:06:12.320> you<00:06:12.380> have<00:06:12.530> to<00:06:13.420> take<00:06:14.420> the

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
them off or off and you have to take the

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.930 
them off or off and you have to take the
engine<00:06:15.220> off<00:06:16.220> of<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:16.730> mower<00:06:17.090> deck

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
engine off of the mower deck

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.140 
engine off of the mower deck
just<00:06:19.750> so<00:06:19.840> that<00:06:19.960> way<00:06:20.110> you<00:06:20.170> can<00:06:20.500> change<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:21.040> seal

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:31.950 

so<00:06:26.160> that<00:06:27.160> I<00:06:27.190> show<00:06:27.600> y'all<00:06:28.600> on<00:06:28.750> how<00:06:28.900> to<00:06:30.750> remove<00:06:31.750> a

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
so that I show y'all on how to remove a

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.150 
so that I show y'all on how to remove a
weight<00:06:32.890> adapter<00:06:34.170> this<00:06:35.170> goes<00:06:35.410> on<00:06:35.650> pretty<00:06:36.010> much

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
weight adapter this goes on pretty much

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.320 
weight adapter this goes on pretty much
most<00:06:36.460> long<00:06:36.670> boys<00:06:36.910> with<00:06:37.510> these<00:06:37.720> uh<00:06:38.040> offset

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
most long boys with these uh offset
