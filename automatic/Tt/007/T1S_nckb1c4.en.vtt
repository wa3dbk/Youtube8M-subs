00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.910
 here is the milan you don't expect but the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.040
 result does not change 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.800
 and he the winter champion thanks to a 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.380
 nice design goal and a defense from 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.749
 manual so the devil can do without 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.509
 of willow inventions says today 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:24.999
 unrecognizable until forced 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.009
 hat to call him back on the bench and yes 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.890
 allows you to give up even alone 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.590
 tip available French makes leather 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.489
 sent by the logical referee in the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.140
 changing rooms after just 35 minutes of play 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.750
 an obligatory question for the reporter 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.760
 an answer that was a bit avoided 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.329
 hair a judgment on the savicevic in e 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.929
 of today 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.429
 but I don't want to talk about services anymore 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.750
 friends because it seems to me now a place 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.280
 common to speak only of this player 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.000
 let's talk about the milan and great performance 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.510
 of Milan 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.820
 san shiny and is part of the rose has 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.249
 reason hat and let's talk about Milan 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.499
 who suffered speed at the start 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:05.530
 of Reggio able to build plots 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:07.750
 thick thanks to precise passages almost 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.840
 always on the fly and without breaks for 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.520
 stop or accompany the ball as much 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.910
 that in the beginning the clearest occasions 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.160
 have been exhibited without showing 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.400
 doubt too much precipitation in the 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.950
 conclusions 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.770
 at the initial surprise however the Milan 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.950
 responds with a cross shot by Orlando 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.810
 that ends up on the pole and then on to 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.150
 twenty-seventh with the great design goal 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.180
 which signs the victory over a rejected one 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.310
 short of captain zanutta however among the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.649
 best in the field with sgarbossa and dinner 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.899
 after the expulsion of dad due 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.790
 move back a few meters 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.520
 but I must say that the team was 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.060
 very organized lives are 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.740
 managed not to cause us problems and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.369
 he has just led and has 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.360
 organized the defense of design goals 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.210
 forcing opponents to shoot 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.670
 only from outside the area in this always 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.770
 well supported by impeccable timing 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.380
 of baldini and in the final also from 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.959
 taxis called to replace savicevic 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.010
 but arranged in the field instead of panucci 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.840
 mandate to support donadoni and design 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.190
 hard-working sliders in front of his own 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.560
 defense 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.959
 a short Milan that with a wise choice 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.360
 tactics left that the Reggio Emilia 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.420
 dominates both midfield for 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.180
 placate it on time in front of the area 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.730
 of rigor of reds but also capable of 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.330
 recur in attack even if alone 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.210
 massaro 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.330
 perhaps a milan no longer arrembante 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.270
 steamroller but second computer 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.060
 reason for ranking as Jesus recognizes 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.850
 rude relentless controller of 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.190
 actually savicevic in this milan 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.200
 he believed we closed a lot we have 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.450
 searched with filter balls though 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.190
 they were good offside singles and 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.880
 perhaps we have committed a moment 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.540
 some decisions by 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.540
