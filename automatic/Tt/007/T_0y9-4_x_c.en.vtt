00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
and it's important to do all your

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.380 
and it's important to do all your
breaking<00:01:55.450> out<00:01:55.750> before<00:01:56.290> your<00:01:56.440> tip<00:01:56.619> in<00:01:56.799> because

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
breaking out before your tip in because

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.340 
breaking out before your tip in because
it's<00:01:58.390> one<00:01:58.540> of<00:01:58.600> them<00:01:58.720> opponent<00:01:59.020> or<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.170> see

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.490 
it's one of them opponent or you see
some<00:01:59.530> crashes<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.460> when<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.420> run<00:02:01.630> wide<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:02.050> t1

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
some crashes and when you run wide in t1

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.410 
some crashes and when you run wide in t1
it<00:02:02.710> really<00:02:02.979> messes<00:02:03.250> up<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.670> second<00:02:04.000> one<00:02:04.149> so

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
it really messes up the second one so

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.240 
it really messes up the second one so
this<00:02:04.570> leads<00:02:04.840> onto<00:02:05.020> our<00:02:05.470> complex<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.070> three

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
this leads onto our complex of three

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.420 
this leads onto our complex of three
corners<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.759> your<00:02:06.850> life<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:13.300> important<00:02:14.110> just

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
you know it's a stop-start corner you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.229 
you know it's a stop-start corner you
try<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.050> get<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.530> right<00:02:17.950> into<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.400> apex<00:02:18.790> hold

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
try to get in right into the apex hold

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.180 
try to get in right into the apex hold
the<00:02:19.450> curb<00:02:19.720> hold<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.260> curve<00:02:20.500> or<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:20.920> curve

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
then pick the bike up and accelerate it

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.420 
then pick the bike up and accelerate it
really<00:02:23.890> hard

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
really hard

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.340 
really hard
easy<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> circuit<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.420> use<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.930> kerbs<00:02:26.110> you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
easy a circuit you can use the kerbs you

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.960 
easy a circuit you can use the kerbs you
look<00:02:26.470> fairly<00:02:26.709> flat<00:02:26.980> I'm<00:02:27.130> using<00:02:27.370> all<00:02:27.820> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
look fairly flat I'm using all the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.210 
look fairly flat I'm using all the
curves<00:02:28.209> also<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.959> some<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.860> inside

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
curves also and some of the inside

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.979 
curves also and some of the inside
curves<00:02:30.519> you<00:02:30.700> can<00:02:30.730> use<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.300> know<00:02:31.600> they're<00:02:31.870> quite

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
curves you can use I know they're quite

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.800 
curves you can use I know they're quite
bumpy<00:02:32.290> but<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:33.220> mean<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.030> curbs<00:02:34.269> are<00:02:34.450> one<00:02:34.570> meter

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
bumpy but I mean the curbs are one meter

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.210 
bumpy but I mean the curbs are one meter
so<00:02:34.900> one<00:02:35.200> meter<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.500> track<00:02:35.860> it's

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
so one meter of track it's

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:46.410 
so one meter of track it's
it's<00:02:37.700> sometimes<00:02:38.000> necessary<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.960> use

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.870 

this<00:02:47.020> is<00:02:47.170> one<00:02:47.320> of<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.470> most<00:02:47.770> technical<00:02:48.580> parts

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
this is one of the most technical parts

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.030 
this is one of the most technical parts
of<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.060> track<00:02:49.270> there<00:02:49.750> but<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.410> would<00:02:50.650> say<00:02:50.830> that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
of the track there but I would say that

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.760 
of the track there but I would say that
in<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> mini<00:02:51.310> corkscrew<00:02:52.140> this<00:02:53.140> right<00:02:53.500> right

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
in a mini corkscrew this right right

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.280 
in a mini corkscrew this right right
right<00:02:54.010> corner<00:02:54.910> it's<00:02:55.120> not<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.420> same<00:02:55.630> drop<00:02:56.050> as<00:02:56.260> a

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
right corner it's not the same drop as a

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.750 
right corner it's not the same drop as a
quarry<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:56.890> they're<00:02:57.010> gonna<00:02:57.160> shake<00:02:57.460> it<00:02:57.640> but

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
quarry and they're gonna shake it but

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.510 
quarry and they're gonna shake it but
then<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:59.020> drop<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.410> over<00:02:59.530> here<00:02:59.650> first<00:03:00.220> or

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
then you drop it over here first or

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.340 
then you drop it over here first or
second<00:03:00.940> gear<00:03:01.120> again<00:03:01.450> depending<00:03:01.990> on<00:03:02.050> your<00:03:02.110> buy

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
second gear again depending on your buy

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.790 
second gear again depending on your buy
it<00:03:02.410> yeah<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:04.600> is<00:03:04.660> also<00:03:04.990> another<00:03:05.350> favor

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
it yeah and this is also another favor

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.240 
it yeah and this is also another favor
of<00:03:06.010> mine<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.550> can<00:03:06.760> second<00:03:07.330> gear<00:03:07.570> third<00:03:07.600> gear

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
of mine you can second gear third gear

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.070 
of mine you can second gear third gear
you're<00:03:09.250> not<00:03:09.580> on<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.850> outside<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> track<00:03:10.810> a

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
you're not on the outside of the track a

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.320 
you're not on the outside of the track a
little<00:03:11.230> bit<00:03:11.560> here<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.250> then<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.490> can<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.970> chop

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
little bit here and then you can I chop

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.910 
little bit here and then you can I chop
some<00:03:13.540> letters<00:03:13.959> can<00:03:14.260> roll<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.680> thrall

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
some letters can roll the thrall

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.310 
some letters can roll the thrall
depending<00:03:15.610> so<00:03:16.270> I'm<00:03:16.330> gonna<00:03:16.480> stop<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.990> throttle

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
depending so I'm gonna stop the throttle

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.320 
depending so I'm gonna stop the throttle
to<00:03:17.440> change<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.830> balance<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.280> bike<00:03:18.550> that's

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
to change the balance of the bike that's

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:31.650 
to change the balance of the bike that's
right<00:03:19.540> back<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:20.220> on<00:03:21.220> my<00:03:21.430> map<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.850> ten<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:31.450> Jonny

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
right back to on my map to ten so Jonny

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.680 
right back to on my map to ten so Jonny
we're<00:03:32.110> actually<00:03:32.260> on<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:33.010> lust<00:03:33.280> turn<00:03:33.850> on<00:03:34.239> the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
we're actually on the lust turn on the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.260 
we're actually on the lust turn on the
track<00:03:34.989> it's<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.530> huge<00:03:36.010> turn<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.910> it's<00:03:37.060> dead

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
track it's a huge turn and it's dead

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.720 
track it's a huge turn and it's dead
wide<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.870> he<00:03:38.080> can<00:03:38.770> a<00:03:38.800> good<00:03:39.100> can<00:03:39.400> but<00:03:39.550> what<00:03:39.640> is

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
wide and he can a good can but what is

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.680 
wide and he can a good can but what is
it<00:03:39.850> about<00:03:39.910> this<00:03:40.090> chair<00:03:40.270> in<00:03:40.330> particularly

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
it about this chair in particularly

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.840 
it about this chair in particularly
important<00:03:41.410> for<00:03:41.920> obvious<00:03:42.280> reasons<00:03:42.610> it's<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
important for obvious reasons it's the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.090 
important for obvious reasons it's the
last<00:03:43.060> corner<00:03:43.330> of<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.989> circus<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:44.590> very

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
last corner of the circus is very

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.760 
last corner of the circus is very
important<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.580> real<00:03:45.730> situation<00:03:46.000> but<00:03:46.690> more<00:03:47.560> so

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
important a real situation but more so

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.710 
important a real situation but more so
because<00:03:47.980> it's<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.520> new<00:03:48.730> corner<00:03:49.030> for<00:03:49.360> us<00:03:49.390> you

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
because it's a new corner for us you

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.289 
because it's a new corner for us you
know<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:50.080> lot<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.650> riders<00:03:51.459> haven't<00:03:51.850> rid<00:03:52.060> this

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
know a lot of riders haven't rid this

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.140 
know a lot of riders haven't rid this
corner<00:03:53.290> yet<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:54.010> you<00:03:54.130> do<00:03:54.310> pick<00:03:54.610> one<00:03:54.970> or<00:03:55.120> two

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
corner yet and you do pick one or two

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.090 
corner yet and you do pick one or two
points<00:03:55.690> in<00:03:55.780> this<00:03:55.870> corner<00:03:56.260> where<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.590> you're

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
points in this corner where you you're

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.890 
points in this corner where you you're
at<00:03:57.220> your<00:03:57.430> slowest<00:03:57.790> point<00:03:58.060> accelerate<00:03:58.630> then

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
at your slowest point accelerate then

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.430 
at your slowest point accelerate then
slow<00:03:59.260> again<00:04:00.570> maximally<00:04:01.570> nine<00:04:01.750> got<00:04:01.900> pickup<00:04:02.260> and

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
slow again maximally nine got pickup and

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.170 
slow again maximally nine got pickup and
go<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:03.160> hopefully<00:04:03.519> that<00:04:03.790> would<00:04:03.850> be<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.060> key

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
go and hopefully that would be the key

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:15.220 
go and hopefully that would be the key
to<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.420> fast<00:04:04.630> lap<00:04:04.750> time

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.849 

so<00:04:16.130> that<00:04:16.370> is<00:04:16.669> mortal<00:04:17.419> and<00:04:17.540> arrogant<00:04:18.320> don't

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
so that is mortal and arrogant don't

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.620 
so that is mortal and arrogant don't
need<00:04:18.980> me<00:04:19.130> driving<00:04:19.549> one<00:04:19.700> so<00:04:19.880> bad<00:04:20.060> with<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.299> it

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
need me driving one so bad with it it

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.880 
need me driving one so bad with it it
was<00:04:20.750> good<00:04:20.930> talking<00:04:21.769> about<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.550> thank<00:04:22.820> you
