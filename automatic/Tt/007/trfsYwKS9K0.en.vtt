360<00:03:20.139> now<00:03:21.139> this<00:03:21.260> isn't<00:03:21.500> true<00:03:21.769> HD<00:03:22.010> yet<00:03:22.400> for<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.760> mac

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
360 now this isn't true HD yet for a mac

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.569 
360 now this isn't true HD yet for a mac
that<00:03:23.450> update<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.109> coming<00:03:24.500> but<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.340> can<00:03:25.489> at

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
that update is coming but you can at

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.179 
that update is coming but you can at
least<00:03:25.609> get<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.180> right<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:27.530> right<00:03:27.560> dimensions

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
least get the right the right dimensions

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.240

so if you record you'll you'll have HD

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.649 
so if you record you'll you'll have HD
dimensions<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.849> just<00:03:32.060> won't<00:03:32.180> have<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.480> true

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
dimensions you just won't have the true

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
recording all your gameplay there is a

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.870 
recording all your gameplay there is a
little<00:04:24.650> bit<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:24.950> delay<00:04:25.220> between<00:04:25.370> what's<00:04:25.760> on

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
little bit of a delay between what's on

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.670 
little bit of a delay between what's on
your<00:04:26.030> TV<00:04:26.210> and<00:04:26.360> what's<00:04:26.630> on<00:04:26.750> here<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.620> you

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
your TV and what's on here so you

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.260 
your TV and what's on here so you
couldn't<00:04:28.010> use<00:04:28.190> this<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.640> actually<00:04:28.790> play

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
couldn't use this to actually play

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.640 
couldn't use this to actually play
because<00:04:29.810> you'll<00:04:29.930> always<00:04:30.140> be<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.320> couple

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
because you'll always be a couple

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.630 
because you'll always be a couple
seconds<00:04:30.920> behind<00:04:31.300> but<00:04:32.300> that's<00:04:33.290> how<00:04:33.500> I<00:04:33.770> record

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
seconds behind but that's how I record

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.520 
seconds behind but that's how I record
all<00:04:34.700> my<00:04:34.880> videos<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.420> if<00:04:35.870> you<00:04:35.930> want<00:04:36.170> to<00:04:36.290> see<00:04:36.410> the
