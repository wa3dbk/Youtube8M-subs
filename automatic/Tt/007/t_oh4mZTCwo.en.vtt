Select type of figure it has pretty
limited<00:01:37.260> articulation<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.520> very<00:01:38.910> very

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090

heavy I like the paint sculpt of it
though<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.730> think<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.000> paint<00:01:42.240> applications

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.540 
though I think the paint applications
are<00:01:43.170> pretty<00:01:43.409> good<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.130> know<00:01:44.250> throughout

applications in it you can see there's

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.120 
applications in it you can see there's
like<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.570> greyish<00:01:57.930> purple<00:01:57.990> mixed<00:01:58.620> over<00:01:58.950> this

like this greyish purple mixed over this

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.950 
like this greyish purple mixed over this
grey<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.760> then<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.940> has<00:02:00.060> black<00:02:00.330> in<00:02:00.570> there<00:02:00.750> so

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
grey and then it has black in there so

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.540 
grey and then it has black in there so
it<00:02:01.110> has<00:02:01.229> quite<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.530> few<00:02:01.710> colors<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.190> there<00:02:02.340> so

it has quite a few colors in there so

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.770 
it has quite a few colors in there so
there's<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.760> close<00:02:02.940> look<00:02:03.120> at<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.330> face<00:02:03.510> sculpt

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
there's a close look at the face sculpt

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.870 
there's a close look at the face sculpt
the<00:02:03.930> first<00:02:04.170> appearance<00:02:04.530> Hulk<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:05.010> like<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.729> I

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the first appearance Hulk I like it I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.010 
the first appearance Hulk I like it I
think<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.150> looks<00:02:06.180> pretty<00:02:06.450> good<00:02:06.690> I<00:02:06.720> think<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
think it looks pretty good I think the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.109 
think it looks pretty good I think the
hair<00:02:07.229> applications<00:02:07.770> are<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.759> little

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
hair applications are just a little

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.960 
hair applications are just a little
misfired<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.289> guess<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:11.159> can<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.760> black

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
misfired I guess you can see the black

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.729 
misfired I guess you can see the black
paint<00:02:12.360> kind<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.659> creeps<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:13.019> a<00:02:13.110> little<00:02:13.409> farther

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
paint kind of creeps up a little farther

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.649 
paint kind of creeps up a little farther
than<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.220> sculpted<00:02:14.700> hairline<00:02:15.120> right<00:02:15.450> over

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
than the sculpted hairline right over

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.750 
than the sculpted hairline right over
here<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.470> look<00:02:16.590> at<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.799> back<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.519> over

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
here if you look at the back of it over

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.430 
here if you look at the back of it over
here<00:02:17.790> there's<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.540> little<00:02:18.870> bit<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.110> hair<00:02:19.260> that's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
here there's a little bit of hair that's

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.680 
here there's a little bit of hair that's
not<00:02:19.709> painted<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:20.159> they<00:02:20.760> need<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:20.970> scoot<00:02:21.599> it

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
not painted so they need to scoot it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.860 
not painted so they need to scoot it
back<00:02:21.720> tiny<00:02:22.319> bit<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> nitpick<00:02:23.940> like

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
back tiny bit but that is a nitpick like

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.899 
back tiny bit but that is a nitpick like
how<00:02:25.019> he's<00:02:25.349> got<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.680> flat<00:02:26.159> hair<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.700> on

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
how he's got this flat hair going on

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.030 
how he's got this flat hair going on
covering<00:02:27.690> all<00:02:27.780> around<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.349> really<00:02:28.709> like<00:02:28.830> how<00:02:28.950> it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
covering all around I really like how it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.740 
covering all around I really like how it
looks<00:02:29.069> though<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.549> really<00:02:29.879> reminds<00:02:30.360> me<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
looks though it really reminds me of the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.089 
looks though it really reminds me of the
first<00:02:30.900> appearance<00:02:31.319> Hulk<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.709> looks<00:02:31.860> pretty

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
first appearance Hulk it looks pretty

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.589 
first appearance Hulk it looks pretty
good<00:02:32.279> I<00:02:32.340> like<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.670> paint<00:02:32.849> applications<00:02:33.420> right

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
good I like the paint applications right

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.390 
good I like the paint applications right
here<00:02:33.749> on<00:02:33.840> his<00:02:33.959> mouth<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.469> the<00:02:34.529> inside<00:02:34.950> his

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
here on his mouth and the inside his

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.870 
here on his mouth and the inside his
teeth<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.879> all<00:02:35.969> that

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
teeth and all that

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.910 
teeth and all that
like<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.240> it<00:02:37.480> looks<00:02:37.630> cool<00:02:37.900> his<00:02:38.230> tattered<00:02:38.500> shirt

mixed<00:02:40.900> in<00:02:40.990> with<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.230> white<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:41.620> think<00:02:41.650> that

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
mixed in with the white I think that

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.160 
mixed in with the white I think that
looks<00:02:42.130> pretty<00:02:42.400> nice<00:02:42.580> this<00:02:43.270> is<00:02:43.330> very<00:02:43.510> faint

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
looks pretty nice this is very faint

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.440 
looks pretty nice this is very faint
texture<00:02:44.860> going<00:02:45.070> on<00:02:45.310> on<00:02:45.490> his<00:02:45.670> skin<00:02:46.030> like<00:02:46.240> right

in<00:02:50.560> there<00:02:50.590> which<00:02:51.010> i<00:02:51.100> think<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.400> kind<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.670> neat

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850

in there which i think is kind of neat
we<00:02:52.330> have<00:02:52.540> some<00:02:52.750> very<00:02:52.930> slight<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.650> know

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
which looks pretty cool and I think the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.310

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
Hulk figure with no fists the way they

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.760
