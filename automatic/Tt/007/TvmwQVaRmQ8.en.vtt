00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
think too what we do as we have learned

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.840 
think too what we do as we have learned
more<00:00:37.670> about<00:00:38.379> the<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:39.980> know<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.399> way<00:00:40.550> people

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
more about the you know the way people

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
decisions I think we realize more that

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.149 
decisions I think we realize more that
we<00:00:46.250> need<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.239> be<00:00:47.360> going<00:00:47.690> beyond<00:00:48.040> some<00:00:49.040> of<00:00:49.070> the

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
we need to be going beyond some of the

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.040 
we need to be going beyond some of the
existing<00:00:49.550> tools<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.300> that's<00:00:50.480> not<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.750> say<00:00:50.900> I'm

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
existing tools and that's not to say I'm

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.110 
existing tools and that's not to say I'm
really<00:00:51.320> isn't<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.620> say<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:51.879> survey<00:00:52.879> based

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
really isn't to say that survey based

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.549 
really isn't to say that survey based
work<00:00:53.329> or<00:00:53.510> qualitative<00:00:53.989> work<00:00:54.050> isn't<00:00:54.379> valid

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
work or qualitative work isn't valid

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:55.810 
work or qualitative work isn't valid
because<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:54.920> absolutely<00:00:55.309> is<00:00:55.460> we<00:00:55.640> wouldn't

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
because and absolutely is we wouldn't

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.299 
because and absolutely is we wouldn't
have<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.180> behavioral<00:00:57.100> validation<00:00:58.100> that<00:00:58.190> we

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
have the behavioral validation that we

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:59.829 
have the behavioral validation that we
have<00:00:58.460> for<00:00:58.670> those<00:00:58.729> things<00:00:59.059> if<00:00:59.269> that<00:00:59.449> if<00:00:59.659> it

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
have for those things if that if it

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.780 
have for those things if that if it
weren't<00:01:00.379> working<00:01:00.769> but<00:01:01.339> I<00:01:01.370> think<00:01:01.579> what<00:01:01.670> this

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
weren't working but I think what this

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.219 
weren't working but I think what this
does<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.149> give<00:01:02.360> us<00:01:02.390> an<00:01:02.629> additional<00:01:03.079> dimension

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
does is give us an additional dimension

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.219 
does is give us an additional dimension
and<00:01:03.800> an<00:01:04.009> additional<00:01:04.339> insights<00:01:04.759> about<00:01:05.479> things

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
and an additional insights about things

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:07.450 
and an additional insights about things
that<00:01:06.530> we<00:01:06.649> perhaps<00:01:06.890> something<00:01:07.039> able<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:07.310> see

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
that we perhaps something able to see

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.029 
that we perhaps something able to see
before<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:08.000> I<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:08.420> think<00:01:09.289> it<00:01:09.500> will<00:01:09.619> lead<00:01:09.890> us

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
before and I just think it will lead us

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.430 
before and I just think it will lead us
to<00:01:10.270> you<00:01:11.270> know<00:01:11.300> better<00:01:11.660> understanding<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.259> how

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
to you know better understanding of how

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.900 
to you know better understanding of how
consumers<00:01:12.950> make<00:01:13.100> decisions<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.640> therefore

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
consumers make decisions and therefore

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.630 
consumers make decisions and therefore
better<00:01:14.030> better<00:01:14.539> business<00:01:14.810> decisions

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.030 

still<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:20.360> huge<00:01:20.810> growth<00:01:21.050> area<00:01:21.200> because<00:01:21.860> I<00:01:21.979> think

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
still a huge growth area because I think

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.000 
still a huge growth area because I think
although<00:01:22.760> it's<00:01:23.659> true<00:01:23.870> to<00:01:24.050> say<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:24.260> pretty

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
although it's true to say that pretty

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.070 
although it's true to say that pretty

experimenting will have done

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.460 
experimenting will have done
experimentation<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:31.940> this<00:01:32.119> field<00:01:32.390> it's<00:01:33.140> not

by any means kind of reached any kind of

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.120 
by any means kind of reached any kind of
plateau<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:36.110> think<00:01:36.440> you<00:01:36.619> know<00:01:36.740> people<00:01:36.950> are

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
plateau I think you know people are

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.350 
plateau I think you know people are
beginning<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.490> do<00:01:37.670> more<00:01:37.850> work<00:01:37.970> with<00:01:38.180> it

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
beginning to do more work with it

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.550 
beginning to do more work with it
they're<00:01:38.600> beginning<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.900> see<00:01:38.960> what<00:01:39.229> works<00:01:39.440> for

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
they're beginning to see what works for

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.650 
they're beginning to see what works for
than<00:01:39.770> what<00:01:39.920> doesn't<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.430> as<00:01:40.940> they<00:01:41.180> do<00:01:41.240> more<00:01:41.600> of

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
than what doesn't and as they do more of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.840 
than what doesn't and as they do more of
that<00:01:41.810> I<00:01:42.290> think<00:01:42.800> you'll<00:01:42.979> find<00:01:43.280> more<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:43.700> more

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that I think you'll find more and more

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.999 
that I think you'll find more and more
companies<00:01:44.659> kind<00:01:44.930> of<00:01:45.080> start<00:01:45.560> using<00:01:45.740> more

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
companies kind of start using more

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.530 
companies kind of start using more

regularly a few years ago we were very

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.960 
regularly a few years ago we were very
much<00:01:47.890> looking<00:01:48.890> at<00:01:49.190> kind<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.490> learnings

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
much looking at kind of the learnings

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.170 
much looking at kind of the learnings
from<00:01:50.800> neuroscience<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:51.979> psychology

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
from neuroscience and psychology

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.609 
from neuroscience and psychology
applying<00:01:53.180> that<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.899> what<00:01:54.020> Milliband<00:01:54.320> does

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
applying that to to what Milliband does

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.990 
applying that to to what Milliband does
changing<00:01:55.070> some<00:01:55.220> of<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.340> questions<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:55.789> we

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
changing some of the questions that we

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.650 
changing some of the questions that we
ask<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.420> so<00:01:56.840> on<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:58.670> still<00:01:58.970> goes<00:01:59.180> on<00:01:59.360> within

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
ask and so on that still goes on within

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.730 
ask and so on that still goes on within
the<00:01:59.750> business<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.229> that<00:02:00.259> learning<00:02:00.560> still

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
the business and that learning still

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.160 
the business and that learning still
being<00:02:01.009> used<00:02:01.190> that<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.810> role<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.080> the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
being used that the the role of the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.290 
being used that the the role of the
neuroscience<00:02:03.410> practice<00:02:03.920> has<00:02:04.039> now<00:02:04.190> changed<00:02:05.000> in

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
neuroscience practice has now changed in

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.979 
neuroscience practice has now changed in
a<00:02:05.360> sense<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:05.780> become<00:02:05.990> more<00:02:06.229> about<00:02:07.780> using<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
a sense and become more about using the

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.180 
a sense and become more about using the
right<00:02:09.110> techniques<00:02:09.530> or<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.769> right<00:02:09.890> client

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
right techniques or the right client

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.680 
right techniques or the right client
issues<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.610> then<00:02:10.700> delivering<00:02:11.060> those<00:02:11.239> what

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
issues and then delivering those what

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.420 
issues and then delivering those what
kind<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.930> vibe<00:02:12.560> are<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.920> getting<00:02:13.250> from

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
kind of vibe are you getting from

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.430 
kind of vibe are you getting from
clients<00:02:13.850> about<00:02:14.510> neuroscience<00:02:15.730> as<00:02:16.730> ever<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.330> is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
clients about neuroscience as ever it is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.990 
clients about neuroscience as ever it is
varied<00:02:18.440> but<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.800> think<00:02:19.340> this<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.550> think<00:02:19.910> there

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
varied but I think this I think there

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.460 
varied but I think this I think there
was<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.120> bit<00:02:20.300> of<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.420> sea<00:02:20.630> change<00:02:20.870> about<00:02:21.140> three

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
was a bit of a sea change about three

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.250 
was a bit of a sea change about three
years<00:02:22.040> ago<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.580> would<00:02:22.730> say<00:02:22.910> where<00:02:23.239> people<00:02:23.989> can't

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
years ago I would say where people can't

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.410 
years ago I would say where people can't
went<00:02:24.530> from<00:02:25.000> scratching<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.060> head<00:02:26.180> slightly

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
went from scratching the head slightly

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.670 
went from scratching the head slightly
and<00:02:26.600> kind<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:26.959> looking<00:02:27.140> at<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.320> little<00:02:27.530> bit

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
and kind of looking at it a little bit

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.860 
and kind of looking at it a little bit
askew<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.370> saying<00:02:28.610> does<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:29.390> really<00:02:29.660> work

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
askew and saying does this really work

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.440 
askew and saying does this really work
is<00:02:30.110> this<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:31.100> this<00:02:31.250> for<00:02:31.430> real<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:32.090> now

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
is this is this is this for real and now

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.600 
is this is this is this for real and now
it's<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:32.959> much<00:02:33.170> more<00:02:33.350> okay<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.190> kind<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.489> know

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
it's it's much more okay I kind of know

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.890 
it's it's much more okay I kind of know
this<00:02:34.730> is<00:02:34.910> there<00:02:35.090> but<00:02:35.299> what<00:02:35.420> do<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.600> do<00:02:35.660> with<00:02:35.840> it

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
this is there but what do I do with it

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.140 
this is there but what do I do with it
and<00:02:36.260> what's<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.829> good<00:02:36.980> for<00:02:37.010> how<00:02:37.489> can<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.760> make<00:02:37.970> it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
and what's it good for how can I make it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.970 
and what's it good for how can I make it
work<00:02:38.329> for<00:02:38.510> me<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:38.989> think<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.459> basic<00:02:40.940> I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
work for me so I think the the basic I

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.830 
work for me so I think the the basic I
guess<00:02:42.980> skepticism<00:02:43.820> it's<00:02:44.299> still<00:02:44.570> there<00:02:44.720> to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
guess skepticism it's still there to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.020 
guess skepticism it's still there to
some<00:02:45.019> extent<00:02:45.549> but<00:02:46.570> it's<00:02:47.570> changed<00:02:48.019> now<00:02:48.200> from

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
some extent but it's changed now from

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.150 
some extent but it's changed now from
this<00:02:50.030> can't<00:02:50.269> possibly<00:02:50.570> work<00:02:50.720> -<00:02:51.140> okay<00:02:52.010> which

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
this can't possibly work - okay which

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.949 
this can't possibly work - okay which
which<00:02:52.489> bits<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:52.940> do<00:02:53.060> work<00:02:53.239> properly<00:02:53.630> for

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
which bits of this do work properly for

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.080 
which bits of this do work properly for
me<00:02:54.079> and<00:02:54.380> where<00:02:54.769> am<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:54.920> gonna<00:02:55.040> use<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:55.489> we've

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
me and where am I gonna use this we've

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.759 
me and where am I gonna use this we've
got<00:02:56.299> some<00:02:56.750> clients<00:02:57.049> particularly<00:02:57.290> saying

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
got some clients particularly saying

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.520 
got some clients particularly saying
places<00:02:58.100> like<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.310> US<00:02:58.579> and<00:02:59.000> Asia<00:02:59.840> where<00:03:00.290> they

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
places like the US and Asia where they

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.110 
places like the US and Asia where they
are<00:03:00.680> building<00:03:00.890> this<00:03:01.130> into<00:03:01.370> what<00:03:01.640> they<00:03:01.760> do<00:03:01.820> on<00:03:02.090> a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
are building this into what they do on a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.330 
are building this into what they do on a
consistent<00:03:02.840> basis<00:03:03.500> now<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:03.860> we've<00:03:03.950> become<00:03:04.070> and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
consistent basis now so we've become and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.250 
consistent basis now so we've become and

in<00:03:18.490> some<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.570> work<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.110> we<00:03:20.320> do<00:03:20.470> for

in some of the work that we do for

in some of the work that we do for

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
people to want to not say negative

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.060 
people to want to not say negative

things so whereas you know that there's

things so whereas you know that there's
some<00:03:24.250> negative<00:03:24.610> reactions<00:03:25.030> going<00:03:25.180> on

some negative reactions going on

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.700 
some negative reactions going on
sometimes<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.870> brands<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:26.500> on<00:03:26.590> that

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
sometimes to brands and so on that

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.220 
sometimes to brands and so on that
they're<00:03:26.830> not<00:03:26.980> always<00:03:27.250> articulating<00:03:28.060> so<00:03:28.630> some

they're not always articulating so some

of these met and some of these sorts of
approaches<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.410> being<00:03:32.410> very<00:03:32.620> attractive<00:03:33.010> in

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
approaches and being very attractive in

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.530 
approaches and being very attractive in
those<00:03:33.190> markets<00:03:33.400> because<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:33.910> do<00:03:34.060> get<00:03:34.300> to<00:03:34.420> see

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
those markets because you do get to see

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.030 
those markets because you do get to see
the<00:03:34.630> negative<00:03:34.960> responses<00:03:35.440> that<00:03:35.650> perhaps

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
the negative responses that perhaps

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.880 
the negative responses that perhaps
weren't<00:03:36.730> there<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.690> original

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
weren't there in the original

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.970 
weren't there in the original
conventional<00:03:38.890> research<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:41.140> yeah<00:03:41.380> we've<00:03:41.650> done

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
conventional research so yeah we've done

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.970 
conventional research so yeah we've done
probably<00:03:42.460> more<00:03:42.640> I'm<00:03:43.150> tracking<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.840> EEG<00:03:44.530> work

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
probably more I'm tracking and EEG work

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.570 
probably more I'm tracking and EEG work
out<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.490> Asia<00:03:45.850> than<00:03:46.210> anywhere<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:47.320> we've<00:03:48.310> done

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
out in Asia than anywhere and we've done

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.750 
out in Asia than anywhere and we've done
probably<00:03:49.000> more<00:03:49.800> implicit<00:03:50.800> Association<00:03:51.520> work

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
probably more implicit Association work

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.449 
probably more implicit Association work
in<00:03:52.030> Western<00:03:52.360> Europe<00:03:52.390> how<00:03:53.200> expensive<00:03:54.100> actually

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
in Western Europe how expensive actually

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.610 
in Western Europe how expensive actually
is<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:55.000> stuff<00:03:55.240> to<00:03:55.390> do<00:03:55.570> compared<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.290> what<00:03:56.440> you

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
is this stuff to do compared to what you

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.650 
is this stuff to do compared to what you
would<00:03:56.650> see<00:03:56.800> as<00:03:57.070> being<00:03:57.190> on<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.820> comparable<00:03:58.360> or

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
would see as being on a comparable or

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.060 
would see as being on a comparable or
something<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.320> might<00:03:59.410> get<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.740> similar

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
something that might get you similar

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.440 
something that might get you similar
results<00:04:00.520> yeah<00:04:00.760> it<00:04:01.000> is<00:04:01.860> I<00:04:02.860> think<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:04.030> varies

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
results yeah it is I think it varies

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.910 
results yeah it is I think it varies
massively<00:04:04.840> depending<00:04:05.200> on<00:04:05.260> what<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.470> do<00:04:05.620> so

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
massively depending on what you do so

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.140 
massively depending on what you do so
you<00:04:05.950> know<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.520> whole<00:04:06.670> kind<00:04:06.820> of<00:04:06.940> field

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
you know the whole kind of field

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.390 
you know the whole kind of field
neuroscience<00:04:07.930> and<00:04:08.140> cognitive<00:04:08.410> psychology

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
neuroscience and cognitive psychology

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.880 
neuroscience and cognitive psychology
covers<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:09.910> huge<00:04:10.120> range<00:04:10.209> you've<00:04:10.690> got<00:04:10.870> fMRI<00:04:11.770> at

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
covers a huge range you've got fMRI at

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.980 
covers a huge range you've got fMRI at
one<00:04:12.100> end<00:04:12.220> of<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.430> scale<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:13.360> know<00:04:13.750> it<00:04:13.840> could<00:04:13.959> be

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
one end of the scale I know it could be

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.780 
one end of the scale I know it could be
something<00:04:14.290> like<00:04:14.350> eye<00:04:14.560> tracking<00:04:14.590> or<00:04:15.400> implicit

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
something like eye tracking or implicit

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.280 
something like eye tracking or implicit
Association<00:04:16.480> measurement<00:04:16.810> down<00:04:16.900> at<00:04:17.049> the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
Association measurement down at the

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.930 
Association measurement down at the
other<00:04:17.380> end<00:04:17.530> of<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.709> scale<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.220> know<00:04:18.820> the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
other end of the scale and you know the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.210 
other end of the scale and you know the
the<00:04:19.630> costs<00:04:20.019> involved<00:04:20.350> practicalities

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
the costs involved practicalities

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.880 
the costs involved practicalities
involved<00:04:21.580> are<00:04:21.640> very<00:04:21.669> different<00:04:22.419> so<00:04:22.990> fMRI

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
involved are very different so fMRI

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.010 
involved are very different so fMRI
would<00:04:24.130> be<00:04:24.310> reasonably<00:04:24.970> expensive<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.570> do<00:04:25.690> you

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
would be reasonably expensive to do you

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.200 
would be reasonably expensive to do you
get<00:04:26.140> a<00:04:26.169> relatively<00:04:26.470> small<00:04:26.740> sample<00:04:26.890> people<00:04:27.430> you

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
get a relatively small sample people you

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.960 
get a relatively small sample people you
know<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.480> lot<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.720> money<00:04:28.930> something<00:04:29.620> like

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
know a lot of money something like

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.850 
know a lot of money something like
implicit<00:04:30.970> Association<00:04:31.720> work<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:32.320> get<00:04:32.650> you

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
implicit Association work you get you

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.650 
implicit Association work you get you
know<00:04:32.950> quantitative<00:04:33.490> sample<00:04:33.790> sizes<00:04:33.970> for

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
know quantitative sample sizes for

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.870 
know quantitative sample sizes for
something<00:04:35.650> that's<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.130> know<00:04:36.220> pretty<00:04:36.610> cost

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
something that's you know pretty cost

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.270 
something that's you know pretty cost
effective<00:04:37.330> what<00:04:37.840> we've<00:04:37.990> tried<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.230> do<00:04:38.560> is<00:04:38.890> I

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.600 
effective what we've tried to do is I
guess<00:04:39.870> focus<00:04:40.870> on<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.740> methods<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.250> we

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
guess focus on the the methods that we

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.700 
guess focus on the the methods that we
think<00:04:42.940> we<00:04:43.090> can<00:04:43.240> deliver<00:04:43.360> in<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:44.110> scalable<00:04:44.380> way

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
think we can deliver in a scalable way

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.999 
think we can deliver in a scalable way

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.679 

tend<00:04:50.369> to<00:04:50.430> react<00:04:50.699> one<00:04:50.849> of<00:04:50.909> two<00:04:51.059> ways<00:04:51.210> they<00:04:51.479> kind

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689 
tend to react one of two ways they kind

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:53.989 
tend to react one of two ways they kind
of<00:04:51.779> go<00:04:52.199> wow<00:04:52.469> that's<00:04:52.800> absolutely<00:04:53.369> fantastic<00:04:53.550> I

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:53.999 
of go wow that's absolutely fantastic I

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.510 
of go wow that's absolutely fantastic I
need<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.389> need<00:04:54.599> to<00:04:54.689> get<00:04:54.749> involved<00:04:55.110> in<00:04:55.199> that<00:04:55.520> or

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
need I need to get involved in that or

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.790 
need I need to get involved in that or
they<00:04:57.150> want<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.419> run<00:04:57.509> away<00:04:57.689> screaming<00:04:57.900> because

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
they want to run away screaming because

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.459 
they want to run away screaming because
it's<00:04:59.129> so<00:04:59.369> different<00:04:59.580> so<00:05:00.059> you<00:05:00.749> know<00:05:00.869> in<00:05:01.289> some

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
it's so different so you know in some

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.829 
it's so different so you know in some
ways<00:05:01.499> alien<00:05:01.979> to<00:05:02.159> what<00:05:02.490> they<00:05:02.699> used<00:05:02.729> to<00:05:03.059> I<00:05:03.330> think

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:03.839 
ways alien to what they used to I think

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.559 
ways alien to what they used to I think
again<00:05:04.439> as<00:05:04.770> clients<00:05:05.430> are<00:05:05.639> clearly<00:05:06.149> kind<00:05:06.479> of

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
again as clients are clearly kind of

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.359 
again as clients are clearly kind of
beginning<00:05:07.529> to<00:05:07.649> understand<00:05:08.039> this<00:05:08.129> a<00:05:08.189> lot

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:08.369 
beginning to understand this a lot

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:11.749 
beginning to understand this a lot
better<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.969> find<00:05:09.270> it<00:05:09.360> more<00:05:09.509> more<00:05:10.399> appealing<00:05:11.399> I

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
better and find it more more appealing I

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.010 
better and find it more more appealing I
think<00:05:11.819> the<00:05:12.210> research<00:05:12.419> industry<00:05:12.839> is<00:05:12.990> shifting

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
think the research industry is shifting

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.260 
think the research industry is shifting
from<00:05:13.889> you<00:05:14.669> know<00:05:14.759> the<00:05:14.879> kind<00:05:15.029> of<00:05:15.089> latter

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
from you know the kind of latter

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.839 
from you know the kind of latter
reaction<00:05:15.869> more<00:05:16.110> towards<00:05:16.439> the<00:05:16.529> former<00:05:16.919> and<00:05:17.099> so

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
reaction more towards the former and so

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.339 
reaction more towards the former and so
you<00:05:17.909> know<00:05:18.059> we<00:05:18.210> find<00:05:18.539> when<00:05:18.779> we<00:05:18.809> do<00:05:19.020> work<00:05:19.199> with

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
you know we find when we do work with

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.189 
you know we find when we do work with
our<00:05:19.819> our<00:05:20.819> partners<00:05:21.270> with<00:05:21.599> in<00:05:21.719> the<00:05:21.930> Maghreb

business know people think they're

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.249 
business know people think they're
getting<00:05:23.999> very<00:05:24.089> receptive<00:05:24.419> to<00:05:24.629> it<00:05:24.839> because

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
getting very receptive to it because

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.829 
getting very receptive to it because
they<00:05:25.439> begin<00:05:25.830> to<00:05:25.979> see<00:05:26.159> ok<00:05:27.029> I<00:05:27.059> am<00:05:27.479> getting<00:05:27.749> an

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:27.839 
they begin to see ok I am getting an

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.059 
they begin to see ok I am getting an
additional<00:05:28.259> bit<00:05:28.379> of<00:05:28.409> insight<00:05:28.740> here<00:05:28.949> that<00:05:29.039> I

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
additional bit of insight here that I

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.340 
additional bit of insight here that I
wouldn't<00:05:29.279> have<00:05:29.460> got<00:05:29.610> beforehand

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.440 

it's<00:05:33.800> very<00:05:33.950> difficult<00:05:34.280> in<00:05:34.430> some<00:05:34.580> ways<00:05:34.730> to<00:05:34.760> take

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
it's very difficult in some ways to take

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.060 
it's very difficult in some ways to take
something<00:05:35.720> that's<00:05:35.840> you<00:05:36.530> know<00:05:36.560> purely

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
something that's you know purely

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.650 
something that's you know purely
optimized<00:05:37.400> for<00:05:37.550> academia<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.060> use<00:05:38.240> that<00:05:38.420> in

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
optimized for academia and use that in

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.750 
optimized for academia and use that in
in<00:05:39.140> the<00:05:39.260> conventional<00:05:39.740> consumer<00:05:40.430> research

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
in the conventional consumer research

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.330 
in the conventional consumer research
and<00:05:41.060> and<00:05:41.750> I<00:05:41.810> think<00:05:41.870> that's<00:05:42.080> honestly<00:05:43.070> thing

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
and and I think that's honestly thing

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.560 
and and I think that's honestly thing
that's<00:05:43.460> big<00:05:43.550> for<00:05:43.610> shock<00:05:43.880> sometimes<00:05:44.180> for<00:05:44.480> some

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
that's big for shock sometimes for some

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.420 
that's big for shock sometimes for some
of<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.690> academics<00:05:45.140> that<00:05:45.410> have<00:05:45.920> been<00:05:46.130> working

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
of the academics that have been working

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.830 
of the academics that have been working
with<00:05:46.550> these<00:05:46.670> techniques<00:05:46.940> for<00:05:47.180> you<00:05:47.420> know<00:05:47.510> a<00:05:47.540> lot

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
with these techniques for you know a lot

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.380 
with these techniques for you know a lot
longer<00:05:47.990> than<00:05:48.170> we<00:05:48.770> have<00:05:49.010> when<00:05:49.850> they<00:05:49.970> suddenly

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
longer than we have when they suddenly

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.630 
longer than we have when they suddenly
become<00:05:50.900> a<00:05:51.050> messy<00:05:51.260> real<00:05:51.530> world<00:05:51.830> that<00:05:52.040> that<00:05:52.520> you

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
become a messy real world that that you

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.700 
become a messy real world that that you
have<00:05:52.790> to<00:05:52.940> then<00:05:53.090> deal<00:05:53.300> with<00:05:53.540> in<00:05:53.930> in<00:05:54.380> regular

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
have to then deal with in in regular

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.380 
have to then deal with in in regular
consumer<00:05:55.070> research<00:05:55.340> so<00:05:55.520> I<00:05:55.550> think<00:05:55.670> the<00:05:55.910> weeping

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
consumer research so I think the weeping

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.420 
consumer research so I think the weeping
rightly<00:05:56.840> quite<00:05:57.050> cautious<00:05:57.260> simply<00:05:58.100> given<00:05:58.310> this

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
rightly quite cautious simply given this

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.860 
rightly quite cautious simply given this
you<00:05:58.610> know<00:05:58.760> there's<00:05:58.970> been<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.390> lot<00:05:59.540> of<00:05:59.630> value<00:05:59.810> out

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
you know there's been a lot of value out

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.830 
you know there's been a lot of value out
of<00:05:59.990> commercial<00:06:00.380> research<00:06:00.800> for<00:06:01.010> many<00:06:01.160> years<00:06:01.400> I

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
of commercial research for many years I

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.700 
of commercial research for many years I
think<00:06:02.840> we<00:06:02.900> there's<00:06:03.140> an<00:06:03.230> industry<00:06:03.500> we've<00:06:03.620> been

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
think we there's an industry we've been

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.530 
think we there's an industry we've been
rightly<00:06:03.920> cautious<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.460> say<00:06:04.610> okay<00:06:04.970> let's<00:06:05.150> test

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
rightly cautious to say okay let's test

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.510 
rightly cautious to say okay let's test
this<00:06:05.750> make<00:06:05.990> sure<00:06:06.020> it<00:06:06.230> works<00:06:06.470> make<00:06:07.310> sure<00:06:07.430> it

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
this make sure it works make sure it

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.710 
this make sure it works make sure it
actually<00:06:07.580> add<00:06:07.880> something<00:06:08.120> to<00:06:08.360> the<00:06:08.450> picture

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
actually add something to the picture

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.810 
actually add something to the picture
we've<00:06:08.840> already<00:06:08.960> gone<00:06:09.230> before<00:06:09.590> we<00:06:09.920> now<00:06:10.640> really

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
we've already gone before we now really

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.390 
we've already gone before we now really
go<00:06:10.970> for<00:06:11.180> it

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.960 

I<00:06:14.430> think<00:06:15.210> it's<00:06:15.479> important<00:06:16.350> that<00:06:16.790> with<00:06:17.790> this

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
I think it's important that with this

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.879 
I think it's important that with this
field<00:06:18.240> we<00:06:18.570> are<00:06:18.600> very<00:06:19.110> very<00:06:19.410> strict<00:06:19.800> about

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
field we are very very strict about

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.120 
field we are very very strict about
things<00:06:20.160> up<00:06:20.310> the<00:06:20.580> LRS<00:06:21.090> code<00:06:21.270> of<00:06:21.360> conduct<00:06:21.690> and

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
things up the LRS code of conduct and

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.189 
things up the LRS code of conduct and
adhering<00:06:23.130> to<00:06:23.160> those<00:06:23.699> those<00:06:24.270> things<00:06:24.630> because

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
adhering to those those things because

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.250 
adhering to those those things because
you<00:06:25.800> know<00:06:25.860> there<00:06:26.040> is<00:06:26.190> that<00:06:26.780> sense<00:06:27.780> that<00:06:28.110> oh

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
you know there is that sense that oh

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.810 
you know there is that sense that oh
you're<00:06:28.740> getting<00:06:28.979> things<00:06:29.130> that<00:06:29.280> people<00:06:29.490> aren't

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
you're getting things that people aren't

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.080 
you're getting things that people aren't
necessarily<00:06:30.210> controlling<00:06:31.520> and<00:06:32.520> yeah<00:06:32.790> clearly

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
necessarily controlling and yeah clearly

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.219 
necessarily controlling and yeah clearly
some<00:06:33.240> people<00:06:33.449> got<00:06:33.510> to<00:06:33.630> worry<00:06:33.780> about<00:06:33.870> that<00:06:34.080> and

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
some people got to worry about that and

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:35.689 
some people got to worry about that and
I<00:06:34.260> got<00:06:34.380> worried<00:06:34.560> about<00:06:34.710> how<00:06:34.919> that<00:06:34.949> that's<00:06:35.430> used

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
I got worried about how that that's used

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.939 
I got worried about how that that's used
so<00:06:36.030> I<00:06:36.060> think<00:06:36.180> you<00:06:36.870> know<00:06:36.960> things<00:06:37.169> like<00:06:37.320> consent

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
so I think you know things like consent

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.890 
so I think you know things like consent
things<00:06:38.190> like<00:06:38.639> you<00:06:39.210> know<00:06:39.240> explaining<00:06:39.720> what's

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
things like you know explaining what's

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.600 
things like you know explaining what's
going<00:06:39.990> on<00:06:40.350> and<00:06:40.770> making<00:06:40.979> sure<00:06:41.190> clearly<00:06:41.520> that

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
going on and making sure clearly that

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.460 
going on and making sure clearly that
you<00:06:41.699> know<00:06:41.820> the<00:06:42.180> technology<00:06:42.900> isn't<00:06:43.050> gonna<00:06:43.260> be

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
you know the technology isn't gonna be

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.170 
you know the technology isn't gonna be
harmful<00:06:44.010> in<00:06:44.160> any<00:06:44.190> way<00:06:44.460> those<00:06:44.820> things<00:06:45.000> are<00:06:45.120> all

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
harmful in any way those things are all

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.510 
harmful in any way those things are all
crucial<00:06:45.449> I<00:06:45.870> can<00:06:46.770> see<00:06:46.949> some<00:06:47.130> regulatory

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
crucial I can see some regulatory

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.570 
crucial I can see some regulatory
challenges<00:06:48.150> emerging<00:06:49.080> if<00:06:49.320> we<00:06:50.010> don't<00:06:50.280> behave

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
challenges emerging if we don't behave

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.189 
challenges emerging if we don't behave
in<00:06:50.789> that<00:06:50.820> way<00:06:51.060> I<00:06:51.300> think<00:06:51.449> right<00:06:51.780> now<00:06:52.820> because

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 
in that way I think right now because

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.170 
in that way I think right now because
because<00:06:55.199> participants<00:06:55.860> don't<00:06:56.310> have<00:06:56.789> any<00:06:56.970> real

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
because participants don't have any real

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.060 
because participants don't have any real
objection<00:06:57.630> to<00:06:57.840> this<00:06:58.020> I<00:06:58.229> I<00:06:58.260> think<00:06:58.830> there's<00:06:59.010> a

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
objection to this I I think there's a

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:00.860 
objection to this I I think there's a
strong<00:06:59.220> case<00:06:59.490> to<00:06:59.520> be<00:06:59.639> made<00:06:59.729> that<00:06:59.970> this<00:07:00.120> is<00:07:00.180> you

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
strong case to be made that this is you

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.320 
strong case to be made that this is you
know<00:07:00.990> as<00:07:01.169> if<00:07:01.740> you<00:07:01.860> like<00:07:02.010> to<00:07:02.100> kind<00:07:02.280> of<00:07:02.340> ethical

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
know as if you like to kind of ethical

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.370 
know as if you like to kind of ethical
or<00:07:03.479> otherwise<00:07:03.750> there's<00:07:03.990> any<00:07:04.080> form<00:07:04.320> of

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 
or otherwise there's any form of
