00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.590
 There is a model accused of stabbing her boyfriend 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.649
 She now claims that he walked at night 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.019
 Several times you often hear Lewis there is this kind of typical stereo 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.219
 I'm in the deception where you see 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.570
 In films in popular culture and sometimes in real life 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.910
 Child with bruises or habit 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.939
 The wife with a bruise is quite obviously it because of 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.210
 A parent or husband has been beaten and when you ask them what happened they are 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.740
 I say 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.980
 I walked to the door so I 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.670
 I fell down the stairs completely on you just completely on my own 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.100
 There is this kind of understanding that well you just do not want to say 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.890
 That your father punches you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.160
 Or your husband pushed you in the wall and that is exactly the argument that is 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.170
 By which the model is charged with stabbing her boyfriend 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.559
 This is a Florida model named Scott should be ACE 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.059
 He was accused of stabbing her boyfriend after he fought around his dog 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.340
 Eating her marijuana is about rationing 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.330
 Her friend Keith claims that Wiggins should stab him repeatedly 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.750
 During the battle that began when his dog 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.159
 It consumes a quantity of its marijuana 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.790
 At this point he was in the process of kicking him out in the apartment 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.460
 We can say that he can not find his computer and at this point claims 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.650
 She stabbed 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.110
 That's when when Scott should have been talking to the police 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.009
 She had a different story saying the couple had a controversy about dinner plans 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.509
 It became material when I tried to leave the apartment 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.650
 And that at that point heat wandered at night and was stuck 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.950
 Several times the same judge cut her bond appointment 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.950
 3500 bucks says she can not own and forget 500 feet from her boyfriend 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.570
 We do not know what happened to the dog according to pet name 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.259
 hot line 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.720
 Marijuana poisoning in dogs can lead to 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.369
 Severe depression and drunk walking although not considered to be 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.040
 deadly 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.890
 You know this story looks totally silly Lewis 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.970
 But based on the fact that it is from Florida, based on the crime stories we see in 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.709
 In Florida 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.160
 It is not entirely impossible that a man entered a knife 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.450
 But it does seem a few times very likely right we have to be 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.190
 This is realistic and we have to use some logic yes 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.190
 What are those incredibly slim opportunities 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.300
 I actually blame the dog for the whole thing well 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.760
 I've certainly had you not think Peter would agree 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.120
 Right right of course you can definitely make the charge look like 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.810
 The strangest night if the dog's life 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.980
 Where the dog is consumed 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.519
 One of the owners of marijuana stagnation 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.769
 And then his owner saw another walk several times at night 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.680
 The dog probably thought that he was seeing things OK 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.230
 Yes if he was thinking anything at all maybe you'd just be hiding 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.530
 Somewhere for all the hype 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.709
