00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.970
 hi friends how are we today we are going to do 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:11.169
 some lentil burgers we need 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.049
 carrot onion garlic 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:16.960
 soy sauce soybeans we also need 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.110
 oregano egg a little salt and 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.990
 seasoning to taste to start we're going to 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.750
 step on our lentils very well to 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.789
 that have a more malleable consistency 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.710
 once we have our lentils 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.890
 well footsteps let's go incorporating 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.829
 each of our ingredients the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.050
 onion the shake the grated carrot 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.499
 thick or fine grated in this case is 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.050
 fine grated and we started to mix very 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.760
 well the preparation then that 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.460
 we have already mixed those ingredients 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.739
 thicker we incorporate an egg or two 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.749
 eggs according to the amount of 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.719
 preparation they have in this case is 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:58.899
 they are 250 grams of lentils half onion 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.870
 a carrot and a clove of chopped garlic 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.150
 we also incorporate a pinch of salt 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.800
 so that it has a little more flavor 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.530
 I in this case put a little more 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.530
 because it was quite the preparation 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.390
 we also incorporate condiments 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.670
 later they end up watching as 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.890
 we place the green oregano seasoning 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.950
 that gives a very special flavor a touch 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:27.020
 very special we will also place you 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.370
 soy sauce which gives it a flavor 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.370
 unique and without comparisson 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.190
 and now we put some flour for 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.200
 that the mixture is made so that the mixture 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.270
 become more homogeneous and we can form 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.650
 the hamburgers since they are difficult to 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.650
 form quickly 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.660
 and we observe 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.670
 next we see the hamburger 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.659
