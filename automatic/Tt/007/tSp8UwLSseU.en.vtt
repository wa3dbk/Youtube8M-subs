 brightest neon saturated 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.620
 colors and of course on this background itself is not 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.750
 want to look like something gray and so I 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.879
 tell you about your choice about what 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.610
 I like my own for nails and for 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.220
 lips start from varnishes I'll show you all 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.719

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.420
 look forge compositions on pink in 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.960
 first it was that pleases me already 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.059
 for 2 years and this api and color in 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 I strictly ri margarita by the way heart 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.489
 then I put under these videos in the infobox 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.390
 so make sure you go and read 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.390
 it is 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.850
 saturated raspberry shade very 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.890
 nice and loving i like but on my 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.890
 nails unfortunately does not last long 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.070
 the next magician I just adore 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.840
 this moment is loreal varnish and varnish 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.759
 Loreal I think you should not talk about 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.689
 tom how much i love them on 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.850
 gel base 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.960
 they are very long kept on my nails 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.149
 and there goes such a coral pink 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.740
 shade is also very beautiful looks 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.799
 incredibly beautiful on the nails 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.600
 but he gives no glossy finish about some 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.390
 semi-matt so if i want 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.289
 I add more gloss on top 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.289
 clear coat 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.160
 the next paws are very cheap from the brand 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.030
 golden rose from which I changed 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:58.260
 just this lid here 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.720
 brush changed from varnish Lorian means 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.060
 I like 10 foams he is very beautiful and 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.540
 Now I will show on the nails like him 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.540
 looks 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.560
 holding this flag of course i'm not that long 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.180
 like for example varnish from l'oreal but for the sake of 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.750
 this color basically i'm ready 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.750
 to suffer 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.019
 and the last two varnishes are Polish mage 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.709
 cosmetics by the way they are now on my 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.859
 nails 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.920
 I have this vipera cosmetics 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.659
 gently lemon yellow dim saturated 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.090
 it is precisely a delicate yellow shade 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.829
 shade of course I really like but by 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.260
 quality and I can not say that they are straight 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.719
 became my favorites because 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.159
 apply two three layers they are a strip i.e. 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:42.159
 capricious very application 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.940
 keeps these like somewhere for 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.650
 two or three days whichever 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.349
 what work will you still think 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.230
 perform and in principle 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.330
 For the sake of shade, again, I'm ready to put 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.459
 I like it a lot more often 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.849
 because I have long been similar 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.860
 met and also here is such a saturated 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.349
 neon orange shade too crazy 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.470
 beautiful this varnish is applied better than 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.569
 previous lemon but again he 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.430
 don't stand up enough 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.220
 Of course it looks very beautiful especially 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.269
 in the evening looks beautiful so neon 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.269
 bright shade 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.150
 and my choice of lipstick and there 5 lipstick here 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.390
 so here, too, all show 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.849
 and i will start with my really most 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.549
 bright favorites 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.739
 lipstick furniture and i am pleasantly surprised 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.190
 the quality of these lipsticks because they 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.900
 first smell that is most 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.670
 mass market lipstick goes the smell so not 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.640
 very pleasant and it is them that 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.450
 gives that is, they are not pleasant to feel 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.510
 on lips 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.840
 in this case, they smell good as 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.940
 and have some sort of cocoa with milk 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.670
 Further, these lipsticks are great for 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.829
 groups but assuming your lips are in 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.599
 good condition 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.909
 there is any lipstick on a well-groomed lip 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.040
 will go to bed well 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.750
 then I put power under that itself 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.720
 pre- moisten lips fighters 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.849
 then put on the colors amazing i chose 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:18.479
 At the moment so far two colors are 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:21.549
 9 10 and 9 121 shocking corolla he 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:25.090
 It looks like this 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.370
 between a bright pink coral but 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.020
 still coral is different here 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.370
 I have a pure coral such from 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.560
 inglot who typed i will show this 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.750
 the light really fits perfectly on 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.120
 summer when you do not want to overload 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.039
 eyes when there is no time or just 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.590
 I really don't want to paint my eyes 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.380
 shadows so that all this does not spread 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.780
 just put mascara on your eyes and 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.870
 This lipstick and face immediately looks very 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.110
 fresh well and the next color is 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.690
 electric car only i'm not sure that i 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.720
 I will wear very often and I will wear 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.270
 very such transparent on the layer but me 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.760
 I longed to have my orange lipstick 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.460
 I was not in the collection of such lipstick and 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.700
 so I chose it from the furniture here 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.000
 on the quality of me 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.000
 gave away 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.520
 my next favorite as I said 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.790
 it is inglot and color i have 104 it exactly 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.660
 coral such a shade too insane 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:31.960
 it smells delicious I don't know maybe cappuccino 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.440
 kind of in general keeps perfectly on 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.990
 lips 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.480
 perfectly moisturizes them so it is not 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.000
 gloss this lipstick is cream lipstick 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.920
 the test tube I also use for a bit 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.370
 and for evening makeup because she 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.930
 very beautiful refreshing face and therefore in 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.060
 principle i like on and in quality 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.130
 she absolutely does not emphasize any 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.140
 peeling but by persistence I can't 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.360
 say that she is super so much for example 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.320
 lipstick from meybellin that's holding on 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.320
 much longer 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.090
 the next my favorite is lip glow from 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.669
 dior 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.130
 This is such a balm that manifests 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.259
 natural hue of your lips he 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.449
 contains sleep 10 which is very important for 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.610
 summer when I for example do not want to again 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.800
 don't paint my eyes but I donâ€™t 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.500
 I want and that the lips were so 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.569
 bright as in the case with the previous 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.580
 lipstick i apply this balm 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.130
 a little bit more pink 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.960
 tint you very cool moisturizes and 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.139
 here I have it coming to an end 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.789
 In principle, everything is strong for the summer 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.770
 that's super summer I use because 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:36.770
 that it is a little cold all the same lips 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:42.469
 and one more shade it is less bright 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:46.749
 than everyone else it's raglan in my 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:49.219
 shade 070 dry this peach 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:51.169
 natural beige shade 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:54.589
 Basically, he looks on his lips too 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:57.739
 quite bright and bright of can be so 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:59.569
 say it is light but at the same time 

00:06:57.739 --> 00:07:01.879
 here is a peach such a pigment 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:03.439
 breaks and shame on the lips looks 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:06.619
 very beautiful 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:08.869
 lipstick insanely capricious in the application 

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:11.809
 these mom don't like that much 

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:13.579
 I often use it but I try everything 

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:15.379
 because it is my second 

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:17.959
 year and of course I want to at least a little bit 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:21.860
 used really gentle such 

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:23.899
 rare beautiful but very necessary 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.879
 badly applied to the lips that is even 

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:28.999
 if we put a balm even if we 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:31.669
 did peeling she starts dry lips 

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:34.039
 under the shine on rolls in folds 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:38.079
 that is, do not need to be very neat and simple 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:38.079
 apply on super perfect lips 

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:42.819
 Here is my choice for this summer 

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:45.069
 I also really want to hear what 

00:07:42.819 --> 00:07:47.589
 What choices have you chosen? 

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:51.509
 lipstick thank you all for your attention and 

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:51.509
