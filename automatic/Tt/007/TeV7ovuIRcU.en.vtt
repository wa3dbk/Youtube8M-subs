the<00:02:23.800> bubbles<00:02:24.160> rapidly<00:02:24.640> coalesce<00:02:25.150> once<00:02:25.960> they

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
the bubbles rapidly coalesce once they

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.710 
the bubbles rapidly coalesce once they

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
reach a certain size they seem to eat

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.990 
reach a certain size they seem to eat
other<00:02:29.020> bubbles<00:02:29.350> at<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.740> faster<00:02:30.370> rate<00:02:30.400> thus

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
other bubbles at a faster rate thus

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.480 
other bubbles at a faster rate thus
growing<00:02:31.450> larger<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.800> this<00:02:32.980> form<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.370> a

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
growing larger and in this form of a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.790 
growing larger and in this form of a
bubble<00:02:33.850> war<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.600> end<00:02:34.780> up<00:02:34.959> with<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.200> bipolar

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
bubble war you end up with a bipolar

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.850 
bubble war you end up with a bipolar
situation<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:37.270> two<00:02:37.480> large<00:02:37.750> bubbles<00:02:38.350> that

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
situation with two large bubbles that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.030 
situation with two large bubbles that
rapidly<00:02:39.400> eat<00:02:39.640> all<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.970> other<00:02:40.180> bubbles<00:02:40.480> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
rapidly eat all the other bubbles and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.340 
rapidly eat all the other bubbles and
eventually<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.490> get<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.760> situation<00:02:43.090> where<00:02:44.080> one

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
eventually you get a situation where one

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.850 
eventually you get a situation where one
bubble<00:02:44.740> dominates<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.700> all<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.200> other

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
bubble dominates and all the other

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.760 
bubble dominates and all the other
bubbles<00:02:48.190> are<00:02:48.720> pressed<00:02:49.720> into<00:02:49.990> an<00:02:50.380> annular

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
bubbles are pressed into an annular

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.920 
bubbles are pressed into an annular
space
