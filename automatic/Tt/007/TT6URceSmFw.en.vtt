 they need help to find something 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.960
 morning blessings 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.960
 potatoes 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.549
 the team wanted to observe the mass of 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.549
 love 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.230
 Y 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.439
 welcome to the channel many thanks 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.970
 for being here I am abrupt 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.460
 I am encouraged and we are going to talk 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.710
 taking advantage of the month of the child's day of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.930
 some series that marked us in 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 our childhood but a little bit a little 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.739
 different since we want to see what 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.750
 happened with those actors with whom 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.820
 we grew up and how do you remember this series 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.100
 called drake and george let's start 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.430
 driver was a very important actor of 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.039
 this series was born in 1986 and currently 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.250
 is 29 years old has worked a lot in 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.769
 dubbing in fact from 2012 to date 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.329
 is in ultimate spider-man a series of 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.519
 caricature and plays the role of peter 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.460
 parker has had several collaborations 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.979
 as a dubbing actor in different 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.530
 series this year the news was given to 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.630
 early this year 2015 that will 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.910
 fractured the hand had an injury and that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 he himself claimed he could not touch the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.630
 guitar more but recently we just 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.240
 see photos of him 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.880
 concerts and playing this instrument he 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.740
 same rose again pictures giving a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.930
 concert and playing the guitar then 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.180
 we think maybe it was a strategy 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.729
 advertising as an actor has not had 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.469
 great relevance more than in the dubbing the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.119
 brother of drake bell in the series is 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.229
 George and in fact in real life 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.020
 it is also called 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.000
 georges perec has the same 29 years and is 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.530
 very active in social networks although 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.630
 I did not have much participation in 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.000
 movies this year we're going to see it with a 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.100
 new material called bukovsky that is going to 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.810
 be led by james franco all 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.240
 we remember the little imp of 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.610
 megan played by miranda cosbert 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.099
 This girl has dedicated herself to singing 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.409
 acting in fact starred in a series 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.929
 called ay karl and that also had a lot 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.390
 success but after this he had no 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.630
 great participation neither in movies nor in 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.299
 series made a couple of months ago 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.060
 he was in billboard in usa his movie 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.720
 call the intruders starring 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.849
 megan or as a post we know it mega ya 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.080
 they are turning me names by 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.060
 miranda 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.160
 is that he stays so much in this role of 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.680
 megan that we saw the trailer and not 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.960
 you believe it if we felt that in some 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.950
 moment was going to be improvised dance 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.090
 or else I was going to leave with a joke 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.100
 unfortunately it is something that 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.230
 submit these actors who do so much 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.000
 time a role that stays in your mind 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.770
 that will always be the same 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.200
 and how not to remember this character 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.390
 called the crazy steve which is 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.000
 played by jerry trainor who 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.490
 after doing there are crazy tips he went to 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.100
 the icarly series where he played the role of 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.930
 spencer who is the elder brother of carl 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.400
 and unfortunately for him and for 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.130
 all because I really felt like a 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.740
 interesting actor and after this no 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.230
 he practically did nothing but calm 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.360
 this 2016 will appear in a new 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.730
 movie called nascent girls 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.310
 we will have to wait for the archrival and 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.100
 girlfriend of georg nicholls and hunmendi who 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.620
 It was played by Allison Scarlett 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.080
 and this girl after doing drake and 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.840
 josh went some series some 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.010
 known and others that seem to be more 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.349
 important for example 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.099
 there is a series of seyfi where he had great 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.329
 participation called the warehouse 13 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.329
 it really looks great this series 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.060
 it seems that it has a very important role 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.409
 and has participated in all the chapters 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.659
 he is currently working on 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.549
 a production called stickers that is 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:54.299
 another series in which it seems will have 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.940
 again a great participation that does not 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.400
 it's my business my iconic helen phrase 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.260
 girl remembers her very funny this 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.909
 actress we leave it at the end because it's the 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.190
 that surprises us not only with 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.989
 its physical transformation but because it is 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.000
 the most successful one after 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.650
 drake and george has had a great 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.280
 race after of those like 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.260
 series animation movies etc. has 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.109
 come out in series as community and father 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.329
 of family or off cup although the 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.850
 main drake and george actors 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.150
 they have had leading projects 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.539
 really none has excelled and helen 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.100
 or live has projects in which no 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.889
 is the protagonist but they are projects 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.500
 really important in the industry 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.670
 of entertainment is funny how they go 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.790
 happening things 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.550
 years success falls and the body changes not 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.980
 if we have seen it in several people already 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.070
 times in janet mcconnaughey in mind in 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.900
 several artists if they liked this guy 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.150
 of videos leave us your comments here 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.950
 down for us to do more I am abrupt 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.510
 I am me and I see you in the 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.510
 next goodbye 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.270
