keep him in the pendulum zone hopefully

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.630 
keep him in the pendulum zone hopefully
he<00:01:40.500> won't<00:01:40.590> be<00:01:40.770> popped<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.250> most<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> the

he won't be popped there most of the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.160 
he won't be popped there most of the
time<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.030> opponent<00:01:42.210> avoids<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:42.990> that
