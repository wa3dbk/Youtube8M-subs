person and that'll make your mom happy

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.229 
person and that'll make your mom happy
and<00:04:04.280> one<00:04:05.280> other<00:04:05.400> thing<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:05.790> think<00:04:05.850> this<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.120> what

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
and one other thing I think this is what

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.729 
and one other thing I think this is what
this<00:04:06.359> all<00:04:06.480> boils<00:04:06.510> down<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:06.989> if<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.260> go<00:04:07.410> into<00:04:07.620> an

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
this all boils down to if you go into an

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:08.720 
this all boils down to if you go into an
agreement<00:04:08.010> with<00:04:08.220> something<00:04:08.579> with<00:04:08.700> a

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
agreement with something with a

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.099 
agreement with something with a
pre-existing<00:04:09.090> thing<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.780> made<00:04:09.959> with

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
pre-existing thing that you made with

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.599 
pre-existing thing that you made with
your<00:04:10.200> brain<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.500> your<00:04:10.769> time<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.160> your<00:04:11.280> effort

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
your brain and your time in your effort

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:12.860 
your brain and your time in your effort
nobody<00:04:11.850> else<00:04:12.030> should<00:04:12.209> own<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.810> think

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
nobody else should own that and I think

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.660 
nobody else should own that and I think
that's<00:04:13.170> what<00:04:13.410> this<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.620> coming<00:04:14.040> down<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.250> maker

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
that's what this is coming down to maker

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.159 
that's what this is coming down to maker
put<00:04:14.820> some<00:04:14.940> time<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.359> money<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.780> effort<00:04:15.900> into

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
put some time and money and effort into

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.719 
put some time and money and effort into

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
raywilliamjohnson anything made in that

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.610 
raywilliamjohnson anything made in that
time<00:04:17.970> maker<00:04:18.239> probably<00:04:18.750> has<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:18.930> right<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.200> some

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
time maker probably has a right to some

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.710 
time maker probably has a right to some
of<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:19.950> but<00:04:20.100> anything<00:04:20.310> made<00:04:20.579> beforehand<00:04:21.150> hmm

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
of that but anything made beforehand hmm

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.149 
of that but anything made beforehand hmm
