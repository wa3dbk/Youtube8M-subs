in this video I'll be showing you how to

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.810 
in this video I'll be showing you how to
do<00:00:10.180> a<00:00:10.210> cable<00:00:10.510> cast<00:00:10.900> on<00:00:11.110> this<00:00:12.070> is<00:00:12.250> a<00:00:12.280> close

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
do a cable cast on this is a close

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.360 
do a cable cast on this is a close
cousin<00:00:13.330> of<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.629> knitted<00:00:13.959> cast<00:00:14.170> on<00:00:14.440> it's<00:00:15.219> done

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
cousin of the knitted cast on it's done

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.220 
cousin of the knitted cast on it's done
in<00:00:15.519> a<00:00:15.639> very<00:00:15.820> similar<00:00:16.209> way<00:00:16.540> just<00:00:16.840> in<00:00:16.960> a<00:00:17.020> slightly

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
in a very similar way just in a slightly

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.650 
in a very similar way just in a slightly
different<00:00:17.439> spot<00:00:18.099> so<00:00:19.000> you<00:00:19.029> want<00:00:19.210> to<00:00:19.270> start<00:00:19.480> with

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
different spot so you want to start with

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:28.470 
different spot so you want to start with
a<00:00:19.720> slipknot<00:00:23.850> now<00:00:24.850> the<00:00:24.939> first<00:00:25.390> stitch<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:27.480> done

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
a slipknot now the first stitch is done

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.580 
a slipknot now the first stitch is done
just<00:00:28.720> like<00:00:28.930> a<00:00:28.960> knitted<00:00:29.289> cast<00:00:29.500> on<00:00:31.379> you<00:00:32.379> knit

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
just like a knitted cast on you knit

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.049 
just like a knitted cast on you knit
into<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:33.340> Slipknot<00:00:33.790> and<00:00:35.640> place<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.879> new

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
into the Slipknot and place the new

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.259 
into the Slipknot and place the new
stitch<00:00:37.390> on<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:38.019> left<00:00:38.260> hand<00:00:38.500> needle<00:00:39.150> but<00:00:40.150> the

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
stitch on the left hand needle but the

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.860 
stitch on the left hand needle but the
next<00:00:40.659> stitch<00:00:41.010> comes<00:00:42.010> from<00:00:42.339> between<00:00:42.699> those<00:00:43.570> two

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
next stitch comes from between those two

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.149 
next stitch comes from between those two
existing<00:00:44.409> stitches<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.940> you<00:00:46.659> put<00:00:46.930> your<00:00:47.159> right

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
existing stitches so you put your right

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.600 
existing stitches so you put your right
hand<00:00:48.430> needle<00:00:49.379> between<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.739> two<00:00:51.369> stitches

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
hand needle between the two stitches

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.869 
hand needle between the two stitches
underneath<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.559> it<00:00:53.650> actually<00:00:53.799> goes<00:00:54.190> over<00:00:54.549> top

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
underneath so it actually goes over top

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.530 
underneath so it actually goes over top
of<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:56.290> yarn<00:00:56.890> that's<00:00:57.250> under<00:00:58.150> this<00:00:58.390> needle<00:00:58.809> and

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
of the yarn that's under this needle and

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.689 
of the yarn that's under this needle and
then<00:01:01.540> knit<00:01:01.600> into<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.350> like<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.250> regular

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
then knit into that like a regular

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.750 
then knit into that like a regular
stitch<00:01:03.970> and<00:01:04.390> place<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.560> new<00:01:05.770> stitch<00:01:06.070> on<00:01:06.549> the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
stitch and place that new stitch on the

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.590 
stitch and place that new stitch on the
left<00:01:06.970> hand<00:01:07.180> needle<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:09.490> repeat<00:01:09.880> going

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
left hand needle and you repeat going

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.130 
left hand needle and you repeat going
between<00:01:10.780> two<00:01:11.590> stitches<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:14.130> pulling<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.760> new

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
between two stitches and pulling the new

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:25.110 
between two stitches and pulling the new
stitch<00:01:17.140> through

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.700 

this<00:01:25.780> creates<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.290> pretty<00:01:26.470> firm<00:01:26.950> cast<00:01:27.400> on<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
this creates a pretty firm cast on that

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.770 
this creates a pretty firm cast on that
mimics<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.550> look<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:30.850> plain<00:01:31.480> stockinette

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
mimics the look of plain stockinette

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.240 
mimics the look of plain stockinette
pretty<00:01:32.500> well<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.440> little<00:01:35.650> firmer<00:01:35.950> than

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
pretty well it's a little firmer than

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.700 
pretty well it's a little firmer than
the<00:01:36.370> regular<00:01:36.730> knitted<00:01:37.030> cast<00:01:37.270> on<00:01:37.510> so<00:01:38.290> it's<00:01:38.470> good

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
the regular knitted cast on so it's good

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.870 
the regular knitted cast on so it's good
in<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:38.950> case<00:01:39.100> that<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.460> don't<00:01:39.610> want

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
in the case that you don't want

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:51.600 
in the case that you don't want
something<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.360> stretch<00:01:40.630> at<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.930> bottom

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.670
