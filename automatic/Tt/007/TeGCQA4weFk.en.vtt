lot of topspin and playing from the

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.430 
lot of topspin and playing from the
baseline<00:01:00.699> what<00:01:01.030> did<00:01:01.149> you<00:01:01.239> think<00:01:01.359> back<00:01:01.539> well

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
baseline what did you think back well

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.809 
baseline what did you think back well
the<00:01:02.499> one<00:01:02.649> thing<00:01:02.769> I<00:01:02.859> found<00:01:03.010> about<00:01:03.159> about<00:01:03.699> this

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
the one thing I found about about this

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.580 
the one thing I found about about this
record<00:01:04.149> and<00:01:04.239> also<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:04.899> one<00:01:05.019> I'm<00:01:05.140> also<00:01:05.289> holding

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
record and also the one I'm also holding

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.100 
record and also the one I'm also holding
which<00:01:05.799> is<00:01:05.890> obviously<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.250> pro<00:01:06.520> life<00:01:06.899> is<00:01:07.899> that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
which is obviously the pro life is that

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.929 
which is obviously the pro life is that
I<00:01:08.200> found<00:01:08.409> that<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.649> balance<00:01:09.009> was<00:01:09.219> was<00:01:09.640> split

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
I found that the balance was was split

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.190 
I found that the balance was was split
between<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.299> handle<00:01:10.659> and<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.869> head<00:01:11.020> and

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
between the handle and the head and

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.450 
between the handle and the head and
there<00:01:11.289> wasn't<00:01:11.409> much<00:01:11.560> feeling<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.189> the<00:01:12.250> middle

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
there wasn't much feeling in the middle

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.069 
there wasn't much feeling in the middle
for<00:01:12.610> me<00:01:12.640> I'd<00:01:13.210> rather<00:01:13.479> put<00:01:13.719> a<00:01:13.750> little<00:01:13.899> bit<00:01:14.020> of

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 
for me I'd rather put a little bit of

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:14.999 
for me I'd rather put a little bit of
weight<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.380> middle<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.649> both<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.890> these

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
weight in the middle of both of these

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.249 
weight in the middle of both of these
just<00:01:15.609> to<00:01:15.789> even<00:01:15.939> out<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.210> even<00:01:16.810> out<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.109> whole

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
just to even out the even out the whole

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.840 
just to even out the even out the whole
way<00:01:17.380> through<00:01:17.409> and<00:01:17.770> then<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.490> then<00:01:18.609> I<00:01:18.640> would

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
way through and then and then I would

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.190 
way through and then and then I would
probably<00:01:19.299> really<00:01:19.450> like<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:19.719> racquet<00:01:20.109> I

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
probably really like this racquet I

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.899 
probably really like this racquet I
struggled<00:01:20.890> with<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.100> difference<00:01:21.399> in<00:01:21.490> weight

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
struggled with the difference in weight

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.029 
struggled with the difference in weight
but<00:01:22.509> from<00:01:22.810> from<00:01:23.140> that<00:01:23.350> it<00:01:23.530> made<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:23.890> very

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
but from from that it made it very

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.249 
but from from that it made it very
comfortable<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.609> volleys<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.030> serving<00:01:25.390> from

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
comfortable and volleys and serving from

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.590 
comfortable and volleys and serving from
the<00:01:26.380> ground<00:01:26.619> from<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.210> baseline<00:01:28.210> with<00:01:28.450> my

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
the ground from the baseline with my

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.760 
the ground from the baseline with my
technique<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.140> found<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.409> little<00:01:29.560> bit<00:01:29.649> difficult

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
technique I found a little bit difficult

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.590 
technique I found a little bit difficult
to<00:01:30.009> get<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.189> get<00:01:30.820> through<00:01:31.060> because<00:01:31.240> I<00:01:31.420> found

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
to get to get through because I found

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.240 
to get to get through because I found
that<00:01:31.719> it<00:01:31.869> was<00:01:31.960> so<00:01:32.109> far<00:01:32.289> in<00:01:32.439> the<00:01:32.500> head<00:01:32.649> up<00:01:33.100> with

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
that it was so far in the head up with

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.830 
that it was so far in the head up with
this<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.490> up<00:01:33.670> at<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:33.820> net<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.149> serving<00:01:34.780> I

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
this and up at the net and serving I

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.599 
this and up at the net and serving I
found<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.079> racquet<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.380> be<00:01:35.469> very<00:01:35.649> solid<00:01:35.859> yeah

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
found this racquet to be very solid yeah

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.940 
found this racquet to be very solid yeah
like<00:01:37.240> she'd<00:01:37.450> like<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.840> go<00:01:38.109> back<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.320> pens<00:01:38.619> point

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
like she'd like to go back to pens point

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.130 
like she'd like to go back to pens point
about<00:01:39.310> having<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.820> racquet<00:01:40.210> weight<00:01:40.810> at<00:01:41.020> the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
about having the racquet weight at the

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.620 
about having the racquet weight at the
end<00:01:41.289> if<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.520> are<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.729> base<00:01:42.969> liner<00:01:43.299> and<00:01:43.479> you've

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
end if you are a base liner and you've

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.539 
end if you are a base liner and you've
got<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.810> big<00:01:44.020> like<00:01:44.229> windshield-wiper<00:01:44.710> forehand

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
got a big like windshield-wiper forehand

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.950 
got a big like windshield-wiper forehand
I<00:01:45.729> think<00:01:46.119> this<00:01:46.240> will<00:01:46.359> really<00:01:46.390> suit<00:01:46.749> you<00:01:46.929> just

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
I think this will really suit you just

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.080 
I think this will really suit you just
because<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.829> get<00:01:48.039> that<00:01:48.189> extra<00:01:48.490> pile<00:01:48.820> through

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
because you get that extra pile through

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.580 
because you get that extra pile through
in<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.299> extra<00:01:49.570> spin<00:01:49.840> from<00:01:50.049> having<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.409> weight

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
in the extra spin from having the weight

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.020 
in the extra spin from having the weight
at<00:01:50.829> the<00:01:50.920> tips<00:01:51.189> rather<00:01:51.460> than<00:01:51.609> put<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:51.939> the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
at the tips rather than put in the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.489 
at the tips rather than put in the
middle<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.689> does<00:01:52.869> really<00:01:53.109> come<00:01:53.289> down<00:01:53.320> to

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:53.499 
middle so it does really come down to

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.200 
middle so it does really come down to
your<00:01:53.740> technique<00:01:54.100> if<00:01:54.310> you've<00:01:54.729> got<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.060> like

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
your technique if you've got the like

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.789 
your technique if you've got the like
modern<00:01:55.570> style<00:01:55.869> technique<00:01:56.289> then<00:01:56.469> this<00:01:56.619> will

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
modern style technique then this will

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.499 
modern style technique then this will
really<00:01:57.069> see<00:01:57.249> you<00:01:57.399> husband<00:01:58.030> says<00:01:58.240> if<00:01:58.359> you've
