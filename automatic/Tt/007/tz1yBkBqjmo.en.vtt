00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.639
 we are here in a national setting 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.980
 national action program launched by TV 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.930
 that because we realize that 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.560
 it's not that a problem is neymar 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.540
 the ess is more global and that a moment 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.070
 given it is necessary that the administration and 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.550
 especially the water draw is a little 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.550
 common sense 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.030
 I thank the gia who came here 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.589
 good federation people as a first 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.260
 manifestation it's weird anyway 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.489
 now to have the label of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.589
 president of young farmers 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.909
 good it's true that I have some 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.620
 small remarks after 2 days 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.530
 already makes a good demo why like 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.610
 that's pretty funny, but at least 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.989
 like that at least it shows 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.119
 our fat guy already 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.579
 the administration we have the director of 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.680
 ddt who's there his deputy director 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.080
 so at least that way they come to see 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.060
 they come to find that low before 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.590
 concur the water does not flow there 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.240
 now the water initially be a little 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.890
 fed up now have to clear well so 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.030
 I hope now this little 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.430
 action even this great action 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.960
 is going to see a little unlock all 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.040
 situations of farmers who can 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.040
 not cure their drainage ditches 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.160
 it's really seeing that we are not 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.900
 a case where we have a ditch at 30 cm yes we have 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.780
 two possibilities of false is clear 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.270
 not there with about have little to see one 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.100
 can have between 45 and 50 centimeters of 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.970
 unevenness in that it flows as is 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.700
 he there too 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.720
 but this is earth is because 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.860
 maybe we'll be there it's part of 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.430
 in fact just now we were talking about 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.340
 interview the candidates balsillie clan 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.070
 and at that point clearly we are on 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.330
 precise points against spoke there you 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.119
 we call we made room we must 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.960
 actually that routine maintenance does not 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.500
 not enough to restore circulation 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.740
 so there sure we will determine a 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.600
 length to the team is necessary on 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.650
 can quite try to clean and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.650
 pick up and find total 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.650
 abstraction 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.650
 no 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.129
 of which 3,4 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.510
 the fdsea of seine-et-marne were in 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.880
 action this morning on the ground for 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.710
 denounce the problematic of 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.960
 floods and the inability to 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.910
 clean our streams and and our 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.890
 ditches and so as part of a 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.240
 national action led by the fnsea us 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.100
 have responded here I thank 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.420
 all the members who took 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.680
 moved to the field to do the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.350
 finding that we must bring now 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.240
 quickly solutions 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.300
 the presence of all the executives 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.640
 ddt leaders allowed us 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.200
 to have a pedagogical approach and 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.180
 explanations from the very example 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.850
 very concrete terrain is so 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.800
 the goal was to show that our 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.690
 calls to the reason was completely 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.160
 founded and that today it will have to 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.000
 now bring solutions 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.080
 so the short term goal is this 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.850
 famous document that will allow 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.410
 to explain to farmers what are 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.209
 their rights and duties in terms 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.020
 maintenance of ditches and courses 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.720
 water 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.340
 and then in the medium term to be able to 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.739
 to have a real smart policy 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.850
 so that everyone can practice his 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.040
 profession in the best conditions 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.450
 after several dry years we have 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.340
 now rather rainy years 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.769
 and voters can not accept 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.950
 to be the adjustment variable of a 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.989
 policy of organizing the flows of 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.140
 bodies of water that are to their detriment 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.340
 so here I am rather satisfied with 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.260
 this event which still has a 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.239
 times been constructive and educational and 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.530
 which will allow I hope to find 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.530
 solutions for all 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.980
