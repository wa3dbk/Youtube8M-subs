gigabyte model does not come with the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.690 
gigabyte model does not come with the
hard<00:01:25.049> driving<00:01:25.439> closer<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.040> need<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> put<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
hard driving closer you need to put it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.760 
hard driving closer you need to put it
into<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> PlayStation<00:01:27.720> 3<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.560> you're<00:01:28.680> gonna

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
into the PlayStation 3 so you're gonna

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.920 
into the PlayStation 3 so you're gonna
have<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.979> order<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.579> separately<00:01:30.479> which<00:01:30.720> is

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
have to order that separately which is

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.800 
have to order that separately which is
an<00:01:31.079> extra<00:01:31.680> cost<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.000> factor<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.600> in

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
an extra cost so if you factor that in

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.999 
an extra cost so if you factor that in
that<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.140> still<00:01:34.320> cheaper<00:01:34.740> than<00:01:34.890> going

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that it's still cheaper than going

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.730 
that it's still cheaper than going
another<00:01:35.280> way<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:36.210> yes<00:01:36.450> definitely<00:01:36.960> go<00:01:37.560> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
another way then yes definitely go that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.890 
another way then yes definitely go that
