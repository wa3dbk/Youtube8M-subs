00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.450
 to retort in a while then it will take 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.200
 some more patience before 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.270

 at the window a basin has arrived there 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:43.880
 hello for the recipe of the pettole ci 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.509
 serve 250 g of 00 flour a teaspoon 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.840
 of oil based on the weight of the flour 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.840
 we put about 70 percent of 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.840
 hot water so in this case it will go 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.950
 about 175 thousand toe 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.450
 half a bun of brewer's yeast and a 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.179
 teaspoon of salt 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.250
 all will come here of the robot 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:11.720
 for those who know that no loot can 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:16.069
 do it also by hand for those of you at 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:22.099
 babies puts on three minutes on the 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:25.130
 spike and fabia ending up in the head for whom 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.890
 does not have the bimby I think a 5 anyway 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:32.030
 kneading minutes then you have to see 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.840
 you, however, is a dough that is always whipped 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.319
 true because it remains 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.540
 rather liquid now you see I am 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.760
 past 3 minutes 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.560
 the dough is like this 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.060
 now our chef will show you 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.060
 good consistency 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:55.470
 the advice to remove it from then 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:03:00.840
 common understanding why and a lot 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.840
 soft here is the consistency you see 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.510
 so below do not put in oil and 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:19.540
 flour in my interior under the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:21.790
 basin or ok this is the concoction e 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.160
 how much we put it to rest for the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.769
 leavening at least two three hours 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.790
 at least two or three hours we see between two 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:33.900
 or three hours for cooking 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:39.010
 this is the leavened mixture 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:43.569
 very mushy it had all strength and springs 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.040
 also before and this is the and the technique of 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.040
 vito that you liked so much another 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.319
 time when he made the panzerotti of 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.750
 the current veil and oil foil 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.260
 sunflower seeds today you have seeds 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.220
 wish 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.220
 I do not know 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:05.400
 a hair in in that you have to 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:09.439
 leave it because it gives flavor and branches beyond 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.870
 the whole and nothing the oil wait for that 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.970
 the beautiful powerful temperature here 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.389
 keeps telling you this thing from the do you 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:22.410
 see to collect the dough you need 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.350
 take with a dipped spoon 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.510
 in the water so that being 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.000
 sticky does not send the 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.710
 spoon instead with water it slips me 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.510
 I recommend you let it drain well 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:40.199
 be warned written in black and who it is 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:43.919
 who told you this secret didn't 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.900
 he says life said the secret no no no 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.820
 okay we will tell you in 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.919
 this recipe is practically that of 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.479
 my mother-in-law we make a recipe of 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:59.699
 my mother-in-law and therefore invitation is used to 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:02.639
 eat the major no eat the 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.289
 so pot in this way yes i 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.860
 our videos always come out style 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.710
 rebus 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.570
 so if there is any other Apulian 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.820
 because I know there are below and i 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.849
 pugliesi and someone says that it is added 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:18.199

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:25.710
 he said who is who in said salutes 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:29.789
 I don't know how much my house is 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:38.639
 temperature the oil does not notice why 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:41.190
 we know how to do a bit of city ​​crack style 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:46.229
 6 by inventing things we turn off and 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.390
 let's see after you almost whine please 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:53.360
 but he also has it 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:06:02.180
 drained for good we take a small piece 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:05.280
 I could not let you see well 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.730
 this is my thing to help you with 2 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:14.900
 teaspoons instead of a finger 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.900
 once you wanted with her like fingers 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.350
 and I can't make him see it 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.050
 show take the form of a 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:32.060
 duvet ball more or less it takes 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.060
 fantasy to say the ball 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:42.830
 here is the result provided by the gods 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:46.830
 bibs explained because we are 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.920
 practically they are so soft 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:53.100
 but we are crunchy in this case 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.040
 we eat salty and if you want enough 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.720
 take some sugar and pass them inside 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.260
 maybe I'll show you later if you do 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.690
 advances some not think anyway 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.670
 just roll them in sugar yes 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:12.150
 attacks sugar and can also 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:14.670
 be a sweet we hope there is 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:18.260
