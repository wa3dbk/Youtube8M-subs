00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
to be honest it's not the first and the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.430 
to be honest it's not the first and the
only<00:02:46.760> African<00:02:47.510> populations<00:02:47.990> where<00:02:48.140> it's<00:02:48.260> like

everybody's on the street everybody's in
the<00:02:55.730> stadium<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.960> moment<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.380> host<00:02:57.560> nation

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
the stadium in a moment the host nation

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.190 
the stadium in a moment the host nation
goes<00:02:58.130> out<00:02:58.340> then<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.300> gets<00:02:59.450> much<00:02:59.720> more<00:02:59.990> quiet

obviously the Dark Horse because Molly

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.580 
obviously the Dark Horse because Molly
has<00:03:55.820> a<00:03:56.030> very<00:03:56.269> very<00:03:56.480> physical<00:03:56.989> team<00:03:57.200> very<00:03:57.530> well

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
has a very very physical team very well

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.699 
has a very very physical team very well
organized<00:03:58.190> I<00:03:58.489> actually<00:03:59.030> go<00:03:59.510> against<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.530> run

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
organized I actually go against the run

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.670 
organized I actually go against the run
I<00:04:00.890> would<00:04:01.130> go<00:04:01.310> for<00:04:01.340> Molly<00:04:01.730> in<00:04:01.940> this<00:04:02.090> one<00:04:02.300> in<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
I would go for Molly in this one in the

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.470 
I would go for Molly in this one in the
second<00:04:03.680> semi-final<00:04:03.920> Darla<00:04:04.850> really<00:04:05.150> didn't

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
second semi-final Darla really didn't

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.020 
second semi-final Darla really didn't
perform<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:06.200> well<00:04:06.260> over<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.519> tournament

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
perform that well over the tournament

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.640 
perform that well over the tournament
but<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.690> think<00:04:08.989> when<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:09.260> comes<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.560> the

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
but I think when it comes to the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.040 
but I think when it comes to the
potential<00:04:10.070> and<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.489> individual<00:04:11.090> skill<00:04:11.420> Ghana

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
potential and the individual skill Ghana

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.770 
potential and the individual skill Ghana
is<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.410> better<00:04:12.590> side<00:04:12.830> I<00:04:13.160> would<00:04:13.940> probably<00:04:14.420> go

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
is the better side I would probably go

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.710 
is the better side I would probably go
for<00:04:14.840> Ghana<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.709> in<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.190> final<00:04:16.480> you<00:04:17.480> won't

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
for Ghana and in the final you won't

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.810 
for Ghana and in the final you won't
believe<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.169> but<00:04:18.200> I<00:04:18.620> see<00:04:19.130> Molly<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.609> my

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
believe it but I see Molly is my

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.510 
believe it but I see Molly is my
favorite<00:04:20.269> maybe<00:04:21.049> also<00:04:21.380> because<00:04:21.590> I<00:04:22.190> have<00:04:22.490> a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
favorite maybe also because I have a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.029 
favorite maybe also because I have a
little<00:04:22.760> thing<00:04:23.060> for<00:04:23.090> Molly<00:04:23.479> because<00:04:23.960> I'm<00:04:24.200> well

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039
