so<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.439> must<00:00:19.680> say<00:00:19.830> just<00:00:20.250> because<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.699> slim

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
so and I must say just because it's slim

so and I must say just because it's slim
doesn't<00:00:21.510> mean<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.930> gives<00:00:22.080> up<00:00:22.230> any<00:00:22.439> type

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
doesn't mean that it gives up any type

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.710 
doesn't mean that it gives up any type
of<00:00:22.859> protection<00:00:23.160> whatsoever<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.330> called

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the hard drop active case for a reason

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.890 
the hard drop active case for a reason
so<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.910> case<00:00:27.090> itself<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> made<00:00:27.720> at<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
so the case itself is made at a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.630 
so the case itself is made at a
two-piece<00:00:28.410> material<00:00:29.039> on<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> inside<00:00:29.519> you

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
two-piece material on the inside you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.150 
two-piece material on the inside you
have<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> soft<00:00:30.210> TPU<00:00:30.510> rubber-like<00:00:31.439> material<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
have a soft TPU rubber-like material and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.760 
have a soft TPU rubber-like material and
the<00:00:32.219> outside<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.030> hard<00:00:33.300> cover<00:00:33.570> pc<00:00:34.170> material

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the outside is a hard cover pc material

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.990 
the outside is a hard cover pc material
now<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.130> take<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> closer<00:00:35.579> look<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
now if you take a closer look on the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.790 
now if you take a closer look on the
inside<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.450> case<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.870> all<00:00:37.050> four<00:00:37.440> corners

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
inside of the case on all four corners

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.200 
inside of the case on all four corners
you've<00:00:38.040> got<00:00:38.160> something<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:38.610> call<00:00:39.000> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
you've got something that they call the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
you've got something that they call the
airspace<00:00:39.870> structure<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.399> actually

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
airspace structure this is actually

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
airspace structure this is actually
gonna<00:00:41.850> help<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.360> any<00:00:42.600> type<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.110> eggs<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:43.530> buck

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
gonna help with any type of eggs or buck

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.580

so<00:00:44.730> any<00:00:45.030> internal<00:00:45.600> damage<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.050> may<00:00:46.200> occur<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
so any internal damage that may occur to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.080 
so any internal damage that may occur to
your<00:00:46.710> phone<00:00:46.890> from<00:00:47.039> dropping<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
your phone from dropping it this is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.889 
your phone from dropping it this is
gonna<00:00:48.239> help<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.510> that

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
gonna help with that

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
gonna help with that
hence<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.350> hard<00:00:49.590> drop<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.039> its<00:00:50.190> name<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.700> this

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
hence the hard drop in its name so this

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.220 
hence the hard drop in its name so this
case<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.030> actually<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.539> bit<00:00:51.719> different<00:00:52.140> from

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
case is actually a bit different from

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.200 
case is actually a bit different from
most<00:00:52.500> other<00:00:52.739> cases<00:00:53.190> as<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.120> it's

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
most other cases as you see here it's

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.720 
most other cases as you see here it's
got<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> slight<00:00:54.899> curvature<00:00:55.410> designed<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
got a slight curvature designed to it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.670 
got a slight curvature designed to it
which<00:00:57.120> actually<00:00:57.449> fits<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.899> your<00:00:57.989> hand<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.410> bit

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
which actually fits in your hand a bit

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
which actually fits in your hand a bit
better<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.250> does<00:00:59.489> give<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> phone<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> little

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
better but does give the phone a little

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.549 
better but does give the phone a little
bit<00:01:00.719> more<00:01:00.960> whiff

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
bit more whiff

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.139 
bit more whiff
this<00:01:01.829> actually<00:01:02.039> isn't<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.520> bad<00:01:02.550> thing<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
this actually isn't a bad thing and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
this actually isn't a bad thing and
gives<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.570> an<00:01:03.660> overall<00:01:03.989> better<00:01:04.320> grip<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
gives it an overall better grip to the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.440 
gives it an overall better grip to the
phone<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> case<00:01:05.880> itself<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.360> be

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
phone so the case itself can be

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.120 
phone so the case itself can be
purchased<00:01:06.869> alone<00:01:07.170> or<00:01:07.409> could<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.740> purchased

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
purchased alone or could be purchased

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.649 
purchased alone or could be purchased
with<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.430> belt<00:01:08.700> holster<00:01:08.970> which<00:01:09.390> also

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
with this belt holster which also

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.750 
with this belt holster which also
doubles<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.290> kickstand<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.549> pretty

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
doubles as a kickstand this is pretty

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
doubles as a kickstand this is pretty
neat<00:01:12.030> because<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.479> does<00:01:12.689> have<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.170> few

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
neat because it does have a few

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.200 
neat because it does have a few
different<00:01:13.950> positions<00:01:14.369> which<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.880> lay<00:01:15.060> it

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
different positions which you can lay it

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
different positions which you can lay it
at<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.990> being<00:01:16.320> almost<00:01:16.830> straight<00:01:17.130> up<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.580> then

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
at one being almost straight up and then

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.370 
at one being almost straight up and then
a<00:01:17.820> few<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.090> notches<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.869> lay<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
a few other notches to lay it down a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
a few other notches to lay it down a
little<00:01:19.650> bit<00:01:19.890> more<00:01:20.159> than<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.580> once<00:01:21.060> you're

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
little bit more than that once you're

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
little bit more than that once you're
done<00:01:21.270> using<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.689> belt<00:01:21.869> hose<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.320> kickstand

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
done using the belt hose as a kickstand

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.289 
done using the belt hose as a kickstand
you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.159> lay<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.400> flat<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you can lay it flat so that it's out of

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.969 
you can lay it flat so that it's out of
your<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:24.540> as<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.320> performance<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
your way as for the performance of the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.920 
your way as for the performance of the
case<00:01:26.220> everything<00:01:26.700> pretty<00:01:27.030> much<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.540> works
