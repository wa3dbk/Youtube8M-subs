00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.960
 now you can see the voice too 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.240
 the reporter 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.250
 from alex kunz with me your conclusion to the 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.170
 today's game's outstanding imagination 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.580
 the fischtown penguin takes it to you 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.900
 no time of play from the rest 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.180
 bring in spite of the many 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.130
 Of course, a shortfall situation 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.570
 towering 10 villa the runner 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.220
 a lot of energy on the ice 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.919
 and of course with one 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.200
 failed to score 3 1 was rewarded 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.579
 you as a neutral observer think what 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.260
 you go there this season then for 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.610
 fischtown pinguins so if you 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.850
 play defensively as well as you do today 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.620
 including a jonas langmann ever 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.390
 if you come back or not 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.370
 I'm sure she's defensive well 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.710
 of course are not offered 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.089
 strong team especially in the majority 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.339
 if you stay away from the punishment bank 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:53.260
 I'm sure I can 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.260
 the title defense in it 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.450
 a satisfied captain at micro 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.900
 mariangela your assessment for 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.660
 today's game yes we it was a tough one 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.060
 fight until the end hannes 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.990
 stone also better cutters and know 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.940
 but stayed cool 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.050
 we got away from the aggressive 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.360
 not even today in play 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.729
 let's bring our boots there 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.830
 always played at the right time 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.250
 made the gates and I think deserves 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.380
 won 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.729
 the situation when you go to the stadium 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.259
 come in and all the paperbacks because of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.570
 that probably makes you special 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.770
 more or the distant view something 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.289
 come up with a good mood 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 that is good and if in the 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.009
 team or the fans against one 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.970
 are then then can clean that too 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.330
 push yes that's right 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.280
 what do you say to ask in the finale yes so 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.920
 like last year has home advantage 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.050
 Although changed has changed but we 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.429
 We are happy that we are against 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.050
 play in the final again 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.820
 can and be happy and then prepare 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.360
 we are already back ahead again 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.800
 finale and full throttle on 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.840
 satisfied mike stewart is with me on 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.130
 Microphone congratulations on the victory as is 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.800
 The game from his point of view is like this 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.759
 like that often we have to be completely honest 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.640
 have known that frankfurts will 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:17.310
 come out and put pressure immediately but 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.530
 the boys have very quiet jonas langmann 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.660
 a paste made so far and me 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.280
 We think we had four breaks today 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.450
 couple two against one situations though 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.319
 ultimately our experience 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.319
 I believe and our class has us 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.959
 helped today and that is the case with the 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.280
 Key to us success today 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.720
 now it is in the final against again 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.520
 Gegigheim this time not with Heimrecht 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.760
 please no it has been damn strong 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.560
 loved both times how do you estimate 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.440
 This series is again as hard as 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.569
 against frankfurt 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.920
 of course very difficult but if in it 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.560
 of ice hockey philosophy 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.670
 it is also our world what please no 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.810
 play against frankfurt play after North 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.349
 south hockey bodyweight hockey 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.260
 very aggressive much pressure bidigheimer 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.980
 is open 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.810
 they are very gifted they can be very 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.790
 fast team frankfurt is great 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.909
 and strong but not nearly so 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.250
 fast as bidding home and so we have to 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.180
 a few small things change with us 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.439
 and then we will go on the attack 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.909
 they have one with david lee 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.980
 excellent player too justin kelly 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.439
 both very very strong even now in the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.719
 series that will turn off I think 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.510
 had with one of the key concerns male 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:42.569
 yes, if we look at the whole thing 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.969
 three rows of bidigheim at the 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.879
 all very strong or run very good 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:50.310
 talented in the defense you have 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.760
 improved in this area in the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.489
 compared to the last season and it will be 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.120
 Hard work but I know something 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.230
 can do my boys and we will 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.719
 prepare us well 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.749
 During this break we will do well 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:11.040
 mixa that was that was against it 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:14.939
 frankfurt will enjoy the time and 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.230
 analyze a few videos and we 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.940
 will be ready 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.989
 Two questions I still have the first 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.570
 question is if usually pretty bad 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.680
 was probably pretty bad too 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.940
 I hope to enjoy it again soon 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.710
 probably not these anymore 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.180
 season hard to say 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.970
 In all honesty it is possible that he 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.970
 not coming back it was whole 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:41.810
 Acting bitterly with intention 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:45.720
 he was a concussion and came 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.910
 whiplash this week will be 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.200
 only more we will always observe 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.600
 non stated our medical team talking 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.150
 Case on the spot looked very bad 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.630
 the good thing is 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.730
 so played excellently today and 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.820
 we have two very strong very strong 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.860
 goalies still with us next question 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.550
 what do you say to the window for electricity 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.280
 penguins even really you always think 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.710
 back and forth every two days a user in the 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.230
 It is not the same in the end and we are 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.080
 appreciate it a lot frankfurt 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.720
 brutally loud but still you have us 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:30.540
 our fans always heard and this 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:33.630
 energy it is resistant against our 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.070
 opponents in foreign halls and me and 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.690
 all our whole team we 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.690
 very much appreciate that very much
