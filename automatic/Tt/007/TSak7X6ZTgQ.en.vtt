 digital football welcome to the new 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.610
 episode debacle yanqui for white series 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.160
 where players talked about the game 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.960
 that they touch to me and then it was raffled in the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
 four better the value of the four 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.260
 best obviously in all 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.690
 platforms you already know to participate is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.850
 very easy to stop our like and er's 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.070
 a tweet that I'll post when you upload this 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.720
 video and well let's go there we will not see 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.000
 with what players do we have to play in this 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:51.000
 episode come first about griezmann in 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 the cover and how many players 2.076 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.690
 three good players let's put the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.690
 second about higuaín on the cover 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:12.780
 because the red way by worked 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:12.780
 quite with the go 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.670
 to some goalkeeper and let's see 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.100
 a lamb because we already have the equipment 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.780
 whole so now I just need to earn it 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.190
 but present is the team but the one 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.340
 we have to play and the truth is that 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.910
 he's done shit I do not have chemistry 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.470
 obviously chemistry is quite low 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.910
 I have a doorman at least at least 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.550
 I have a janitor who has seven chemistry 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.060
 because with a defense I do not have sides 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.310
 neither right nor left in position then 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.520
 humans that the defenses that has 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.110
 I have not spoken and I have 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 riff-raff as on the left 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.750
 we have the mist that is going quite well and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.120
 we will have here what I do not dislike 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.590
 more or less good front without chemistry 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.240
 and such but what they like are pretty 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.040
 fast and I think how to do something 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.750
 but good to the center of the field yes that 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:19.560
 it's disastrous I do not have neither at times nor 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.540
 mcd is neither m2 has not left me like this 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.050
 not to play with three strikers in 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:31.200
 the 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:32.490
 the pace that has put the strikers 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.280
 that have a little bit better 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.540
 physical 78 and 79 physical although they have little 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.520
 defense of forwards to the mc I have put at 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.520
 that has more passion than those who have 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.970
 over 72 that the Korean gentleman 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.370
 so good gentlemen is what there is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.810
 these series like that and you know, it's not going to 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.630
 get to them dominant will not get 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.820
 at 20,000 coins so in this 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.120
 episode we will draw 20,000 coins to 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.120
 shoot 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.430

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.660

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.939
