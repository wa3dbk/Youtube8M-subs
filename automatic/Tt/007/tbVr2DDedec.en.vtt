00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
guys enjoyed this tutorial it's really

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.840 
guys enjoyed this tutorial it's really
simple<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.620> just<00:04:07.860> didn't<00:04:08.160> mind<00:04:08.310> like<00:04:08.550> in<00:04:08.730> about

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
simple I just didn't mind like in about

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.350 
simple I just didn't mind like in about
what<00:04:09.209> two<00:04:09.510> minutes<00:04:09.720> o<00:04:10.220> 1l<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.910> hardest<00:04:12.239> part

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
what two minutes o 1l the hardest part

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.830 
what two minutes o 1l the hardest part
is<00:04:12.630> done<00:04:13.230> it's<00:04:13.620> like<00:04:13.890> my

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
is done it's like my

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.629 
is done it's like my
the<00:04:14.930> pan<00:04:15.170> is<00:04:15.200> this<00:04:15.650> month<00:04:15.890> because<00:04:16.220> I<00:04:16.459> actually

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
the pan is this month because I actually

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.340 
the pan is this month because I actually
draw<00:04:17.030> with<00:04:17.209> this<00:04:17.389> month<00:04:17.600> right<00:04:17.840> with<00:04:18.019> this<00:04:18.139> one

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
draw with this month right with this one

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.580 
draw with this month right with this one
so<00:04:18.530> it's<00:04:18.680> harder<00:04:19.010> doing<00:04:19.639> this<00:04:19.959> but<00:04:20.959> it<00:04:21.260> just

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
so it's harder doing this but it just

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.100 
so it's harder doing this but it just
takes<00:04:21.739> practice<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.550> that<00:04:23.030> was<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:23.570> for<00:04:23.630> the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
takes practice and that was it for the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.129 
takes practice and that was it for the
smells<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:25.220> was<00:04:25.370> really<00:04:25.699> simple<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.419> as<00:04:26.750> I

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
smells it was really simple and as I

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.860 
smells it was really simple and as I
said<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:28.130> Sharpie<00:04:28.790> will<00:04:28.970> not<00:04:29.180> fall<00:04:29.419> out<00:04:29.449> I've

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
said the Sharpie will not fall out I've

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.740 
said the Sharpie will not fall out I've
tried<00:04:30.229> it<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.620> it<00:04:31.010> will<00:04:31.389> when<00:04:32.389> you<00:04:32.479> want<00:04:32.690> to
