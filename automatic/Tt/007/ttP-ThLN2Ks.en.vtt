on this kind of Frisco style tank you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.810 
on this kind of Frisco style tank you
know<00:02:15.200> something<00:02:15.620> that's<00:02:15.740> high<00:02:15.980> mounted<00:02:16.550> and

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
know something that's high mounted and

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.870 
know something that's high mounted and
it's<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.690> know<00:02:17.720> small<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:19.220> down<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
it's you know small just down to the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.360 
it's you know small just down to the
bare<00:02:20.180> minimum<00:02:20.420> style<00:02:20.990> gas<00:02:21.320> tank<00:02:21.680> there's

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
bare minimum style gas tank there's

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.920 
bare minimum style gas tank there's
several<00:02:22.640> different<00:02:22.790> ways<00:02:23.240> we<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.720> go<00:02:23.780> about

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
several different ways we can go about

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.320 
several different ways we can go about
this<00:02:24.440> we<00:02:24.890> could<00:02:25.070> use<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.580> tank<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.060> we<00:02:26.120> could

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
this we could use this tank and we could

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.030 
this we could use this tank and we could
cut<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.630> all<00:02:26.750> apart<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.290> cut<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.590> bottom<00:02:27.890> out

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
cut it all apart and cut the bottom out

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.060 
cut it all apart and cut the bottom out
of<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.580> make<00:02:29.150> all<00:02:29.330> new<00:02:29.540> mounts<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.230> fix

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
of it and make all new mounts and fix

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.070 
of it and make all new mounts and fix
all<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.430> dents<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.000> change<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.570> cap<00:02:32.810> and

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
all the dents and change the cap and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.290 
all the dents and change the cap and
everything<00:02:33.740> but<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.550> reality<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:35.210> would

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
everything but in reality it would

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.810 
everything but in reality it would
probably<00:02:35.660> be<00:02:36.200> easier<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.830> start<00:02:37.100> from<00:02:37.580> scratch

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
probably be easier to start from scratch

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.540 
probably be easier to start from scratch
and<00:02:38.180> make<00:02:38.630> it<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.200> way<00:02:39.320> we<00:02:39.500> want<00:02:39.709> it<00:02:39.860> right

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
and make it the way we want it right

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.080 
and make it the way we want it right
from<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.940> get-go<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:42.740> know<00:02:42.860> usually<00:02:43.280> with

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
from the get-go so you know usually with

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.380 
from the get-go so you know usually with
sheetmetal<00:02:44.450> work<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:46.400> separate<00:02:46.970> your<00:02:47.209> work

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
sheetmetal work you separate your work

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.050 
sheetmetal work you separate your work
into<00:02:47.630> pieces<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.980> work<00:02:49.190> is<00:02:49.400> usually<00:02:49.580> pieced

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
into pieces the work is usually pieced

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.780 
into pieces the work is usually pieced
out<00:02:50.270> where<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.750> most<00:02:51.050> extreme<00:02:51.650> radius<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.430> so

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
out where the most extreme radius is so

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.780 
out where the most extreme radius is so
this<00:02:53.300> curve<00:02:53.690> here<00:02:54.320> is<00:02:54.470> where<00:02:55.400> we<00:02:55.550> have<00:02:55.760> the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
this curve here is where we have the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.890 
this curve here is where we have the
most<00:02:56.120> extreme<00:02:56.630> radius<00:02:57.140> so<00:02:58.480> what<00:02:59.480> we<00:02:59.600> should<00:02:59.660> do

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
most extreme radius so what we should do

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.710 
most extreme radius so what we should do
is<00:03:00.050> try<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.380> make<00:03:00.560> some<00:03:00.860> patterns<00:03:01.310> off<00:03:01.580> of<00:03:01.790> this

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.860 

we<00:03:06.380> just<00:03:06.560> uses<00:03:06.950> this<00:03:07.160> regular<00:03:07.640> regular<00:03:08.600> tissue

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
we just uses this regular regular tissue

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.470 
we just uses this regular regular tissue
paper<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.650> some<00:03:09.920> magnets<00:03:10.430> it's<00:03:11.150> pretty

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
paper and some magnets it's pretty

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.320 
paper and some magnets it's pretty
simple<00:03:12.340> now<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.430> tissue<00:03:13.610> paper<00:03:13.760> I'll<00:03:14.090> almost

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
simple now the tissue paper I'll almost

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.020 
simple now the tissue paper I'll almost
use<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.260> same<00:03:15.530> exact<00:03:16.010> thing<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.310> meta<00:03:16.730> will

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
use the same exact thing that meta will

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.070 
use the same exact thing that meta will
do<00:03:17.240> you<00:03:17.450> know<00:03:17.570> it'll<00:03:17.840> only<00:03:18.200> it'll<00:03:18.860> only<00:03:19.250> lay<00:03:19.490> a

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
do you know it'll only it'll only lay a

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.810 
do you know it'll only it'll only lay a
flat<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.470> certain<00:03:21.860> extent<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.490> where<00:03:22.700> the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
flat to a certain extent and where the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.000 
flat to a certain extent and where the
tissue<00:03:23.000> paper<00:03:23.180> wrinkles<00:03:23.960> up<00:03:24.170> or<00:03:24.620> where<00:03:24.920> it

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
tissue paper wrinkles up or where it

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.130 
tissue paper wrinkles up or where it
overlaps<00:03:25.520> that's<00:03:26.060> exactly<00:03:26.540> where<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.840> metal

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
overlaps that's exactly where the metal

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.750 
overlaps that's exactly where the metal
is<00:03:27.200> going<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.410> need<00:03:27.800> to<00:03:27.890> be<00:03:28.040> shrunken<00:03:28.610> or

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
is going to need to be shrunken or

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.900 
is going to need to be shrunken or
stretch<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.390> fit<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.810> we<00:03:29.870> kind<00:03:30.110> of<00:03:30.910> manipulate

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
stretch to fit and we kind of manipulate

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.720 
stretch to fit and we kind of manipulate
it<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.360> get<00:03:33.020> it<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.170> fold<00:03:33.590> over<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:34.490> I<00:03:34.670> know

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
it and get it to fold over and I know

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.080 
it and get it to fold over and I know
that'll<00:03:35.210> kind<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.570> tell<00:03:35.750> us<00:03:35.780> later<00:03:36.200> on<00:03:36.320> where

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
that'll kind of tell us later on where

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.140 
that'll kind of tell us later on where
the<00:03:38.090> metals<00:03:38.480> gonna<00:03:39.130> need<00:03:40.130> some<00:03:40.400> work<00:03:40.640> done<00:03:40.880> to

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
the metals gonna need some work done to

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.230 
the metals gonna need some work done to
it<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:42.440> now<00:03:42.470> we've<00:03:42.770> got<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.130> top<00:03:43.310> it's<00:03:43.730> laid<00:03:44.030> on

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
it so now we've got the top it's laid on

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.650 
it so now we've got the top it's laid on
pretty<00:03:44.690> flat<00:03:45.220> so<00:03:46.220> what<00:03:46.370> we<00:03:46.490> need<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.700> do<00:03:46.880> is

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
pretty flat so what we need to do is

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.780 
pretty flat so what we need to do is
kind<00:03:47.990> of<00:03:48.170> simulate<00:03:48.680> where<00:03:49.040> we<00:03:49.250> would<00:03:49.460> want<00:03:49.700> to

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
kind of simulate where we would want to

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.460 
kind of simulate where we would want to
weld<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.180> or<00:03:50.330> where<00:03:50.480> we<00:03:50.630> use<00:03:50.750> one<00:03:50.960> to<00:03:51.080> cut<00:03:51.320> the

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
weld it or where we use one to cut the

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.930 
weld it or where we use one to cut the
material<00:03:51.670> leaving<00:03:52.670> probably<00:03:53.390> an<00:03:54.610> extra<00:03:55.610> inch

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
material leaving probably an extra inch

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.670 
material leaving probably an extra inch
or<00:03:56.210> so<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.630> weld<00:03:56.840> will<00:03:57.080> probably<00:03:57.440> end<00:03:57.560> up

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
or so the weld will probably end up

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.380 
or so the weld will probably end up
being<00:03:57.740> here<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.310> middle<00:03:58.580> let's<00:03:59.000> make<00:03:59.240> another

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
being here the middle let's make another

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.850 
being here the middle let's make another
mark<00:03:59.900> on<00:04:00.680> this<00:04:01.060> pattern<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:02.650> before<00:04:03.650> the

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
mark on this pattern that before the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.430 
mark on this pattern that before the
radius<00:04:04.280> starts<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:05.450> know<00:04:05.570> before<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.140> metal

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
radius starts you know before the metal

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.040 
radius starts you know before the metal
starts<00:04:06.740> to<00:04:06.890> curve<00:04:07.160> our<00:04:07.400> bird<00:04:07.700> on<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.690> edge<00:04:08.840> of

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
starts to curve our bird on the edge of

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.530 
starts to curve our bird on the edge of
the<00:04:09.140> tank<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:10.489> that'll<00:04:10.790> show<00:04:10.820> us<00:04:11.180> when<00:04:11.390> we're

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
the tank and that'll show us when we're

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.080 
the tank and that'll show us when we're
shrinking<00:04:12.050> it<00:04:12.230> how<00:04:12.890> deep<00:04:13.250> we<00:04:13.459> need<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.730> go<00:04:13.880> in

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
shrinking it how deep we need to go in

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.380 
shrinking it how deep we need to go in
with<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.480> dies<00:04:15.100> will<00:04:16.100> kind<00:04:16.340> of<00:04:16.430> be<00:04:16.520> our<00:04:16.700> little

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
with the dies will kind of be our little

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.960 
with the dies will kind of be our little
guide<00:04:17.890> always<00:04:18.890> give<00:04:19.100> yourself<00:04:19.250> about<00:04:19.790> an

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
guide always give yourself about an

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.849 
guide always give yourself about an
extra<00:04:20.330> inch<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.720> material<00:04:21.169> that<00:04:21.290> you<00:04:21.350> can<00:04:21.620> trim

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
extra inch of material that you can trim

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.710 
extra inch of material that you can trim
off<00:04:21.890> because<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.760> good<00:04:23.000> part<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.419> metal

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
off because a good part of the metal

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.560 
off because a good part of the metal
will<00:04:23.870> be<00:04:23.900> distorted<00:04:24.560> from<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.890> machines

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.050 

add<00:04:28.170> an<00:04:28.500> extra<00:04:28.800> quarter<00:04:29.130> inch<00:04:29.340> into<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.790> width

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
add an extra quarter inch into the width

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.440 
add an extra quarter inch into the width
of<00:04:30.180> your<00:04:30.240> design<00:04:30.720> you'll<00:04:31.290> need<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.680> later<00:04:31.830> on

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
of your design you'll need it later on

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:40.130 
of your design you'll need it later on
so<00:04:33.450> that<00:04:33.600> should<00:04:33.780> be<00:04:33.870> our<00:04:33.960> pattern<00:04:38.930> this<00:04:39.930> is

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
so that should be our pattern this is

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.140 
so that should be our pattern this is
just<00:04:40.700> 18<00:04:41.700> gauge<00:04:42.320> coal<00:04:43.320> rolled<00:04:43.620> steel<00:04:43.950> and<00:04:44.400> it's

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
just 18 gauge coal rolled steel and it's

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.760 
just 18 gauge coal rolled steel and it's
feels<00:04:45.480> pretty<00:04:45.780> forgiving<00:04:46.290> because<00:04:46.440> this<00:04:46.590> is<00:04:46.740> a

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
feels pretty forgiving because this is a

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.700 
feels pretty forgiving because this is a
pretty<00:04:47.070> beat-up<00:04:47.460> piece<00:04:47.880> that's<00:04:48.210> had<00:04:48.390> some

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
pretty beat-up piece that's had some

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.440 
pretty beat-up piece that's had some
English<00:04:49.710> wheeling<00:04:50.190> gun<00:04:50.400> on<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.760> so<00:04:51.000> now<00:04:51.150> I<00:04:51.180> mean

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
English wheeling gun on it so now I mean

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.880 
English wheeling gun on it so now I mean
the<00:04:51.750> most<00:04:51.870> important<00:04:52.260> part<00:04:52.380> is<00:04:52.470> developing

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
the most important part is developing

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.210 
the most important part is developing
the<00:04:53.010> pattern<00:04:53.540> for<00:04:54.540> your<00:04:54.690> top<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.290> now<00:04:55.530> we<00:04:55.890> know

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
the pattern for your top so now we know

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.280

sour<00:05:39.969> pattern<00:05:40.770> so<00:05:41.770> here's<00:05:42.009> our<00:05:42.129> flat<00:05:42.340> spot<00:05:42.819> on

sour pattern so here's our flat spot on

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.999 
sour pattern so here's our flat spot on
the<00:05:43.090> center<00:05:43.449> so<00:05:43.719> we<00:05:43.870> make<00:05:44.080> we're<00:05:44.710> just<00:05:44.860> gonna

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
the center so we make we're just gonna

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.909 
the center so we make we're just gonna
set<00:05:45.310> a<00:05:45.340> little<00:05:45.580> guide<00:05:46.199> to<00:05:47.199> make<00:05:47.409> sure<00:05:47.620> we<00:05:47.770> don't

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
set a little guide to make sure we don't

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.309 
set a little guide to make sure we don't
shrink<00:05:48.550> any<00:05:49.270> more<00:05:49.599> than<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:50.199> actual

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
shrink any more than that actual

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.670 
shrink any more than that actual
distance<00:05:53.319> so

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.460 

this<00:05:57.610> mark<00:05:57.940> is<00:05:58.090> your<00:05:58.240> guide<00:05:58.449> so<00:05:58.840> don't<00:05:59.050> go<00:05:59.199> past

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
this mark is your guide so don't go past

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.560 
this mark is your guide so don't go past
it<00:05:59.650> when<00:05:59.830> you<00:05:59.919> feed<00:06:00.100> it<00:06:00.250> into<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.490> machines<00:06:00.910> it

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
it when you feed it into the machines it

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.570 
it when you feed it into the machines it
keeps<00:06:01.960> it<00:06:02.139> balanced<00:06:02.620> on<00:06:02.710> both<00:06:02.740> sides<00:06:03.250> so<00:06:03.550> it

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
keeps it balanced on both sides so it

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.330 
keeps it balanced on both sides so it
turns<00:06:03.910> out<00:06:04.120> symmetrical<00:06:05.039> what<00:06:06.039> needs<00:06:06.220> to

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
turns out symmetrical what needs to

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.600 
turns out symmetrical what needs to
happen<00:06:07.440> this<00:06:08.440> is<00:06:08.620> our<00:06:08.770> mouth<00:06:08.949> so<00:06:09.930> this<00:06:10.930> edge

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
happen this is our mouth so this edge

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.879 
happen this is our mouth so this edge
needs<00:06:12.610> to<00:06:12.820> be<00:06:12.940> pulled<00:06:13.240> down<00:06:13.710> because<00:06:14.710> this<00:06:14.830> is

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
needs to be pulled down because this is

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:16.740 
needs to be pulled down because this is
a<00:06:15.039> shape<00:06:15.370> that's<00:06:15.610> been<00:06:15.850> in<00:06:16.000> two<00:06:16.210> ways<00:06:16.449> it's

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
a shape that's been in two ways it's

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.930 
a shape that's been in two ways it's
it's<00:06:17.080> curving<00:06:17.620> around<00:06:17.740> the<00:06:18.009> radius<00:06:18.370> and<00:06:18.610> it's

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
it's curving around the radius and it's

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.360 
it's curving around the radius and it's
folding<00:06:19.449> over<00:06:19.600> so<00:06:20.560> we<00:06:20.680> need<00:06:20.830> to<00:06:20.919> use<00:06:21.070> some

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
folding over so we need to use some

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.219 
folding over so we need to use some
machines<00:06:22.139> to<00:06:23.280> to<00:06:24.280> shape<00:06:24.520> that<00:06:24.759> so<00:06:25.120> right<00:06:25.780> while

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
machines to to shape that so right while

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.680 
machines to to shape that so right while
we're<00:06:26.410> worried<00:06:26.650> about<00:06:26.710> is<00:06:26.860> from<00:06:27.479> where<00:06:28.479> the

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
we're worried about is from where the

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.790 
we're worried about is from where the
turn<00:06:28.900> starts<00:06:29.789> which<00:06:30.789> is<00:06:30.820> right<00:06:31.150> about<00:06:31.360> here<00:06:31.800> so

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
turn starts which is right about here so

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.870 
turn starts which is right about here so
we'll<00:06:33.479> take<00:06:34.479> that<00:06:34.690> over<00:06:35.020> to<00:06:35.050> the<00:06:35.880> little

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
we'll take that over to the little

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.640 
we'll take that over to the little
Pettingill

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.740 

now<00:06:41.250> that<00:06:41.400> we've<00:06:41.520> cut<00:06:41.729> our<00:06:41.850> top<00:06:42.060> piece<00:06:42.330> to<00:06:42.360> size

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
now that we've cut our top piece to size

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.960 
now that we've cut our top piece to size
the<00:06:43.470> next<00:06:43.500> step<00:06:43.949> is<00:06:44.130> to<00:06:44.250> start<00:06:44.520> forming<00:06:44.820> the

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
the next step is to start forming the

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:52.320 
the next step is to start forming the
metal<00:06:45.300> to<00:06:45.419> shape

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330
