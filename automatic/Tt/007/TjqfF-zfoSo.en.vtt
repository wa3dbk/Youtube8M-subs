00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
is it getting enough sleep drinking

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.250 
is it getting enough sleep drinking

uhm<00:03:12.269> so<00:03:12.629> from<00:03:13.140> today<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.470> know<00:03:13.709> earlier<00:03:14.129> on<00:03:14.519> we

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
uhm so from today I know earlier on we

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.920 
uhm so from today I know earlier on we
were<00:03:14.670> talking<00:03:14.909> to<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.269> boys<00:03:15.420> about<00:03:15.750> this

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
were talking to the boys about this

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.600 
were talking to the boys about this
being<00:03:16.140> an<00:03:16.409> opportunity<00:03:16.860> for<00:03:17.040> them<00:03:17.159> to<00:03:17.220> loving

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
being an opportunity for them to loving

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.490 
being an opportunity for them to loving
themselves<00:03:18.030> against<00:03:18.269> UK<00:03:18.780> players<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.349> see

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
themselves against UK players and see

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.369 
themselves against UK players and see
what<00:03:19.769> it's<00:03:20.010> about<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:21.269> is<00:03:21.599> that<00:03:21.870> really<00:03:22.080> what

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
what it's about it is that really what

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.589 
what it's about it is that really what
they're<00:03:22.640> taken<00:03:23.640> from<00:03:23.730> today<00:03:24.060> really<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.510> a

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
they're taken from today really is a

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.940 
they're taken from today really is a
learning<00:03:25.470> process

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
learning process

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.830 
learning process
ready<00:03:26.340> for<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.610> next<00:03:26.760> opportunity<00:03:27.269> trial

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
ready for the next opportunity trial

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.630 
ready for the next opportunity trial
they<00:03:28.019> go<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.349> think<00:03:28.530> it's<00:03:29.129> giving<00:03:29.430> them<00:03:29.489> up

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
they go I think it's giving them up

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.460 
they go I think it's giving them up
based<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.360> they<00:03:30.510> can<00:03:30.690> say<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:31.290> where<00:03:31.440> I

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
based so they can say this is where I

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.770 
based so they can say this is where I
stand<00:03:32.159> against<00:03:32.610> English<00:03:32.879> players<00:03:33.180> but

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
stand against English players but

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.950 
stand against English players but
they're<00:03:34.110> also<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.769> fun

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
they're also of a fun

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.940 
they're also of a fun
themselves<00:03:38.090> it's<00:03:39.090> an<00:03:39.210> experience<00:03:39.990> where<00:03:40.740> they

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
themselves it's an experience where they

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.820 
themselves it's an experience where they
can<00:03:41.160> go<00:03:41.460> in<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.180> conductor<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:43.470> revise

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
can go in and the conductor to revise

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.460 
can go in and the conductor to revise
while<00:03:44.760> my<00:03:44.910> expectations<00:03:45.690> am<00:03:45.900> i<00:03:45.990> doing<00:03:46.260> things

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
while my expectations am i doing things
