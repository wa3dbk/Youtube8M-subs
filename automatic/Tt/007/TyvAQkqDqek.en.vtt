 continue to pass the card called 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.350
 time to travel 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.330
 Well guys in this series, I want to go 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 once again test number 4 and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.429
 continue to go through the whole map because 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.020
 I didn't take the guys last time 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.090
 did not take a more accurate series before last 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.890
 krestrazh which was the question well what 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.779
 remember the questions and drove 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.550
 and you can call such a bonus 100 series though 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.830
 and there will be all not complete tests as 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.599
 your name is my name is Vlad again 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.830
 answer so I generally remember the answer to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 the question is really real by 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 the creator of the game, mycroft marcus person 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.570
 and they are fed up with it at all refresh more accurately 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 who feeds the speech in edge measurement where 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.320
 this dragon ender 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.989
 all right genre of game mikroft sandbox 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.399
 worth the underworld of a block of 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.520
 composed of red stone we are we 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.850
 know this of course which mode is shorter 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.780
 hardcore i remember i must answer i 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.699
 I haven't watched all this time. 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:06.600
 I do n't know, for example, the top may be there 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:08.460
 he will be shorter than the chest here I thought that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.350
 look guys i thought for short 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.409
 there was past trials and she just isn't 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.780
 I did not see I do not know why, but he is here 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.250
 and from wonderful so here too and nasdaq 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 really krasrazh number four 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.189
 the shoes here we will answer wooden 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.740
 pickaxe 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.630
 here and here we have the last question as what 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.290
 how can you break bedrock with 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.420
 dark oak 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.090
 all he once again won the gold 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.470
 nuggets but this is cheater gold 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.200
 nuggets too well re tests 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.119
 we pass as we have already received 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.920
 but tests 22 nuggets and we them 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.420
 left here well what are we guys now 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.850
 pass in the following tests it is with us 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.970
 called guessing ore well let's get to it 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.040
 let's get the information about the test here 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.149
 something like a test of coal 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.000
 stone that is you 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.649
 given info info what a to me 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.829
 you have to choose the right one 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.729
 and put a lever on him so infa 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.740
 I have it and I understand it 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.659
 has many varieties among which 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.860
 almost black marion purple amethyst 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:13.330
 yellow citrine and so on diamond 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.090
 well i guess this diamond is not 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.010
 fartanulo failed let's do it again 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.020
 read has many varieties 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.930
 among which is almost black marion 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:30.520
 purple amethyst yellow citrine can 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:34.510
 be that it may be simple somehow not but 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.090
 I see here 4d 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.790
 honestly did not know what it was 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.040
 ore has what is it called my goodness i 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.690
 forgot shorter guys that's this kind of it 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.050
 seemed like the right answer i didn't know 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.930
 so take the lever and the next Nasra soft 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.560
 yellow metal yellow on him what 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.140
 prank joke prank reddish 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.360
 some product attached with impurities 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.780
 other metals particular copper in thin 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.270
 films 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.370
 shining green green possesses 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.930
 high thermal conductivity and low 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.040
 electrical resistance is ours 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.690
 gold yes yes then gold tour is difficult not 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.920
 to guess 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:19.239
 navy poly mineral aggregate 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.709
 no visible light inclusions what am i 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.950
 I do not see that the second font 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.989
 jewelry varieties are dense 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.209
 dark blue you strong and 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.640
 In short, it seems to me that I already immediately 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.220
 I will answer it with us here is such a lapis lazuli 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.780
 take the lever and and the next kind are 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.540
 various shades from yellow green to 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.989
 green to blue green however 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.940
 in a tone 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.769
 is green right down to the very 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.160
 dark green is probably 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.260
 emerald all right lever so 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.530
 spread quite widely on his 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.970
 but it accounts for about 41 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.459
 percent of the mass of the earth's crust 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.690
 4th place among all the elements of the second 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:01.660
 among metals and what could it be 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.560
 iron probably metal yes that's all right 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.239
 it is metal so again and like oil 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.489
 the end is an organic 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.950
 slow substance 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:16.079
 decomposition under the influence of biological and 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:19.470
 geological processes coal 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.470
 yes, well, because he is someone 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.539
 for example a tree but when it settles 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.430
 turns into a corner it's shorter okay 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.909
 for a long time you will explain what I am now on 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:33.680
 lessons of natural science some coloring 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:35.789
 black gray reddish bureau located 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.699
 the arrangement of the lanes point to 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:43.110
 on the direction of the flow of lava structure 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:49.110
 glass fiber and equal dense and you 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:54.210
 no and understood everything and obsidian is true all 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.949
 perfectly so there's more to what is and here 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.469
 us kresrazh number 9 dan seems to me that 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.169
 the past too potions were christening so 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:02.909
 this is probably our last rare but 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.500
 however quite wide 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.849
 common industrial metal 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.729
 deposits are known at all 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.379
 specific except antarctica it is all on 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.360
 all continents except Antarctica 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:14.250
 several types of deposits are known 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.900
 already a few thousand years ago in 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.460
 commercially mined from 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.849
 loose deposits 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.449
 Well, in fact, we have not yet started Redstone 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.020
 it's not that 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:28.529
 and that this may be the case 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.949
 than anvils and I donâ€™t know well yes 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.690
 again 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.069
 rare but quite wide 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.889
 common metal industrially 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:36.270
 several deposits of fame 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.800
 types of deposits already several thousand 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.839
 years of industrial scale power 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.550
 scattered well if industrial 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:43.550
 the scale essentially should be coal 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.900
 Well 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:57.790
 for some reason it says color again 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:06:01.090
 this is that yes this guys was a mass and not 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.270
 knowing answered somehow rather by chance 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.130
 we put everything in our chest and so 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.560
 we all put it today we are by the way yes we were 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.930
 until the end of all krestrazhi well what can we 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.419
 It left the final test test 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.340
 ready to meet us I think but ready 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.720
 but guys I'm sorry that this turned out 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.190
 short series hope it is for you 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.810
 I like it if this is the case 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.970
 Like below drive to write your 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.830
 comments as well as guys subscribe
