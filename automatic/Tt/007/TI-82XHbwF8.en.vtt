oil or tackle at the tempo we can do it
we<00:01:40.180> can<00:01:40.210> do<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.390> twice<00:01:40.720> okay<00:01:41.290> otherwise<00:01:41.740> you

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
we can do it twice okay otherwise you

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.520 
we can do it twice okay otherwise you
know<00:01:42.520> that's<00:01:42.820> what<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.000> do

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
know that's what I do

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.660 
know that's what I do
two<00:01:44.530> days<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:44.830> it<00:01:44.920> all<00:01:45.010> mental<00:01:45.280> have<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.490> fill

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
two days and it all mental have to fill

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.060 
two days and it all mental have to fill
it<00:01:45.760> up<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.869> other<00:01:47.140> is<00:01:47.229> right<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.770> oil<00:01:47.920> is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
it up and the other is right the oil is

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.800 
it up and the other is right the oil is
right<00:01:48.220> here<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:48.610> we<00:01:49.030> have<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.180> little<00:01:49.390> fall<00:01:49.570> for

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
right here so we have a little fall for

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.780 
right here so we have a little fall for
this<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.890> put<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.100> in<00:01:51.220> here<00:01:51.369> just<00:01:51.430> like<00:01:51.640> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
this and put it in here just like the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.620 
this and put it in here just like the
cleaner<00:01:54.119> there's<00:01:55.119> nothing<00:01:55.330> special<00:01:55.479> about

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
cleaner there's nothing special about

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.270 
cleaner there's nothing special about
the<00:01:55.810> oil<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.259> just<00:01:56.470> go<00:01:56.560> straight<00:01:56.830> in<00:01:56.950> here<00:01:57.070> now

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
the oil you just go straight in here now

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.080 
the oil you just go straight in here now
the<00:01:57.340> cleaner<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.290> mix<00:01:59.560> now<00:01:59.860> there's<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.580> 5:1

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
the cleaner it's a mix now there's a 5:1

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.840 
the cleaner it's a mix now there's a 5:1
ratio<00:02:01.119> so<00:02:01.899> so<00:02:02.710> all<00:02:02.979> I<00:02:03.009> need<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.280> premix<00:02:03.610> that<00:02:03.759> in

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
ratio so so all I need is premix that in

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.310 
ratio so so all I need is premix that in
here<00:02:03.970> put<00:02:04.270> in<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.420> cleaner<00:02:04.600> we're<00:02:05.080> done<00:02:05.200> with

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
here put in the cleaner we're done with

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.080 
here put in the cleaner we're done with
this<00:02:05.410> for<00:02:05.619> now<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:06.729> going<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.910> be<00:02:07.000> good

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
this for now this is going to be good

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:14.880 
this for now this is going to be good
for<00:02:07.270> today<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.920> catback<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:14.590> takes<00:02:14.800> a

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
for today to catback on and this takes a

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.240 
for today to catback on and this takes a
little<00:02:15.010> bit<00:02:15.130> longer<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.580> phone<00:02:15.790> smaller

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.640 

if<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.849> fill<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.180> up<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.510> haven't<00:02:25.260> tested<00:02:25.410> it

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
if you fill this up I haven't tested it

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.960 
if you fill this up I haven't tested it
but<00:02:25.800> if<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.040> fill<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.370> whole<00:02:26.400> tank<00:02:26.790> up<00:02:26.940> here

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
but if you fill the whole tank up here

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.800

and lastly I'm going to show you right
here<00:03:03.900> good<00:03:04.290> gonna<00:03:04.560> come<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:04.890> closer<00:03:05.069> to<00:03:05.280> here

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
here good gonna come in closer to here

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.209 
here good gonna come in closer to here
this<00:03:05.969> is<00:03:06.030> our<00:03:06.299> like<00:03:06.840> our<00:03:06.959> digital<00:03:07.319> display<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:08.219 
this is our like our digital display the

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:09.440 
this is our like our digital display the
only<00:03:08.400> thing<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.609> have<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.790> worry<00:03:09.000> about<00:03:09.150> is

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
only thing you have to worry about is

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.569 
only thing you have to worry about is
that<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:10.530> shows<00:03:10.739> right<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.400> is

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
that it shows right here that this is

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.729 
that it shows right here that this is
program<00:03:12.060> number<00:03:12.480> three<00:03:12.959> if<00:03:13.109> you<00:03:13.230> can<00:03:13.349> see<00:03:13.560> that

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
program number three if you can see that

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.099 
program number three if you can see that
it<00:03:14.700> should<00:03:14.909> always<00:03:15.090> be<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.569> that's<00:03:15.900> what

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
it should always be that that's what

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.509 
it should always be that that's what
pattern<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.890> Euler<00:03:17.159> is<00:03:17.219> going<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.400> lay<00:03:17.489> down

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
pattern the Euler is going to lay down

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.089 
pattern the Euler is going to lay down
we<00:03:17.939> have<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.120> few<00:03:18.359> more<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.439> one<00:03:19.620> for

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
we have a few more but that one for

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.149 
we have a few more but that one for
kingpins<00:03:21.060> sake<00:03:22.019> we're<00:03:22.620> always<00:03:22.769> going<00:03:22.950> to<00:03:23.010> have

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
kingpins sake we're always going to have

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.300 
kingpins sake we're always going to have
this<00:03:23.280> one<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.549> here<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.879> if<00:03:24.689> it<00:03:25.109> ever<00:03:25.200> if<00:03:26.129> it's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
this one in here and if it ever if it's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.069 
this one in here and if it ever if it's
ever<00:03:26.459> different<00:03:26.879> come<00:03:27.060> get<00:03:27.209> scatter<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.659> will

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
ever different come get scatter I will

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.050 
ever different come get scatter I will
come<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:28.859> should<00:03:29.280> always<00:03:29.400> be<00:03:29.489> Ellen<00:03:29.849> so<00:03:30.000> it

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
come but it should always be Ellen so it

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.539 
come but it should always be Ellen so it
should<00:03:30.209> be<00:03:30.239> okay<00:03:31.049> now<00:03:31.889> all<00:03:32.069> we're<00:03:32.189> going<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.340> be

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
should be okay now all we're going to be

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.210 
should be okay now all we're going to be
the<00:03:32.639> core<00:03:32.849> behind<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.299> okay<00:03:34.010> we<00:03:35.010> have<00:03:35.099> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
the core behind this okay we have the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.039 
the core behind this okay we have the
whatever<00:03:35.400> link<00:03:36.060> set<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.419> go<00:03:36.540> we<00:03:36.689> close<00:03:36.870> early

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
whatever link set to go we close early
