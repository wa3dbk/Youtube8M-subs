like a nice little house and that lets
me<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.670> while<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> build<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.750> long<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.260> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
me a while to build not that long but I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
me a while to build not that long but I
would<00:00:44.520> longer<00:00:44.730> than<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> take<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.180> most<00:00:45.360> things

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
would longer than I take on most things

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.479 
would longer than I take on most things
cuz<00:00:45.840> i<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.200> don't<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.379> doing<00:00:46.559> things<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
cuz i just don't like doing things so I

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.459 
cuz i just don't like doing things so I
figured<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.760> would<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.020> fly<00:00:49.020> around<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.379> my

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
figured I would just fly around to my

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.639 
figured I would just fly around to my
little<00:00:49.739> sky<00:00:50.399> orb<00:00:50.640> thing<00:00:51.059> oh<00:00:51.899> there<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.530> go

height<00:01:09.330> limit<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.780> when<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.080> this

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
height limit for you when you have this

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.060 
height limit for you when you have this
you<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.280> keep<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> up

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
pretty much breaks the game even as when

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.460

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
going to see like my I don't know I

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.469 
going to see like my I don't know I
think<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> z-value<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.549> huge<00:01:33.060> so

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
think it's a z-value is going up huge so

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.640 
think it's a z-value is going up huge so
this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> last<00:01:34.259> thing<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.439> want<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.590> show
