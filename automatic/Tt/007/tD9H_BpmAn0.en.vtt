so<00:03:46.459> far<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:47.629> softness<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.379> it<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.739> quality<00:03:49.609> of

the edges and the movement it's the

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.250 
the edges and the movement it's the
subtle<00:03:54.680> tea<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.730> speed<00:03:56.569> of<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.870> turns

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
subtle tea the the speed of the turns

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.289 
subtle tea the the speed of the turns
and<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.709> ease<00:03:57.859> of<00:03:57.889> it<00:03:58.220> he's<00:03:58.430> annoyed<00:03:58.700> himself

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
and the ease of it he's annoyed himself

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.849 
and the ease of it he's annoyed himself
at<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.450> twizzles<00:03:59.870> did<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:00.200> well<00:04:00.379> to<00:04:00.620> get<00:04:00.709> the

second part of that twizzle back and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.879 
second part of that twizzle back and
make<00:04:03.409> it<00:04:03.440> work<00:04:08.319> when<00:04:09.319> they<00:04:09.439> were<00:04:09.500> doing<00:04:09.650> some

quality<00:04:36.949> that<00:04:37.180> movement<00:04:38.620> because<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.710> key

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
quality that movement because the key

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.710 
quality that movement because the key
thing<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.310> skating<00:04:40.729> is<00:04:40.880> if<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.120> get<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.449> rise

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
thing and skating is if you get the rise

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.839
