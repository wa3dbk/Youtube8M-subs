00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.300 
looking to bring on more substitutes
throughout<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.349> game<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.650> as<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.159> can<00:02:33.280> see

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
throughout the game and as you can see

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.559 
throughout the game and as you can see
there<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.640> actually<00:02:33.849> paid<00:02:34.239> off<00:02:34.420> because

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
there that actually paid off because

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.270 
there that actually paid off because
Royce<00:02:34.900> did<00:02:35.170> go<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.440> get<00:02:35.530> himself<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.950> goal<00:02:36.129> when

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
Royce did go and get himself a goal when

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.550 
Royce did go and get himself a goal when
it<00:02:36.370> came<00:02:36.519> on<00:02:36.549> as<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:37.150> impact<00:02:37.480> substitute<00:02:38.019> I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
it came on as the impact substitute I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.229 
it came on as the impact substitute I
know<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.950> he<00:02:39.190> doesn't<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.730> most<00:02:40.030> pace

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
know that he doesn't have the most pace

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.819 
know that he doesn't have the most pace
in<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.450> game<00:02:40.659> but<00:02:41.110> when<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.530> bring<00:02:41.709> on

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
in the game but when you bring on

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.890 
in the game but when you bring on
someone<00:02:42.099> who's<00:02:42.549> like<00:02:43.000> fully<00:02:43.329> fit<00:02:43.599> and<00:02:43.750> ready

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
someone who's like fully fit and ready

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.440 
someone who's like fully fit and ready
to<00:02:44.109> go<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:44.470> about<00:02:44.980> 60<00:02:45.579> 70<00:02:45.940> minutes<00:02:46.180> into<00:02:46.359> the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
to go on about 60 70 minutes into the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.509 
to go on about 60 70 minutes into the
game<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:47.019> opponent's<00:02:47.590> defenders<00:02:48.010> are<00:02:48.280> just

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
game the opponent's defenders are just

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.030 
game the opponent's defenders are just
so<00:02:48.760> slow<00:02:49.359> and<00:02:49.569> tired<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.349> you<00:02:50.379> will<00:02:50.620> rip<00:02:50.859> them

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
so slow and tired that you will rip them

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.270 
so slow and tired that you will rip them
apart<00:02:51.129> but<00:02:51.720> Swansea<00:02:52.720> go<00:02:53.019> through<00:02:53.349> as<00:02:53.590> well<00:02:53.950> so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
apart but Swansea go through as well so

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.680 
apart but Swansea go through as well so
that<00:02:54.430> was<00:02:54.519> kind<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.879> shock<00:02:54.910> result<00:02:55.299> against

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
that was kind of a shock result against

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.140 
that was kind of a shock result against
Arsenal<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.349> I've<00:02:57.099> got<00:02:57.400> my<00:02:57.549> next<00:02:57.970> game<00:02:58.120> I

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
Arsenal and I've got my next game I

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.319 
Arsenal and I've got my next game I
believe<00:02:58.299> it's<00:02:58.750> against<00:02:59.079> Cardiff<00:02:59.739> or

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
believe it's against Cardiff or

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.399 
believe it's against Cardiff or
nottingham<00:03:01.329> forest<00:03:01.659> I<00:03:01.720> didn't<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:01.989> exactly

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
little bit staggered so I assume it

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.659
