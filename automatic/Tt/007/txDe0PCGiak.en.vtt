00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
tar and marsh and north of regex run you

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.600 
tar and marsh and north of regex run you
see<00:00:13.139> our<00:00:13.349> position<00:00:13.889> right<00:00:14.070> up<00:00:14.219> here

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
see our position right up here

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.380 
see our position right up here
underneath<00:00:15.089> some<00:00:15.540> debris<00:00:17.029> there's<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> pipe

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
underneath some debris there's a pipe

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
underneath some debris there's a pipe
right<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.830> start<00:00:19.830> your<00:00:20.010> run<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:23.090> once<00:00:24.090> you

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
right here start your run and once you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.170 
right here start your run and once you
get<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.449> top<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:25.320> hop<00:00:26.099> off<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> side<00:00:26.880> onto

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
get up top just hop off to the side onto

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.049 
get up top just hop off to the side onto
this<00:00:27.800> platform<00:00:30.920> run<00:00:31.920> across<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.550> span<00:00:33.420> here

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
this platform run across this span here

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.770 
this platform run across this span here
and<00:00:36.059> onto<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.600> wall

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:50.990 

jump<00:00:42.780> off<00:00:48.290> now<00:00:49.290> there<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.620> some<00:00:49.649> gaps<00:00:50.219> that

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
jump off now there are some gaps that

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.139 
jump off now there are some gaps that
are<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.540> very<00:00:51.839> obvious<00:00:52.440> up<00:00:52.739> ahead<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.850> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
are not very obvious up ahead here so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.069 
are not very obvious up ahead here so
you<00:00:54.239> want<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> make<00:00:54.809> transitions<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:56.039> jumps

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
you want to make transitions with jumps

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.079 
you want to make transitions with jumps
over<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.649> your<00:00:58.979> datacron<00:00:59.550> off<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.970> the

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
over here is your datacron off in the

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.000 
over here is your datacron off in the
distance<00:01:00.269> you<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:01.170> we've<00:01:01.440> got<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.739> long

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
distance you can see we've got a long

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
distance you can see we've got a long
way<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> go<00:01:02.790> all<00:01:03.089> these<00:01:03.570> different<00:01:03.899> platforms

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
way to go all these different platforms

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.590 
way to go all these different platforms
and<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> little<00:01:05.729> gaps<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and you can see the little gaps if you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.200 
and you can see the little gaps if you
look<00:01:06.750> closely<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> watch<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:11.940> here

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
look closely so watch this one here

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.620 
look closely so watch this one here
double<00:01:12.570> gaps<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.380> easy<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:14.390> fall<00:01:15.390> right

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
double gaps so it's easy to fall right

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:30.140 
double gaps so it's easy to fall right
into<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.289> there

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.010 

let's<00:01:31.150> just<00:01:31.360> take<00:01:31.540> this<00:01:31.570> with<00:01:31.930> a<00:01:32.020> jump<00:01:37.020> jump

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
let's just take this with a jump jump

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:53.899 
let's just take this with a jump jump
here<00:01:43.710> keep<00:01:44.710> jumping

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.789 

when<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.060> doubt<00:01:55.090> jump<00:01:55.750> when<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.470> comes<00:01:56.650> to

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
when in doubt jump when it comes to

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:16.700 
when in doubt jump when it comes to
these<00:01:56.920> transitions<00:01:57.670> here

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.640 

now<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.490> one<00:02:17.760> will<00:02:17.910> knock<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.270> back<00:02:18.480> if<00:02:19.470> you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
now this one will knock you back if you

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.030 
now this one will knock you back if you
don't<00:02:19.680> jump<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.190> little<00:02:20.340> early<00:02:24.890> come<00:02:25.890> around

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
don't jump a little early come around

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.750 
don't jump a little early come around
the<00:02:26.190> left<00:02:26.220> side<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.820> column<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:31.760> there's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
the left side of the column and there's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.530 
the left side of the column and there's
your<00:02:32.850> datacron<00:02:34.640> easy<00:02:35.640> as<00:02:35.910> long<00:02:36.150> as<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.390> make

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
your datacron easy as long as you make

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:45.140 
your datacron easy as long as you make
your<00:02:36.570> jumps<00:02:38.090> again<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.140> cunning<00:02:40.800> +<00:02:41.130> 2<00:02:44.150> and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
your jumps again this is cunning + 2 and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.980 
your jumps again this is cunning + 2 and
there<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.810> go<00:02:46.020> enjoy
