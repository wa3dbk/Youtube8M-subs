the<00:01:18.750> 66<00:01:19.259> car<00:01:19.320> Blake's<00:01:19.799> speed<00:01:20.100> might<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.490> just

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the 66 car Blake's speed might have just

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
mean again that is purely speculation

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.620 
mean again that is purely speculation
lake<00:01:25.289> speed<00:01:25.560> was<00:01:25.710> right<00:01:25.950> behind<00:01:26.159> him<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.759> we
