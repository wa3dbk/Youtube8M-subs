their battery pack there we've got a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.830 
their battery pack there we've got a
servo<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:27.210> there<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:28.859> which<00:00:29.840> stairs

servo just there like that which stairs

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.709 
servo just there like that which stairs
does<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.769> steering<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:32.550> I'm<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.969> into<00:00:33.540> that

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
does the steering if I'm get into that

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.440 
does the steering if I'm get into that
bit<00:00:33.930> thing<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.340> servo<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.210> about

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
bit thing see the servo is just about

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.060 
bit thing see the servo is just about
there<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.950> nice<00:00:38.790> kind<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.059> metal<00:00:40.070> forks

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
I've got plans for this bike as in I'm

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.920 
I've got plans for this bike as in I'm
interested<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> idea<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:08.540> putting<00:01:09.540> this

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
interested in the idea of putting this

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.030 
interested in the idea of putting this
motor<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:12.680> into<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> VX<00:01:15.330> 18

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
motor here into it now this is a VX 18

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
motor here into it now this is a VX 18
motor<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.310> I've<00:01:17.400> bought<00:01:17.580> from<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.390> got<00:01:19.020> from

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
motor that I've bought from the got from

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.340 
motor that I've bought from the got from
a<00:01:19.259> cheap<00:01:19.500> buggy<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.189> poor<00:01:20.460> buggy<00:01:20.930> basically<00:01:21.930> 50

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
a cheap buggy a poor buggy basically 50

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.749 
a cheap buggy a poor buggy basically 50
quid<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> sell<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> basic

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
quid I'm going to sell all the basic

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.640 
quid I'm going to sell all the basic
various<00:01:24.119> bits<00:01:24.360> off<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> buggy<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.200> use<00:01:25.409> this

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
various bits off the buggy and use this

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.350 
various bits off the buggy and use this
and<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.250> probably<00:01:26.430> use<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> radio<00:01:27.150> gear

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
and then probably use the radio gear

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.670 
and then probably use the radio gear
from<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.750> well<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.350> gonna<00:01:28.470> have

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
from it as well I think I'm gonna have

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.560 
from it as well I think I'm gonna have
to<00:01:28.799> swap<00:01:29.220> around<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:31.579> the<00:01:32.579> carburetor<00:01:33.119> so

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
to swap around the the carburetor so

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.210 
to swap around the the carburetor so
it's<00:01:33.720> facing<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.200> different<00:01:34.530> direction<00:01:34.650> I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
it's facing in a different direction I

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.069 
it's facing in a different direction I
think<00:01:36.060> that'll<00:01:36.509> work

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
think that'll work

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.399 
think that'll work
I'm<00:01:37.439> not<00:01:37.650> sure<00:01:37.920> yet<00:01:38.600> we<00:01:39.600> will<00:01:39.780> say<00:01:42.079> yes<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.290> I'm

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
I'm not sure yet we will say yes if I'm

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.929 
I'm not sure yet we will say yes if I'm
actually<00:01:43.590> able<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.460> might<00:01:44.700> not<00:01:44.820> be

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
actually able to do that I might not be

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.350 
actually able to do that I might not be
able<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.450> which<00:01:45.689> might<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.079> pain<00:01:47.360> so

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
able to do it which might be a pain so

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.910 
able to do it which might be a pain so
there's<00:01:48.540> various<00:01:48.780> kind<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> problems<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
there's various kind of problems at the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.310 
there's various kind of problems at the
moment<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.210> kind<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:52.140> not

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
moment it's all kind of there it's not

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.870 
moment it's all kind of there it's not
kind<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> running<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> moment<00:01:53.670> cause<00:01:53.759> it's

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
kind of running at the moment cause it's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.469 
kind of running at the moment cause it's
all<00:01:54.000> apart

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
all apart

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.940 
all apart
I<00:01:54.509> also<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.229> first<00:01:55.409> thing<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> managed<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.829> do

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
I also the first thing I managed to do

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.289 
I also the first thing I managed to do
was<00:01:56.100> break<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:58.250> string<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> pull<00:01:59.729> starter

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
was break the string on the pull starter

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.910 
was break the string on the pull starter
very<00:02:00.479> cleverly<00:02:00.899> when<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.200> was<00:02:01.290> trying<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> start

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
very cleverly when I was trying to start

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.050 
very cleverly when I was trying to start
it<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.490> means

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
it so that means

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.010 
it so that means
big<00:02:03.180> thing<00:02:03.860> but<00:02:04.860> yes<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.210> idea<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.750> sit

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
big thing but yes so the idea is to sit

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.500 
big thing but yes so the idea is to sit
the<00:02:07.200> engine<00:02:07.560> probably<00:02:09.110> there<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:11.510> it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
the engine probably there like that it

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.120 
the engine probably there like that it
looks<00:02:12.840> as<00:02:13.020> if<00:02:13.050> there<00:02:13.319> may<00:02:13.440> be<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.860> enough

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
looks as if there may be just enough

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.509 
looks as if there may be just enough
room<00:02:14.459> I've<00:02:14.700> checked<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:18.660> Thunder<00:02:19.110> Tiger

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
room I've checked the the Thunder Tiger

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.880 
room I've checked the the Thunder Tiger
bike<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.849> I<00:02:20.940> have<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.870> hopefully<00:02:22.680> we<00:02:22.860> can

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
bike that I have and hopefully we can

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.960 
bike that I have and hopefully we can
just<00:02:23.250> set<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.730> thing<00:02:23.970> there<00:02:24.239> although<00:02:24.810> I

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
just set the thing there although I

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.339 
just set the thing there although I
think<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.209> might<00:02:27.390> be<00:02:27.540> difficult<00:02:27.750> cuz<00:02:28.200> there

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
think it might be difficult cuz there

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.780 
think it might be difficult cuz there
she'll<00:02:28.530> cogs<00:02:28.860> about<00:02:29.160> there<00:02:29.370> something's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
she'll cogs about there something's

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.280 
she'll cogs about there something's
sitting<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.180> engine<00:02:30.420> sitting<00:02:30.660> right<00:02:30.930> out<00:02:31.110> at

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
sitting the engine sitting right out at

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.530 
sitting the engine sitting right out at
the<00:02:31.319> side<00:02:31.650> there<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.849> might<00:02:33.000> mean<00:02:33.180> cutting

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
the side there so it might mean cutting

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.080 
the side there so it might mean cutting
a<00:02:33.630> very<00:02:33.660> large<00:02:34.019> chunk<00:02:34.380> out<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:35.090> and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
a very large chunk out of this and

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.250 
a very large chunk out of this and
whether<00:02:36.239> they'll<00:02:36.450> actually<00:02:36.660> be<00:02:36.870> strong

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
whether they'll actually be strong

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.780 
whether they'll actually be strong
enough<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.500> hold<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.920> thing<00:02:38.100> together<00:02:38.400> or<00:02:38.640> not

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
enough to hold the thing together or not

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.699 
enough to hold the thing together or not
I<00:02:38.850> don't<00:02:39.000> know<00:02:39.239> once<00:02:39.600> that's<00:02:39.840> kind<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.110> done<00:02:40.350> so
