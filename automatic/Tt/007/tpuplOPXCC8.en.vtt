00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.129
 giving continuity with needle 3 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.560
 mm with jajÃ¡ you have here right? 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.020
 a speck stuck here and my wire 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.849
 Porcher thousand I'm working it 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.880
 tucked double're so good is because the 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.380
 white is a thousand phil double work what 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.830
 We're going to do it simple. 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.019
 Soon I ran his base and passed it to him. 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.480
 the first dot of the needle base 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:37.330
 way between your fingers and you 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.760
 learn from the low you already 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:45.010
 began to perform white belly of your 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.500
 from your Santa's runway 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.140
 It's okay, make two chains of mine. 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.879
 give height and for each point you 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.690
 find on base 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:59.350
 You'll make the halfway point, that's all. 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.890
 all base is worked in half a point 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.640
 high without increases and without 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.670
 dreams 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.659
 so let's go straight and straight through 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.670
 here at the tip doing a half point 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.310
 arrived on the edge then the following 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.979
 You'll have to give continuity. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.740
 doing a little walk around the goal only 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.899
 You have to come to work because you 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.560
 is working in this direction to 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.789
 turn 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.149
 You will make the high point in the 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:35.049
 Same hole in fact two medium 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:37.569
 point jumps in the same little hole there 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.229
 this viradinha note here also I have 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:45.130
 I have two made to finish loop 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:50.200
 again and makes one more being in the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:53.649
 total will be 3 high points in the same 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.799
 hole quinho you are seeing here, then 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.289
 made three in the same hole 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.759
 giving continuity in the work we go 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:08.319
 make the point picto so it is so do 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:12.370
 passes the needle through the 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.069
 the first loop you made lafa and 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.270
 concludes at once 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.600
 look at that as well with gominho 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.730
 learn 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.489
 This speck you made 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.750
 a low in the course of the dolphin 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.010
 Look here 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:37.299
 we will do three more again 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:41.049
 little chains then to a two three saw 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:44.890
 Here I learned the first little chain with 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.610
 the same laginha doing it again 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.349
 you will trap it with low 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:56.319
 in the course of your little hat look here in 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:01.690
 Look what we're doing is this. 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:04.440
 again holding the chain on 3 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.099
 the first chain with the same launch 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.980
 finishing off right spring and saw again 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:16.690
 I learned in your little hat with the dot 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:20.140
 low and so will you do in this part 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.549
 here will be the one from here to the top when 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.489
 get up here where you have a 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.169
 Dobrinha, you see, you stop and 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.630
 people see what has to be done looks 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:31.299
 there I got into the fight of my little body 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.790
 so we're going to do the following I 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.769
 I'll make the three current lines for 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.440
 to do what was left here then ready 15 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.019
 He's watching now, this is how I'm going to go. 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:49.540
 my needle between the points because 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:50.889
 are 123 career points in the 123 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.380
 see 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:56.139
 so I'll go through the look point 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.269
 What I'm doing between one and another is 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:01.599
 where I'll pass the needle and then I 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:05.099
 i hold as low 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:10.930
 do again got 1 2 and 3 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:16.030
 holding chains forming what 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.859
 was again step between one and another and 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.910
 I make my low 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:25.240
 Look, there, I 'm already leaving. 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:31.140
 turn to get into continuity 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:35.140
 Here you go, jewelry. Make the three dots. 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.030
 holds the peak and you go 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.790
 train 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:44.880
 immediately in the first row O 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.180
 see that after the bend the low 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.900
 River 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.790
 We're already out of the dojo. 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.820
 continuity in the cap 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.740
 let's go until then down to doing 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.990
 this same procedure 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.560
 continuing, I 'm already doing the 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:07.449
 my little walk then O here three 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:10.960
 I hold fasteners by doing it picac bilac 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:14.350
 and immediately at the same point already 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.900
 making the point o be 12 points 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.050
 at the same point 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:24.850
 you've already changed the direction of my 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:28.330
 she was like this and now she's 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.120
 is following the corro see here 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:35.020
 Now people at the right time just work. 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.449
 straight and straight the continuity of the river without 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.460
 Mystery, no, no, no, no, no. 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.210
 There's nothing else to be done. 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.990
 although still with the same white thread already 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:50.860
 having finished the little cap we'll go 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:55.930
 make another ball which is placed in the 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:59.260
 the tip of the river caught the first dot 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:09.010
 Pride is also three chains had 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:13.180
 as the 2 and 3 3 chains hold the 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:17.650
 last in the first circle 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:24.960
 which is really close to that of the 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:29.560
 circle up 1 2 3 dots three 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:33.460
 and around this circus 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:39.280
 locate the center of it and around it 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:41.560
 You speak there are a dozen high points. 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:46.889
 so around him 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:50.009
 you will make 12 high points 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:52.169
 It's very tight but it's putting 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:55.340
 because it's ok, it's okay 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:58.020
 twelve points high done the 12 points 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:02.639
 What are you going to do next? 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:06.719
 'you will add a chain to 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:10.999
 the height and you will work a point 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:17.400
 down the next chain you will do 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:22.979
 two lows in the next but will do so 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:27.379
 one on the south side for 22 points 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:31.879
 the same point in the next 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:35.580
 again only 1 and so you go 

00:07:31.879 --> 00:07:40.789
 interspersing two points down one point 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:47.029
 low two low one low 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:47.029
 alternately around this ass movie
