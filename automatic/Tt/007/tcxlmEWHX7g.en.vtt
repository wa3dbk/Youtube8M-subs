00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.310 
I just think that was kind of over the
line<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:22.830> uh<00:01:23.509> for<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.570> most<00:01:24.600> part<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.020> think<00:01:25.049> he

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
line but uh for the most part I think he

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.050 
line but uh for the most part I think he
was<00:01:25.409> right<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:25.890> skip<00:01:26.400> bayless<00:01:26.759> kind

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
was right and I think skip bayless kind

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.760 
was right and I think skip bayless kind
of<00:01:27.150> goes<00:01:27.390> over<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.750> line<00:01:27.780> sometimes<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.619> little

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
of goes over the line sometimes a little

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.980 
of goes over the line sometimes a little
bit<00:01:28.950> sorry<00:01:29.939> about<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:32.810> sorry<00:01:33.810> about<00:01:33.960> that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
bit sorry about that sorry about that

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.810 
bit sorry about that sorry about that
but<00:01:34.350> yeah<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:34.829> he<00:01:35.040> kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.280> goes<00:01:35.430> over

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
but yeah I think he kind of goes over

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.310 
but yeah I think he kind of goes over
the<00:01:36.119> top<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.360> little<00:01:36.540> bit<00:01:36.750> skip<00:01:36.900> bayless<00:01:37.049> kind

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the top a little bit skip bayless kind

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.690 
the top a little bit skip bayless kind
of<00:01:37.380> goes<00:01:37.530> over<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> top<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.310> bit<00:01:38.549> with

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
of goes over the top a little bit with

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.630 
of goes over the top a little bit with
his<00:01:39.229> criticisms<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.280> there's<00:01:41.430> like

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
serious but uh I don't know I just think

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.190 
serious but uh I don't know I just think
that<00:02:28.370> he<00:02:28.640> may<00:02:29.060> get<00:02:29.420> back<00:02:29.570> less<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.750> sympathetic

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
that he may get back less a sympathetic

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.380 
that he may get back less a sympathetic
figure<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.430> skip<00:02:31.670> bayless<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:32.000> pi<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.300> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
figure and skip bayless is pi like the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.910 
figure and skip bayless is pi like the
most<00:02:32.570> unsympathetic<00:02:32.930> figure<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.590> long<00:02:33.680> time

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
most unsympathetic figure of a long time

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.260 
most unsympathetic figure of a long time
like<00:02:34.070> skip<00:02:34.280> bayless<00:02:34.430> one<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.880> whole<00:02:35.030> thing

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
like skip bayless one that whole thing

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.570 
like skip bayless one that whole thing
like<00:02:35.510> when<00:02:36.440> he<00:02:36.560> when<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:36.860> guy<00:02:37.100> went<00:02:37.370> after

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
like when he when that guy went after

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.770 
like when he when that guy went after
him<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.760> saying<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.030> he<00:02:38.120> sucks<00:02:38.360> at<00:02:38.480> life<00:02:38.600> i

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
him and saying that he sucks at life i

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.300

inside because he pretty much won

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.600 
inside because he pretty much won
because<00:02:42.470> people<00:02:42.860> have<00:02:42.980> sympathy<00:02:43.310> for<00:02:43.340> skip
