00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.770 
obviously going through you're just at
that<00:02:05.979> stage<00:02:06.399> as<00:02:06.549> an<00:02:06.670> artist<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.240> because<00:02:07.570> so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
that stage as an artist and because so

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.749 
that stage as an artist and because so
many<00:02:07.899> artists<00:02:08.320> do<00:02:08.440> go<00:02:08.619> through<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.310> it's

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
many artists do go through that and it's

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.220 
many artists do go through that and it's
a<00:02:09.820> positive<00:02:10.030> thing<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.630> go<00:02:10.750> through<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.080> I

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
a positive thing to go through that I

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.290 
a positive thing to go through that I
think<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.710> know<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.490> expect<00:02:12.850> it<00:02:13.000> won't<00:02:13.150> be

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
think you know and I expect it won't be

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.000 
think you know and I expect it won't be
the<00:02:13.660> only<00:02:13.690> time<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.260> will<00:02:14.380> go<00:02:14.620> through<00:02:14.650> it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
the only time you will go through it

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.450 
the only time you will go through it
either

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
either

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.510 
either
I<00:02:15.520> certainly<00:02:15.850> hope<00:02:16.090> not<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:17.530> like<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.340> say

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
I certainly hope not but like you say

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.220 
I certainly hope not but like you say
the<00:02:18.760> music<00:02:19.060> industry<00:02:19.420> has<00:02:19.630> changed<00:02:19.660> almost

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
the music industry has changed almost

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.010 
the music industry has changed almost
beyond<00:02:20.860> recognition<00:02:21.780> just<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:22.990> last

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
beyond recognition just that the last

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.070 
beyond recognition just that the last
even<00:02:23.680> two<00:02:24.220> or<00:02:24.250> three<00:02:24.640> years<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:25.420> it's<00:02:25.960> a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
even two or three years it's it's a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.510 
even two or three years it's it's a
completely<00:02:26.440> different<00:02:26.830> industry<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.370> one

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
completely different industry to the one

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.670 
completely different industry to the one
that<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:27.730> knew<00:02:27.910> before<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:29.230> does<00:02:29.440> take<00:02:29.620> a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
that we knew before and that does take a

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.370 
that we knew before and that does take a
lot<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:29.890> reassessment<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.700> think<00:02:30.940> on<00:02:31.120> on

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
lot of reassessment I think on on

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.490 
lot of reassessment I think on on
everyone's<00:02:32.380> side<00:02:32.710> but<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.430> mean<00:02:33.760> going<00:02:33.940> back<00:02:34.090> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
everyone's side but I mean going back to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.760 
everyone's side but I mean going back to
come<00:02:35.500> closer<00:02:36.210> did<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.360> criticism<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.110> you

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770

one way of doing it and achieving that

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.090 
one way of doing it and achieving that
and<00:06:07.480> and<00:06:07.720> sometimes<00:06:08.260> it<00:06:08.410> just<00:06:08.530> doesn't<00:06:08.650> always

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
and and sometimes it just doesn't always

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.400 
and and sometimes it just doesn't always
work<00:06:09.250> it<00:06:09.760> doesn't<00:06:10.180> because<00:06:10.420> you<00:06:10.900> trying<00:06:11.200> to<00:06:11.290> be

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
work it doesn't because you trying to be

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.190 
work it doesn't because you trying to be
somebody<00:06:11.650> else<00:06:12.100> I<00:06:12.490> mean<00:06:12.820> I<00:06:13.120> couldn't<00:06:14.050> do<00:06:14.170> that

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
somebody else I mean I couldn't do that

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.650 
somebody else I mean I couldn't do that
I<00:06:14.620> guess<00:06:15.010> that's<00:06:15.700> why<00:06:15.910> I<00:06:15.940> didn't<00:06:16.240> really<00:06:16.360> work

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.710 
I guess that's why I didn't really work
out<00:06:16.840> that<00:06:17.110> that<00:06:17.380> well<00:06:18.060> but<00:06:19.060> also<00:06:19.270> because<00:06:19.570> I

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
out that that well but also because I

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.890 
out that that well but also because I
didn't<00:06:19.990> support<00:06:20.320> it<00:06:20.440> that<00:06:20.650> much<00:06:20.890> I<00:06:21.160> really<00:06:22.030> I'm
