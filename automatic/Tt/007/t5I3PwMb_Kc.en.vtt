00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
tremendously a lot of times we'll see

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.209 
tremendously a lot of times we'll see
guys<00:01:58.579> who<00:01:59.579> squaw<00:01:59.880> let's<00:02:00.119> say<00:02:00.270> 315<00:02:00.680> go<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
guys who squaw let's say 315 go do the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.410 
guys who squaw let's say 315 go do the
bar<00:02:02.430> they'll<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.119> 135<00:02:03.689> will<00:02:04.259> do<00:02:04.380> 225<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.850> 275

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
bar they'll do 135 will do 225 do 275

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.419 
bar they'll do 135 will do 225 do 275
and<00:02:06.990> maybe<00:02:07.140> they<00:02:07.259> squeak<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.619> 315<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
and maybe they squeak out 315 for a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.850 
and maybe they squeak out 315 for a
single<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.000> damn<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.929> bam<00:02:10.440> they're<00:02:10.679> done

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
single and damn and bam they're done

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.800 
single and damn and bam they're done
they're<00:02:11.520> on<00:02:11.670> their<00:02:11.849> way<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.180> next

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
they're on their way to the next

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.200 
they're on their way to the next
now<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:14.020> guy<00:02:14.170> squats<00:02:14.530> 405<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.760> can<00:02:15.940> be<00:02:16.060> there

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
now if a guy squats 405 you can be there

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.850 
now if a guy squats 405 you can be there
much<00:02:16.390> longer<00:02:16.630> he's<00:02:17.200> going<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.410> get<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.650> more

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
much longer he's going to get in more

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.250 
much longer he's going to get in more
sets<00:02:18.220> he's<00:02:18.819> going<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.000> get<00:02:19.090> in<00:02:19.209> more<00:02:19.390> reps<00:02:19.720> he's

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
sets he's going to get in more reps he's

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.800 
sets he's going to get in more reps he's
going<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.500> get<00:02:20.620> in<00:02:20.740> more<00:02:20.920> volume<00:02:21.430> he<00:02:22.209> therefore

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
going to get in more volume he therefore

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.770 
going to get in more volume he therefore
he's<00:02:23.290> going<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.470> increase<00:02:23.950> his<00:02:24.130> work<00:02:24.370> capacity

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
he's going to increase his work capacity

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.809 
he's going to increase his work capacity
now<00:02:25.780> if<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.080> comes<00:02:26.290> down<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.800> squatting<00:02:27.250> 315

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
now if it comes down to squatting 315

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.490 
now if it comes down to squatting 315
for<00:02:28.060> reps<00:02:28.300> who<00:02:28.959> do<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.110> think<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.320> going<00:02:29.410> to

win that battle the guy who's stronger

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.040 
win that battle the guy who's stronger
more<00:02:32.920> than<00:02:33.100> likely<00:02:33.280> i<00:02:33.459> mean<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.850> know<00:02:33.930> but<00:02:34.930> the
