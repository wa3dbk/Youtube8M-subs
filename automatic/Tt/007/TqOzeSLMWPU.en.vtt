00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.759
 it turned out that having breakfast at home in 2013 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.830
 completely obsolete 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.050
 nowadays you go to ikea or the hema 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 for a breakfast but it still is 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.110
 so healthy, how about actually 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.910
 to beat 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.910
 we set off with top chef pierre wind 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.320
 go soul considering breakfast english little 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.570

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.840
 breakfast war going on and well i am 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.090
 curious how does breakfast in elten stand for 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.520
 outdoors we start at baker bart 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.520
 there breakfast costs 2 euros 50 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.390
 but they have the opportunity hands do you 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.690
 hear it also be and still fresh 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.969
 nice little town of fresh bread than would 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.239
 it on what's on it 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.049
 it's almost dead after 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.189
 through your cheese cover with the coffee 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.399
 no matter how much you have one 

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:08.860
 for 250 if everything is fresh 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.840
 a good conversation about it 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.060
 after a hefty walk we arrive at the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.830
 intratuin restaurant 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.830
 here the breakfast will cost you 295 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.440
 and this then exposes that rick 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.800
 you cut it open and because it is so sticky 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.340
 is can simply cut with singing lessons 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.340
 then you get this 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.040
 think a sort of spoon full and 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.439

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.799
 McDonald's is the pioneer of this kind 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.369

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.490

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.909
 base when right 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.120
 you simply cannot afford it cheaper than this 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.120
 read 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.769

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.700
 and then finally the pancakes or the 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.730
 Dutch Mini Pancakes 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.209
 they are completely dried out 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.709
 before seeing a normal coffee 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.030
 realize you can just hang on 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.030

 at the hema breakfast only costs you 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:28.020
 1 euro which cost me attention until they stand out 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.510
 in the coffee in a production line 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.300
 it was always cyan 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.840
 the head is less and just the same 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.180

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.170

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.980
 at ikea people are already waiting for 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.770

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.660
 there it also costs only 1 euro 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.110
 but i have to say i am a loaf of bread 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.110
 really bad 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.350

 interesting you what i am here at school 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.050
 but percent is the general taste 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.210
 in things when someone wanted to know how 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.670

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.200
