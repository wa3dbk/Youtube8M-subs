violent fusion hair moisturizing lotion
that<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.409> normally<00:02:25.470> use<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.580> little

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
that I normally use but it's a little

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.520 
that I normally use but it's a little
bit<00:02:26.940> thicker<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:28.830> find<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.970> sets<00:02:30.530> my

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
bit thicker and I find that it sets my

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.800 
bit thicker and I find that it sets my
twist<00:02:31.860> really<00:02:32.370> nicely<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:33.120> almost<00:02:33.269> feels<00:02:33.599> like

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
I have something that could cause kind

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.110
