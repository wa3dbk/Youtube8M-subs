00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.030
 Hello 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.549
 to youtube friends ha ha ha ha ha 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.340
 sorry I'm super mega excited 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.050
 and they know why it's good because 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.480
 rockstar has finally talked about 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.119
 gta 5 not so much info but has clarified 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.730
 some things and they have also published two 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.279
 images of gta 5 which are very 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.259
 but very good girls I'll start by saying 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.680
 the things that rockstar has clarified 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.980
 typical question that is going on with gta 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.860
 5 response from rockstar we are very 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.340
 busy working on the game everything is going 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.600
 ok but the game is a huge project 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.520
 we should have more information and 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.610
 some new assets for you 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.760
 Soon he asks why they do not give us more 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.650
 news response as we said 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.110
 before many times we have had 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.420
 time differences between releases 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.730
 of assets in the previous games and it 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.800
 will continue to do so in the future 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.509
 sorry if you find this 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.000
 frustrating but please understand 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.979
 we do not do this because we do not 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.350
 let's worry about our fans not 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.930
 we respect our fans we hate the 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.700
 gta fans 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.620
 precisely the opposite we do 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.600
 because we want to make sure that only 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.730
 100% information is released 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.260
 correct and because we want to maintain a 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.360
 lots of new things for the 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.070
 real game launch of what 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.740
 there are still a lot of surprises 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.840
 when you play it, the only things that 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.060
 we are concerned are that you enjoy 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.820
 of the experience of playing the game and of 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.890
 give exact information only that we have not 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.810
 been in a position to show more 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.300
 of the game that the trailer and it will not be for 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.950
 one time another thing more they said is 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.350
 that all those betas that walk around 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.360
 Internet are completely false and that 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.460
 be careful because you could fall into 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.170
 a scam plus they do not 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.360
 will take care of things on the internet 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.300
 as images if they are false or true 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.729
 that they leave it to our criterion well 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.770
 friends with this we have ensured that 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.930
 they are not surrounding us they are 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.360
 working hard plus it's obvious 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.190
 that is a hard work the gta 5 since 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.739
 as it is rumored and for me many is 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.780
 true the map of gta 5 will be four 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.209
 times the liberty city of gta 4 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.489
 also rockstar in these affirmations 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.330
 clarified that in Gta 4 there were no planes 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.220
 nor jets due 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.710
 small size of the city but of 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.900
 sure as gta 5 will have forests and will be 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.270
 larger the planes and jets will return 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.490
 good by changing the subject of 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.110
 clarifications I will go on to show the two 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.170
 images published by rock star 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.630
 officially from gta 5 here we have the 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.120
 first we can appreciate the city of 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.580
 the saints like in the very big trailer 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.980
 and beautiful on the left you can see the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.090
 west web event the big building of the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.060
 gta san andreas 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.370
 for me excellent graphics the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.100
 well as detailed clouds 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.530
 the sunset very beautiful x of the unique 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.540
 negative are the lights of the cars 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.790
 which in some cases lead to others 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.620
 sides like for example to some tree to 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.620
 exception that a car has been made 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.720
 xd shit about the helicopter is a 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.270
 police helicopter although I think 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.120
 that was stolen xd now we go to the 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.940
 second image this image almost makes 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.430
 I'm drooling xd we can appreciate 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.410
 a beautiful nature the trees and 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.600
 the detailed palm trees 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.550
 excellent you can see the excellent 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.840
 reflection of trees and buildings 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.680
 in water 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.050
 to 4 but this time much more detailed to the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.269
 look like this is a small neighborhood I do not know 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.069
 if inside or outside the city this 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.470
 I say because of the small houses in the 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.360
 zone at the beginning you see a small 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.299
 harbor with two people sitting 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.190
 apparently wetting his feet in the background 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.470
 you can appreciate the buildings of the 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.730
 City of Saints as the building in 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.769

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.019
