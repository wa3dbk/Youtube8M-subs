that's<00:01:07.900> what<00:01:08.080> it's<00:01:08.229> doing<00:01:08.409> so<00:01:08.560> akka<00:01:09.340> had<00:01:09.550> that

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
that's what it's doing so akka had that

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.219 
that's what it's doing so akka had that
completely<00:01:10.210> wrong<00:01:10.479> and<00:01:10.509> I've<00:01:10.869> been<00:01:10.960> trying<00:01:11.170> to

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
completely wrong and I've been trying to

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.630 
completely wrong and I've been trying to
figure<00:01:11.409> out<00:01:11.530> why<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.800> hasn't<00:01:12.220> been<00:01:12.430> working

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
figure out why it hasn't been working

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.960 
figure out why it hasn't been working
and<00:01:13.630> that<00:01:13.869> was<00:01:14.050> one<00:01:14.289> of<00:01:14.440> the<00:01:14.500> reasons<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.850> it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
and that was one of the reasons so it

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.480 
and that was one of the reasons so it
looks<00:01:16.149> like<00:01:16.240> we<00:01:16.869> finally<00:01:17.140> have<00:01:17.490> something

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
looks like we finally have something

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.740 
looks like we finally have something
going<00:01:18.700> I'm<00:01:18.940> gonna<00:01:19.119> do<00:01:19.240> something<00:01:19.539> haven't

chamber we have here this is the new
chamber<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.910> made<00:01:57.260> this<00:01:58.260> chamber<00:01:58.620> is

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
chamber that I just made this chamber is

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.270 
chamber that I just made this chamber is
fantastic<00:01:59.580> I<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.660> it's<00:02:01.100> something<00:02:02.100> I'm

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
fantastic I think it's something I'm

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.910 
fantastic I think it's something I'm
going<00:02:02.370> to<00:02:02.430> tell<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.670> manufacture<00:02:03.180> about<00:02:03.920> they

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
going to tell the manufacture about they

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.540 
going to tell the manufacture about they
are<00:02:05.270> spring-loaded<00:02:06.270> down<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:07.080> but<00:02:07.550> there

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
are spring-loaded down here but there

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.410 
are spring-loaded down here but there
needs<00:02:08.730> to<00:02:08.910> be<00:02:09.030> some<00:02:09.330> weight<00:02:09.540> on<00:02:09.720> top<00:02:09.930> as<00:02:10.140> well<00:02:10.290> I

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
needs to be some weight on top as well I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.580 
needs to be some weight on top as well I
could<00:02:12.420> make<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.960> spring<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> little<00:02:13.350> tighter

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
could make the spring a little tighter

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.050 
could make the spring a little tighter
but<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.830> thing<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.040> was<00:02:14.160> gonna<00:02:14.460> be<00:02:14.670> saying<00:02:14.910> is

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
but the thing I was gonna be saying is

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.390 
but the thing I was gonna be saying is
it's<00:02:15.210> starting<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.690> fall<00:02:15.810> off<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.990> table<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:17.370> I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
it's starting to fall off the table so I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.040 
it's starting to fall off the table so I
need<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.670> capture<00:02:17.850> this<00:02:18.150> material<00:02:18.930> that's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
need to capture this material that's

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.660 
need to capture this material that's
coming<00:02:19.290> out<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:21.620> have<00:02:22.620> an<00:02:22.710> idea<00:02:22.980> how<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.160> catch

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
coming out I have an idea how to catch

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.020 
coming out I have an idea how to catch
that<00:02:23.970> but<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.810> looks<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.250> we<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.460> something

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
that but it looks like we have something

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.990 
that but it looks like we have something
happening<00:02:27.360> right<00:02:27.720> here
