00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:24.800
 so to speak gooseberry we took 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:33.010
 gooseberry cleaned it of these here 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:37.100
 hooks washed and decided to dry it in 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.299
 electric dryers so to speak we have already dried 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.739
 his three days that is for the night we turned off 

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:47.299
 in the afternoon we dried all day long 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:51.710

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:40.440
 so to say the experiment to taste he became 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.390
 very sour though when we ripped it off 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.890

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.509
 sour that is, we have not been in three days 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.640
 able to dry what we have here 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:04.160
