scratch<00:05:12.130> there's<00:05:13.130> just<00:05:13.250> no<00:05:13.460> way<00:05:13.700> you<00:05:13.730> can<00:05:14.000> just

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
scratch there's just no way you can just

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.330 
scratch there's just no way you can just
get<00:05:14.390> this<00:05:14.630> texturing<00:05:15.260> here<00:05:15.530> and<00:05:15.830> go<00:05:16.040> okay

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
get this texturing here and go okay

let's<00:05:16.610> put<00:05:16.760> it<00:05:16.820> in<00:05:16.880> the<00:05:16.970> ps4<00:05:17.240> engine<00:05:17.750> it's<00:05:17.870> way

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
let's put it in the ps4 engine it's way

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.590 
let's put it in the ps4 engine it's way
too<00:05:18.230> complicated<00:05:18.740> or<00:05:19.250> they<00:05:19.610> just<00:05:20.270> leave<00:05:20.419> the

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
too complicated or they just leave the

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.260 
too complicated or they just leave the
graphics<00:05:21.020> as<00:05:21.200> it<00:05:21.350> is<00:05:21.500> but<00:05:21.800> just<00:05:22.060> turn<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.180> into

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
graphics as it is but just turn it into

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.260 
graphics as it is but just turn it into
1080p<00:05:24.080> yeah<00:05:24.950> but<00:05:25.130> see<00:05:25.310> that<00:05:25.790> doesn't<00:05:26.060> make<00:05:26.120> any

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
1080p yeah but see that doesn't make any

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.030 
1080p yeah but see that doesn't make any
sense<00:05:26.570> because<00:05:26.930> you<00:05:27.320> can't<00:05:27.590> because<00:05:27.919> the

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
sense because you can't because the

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
plugins there's absolutely no way that

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.659 
plugins there's absolutely no way that

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
you would be able to that you actually

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.400 
you would be able to that you actually
are<00:05:44.240> shit<00:05:44.510> if<00:05:44.630> they're<00:05:44.780> gonna<00:05:44.960> go<00:05:45.080> to<00:05:45.140> my<00:05:45.260> way

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
are shit if they're gonna go to my way

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.560 
are shit if they're gonna go to my way
there's<00:05:45.919> no<00:05:46.100> way<00:05:46.280> that<00:05:46.400> you<00:05:46.490> can<00:05:46.640> upscale<00:05:47.360> it

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
there's no way that you can upscale it

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.210 
there's no way that you can upscale it
anymore<00:05:47.870> than<00:05:48.260> it<00:05:48.380> is<00:05:48.500> it<00:05:48.650> would<00:05:48.740> have<00:05:48.770> to<00:05:49.100> be

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
anymore than it is it would have to be

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.650 
anymore than it is it would have to be
redone<00:05:49.669> the<00:05:49.850> textures<00:05:50.240> would<00:05:50.330> have<00:05:50.479> to<00:05:50.570> be

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
redone the textures would have to be

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.880 
redone the textures would have to be
remade<00:05:51.020> because<00:05:51.110> if<00:05:51.260> you<00:05:51.350> zoom<00:05:51.530> into<00:05:51.710> these

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
remade because if you zoom into these

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.219 
remade because if you zoom into these
textures<00:05:52.340> they're<00:05:52.490> old<00:05:52.700> they're<00:05:52.940> about<00:05:53.120> 32<00:05:54.050> by

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
textures they're old they're about 32 by

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.920 
textures they're old they're about 32 by
32<00:05:54.620> pixels<00:05:54.979> maybe<00:05:55.430> even<00:05:55.640> 16<00:05:56.120> by<00:05:56.270> 16<00:05:56.330> they'd

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
32 pixels maybe even 16 by 16 they'd

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.980 
32 pixels maybe even 16 by 16 they'd
have<00:05:57.140> to<00:05:57.320> literally<00:05:58.180> literally<00:05:59.180> change<00:05:59.660> the

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
have to literally literally change the

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.020 
have to literally literally change the
entire<00:06:00.470> game<00:06:00.830> they'd<00:06:01.460> have<00:06:01.580> to<00:06:01.729> they'd<00:06:01.940> have

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
entire game they'd have to they'd have

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.060 
entire game they'd have to they'd have
to<00:06:02.180> retexture<00:06:02.930> a<00:06:03.110> little<00:06:03.410> bit<00:06:03.500> have<00:06:03.590> to<00:06:03.710> change

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
to retexture a little bit have to change

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.430 
to retexture a little bit have to change
the<00:06:04.280> code<00:06:04.490> because<00:06:04.880> ps1<00:06:05.720> has<00:06:05.840> a<00:06:05.870> completely

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
the code because ps1 has a completely

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.800 
the code because ps1 has a completely
different<00:06:06.620> game<00:06:07.220> creation<00:06:07.810> architecture

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
different game creation architecture

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.500 
different game creation architecture
than<00:06:09.560> the<00:06:09.830> ps2<00:06:10.310> and<00:06:10.340> the<00:06:10.580> ps3<00:06:10.880> and<00:06:11.240> the<00:06:11.270> ps4

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
than the ps2 and the ps3 and the ps4

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.200 
than the ps2 and the ps3 and the ps4
it's<00:06:12.320> very<00:06:12.710> complicated<00:06:13.280> you<00:06:13.370> can't<00:06:13.669> see<00:06:14.060> with

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
it's very complicated you can't see with

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.380 
it's very complicated you can't see with
ps2<00:06:14.660> -<00:06:14.780> ps3<00:06:15.380> it's<00:06:15.979> just<00:06:16.250> a<00:06:16.340> matter<00:06:16.520> of<00:06:16.669> having

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
ps2 - ps3 it's just a matter of having

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.540 
ps2 - ps3 it's just a matter of having
to<00:06:17.690> upscale<00:06:18.260> and<00:06:18.530> read<00:06:18.770> through<00:06:18.950> the<00:06:19.070> textures

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
to upscale and read through the textures

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.840 
to upscale and read through the textures
you<00:06:20.030> know<00:06:20.150> and<00:06:20.690> fix<00:06:20.960> it<00:06:21.110> but<00:06:21.260> with<00:06:21.380> ps1<00:06:22.190> it's<00:06:22.729> a

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
you know and fix it but with ps1 it's a

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.760 
you know and fix it but with ps1 it's a
completely<00:06:23.390> different<00:06:23.750> system<00:06:24.169> it's<00:06:24.650> a

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
completely different system it's a

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.279 
completely different system it's a
completely<00:06:25.280> different<00:06:25.550> thing<00:06:26.060> so<00:06:26.090> if<00:06:26.750> they

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
completely different thing so if they

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:28.690 
completely different thing so if they
redid<00:06:27.770> it<00:06:27.830> that<00:06:28.039> have<00:06:28.160> to

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
redid it that have to

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.970 
redid it that have to
we<00:06:28.760> do<00:06:29.000> it<00:06:29.180> from<00:06:29.450> scratch<00:06:29.660> just<00:06:30.170> like<00:06:30.680> they<00:06:30.920> did

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
we do it from scratch just like they did

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.340 
we do it from scratch just like they did
with<00:06:31.280> a<00:06:31.340> Tony<00:06:31.730> Hawk's<00:06:32.000> Pro<00:06:32.270> Skater<00:06:32.300> they<00:06:33.170> did

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
with a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater they did

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.310 
with a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater they did
that<00:06:33.940> when<00:06:34.940> they<00:06:35.030> did<00:06:35.180> the<00:06:35.270> HD<00:06:35.630> remaster<00:06:36.260> of

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
that when they did the HD remaster of

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320 
that when they did the HD remaster of
that<00:06:36.530> or<00:06:37.010> remake<00:06:37.670> or<00:06:37.910> wouldn't<00:06:38.090> be<00:06:38.150> able<00:06:38.210> to

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
that or remake or wouldn't be able to

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.510 
that or remake or wouldn't be able to
call<00:06:38.480> it<00:06:38.630> but<00:06:38.810> yeah<00:06:39.620> it's<00:06:39.830> you<00:06:40.160> know<00:06:40.250> I<00:06:40.280> would

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
call it but yeah it's you know I would

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.070 
call it but yeah it's you know I would
like<00:06:40.670> I'd<00:06:40.880> love<00:06:41.060> to<00:06:41.180> see<00:06:41.390> it<00:06:41.480> but<00:06:41.660> yeah<00:06:41.960> that

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
like I'd love to see it but yeah that

like I'd love to see it but yeah that
was<00:06:42.140> double-header

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
was double-header

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.450 
was double-header
and<00:06:43.070> that<00:06:43.280> was<00:06:43.400> the<00:06:43.520> third<00:06:43.790> and<00:06:44.150> final<00:06:45.460> third
