you want to do it on the right that's
entirely<00:00:12.660> up<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.230> but<00:00:14.070> what<00:00:14.219> you'll<00:00:14.370> need

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
entirely up to you but what you'll need

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.650 
entirely up to you but what you'll need
to<00:00:14.639> do<00:00:14.759> then<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.660> have<00:00:15.900> your<00:00:16.619> left<00:00:16.859> leg<00:00:17.070> out

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
to do then is you have your left leg out

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.160 
to do then is you have your left leg out
but<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.779> put<00:00:18.960> your<00:00:19.109> right<00:00:19.320> leg<00:00:19.350> into<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.550> hoop

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
but you put your right leg into the hoop

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.340 
but you put your right leg into the hoop
so<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.260> put<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.439> leg<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.580> leg<00:00:23.760> out

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
so you put one leg in and one leg out

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.040 
so you put one leg in and one leg out
then<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.680> need<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.510> your<00:00:27.510> left

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
then what you need to do is your left
leg<00:00:28.289> will<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> pushing<00:00:30.320> or<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.890> have

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
leg will do the pushing or if you have

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.560 
leg will do the pushing or if you have
it<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.250> other<00:00:32.340> way<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.579> right<00:00:32.969> leg<00:00:33.210> would<00:00:33.450> do

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
it the other way the right leg would do

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.700 
it the other way the right leg would do
the<00:00:33.660> pushing<00:00:34.160> so<00:00:35.300> you<00:00:36.300> want<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.600> push<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.469> hoop
