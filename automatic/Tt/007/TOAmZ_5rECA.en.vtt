00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.800
 hello to everyone with you lech and this is the 22 series 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.920
 funny and funny moments of the world 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.920
 tanks 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.070
 for a start we have a game in 1st dung 111 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.349
 zigfried line on the map in defense mode 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.259
 he holds the right flank taking cover 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.620
 hill as here he flies from the bomb 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.030
 art that is not visible well our player 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.820
 it doesn't stop 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.010
 ved trying to calculate the position of the artifacts by 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.140
 marker direction of the enemy's shot 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.820
 and after all gets the same 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.640
 and this despite the fact that he had caught fire 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.580
 light bulb and he hurried to pass 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.920
 back and shot in motion but here's the mouse 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.360
 like this, even the future is not illuminated 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.970
 you can not feel full 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.070
 security on the art I'm players 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.070
 just seek revenge on you 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.600
 in the second moment we have a master 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.190
 contactless battle famously 34 on light 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.560
 Tanker ru 251 on it go t-54 and our 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.470
 the hero becomes a shot for the enemy 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.080
 well famously shoots back and how master 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.570
 aikido carries the opponent along 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.820
 then easily dodges a shot 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.200
 t-54 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.800
 stops and the average tank 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.660
 inertia flies farther and crashes 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:40.710
 great presentation admission selection 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:43.410
 melee and now master class on 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.810
 shooting ahead of the game for the game by 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.450
 anti-age on trials g 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.729
 our hero took the pants on to the relay has 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.810
 the ability to shoot through almost 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.119
 enemy bases 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.149
 see rushing at full speed more often 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.759
 selects the trajectory to advance and without 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.700
 information shoots a very long flight 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.039
 projectile because this fabasnitsa and hit 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.229
 in slow motion it seems that our 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.420
 the hero just bummed in the direction 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.420
 Partly tried to get himself under the projectile 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.300
 however there was an exact shot at 500 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.849
 15 meters from the landfill on the moving 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.270
 full speed opponent worthy of the title 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.270
 sniper 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.629
 4 points we have a master blinds player about 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.060
 so wenge on sender he MK7 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.640
 the annoying firefly is constantly hiding 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.980
 behind the stone, vanishing the light and our hero 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.489
 clever padla pours it on it 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.319
 destroying all 132 without light though 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.810
 maybe he just shot another 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.489
 tanks it happened anyway you 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.480
 you know how it will no longer bother 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:57.450
 our hero but not just our hero 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.400
 master of the blinds after a couple of minutes of the fight he 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.319
 repeats his trick this time victim 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.799
 the art tiger p 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.230
 although our hero recovered another art T92 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.829
 but nobody leaves alive from ours 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.829
 masters 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.170
 lastly we have an object 140 which 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.860
 turned out to be one on one with heavy british 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.170
 fv215b pkhp advantage is not in favor with a 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.810
 ship which controls the Soviet masto 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.300
 but this advantage equalizes the ally 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.100
 the truth anyway british cause more 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.840
 damage and most likely the object is not 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.920
 get out the winner in this 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.840
 martial arts 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.330
 but in the confrontation in the Soviet 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.480
 British technician intervenes in b and 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.880
 decides for them the outcome of the battle with. twists 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.850
 turntable and both tanks sent to 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.960
 hangar destroying each other 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.390
 unexpected intervention of higher powers 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.370
 leaves open the question of who would 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.930
 won the soviet middle or 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.930
 british heavy tank 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.060
