00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.589
 lately I've always wondered something 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.199
 how the saga of exe file as3 dize would have really existed 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.120
 to be precise and is addressing three chapters to me 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.740
 put all we are waiting for fourth of course 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.900
 - we can attribute to them. chronological order starting from second to 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.710
 then move on to the first and finally to the third 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.180
 7 waiting for the fourth 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.640
 it is absolutely necessary to premise that in real life ghosts do not exist 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.200
 and therefore for this time we will not talk about animatronics and possessed by souls 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.450
 but simply a robot 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.359
 then 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.400
 how it could all be started 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.380
 the desire to succeed with a catering offer to then extend 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.650
 the chain is a good pension for a wealthy entrepreneur 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.010
 but one in particular has decided to focus on an exclusive novelty in 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.990
 that year 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.600
 exact that animatronics 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.630
 tasty robots and high technology capable of playing a role 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.630
 entertainment for the youngest customers 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.740
 obviously being a novelty the cold faxes via bissa is only a proposal 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.890
 commercial still in the experimental phase 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.190
 if successful, our entrepreneurs spread alibi take on the fair 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.180
 restorative chain 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 unfortunately the opposite will happen 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.759
 the cause rather the possible causes of the failure can be 2 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.400
 the first the murder sheets of cinco more children by an employee 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.630
 alias papagayo 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.900
 the tragedy would indeed raise a colossal controversy with a consequent 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.899
 negative impact on the entire clientele 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.580
 such a negative publicity that the project of our poor fails 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.199
 entrepreneurs 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.629
 to forget babbabia in the pool run away 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.050
 but cleanliness will know who it is 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.280
 thanks to the information provided on the employees by the owner and therefore his 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.939
 first name 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.439
 ginseng 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.699
 the second possible causes the bite of 87 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.879
 and here in I know it's touching a sensitive issue 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.280
 I know that many of you are still in search of real morbidity 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.599
 but without wasting time we say that one has given an animatronics 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:42.659
 . 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.639
 the malfunction of the robots and it is not a novelty in fact the 4 originals are 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.749
 already been set aside 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:53.859
 unfortunately it seems to be a problem that persists even in other animatronics 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.119
 but if they no longer have the spirit that liquidator they attack 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.749
 the answer will be given to us in the first game 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.200
 concluding the bite will unleash the death of a child 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.349
 causing the same bankruptcy effect that would have been created with the murder by 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.619
 part of whitebeard 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:16.609
 these two factors we can also combine them thus causing total closure 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.439
 Business 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.809
 all that remains of our unfortunate entrepreneur is the mortgage 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:28.039
 after a few years someone always very rich decides to buy back 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:30.779
 to renovate the entire pizzeria 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:35.939
 for football the idea was probably not going to fail if it wasn't 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.479
 for the two factors 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:41.759
 guilty it was only necessary to wait a little while to regain confidence 

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:43.399
 of customers 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:47.129
 but above all or correct the defects of animatronics 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.170
 with the decision to keep only the four main ones 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.009
 probably due to the high cost of repairs 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.189
 but this is not enough in mortal fault still persists despite the 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:01.479
 changes 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.439
 now emo hair because cold and good company attack us without 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.679
 reason 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.189
 in reality there is a reason 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.189
 and he tells us his own mushroom in one of his phone calls 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:17.809
 in fact it will be said that animatronics are recognized as endoskeleton without 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:18.849
 suit 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.059
 the horoscope is to wear one there 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:26.029
 but their mechanical strength will be fatal to our body 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.860
 the guardian person of normal intellect as soon as he will notice the 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.490
 danger and violence is true I could dismiss the space was the 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.180
 voice of danger on the spot 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.969
 or he will file a complaint against the dullness of the boss 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:45.789
 closed in his idea of ​​not wanting to get rid of the automata for anybody 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.800
 reason to the world 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.879
 however, word of mouth will bring to light the 87 episode 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.779
 absolute holy chica of fidenza to the whole impenna 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.779
 and the same failure of previous years 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.140
 after second failure our par bolgari returns to the place fearing to have 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.610
 left too few hints that could lead him to it 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.409
 he finds himself escaping again to a sudden police blitz ha 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.120
 triggered by reports of someone who recognized him 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.489
 without any escape he will hide himself in a very old man 

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:25.849
 animatronics also abandoned due to malfunction 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.059
 and sex and cedra some we all know 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.930
 after about 30 years in a total state of abandonment the building will be demolished 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.069
 together with all gianni matronix 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.119
 the story of the tragedy combined with the madness of the robots has now become 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:44.789
 quite famous 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.539
 and apparently someone can still profit from it 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.159
 comment 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.650
 you will notice that many amusement parks are present 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:56.449
 attractions with horror background 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.150
 This individual's video will be to buy image rights of the 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.189
 pizzeria 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:04.159
 and use them to create a new horror attraction 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:07.589
 inside an amusement park 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:12.059
 the attraction will be based on a guided tour through a believer 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:16.919
 reproduction of the pizzeria with actors dressed as animatronics who 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.180
 they will scare people 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.809
 there will be practically no danger 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:25.129
 except for those who suffer from heart obviously 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.360
 A promotional advantage is possible because the traction is based on history 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.639
 actually happened 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.020
 there will be the interest of many bull enthusiasts 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.340
 if you then want to finish the third chapter with a fire you can do it 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.340
 hundreds of possibilities. rire 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.670
 bennet, you little boys with this finished now we just have to wait 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.729
 faina ex asf 24
