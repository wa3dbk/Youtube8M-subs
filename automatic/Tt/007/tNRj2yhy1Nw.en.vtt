adult size shoes there's two different
versions<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.680> doll<00:01:16.979> there's<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
versions of this doll there's a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.090 
versions of this doll there's a
automated<00:01:18.180> version<00:01:18.479> which<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.290> robotic<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
automated version which is robotic and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.580 
automated version which is robotic and
that's<00:01:20.460> powered<00:01:20.759> by<00:01:20.790> electricity<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:22.170> then

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that's powered by electricity and then

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.580 
that's powered by electricity and then
there's<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.070> manual<00:01:23.820> version<00:01:24.140> which<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> non

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
there's a manual version which is a non

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.990 
there's a manual version which is a non
robotic<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.369> powered<00:01:26.670> by<00:01:26.790> your

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
robotic and that's powered by your

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.770 
robotic and that's powered by your
imagination

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
imagination

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.819 
imagination
so<00:01:28.650> she<00:01:28.820> functions<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.960> she's<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> ton

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
so she functions so she's got like a ton

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
so she functions so she's got like a ton
of<00:01:31.890> servo<00:01:32.130> motors<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> moment<00:01:33.930> she's

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
of servo motors and at the moment she's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.399 
of servo motors and at the moment she's
powered<00:01:34.259> by<00:01:34.439> Android<00:01:35.400> device<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.450> she<00:01:36.540> can

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
powered by Android device so she can

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.960 
powered by Android device so she can
pair<00:01:37.590> up<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> various<00:01:38.280> api's<00:01:38.700> like

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
pair up with the various api's like

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.780 
pair up with the various api's like
