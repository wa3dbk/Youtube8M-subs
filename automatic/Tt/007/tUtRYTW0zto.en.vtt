but I personally think udn is superior

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.750 
but I personally think udn is superior
because<00:04:13.109> of<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.620> higher<00:04:13.769> customized<00:04:14.310> ability

but also the high amount of available

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.439 
but also the high amount of available
actions<00:04:16.829> which<00:04:17.459> makes<00:04:17.729> it<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.060> much<00:04:18.209> more
