the might love it lead model with a

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.650 
the might love it lead model with a
small<00:02:46.850> booster<00:02:47.330> this<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.990> only<00:02:48.580> 30<00:02:49.580> grams<00:02:50.240> on

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.870 
small booster this is only 30 grams on
here<00:02:51.020> again<00:02:51.350> screwed<00:02:51.770> on<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.700> mouthpiece

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
here again screwed on to the mouthpiece

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.330 
here again screwed on to the mouthpiece
cup<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:54.140> diameter<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.680> cup<00:02:54.830> is<00:02:55.010> slightly

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
cup the diameter of the cup is slightly

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.760 
cup the diameter of the cup is slightly
smaller<00:02:55.640> than<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.880> studio<00:02:56.380> helping<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:57.680> the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
smaller than the studio helping in the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.290 
smaller than the studio helping in the
upper<00:02:57.980> register<00:02:58.459> but<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.820> bat<00:02:58.970> bore<00:02:59.180> is

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
upper register but the bat bore is

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.570 
upper register but the bat bore is
rather<00:02:59.480> large<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.770> helps<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.190> get<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.370> air

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
rather large so it helps to get the air

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.360 
rather large so it helps to get the air
through<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.300> hopefully<00:03:02.690> create<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:03.290> big<00:03:04.040> sound

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
through and hopefully create a big sound

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.030 
through and hopefully create a big sound
when<00:03:04.910> playing<00:03:05.180> high<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.680> just<00:03:06.890> give<00:03:07.010> a
