building back in the 20s and they needed
a<00:01:26.900> smaller<00:01:27.260> locomotive<00:01:28.040> for<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.700> lot<00:01:29.090> of<00:01:29.120> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
a smaller locomotive for a lot of the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.580 
a smaller locomotive for a lot of the
side<00:01:29.540> drifts<00:01:29.870> where<00:01:29.990> they<00:01:30.080> couldn't<00:01:30.350> run

their large electrical cord to run the
main<00:01:32.420> locomotive<00:01:33.170> they<00:01:33.710> used<00:01:34.010> these<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.580> it's

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
main locomotive they used these and it's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.390 
main locomotive they used these and it's
called<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.510> little<00:01:35.780> tram<00:01:36.110> or<00:01:36.320> because<00:01:36.830> men

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
called the little tram or because men

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.980 
called the little tram or because men
that<00:01:37.580> push<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.940> ore<00:01:38.060> cars<00:01:38.390> around<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.750> mines

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
that push the ore cars around the mines

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.590 
that push the ore cars around the mines
were<00:01:39.200> called<00:01:39.470> tram<00:01:39.800> errs<00:01:40.010> and<00:01:40.480> what<00:01:41.480> they

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
were called tram errs and what they

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.510 
were called tram errs and what they
found<00:01:41.780> out<00:01:42.020> it<00:01:42.170> was<00:01:42.260> that<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.680> man<00:01:43.100> could<00:01:43.310> push

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
found out it was that a man could push

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.420 
found out it was that a man could push
about<00:01:43.820> 25<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.690> 30<00:01:44.900> pounds<00:01:45.410> of<00:01:45.590> lateral<00:01:46.130> force

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
about 25 to 30 pounds of lateral force

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.520 
about 25 to 30 pounds of lateral force
along<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.000> tracks<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.320> little

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
along the tracks and that the little

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.650 
along the tracks and that the little
tram<00:01:48.860> er<00:01:48.890> could<00:01:49.370> do<00:01:49.520> much<00:01:49.760> more<00:01:49.790> than<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:50.390> and

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
tram er could do much more than that and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.540 
tram er could do much more than that and
so<00:01:51.230> it<00:01:51.290> was<00:01:51.380> much<00:01:51.530> more<00:01:51.740> efficient<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:52.400> make

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
so it was much more efficient and make

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.850 
so it was much more efficient and make
it<00:01:52.670> load<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.910> lot<00:01:53.210> more<00:01:53.450> or<00:01:53.720> using<00:01:54.500> these<00:01:54.620> little

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
it load a lot more or using these little

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.650 
it load a lot more or using these little
tremors<00:01:55.310> instead<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.730> just<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:56.000> man<00:01:56.210> pushing<00:01:56.600> a

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
tremors instead of just a man pushing a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.630 
tremors instead of just a man pushing a
car<00:01:56.900> so<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:57.920> pretty<00:01:58.040> much<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.280> man's

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
car so this is pretty much the man's

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.880 
car so this is pretty much the man's
best<00:01:59.030> friend<00:01:59.420> this<00:01:59.810> is<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.990> man's<00:02:00.230> best<00:02:00.440> friend

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
best friend this is a man's best friend

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.170 
best friend this is a man's best friend
they<00:02:00.980> loved<00:02:01.220> riding<00:02:01.400> around<00:02:01.640> on<00:02:01.790> these<00:02:01.970> things

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
they loved riding around on these things

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.850 
they loved riding around on these things
and<00:02:02.480> not<00:02:02.600> having<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.870> push<00:02:03.080> them<00:02:03.230> by<00:02:03.350> hand<00:02:03.590> I

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
and not having to push them by hand I

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.160 
and not having to push them by hand I
bet<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.280> was<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.460> sheriff's<00:02:05.270> job<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.870> be<00:02:06.020> the

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
bet it was a sheriff's job to be the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.139 
bet it was a sheriff's job to be the
little<00:02:06.380> tram<00:02:06.590> driver<00:02:06.950> absolutely<00:02:07.760> it's<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.000> lot
