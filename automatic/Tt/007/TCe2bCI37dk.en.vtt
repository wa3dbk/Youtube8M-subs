think<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.010> trick<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.430> though<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.940> just

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
think the trick to this though is just

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.080 
think the trick to this though is just
being<00:00:39.510> quick<00:00:40.340> like<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> thing<00:00:42.059> is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
being quick like that but the thing is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.869 
being quick like that but the thing is
if<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.989> fall<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:44.010> know<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:45.530> okay<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:47.370> appear

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
if we fall you know we okay just appear

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.670 
if we fall you know we okay just appear
out<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.090> nowhere<00:00:48.239> sure<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.530> what

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
out of nowhere sure you know what

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.069 
out of nowhere sure you know what
actually<00:00:49.860> here's<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.489> we're<00:00:50.579> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> do

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
actually here's what we're going to do

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.319 
actually here's what we're going to do
turn<00:00:52.079> leave<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.350> civility<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.129> if<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.090> fall

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
turn leave in civility on and if we fall

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.959 
turn leave in civility on and if we fall
damage<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> level

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
damage is going to go to them to level

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
getting it looks like that level but my

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.800
