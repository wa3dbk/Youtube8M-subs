high acuity patients that require
frequently<00:01:03.260> multiple<00:01:04.260> visits<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.010> to

frequently multiple visits and we get to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.160 
frequently multiple visits and we get to
know<00:01:05.250> those<00:01:05.369> patients<00:01:05.880> pretty<00:01:06.119> well<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.930> also

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
know those patients pretty well we also

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.280 
know those patients pretty well we also
see<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> wide<00:01:08.070> variety<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.729> general<00:01:09.330> pediatrics

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290

for kind of short time hospitalization

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.030 
for kind of short time hospitalization
so<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.280> nice<00:01:14.460> variety

investigating<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.800> case<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.400> then<00:01:31.640> we<00:01:31.880> reach

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
investigating the case and then we reach

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.560 
investigating the case and then we reach
kind<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.960> discussion<00:01:33.410> and<00:01:33.680> in<00:01:33.770> conclusion
