00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:45.410
 we are completely there we are not both 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.910
 more the most stable kreuzbergers have 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.890
 we need to continue a bit 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.630
 training to build our muscles and 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.940
 we do that in the gym so yes 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.820
 we are now relaxed that is 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.650
 stop our local study with the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.360
 learned how the fitness is 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.740
 an important component and especially at 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.900
 injuries healed cruciate ligament rupture 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.760
 because that was a lot because ours 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.330
 fitness is the first course of truth 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.820
 in April 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.770
 that was an innsbruck in the hall that 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.360
 was pretty timely with the contest with 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.790
 the first stop and I'm over then 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.960
 the jumped was that you finally 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.180
 you have a bit of a problem 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.340
 and has to expose my foot and 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.119
 then it's easy to side like 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.220
 broken away 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.380
 and that's where we have to go now 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.770
 So start after my cruciate ligament tore 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.720
 in czechia in todtnau was yes 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.020
 twice the arthroscopy is operated once 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.000
 and cruciate your missions and now 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.860
 here would always be a petri or with 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.710
 philipp in area in berlin afterwards times 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.570
 a lot of exercise gets stronger again 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.880
 hopefully not my big luck 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.440
 that's what happened is so 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.899
 innsbruck sovereignty the most blatant 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.550
 Knee specialist this forgives then was 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.380
 somehow I'll be back three months later 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.509
 on the bike and I drove my first 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.500
 this is very fast and easy for me 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.899
 unfortunately had to be back a month later 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.610
 razed to settle and now once 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.770
 you and start again 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.580
 yes I am first of all a lot 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.930
 Bicycle rides for road bike and 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.700
 Of course, I am also many again 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.490
 driven by the knee always wants 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.500
 stronger and stronger and I realize already 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.050
 So again slowly pretty normal 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.310
 So feels like training before 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.600
 definitely brings a lot 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.610
 So I can only recommend to everyone 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.140
 So what you have to train a lot because 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.450
 it really bites my way 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.640
 second cruciate ligament tear 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.140
 how could not believe it 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.850
 system at the op my mobile phone a hand 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.710
 pressed to take some pictures 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.990
 can and the thing is tracked and now 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.190
 really cool things shot 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.840
 at that time has an animal with the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.250
 atoss copies where you just the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.950
 The tower had the camera on his knee 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.970
 then the broken cross was back then 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.660
 even that's right 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.250
 that's why it's so different and different 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.340
 which the fabric is specified and all 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.950
 say here still very cool with that 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.120
 the hose and knee drainage that 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.690
 also pretty cool and that even 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.690
 pull yourself out 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.700
 we own local spot here we drive 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.260
 I've been here for seven years 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.939
 formerly also stood quite 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.069
 small hills that were so big 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.920
 and a few years ago started the 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.409
 all build large oversized 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.780
 and a week ago his route still 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.280
 So, from about that point , have everything 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.140
 That's a little bit done 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.140
 Film can send a new route 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.120
 Unfortunately, the track is not like this today 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.890
 cool but there in the morning when the in 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.670
 unfortunately you still have to drive finnentrop 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.670
 a few box office tricks 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.330
 So a lot has happened today 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.440
 how to work in the gym and afterwards 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.930
 I can give the spot the best conditions 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.280
 was hard to drive but get it 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.340
 the relatively stable and I guess 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.290
 tomorrow we hit, that's me 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.760
 have prospects directly and where the 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.800
 lever bond and who would have the 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.050
 almost exactly between berlin and between 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.460
 potsdam europe , he is pretty cool so 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.020
 as a little boy we could without 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.400
 problems stop two stations with the 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.410
 train with melo park or at the 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.610
 potsdamern skateparks and we have with 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.690
 Of course , time is one has 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.830
 not just focused on asking 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.930
 but just a bit on 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.739
 sightseeing or eating out with you 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.759
 friends 

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:19.369
 Tattoo everything and there and there 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.349
 Berlin is already quite diverse as 

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:22.969
 tattooing has just said is just 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.709
 also a pretty thing was itself 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.059
 pretty crowded in the evening but here 

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:27.739
 is a small job free and 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.389
 maybe we'll get the nature in 

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:32.229
 to drive berlin and maybe one 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.229
 he really has a little time
