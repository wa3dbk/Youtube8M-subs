00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.230
 hello everyone with you again robot i love 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.410
 play 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.259
 tanchiki but my money broke and mom 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.900
 said she wouldn't buy me anymore 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.199
 because I will break it again 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.260
 the wall at the next sink so I 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.370
 downloaded the world of tanks from the internet and now 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.190
 merge here and today i will show you how 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.930
 easily get a medal 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.120
 scout and sentinel in one battle 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.080
 without doing anything 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.640
 the easiest way is to get what we need on 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.150
 tank 1 damage and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.900
 any tank will do but the faster it will be 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.260
 tank the greater the success rate the same way us 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.560
 surely you need 2 modules 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.199
 stereo tube 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.250
 and disguise to play the role 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.590
 all seeing 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.830
 and the inconspicuous ninja tank now when 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.710
 we got ready we got to get on 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.430
 card is a robin but only from the side 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.690
 izba we need as quickly as possible 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.020
 getting into the bushes in the middle of the field is more dangerous 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.020
 just wade into these bushes but 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.240
 a chance to get two medals above 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.090
 it is here if we have not been noticed by all 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.900
 what we can do is just wait until the end 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.930
 round 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.120
 and it doesn't matter who 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.120
 will win if you are killed 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.380
 then you will get one sentinel if 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.189
 stay alive 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.990
 it is also a scout 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.130
 remember that it becomes possible 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.140
 precisely because of the harder masking 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.340
 watch the whole fight is not necessary because 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.299
 so everything is clear 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.679
 you shine allies minus opponents 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.530
 and then all together you are going to finish off 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.980
 You will now see the results tables. 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.330
 this fight 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.450
 and I say goodbye to you until the next video 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.450
 bye everyone 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.690
 go away
