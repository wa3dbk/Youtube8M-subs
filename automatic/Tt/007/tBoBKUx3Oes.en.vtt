physics<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.549> answer<00:03:06.939> profit<00:03:07.659> if<00:03:08.109> you're<00:03:08.319> a

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
physics the answer profit if you're a

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.899 
physics the answer profit if you're a
bargain<00:03:08.709> anyway<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.640> guess<00:03:10.269> anyway

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
bargain anyway I guess anyway

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.490 
bargain anyway I guess anyway
watch<00:03:12.909> this<00:03:13.030> was<00:03:13.239> on<00:03:13.359> sale<00:03:13.390> his<00:03:13.989> stolen

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
watch this was on sale his stolen

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.330 
watch this was on sale his stolen
because<00:03:14.769> they<00:03:14.950> was<00:03:15.099> kind<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.519> rusted<00:03:15.849> up

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
because they was kind of rusted up

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.500 
because they was kind of rusted up
because<00:03:18.340> they'd<00:03:18.519> set<00:03:18.760> outside<00:03:19.120> for<00:03:19.359> a<00:03:19.389> while

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
because they'd set outside for a while

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.220 
because they'd set outside for a while
so<00:03:19.659> they<00:03:19.719> put<00:03:19.930> oneself<00:03:20.109> like<00:03:20.409> $15.99<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.579> is

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
so they put oneself like $15.99 this is

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.559 
so they put oneself like $15.99 this is
2014<00:03:23.230> in<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.040> spray

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
2014 in the spray

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.179 
2014 in the spray
I<00:03:27.450> killed<00:03:28.450> up<00:03:28.569> my<00:03:28.689> little<00:03:28.870> micro<00:03:29.590> garden<00:03:29.980> it's

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:30.189 
I killed up my little micro garden it's

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:31.860 
I killed up my little micro garden it's
only<00:03:30.340> about<00:03:30.489> like<00:03:30.760> 40<00:03:31.120> foot<00:03:31.299> long<00:03:31.329> by<00:03:31.510> like

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
only about like 40 foot long by like

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.159 
only about like 40 foot long by like
cutting<00:03:32.189> 24<00:03:33.209> foot<00:03:34.260> foot<00:03:35.260> wide<00:03:35.439> or<00:03:35.709> something

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
cutting 24 foot foot wide or something

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.289 
cutting 24 foot foot wide or something
yeah<00:03:38.169> this<00:03:38.500> is<00:03:38.680> probably<00:03:39.669> little<00:03:39.819> excessive

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
yeah this is probably little excessive

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.890 
yeah this is probably little excessive
for<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.609> amount<00:03:42.609> of<00:03:42.730> tillage<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.359> I<00:03:43.629> have

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
for the amount of tillage that I have

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:52.770 
for the amount of tillage that I have
but<00:03:44.680> I'm<00:03:45.549> lazy<00:03:45.849> and<00:03:50.129> house<00:03:51.129> more<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:51.970> was<00:03:52.180> hot

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.990 
around the building I'm going to destroy
the<00:04:05.229> building<00:04:05.319> eventually<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:06.220> got<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.579> sit<00:04:06.790> the

thing<00:04:30.159> that<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.520> book<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.360> like<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.630> generic

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
thing that the book is like a generic

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.159 
thing that the book is like a generic
book<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.560> doesn't<00:04:32.919> tell<00:04:33.070> you<00:04:33.250> anything

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
book and it doesn't tell you anything

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.480 
book and it doesn't tell you anything
the<00:04:35.169> amount<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.440> fluid<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.800> goes<00:04:35.949> in<00:04:36.250> here

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
the amount of fluid that goes in here

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.029 
the amount of fluid that goes in here
this<00:04:37.419> one<00:04:37.599> part<00:04:37.810> takes<00:04:37.990> two<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:38.289> two<00:04:38.770> thirds

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
this one part takes two and two thirds

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.529 
this one part takes two and two thirds
or<00:04:39.280> so<00:04:41.190> quartz<00:04:42.190> now<00:04:42.340> this<00:04:42.550> is<00:04:42.699> like<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:43.150> notice

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
or so quartz now this is like I notice

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.480 
or so quartz now this is like I notice
some<00:04:43.690> of<00:04:43.780> them<00:04:43.870> are<00:04:43.960> more<00:04:44.260> straight<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:45.220> is<00:04:45.460> a

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
some of them are more straight this is a

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.370 
some of them are more straight this is a
little<00:04:45.669> bit<00:04:45.759> wider<00:04:45.970> so<00:04:46.120> maybe<00:04:46.960> I'll<00:04:47.080> go<00:04:47.169> 2<00:04:47.229> and

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
little bit wider so maybe I'll go 2 and

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.040 
little bit wider so maybe I'll go 2 and
a<00:04:47.500> half<00:04:47.680> or<00:04:47.860> so<00:04:47.949> a<00:04:47.979> lot<00:04:48.280> but<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.270> got<00:04:49.389> a<00:04:49.570> gallon

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
a half or so a lot but I got a gallon

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.860 
a half or so a lot but I got a gallon
and<00:04:50.289> I<00:04:50.440> pretty<00:04:50.650> much<00:04:50.860> finished<00:04:51.250> it<00:04:51.430> between

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
and I pretty much finished it between

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.689 
and I pretty much finished it between
the<00:04:52.870> side<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.770> top<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.220> side<00:04:54.430> takes

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
the side and the top the side takes

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.320 
the side and the top the side takes
about<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.270> quart<00:04:55.630> or<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.530> and<00:04:56.860> out<00:04:57.700> of<00:04:57.940> all<00:04:58.270> of

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
there's hardly any left

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.310 
there's hardly any left
I<00:05:04.710> don't<00:05:05.710> know<00:05:05.800> hardly<00:05:06.220> make<00:05:06.640> a<00:05:06.670> cup<00:05:06.970> or<00:05:07.090> two

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
I don't know hardly make a cup or two

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.890 
I don't know hardly make a cup or two
