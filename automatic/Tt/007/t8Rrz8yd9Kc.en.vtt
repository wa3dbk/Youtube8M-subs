 Sperandio and today I will talk about sam was 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.900
 They asked me if I could make a 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 santo andré no light how can you 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.160
 Yes, I'll show you how. 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.750
 What are you doing and this photograph that is from 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.850
 andrezinho medeiros andré medeiros 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.500
 I even want to send a hug and 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.199
 by carlos medeiros 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.050
 andrezinho andrezinho hugged dear 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.140
 This photo is in Araraquara, right? 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.580
 and to get there as we only fix 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 a little this picture 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.600
 I'm going to make a cut here a little bit 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.520
 A little closer, I'll go 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 put it a little bit in the rule of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.040
 thirds here to give more to give a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.649
 reading in the picture and going 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.680
 turn a little here because the line 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.300
 of stability that would be the tree 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.550
 I was off-axis here too then 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.739
 Let's put it on the line so that's it. 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.239
 give an internet tools is to 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.550
 and placing crop tool head o 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.180
 photo on the axis then I will increase only one 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.720
 little exposure're little 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.000
 0.46 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.049
 Put down captivate 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.760
 perth conditions and remove the deviation 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.640
 chromatic first of all what I wanted 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.810
 say this photo was made a jotapeg 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.430
 adobe lgbt the opening decorator rgb tá 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.630
 come on let's get the adjustment brush 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.650
 here is an adjustment brush 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.610
 let's put it a little easier 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.820
 huh 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.930
 here let's get ready here O're seeing 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.610
 there it is to define and redefine such a 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.290
 I'm going to go up just a little bit the exhibition 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.930
 is 0.54 can only see what happens 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.500
 here where you are here andrezinho 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.900
 Nice beauty, I'll take this 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.030
 same brush I'll work with a 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.410
 bit of clarity here o take a little 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.900
 from clarity ok back there 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.640
 I'll take the brush and come back here the real one. 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.560
 If you do not take a little sound, I'll go 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.930
 climb just a little bit 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.670
 the whites not the white ones either 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.520
 to draw 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.300
 then we recover them node 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.190
 contrast ne 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.260
 and ready how to take some of the 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.460
 saturation let's take it just a little bit 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.750
 saturation 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:37.280
 this is the fit 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.080
 Basic, right now, and we're going to come back. 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.400
 really will do santo andré now 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.970
 huh 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.940
 so I'm going to stay here and increase 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.130
 radial to radial filter né 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.500
 and now I come back to kind of intensity 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.490
 thing that diffusion I will put diffusion 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.470
 in 100% of the 100% ok and now I will trace 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.580
 a mask that pa 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:07.340
 Nice thing, do not worry, you 'll still hear her. 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:09.470
 here the water here and invert the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.160
 mask that reverses the reverse 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:19.010
 mask and now I have occupational exposure 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:21.560
 the exposure take some of the contrast 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.210
 from behind and now I'm going to climb back there 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.730
 I'm going up I'm going to take some of the 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.900
 quality is also good, I 'll go up to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:35.390
 saturation little I will take the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.970
 liquidity a little bit and increase 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.270
 just a little 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.320
 the beauty part of the noise now I go on 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.580
 temperature 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:48.520
 hello opa base can not put too much 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.800
 people who will later become very yellow 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.500
 I will not like it very much in the vain beauty. 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.140
 here take the radial tool and go on 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.220
 general of the contrast there 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.160
 the contrast a bit cooler 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.450
 because the light is coming here look shadow 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.880
 of the curse there 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.550
 the projection of the shadow is a soft light one 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.680
 shadow coming from here then the light 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.810
 I had to come right here, right? 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.090
 good here again take a look at your 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:21.030
 majesty here open a little this 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.850
 fan rock 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.310
 So I'm liking it, it's already great. 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.790
 there was a little that fan and now it is 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.210
 over there 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:35.310
 the trick of a really cool photo 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:39.910
 in general I will take some of the clarity 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:42.780
 clarity né clarity on the wall quality 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.510
 now I'm going to give a little more 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.139
 contrast and maybe a little bit more 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.580
 exhibition 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:56.270
 Ufa 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:05:02.659
 15 35 beauty closed not yet not right 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:05.360
 Let's put it here in the curves and tones I 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:11.120
 I'm going up here and come up a little bit here. 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.250
 and I'm going down a little here ok then 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.219
 it is there civil quickly the agent did 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:19.849
 a very nice portrait the before and the 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:21.530
 and then he has done the holy Andrew was 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:27.530
 I just forgot that I forgot 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:30.199
 There's a crack here and give yourself enough. 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:35.090
 then I go back to us leaving 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:38.210
 enough and I'll put on an air mask 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.180
 here is a little bit even here one 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.779
 bit of noise illuminance does not take 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.460
 a little bit of the luminaire's brightness and 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:52.879
 Now I'm going to raise the ray a little bit 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:54.590
 here then is this there now yes come on 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:58.009
 before and after 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.889
 before and after is not the photo that with a 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.529
 a bit warmer to represent a 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.259
 pair of being in that nice light that light 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:08.029
 of 6000 or 7000 kelvin né 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:11.419
 so this is it friends I hope you 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:13.159
 have enjoyed funk tyco delight 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.560
 how to make a flex 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:18.500
 and do not forget the young man even forgets 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.039
 share the video it's good and it follows me

 there
