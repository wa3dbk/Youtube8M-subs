00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.980
My makeup-less face bowed; this cruel, ruthless appearance a lie

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.860
I set a perfume about my eyes; Temptation at Night

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.000
Drawn into pleasant intoxication, I’ll leave no trace

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.140
I’ll break through your gentle advances, kill you with a glance

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:07.860
With my glossed lips and fallaciously slender, weak arms, You Can’t Fool Me.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.580
Perplexing, driving, cornering, I target you with an uninterrupted gaze

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.800
But there’s always someone in the way, no matter where I turn she won’t leave.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.480
I know everyone’s thinking it, keeping it to themselves

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.740
But say it, don’t hide it! It’ll all be be over soon anyway

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.560
Don’t be a tease, I’ll provoke you so you can’t fight back, as a joke.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.680
My eyes and lips stay glossy, and only time passes by

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.560
Lazily my sugary perfume is carried your way

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.820
I drop by for a selfish game,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.820
I wonder if I can get you to take some proof or a present?

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:41.620
My manicure sparkles, and I raise my thin eyebrows in a reaction with stimulation.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.320
I’ve spotted a chance, and in an instant I close in

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.540
The moment you let down your guard, I’ll take everything

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.460
With my aura I’ll blow away your memories, make it like I was never here

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.580
Make you ignore reality, erasing the hazy starting line.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.480
Cancel your primitive thinking, as a joke.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.200
You make love magic. I’ll throw them soon
Cancel your primitive thinking, as a joke.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200
You make love magic. I’ll throw them soon

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.060
Are you ready? OK? My accuracy

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.540
Don’t stop the desire. Is amazing – you’re in trouble, but don’t you like it?

00:03:45.480 --> 00:04:02.260
Secretly, I’ll spread my mascara, blink and display, No Trespassing!

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.900
I take care to search for the truth; I know it’s not helping anyone

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.200
But I want to resolve these stirring in my heart my own way

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.120
In between my fingers, are daggers polished like mirrors

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.160
Forgetting my perfectly executed elegant leisures

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:40.060
I manipulate my own space-time, as a joke.
