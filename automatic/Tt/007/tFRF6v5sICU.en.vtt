Aston Martin actually and to begin with

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.719 
Aston Martin actually and to begin with
you<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.649> question<00:01:55.100> whether<00:01:55.249> it's<00:01:55.520> perhaps

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
you you question whether it's perhaps

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.649 
you you question whether it's perhaps
too<00:01:56.090> stiff<00:01:56.509> for<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.439> road<00:01:58.299> but<00:01:59.299> once<00:01:59.479> you're

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
too stiff for the road but once you're

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.709 
too stiff for the road but once you're
on<00:01:59.689> the<00:01:59.869> move<00:02:00.079> it<00:02:00.709> just<00:02:01.009> gives<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:01.369> car<00:02:01.639> a<00:02:01.969> real

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
on the move it just gives the car a real

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.489 
on the move it just gives the car a real
sense<00:02:03.259> of<00:02:03.530> connection<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.459> road<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:05.499> like

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:06.499 
sense of connection to the road and like

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:08.690 
sense of connection to the road and like
I<00:02:06.530> say<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.829> sense<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.219> focus<00:02:07.429> which

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
I say a sense of focus which

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.869 
I say a sense of focus which
I<00:02:08.759> think<00:02:09.390> has<00:02:09.899> been<00:02:10.140> lacking<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.310> other<00:02:11.459> assets

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
I think has been lacking in other assets

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.729 
I think has been lacking in other assets
so<00:02:12.030> far<00:02:12.300> they've<00:02:12.450> always<00:02:12.569> add<00:02:12.780> more<00:02:13.050> towards

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
so far they've always add more towards

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.210 
so far they've always add more towards
