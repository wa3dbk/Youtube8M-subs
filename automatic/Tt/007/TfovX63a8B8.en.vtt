watched<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.080> couple<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.710> video<00:01:25.950> reviews<00:01:26.369> on

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
watched a couple of video reviews on

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.480 
watched a couple of video reviews on
this<00:01:26.640> case<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.650> some<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.799> reviewers<00:01:29.250> have

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
this case and some of the reviewers have

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.280 
this case and some of the reviewers have
been<00:01:29.640> complaining<00:01:30.090> about<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.750> performance

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
been complaining about the performance

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.700 
been complaining about the performance
of<00:01:31.650> these<00:01:31.829> corsair<00:01:32.490> units<00:01:32.939> here<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.450> also<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
of these corsair units here and also the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.700 
of these corsair units here and also the
NOC<00:01:35.549> torres<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.180> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.509> providing<00:01:37.170> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
NOC torres are going to be providing a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.230 
NOC torres are going to be providing a
far<00:01:38.250> better<00:01:38.460> airflow<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.950> quieter<00:01:40.950> operation

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
far better airflow and quieter operation

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.080 
far better airflow and quieter operation
so<00:01:43.070> anyway<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.100> 240

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
so anyway this is the one for 240

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.450 
so anyway this is the one for 240

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
square type of configuration whereas the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.240 
square type of configuration whereas the
doctoral<00:02:47.910> chose<00:02:48.270> this<00:02:48.540> round<00:02:49.200> form<00:02:49.770> factor

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
doctoral chose this round form factor

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.030 
doctoral chose this round form factor
and<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:50.520> kind<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.570> changed<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.170> location<00:02:52.350> of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
and that kind of changed the location of

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.880 
and that kind of changed the location of
the<00:02:53.870> mounting<00:02:54.870> hole<00:02:55.730> screws<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:58.380> get<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.680> fans

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
the mounting hole screws to get the fans

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.870 
the mounting hole screws to get the fans
on<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.250> case<00:02:59.490> so<00:03:00.140> as<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:02.070> can<00:03:02.160> see<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.670> is

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
on the case so as you can see this is

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.360 
on the case so as you can see this is
the<00:03:03.270> holes<00:03:03.570> right<00:03:04.170> here<00:03:04.230> where<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.860> Corsair

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
the holes right here where the Corsair

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.810 
the holes right here where the Corsair
is<00:03:05.520> mounted<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.740> this<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:07.890> where<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.610> new

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
is mounted and this is where the new

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.010 
is mounted and this is where the new
mounting<00:03:09.540> placement<00:03:10.050> needed<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.590> be<00:03:10.710> for<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
mounting placement needed to be for the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.350 
mounting placement needed to be for the
the<00:03:13.020> doctor<00:03:13.770> of<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.490> nocturia<00:03:14.880> units<00:03:17.360> we

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
the doctor of the nocturia units we

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.660 
the doctor of the nocturia units we
drill<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.660> with<00:03:18.960> all<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.410> was<00:03:19.980> required<00:03:20.370> here

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
drill it with all it was required here

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.550 
drill it with all it was required here
was<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.180> drill<00:03:21.390> some<00:03:21.570> new<00:03:21.720> holes<00:03:22.020> here

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
was just to drill some new holes here

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.210 
was just to drill some new holes here
this<00:03:23.520> fan<00:03:23.790> right<00:03:24.030> here<00:03:24.170> worked<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.440> 120

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
this fan right here worked in the 120

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.070 
this fan right here worked in the 120
millimeter<00:03:26.610> placement<00:03:27.240> holes<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.780> was<00:03:27.900> bad

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
millimeter placement holes that was bad

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.430 
millimeter placement holes that was bad
already<00:03:28.470> back<00:03:28.650> here<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.250> no<00:03:29.550> problem<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.120> one

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
already back here so no problem that one

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.790 
already back here so no problem that one
but<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:32.240> fan<00:03:33.240> required<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.320> little<00:03:34.560> bit<00:03:34.650> more

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
but this fan required a little bit more

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.670 
but this fan required a little bit more
extensive<00:03:35.550> modding<00:03:36.560> what<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:37.680> did<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:39.680> created

placements<00:03:49.980> for<00:03:50.210> on<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:51.840> case<00:03:52.080> and<00:03:52.410> then<00:03:53.400> we

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
placements for on the case and then we

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.380 
placements for on the case and then we
took<00:03:54.390> this<00:03:54.570> noctua<00:03:55.410> fan<00:03:55.890> lined<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.030> up<00:03:57.120> and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
took this noctua fan lined it up and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.590 
took this noctua fan lined it up and
drilled<00:03:57.870> new<00:03:58.580> screw<00:03:59.580> holes<00:03:59.880> on<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.390> newt

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
drilled new screw holes on to the newt

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.570 
drilled new screw holes on to the newt
under<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.990> brackets<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.740> mounted<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> fan

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
under the brackets and mounted the fan

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.230 
under the brackets and mounted the fan
on<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.360> brackets<00:04:03.810> so<00:04:04.710> a<00:04:05.040> little<00:04:06.000> bit<00:04:06.120> of

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
on to the brackets so a little bit of

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.480 
on to the brackets so a little bit of
case<00:04:06.420> modding<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:07.380> was<00:04:07.530> kind<00:04:07.710> of<00:04:07.770> fun<00:04:08.010> took

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
case modding that was kind of fun took

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.410 
case modding that was kind of fun took
most<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.850> day<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.090> do<00:04:09.360> though<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:11.420> these
