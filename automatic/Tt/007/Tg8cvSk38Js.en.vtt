00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
opportunities and it's just a shame when

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.000 
opportunities and it's just a shame when
you<00:05:50.510> have<00:05:50.720> a<00:05:50.750> real<00:05:51.080> printed<00:05:51.440> actress<00:05:51.800> like

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
you have a real printed actress like

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.970 
you have a real printed actress like
that<00:05:52.310> you<00:05:52.880> should<00:05:53.090> use<00:05:53.330> her<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:53.840> they<00:05:54.650> didn't

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
that you should use her and they didn't

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.580 
that you should use her and they didn't
and<00:05:55.570> frankly<00:05:56.570> to<00:05:56.630> me<00:05:56.720> it's<00:05:56.990> just<00:05:57.080> a<00:05:57.380> missed

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
and frankly to me it's just a missed

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.420 
and frankly to me it's just a missed
opportunity

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
opportunity

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.630 
opportunity
so<00:05:58.790> that's<00:05:58.970> too<00:05:59.150> bad<00:05:59.330> but<00:05:59.750> it<00:06:00.050> is<00:06:00.110> what<00:06:00.410> it<00:06:00.500> is

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
so that's too bad but it is what it is

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:12.820 
so that's too bad but it is what it is
that's<00:06:01.640> all<00:06:01.790> for<00:06:01.970> now<00:06:02.000> see<00:06:02.330> you<00:06:02.600> later
