still have a year left in my current

years<00:00:34.980> which<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:36.149> ridiculous<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.559> did<00:00:37.710> cost

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
years which is ridiculous so it did cost

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.750 
years which is ridiculous so it did cost
a<00:00:38.100> lot<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.340> money<00:00:38.489> was<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:39.140> 649<00:00:40.140> plus<00:00:40.469> tax<00:00:40.760> but

right there there's a little hole right

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.940 
right there there's a little hole right
here<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:08.429> camera<00:02:08.789> here<00:02:09.379> this<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.739> course

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
here and the camera here this of course

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.930 
here and the camera here this of course
is<00:02:11.310> different<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.360> more<00:02:12.840> round

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
is different it's more round

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.760 
is different it's more round
it's<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.330> steal<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.320> designed

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
it's a steal so it's designed

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.080 
it's a steal so it's designed
differently<00:02:19.100> this<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.280> typical<00:02:20.670> case<00:02:20.850> you

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
differently this is a typical case you

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.060 
differently this is a typical case you
got<00:02:21.270> your<00:02:21.860> folder

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
got your folder

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.900 
got your folder
you<00:02:23.460> got<00:02:23.670> your<00:02:24.020> manual<00:02:25.020> in<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:26.670> got

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
you got your manual in here you got

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.660 
you got your manual in here you got

fresh new set of earbuds which I'm in

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.540 
fresh new set of earbuds which I'm in
need<00:02:29.820> of<00:02:30.200> because<00:02:31.200> they<00:02:31.380> tend<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:31.890> break<00:02:32.100> quite

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
need of because they tend to break quite

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.030 
need of because they tend to break quite
easily<00:02:33.020> here's<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.110> charger<00:02:34.650> which<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.010> a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
easily here's a charger which I have a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.740 
easily here's a charger which I have a
bunch<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.460> them<00:02:35.610> USB<00:02:36.470> docks<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.430> plug

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
bunch of them USB docks and the plug

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.150 
bunch of them USB docks and the plug
that's<00:02:39.750> pretty<00:02:40.050> much<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.440> um<00:02:41.690> hopefully<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:43.160> can

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
that's pretty much it um hopefully I can

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.240 
that's pretty much it um hopefully I can
turn<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.610> on<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:46.910> I'm<00:02:47.910> assuming<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:49.250> I'm

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
turn it on but I'm assuming that I'm

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.820 
turn it on but I'm assuming that I'm
gonna<00:02:50.370> have<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.670> activate<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.240> so<00:02:51.510> before<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.740> do

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
gonna have to activate it so before I do

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.270 
gonna have to activate it so before I do
that<00:02:53.420> there<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.630> screen<00:02:55.410> protector<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
that there is a screen protector on it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.520 
that there is a screen protector on it
on<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.180> back<00:02:57.210> as<00:02:57.690> well<00:02:57.870> which<00:02:58.170> I'm<00:02:58.320> going<00:02:58.440> to

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
on the back as well which I'm going to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.510 
on the back as well which I'm going to
take<00:02:58.710> off<00:02:59.630> and<00:03:00.630> I'm<00:03:01.110> very<00:03:01.230> excited<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.250> first

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
take off and I'm very excited the first

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.400 
take off and I'm very excited the first
thing<00:03:02.700> that's<00:03:02.790> different<00:03:03.120> about<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.630> is<00:03:03.780> the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
thing that's different about it is the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.320 
thing that's different about it is the
brighten<00:03:04.680> on<00:03:04.800> display<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.460> makes<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.970> text

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
brighten on display it makes the text

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.900 
brighten on display it makes the text
and<00:03:06.510> picture<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.110> lot<00:03:07.440> clearer<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.070> compared<00:03:08.790> my

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
and picture a lot clearer I compared my

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.070 
and picture a lot clearer I compared my
old<00:03:09.120> iPhone<00:03:09.390> 3G<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.610> screen<00:03:11.970> here<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.420> it

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
old iPhone 3G to this screen here and it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.970 
old iPhone 3G to this screen here and it
just<00:03:13.290> looks<00:03:13.500> ridiculously<00:03:14.220> different<00:03:15.980> to

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
just looks ridiculously different to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.250 
just looks ridiculously different to
probably<00:03:17.250> show<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.460> guys<00:03:17.670> but<00:03:18.150> no<00:03:18.780> SIM<00:03:19.050> card

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
probably show you guys but no SIM card

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.010 
probably show you guys but no SIM card
installed<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:20.040> sort<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.340> eyelets<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.020> which

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
installed in sort of eyelets and which

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.520 
installed in sort of eyelets and which
to<00:03:22.260> be<00:03:22.350> honest<00:03:22.739> it's<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.970> side<00:03:24.530> right

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
to be honest it's on the side right

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.410 
to be honest it's on the side right
there<00:03:25.800> let's<00:03:26.160> go<00:03:26.280> ahead<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.580> do<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.670> so<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
there let's go ahead and do that so I

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
got Fido here I have this from my old 3G

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.780 
got Fido here I have this from my old 3G
ad<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.900> 3G<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.500> it's<00:03:34.590> been<00:03:34.739> 2<00:03:34.950> years<00:03:34.980> since<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.020 

pop<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:39.770> now<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.100> micro<00:03:41.520> SIM<00:03:41.760> card

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
pop that now this is a micro SIM card

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.580 
pop that now this is a micro SIM card
and<00:03:44.120> since<00:03:45.120> it's<00:03:45.270> unlocked<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:46.050> don't<00:03:46.320> think<00:03:46.500> it

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
and since it's unlocked I don't think it

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.199 
and since it's unlocked I don't think it
needs<00:03:46.739> to<00:03:46.830> be<00:03:46.950> activated<00:03:47.160> but<00:03:47.730> I'm<00:03:47.820> not<00:03:47.970> sure

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
needs to be activated but I'm not sure

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.199 
needs to be activated but I'm not sure
that's<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.420> mini<00:03:51.750> sim<00:03:52.820> so<00:03:53.820> let<00:03:53.910> me<00:03:54.000> go<00:03:54.120> ahead

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
that's the mini sim so let me go ahead

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.650 
that's the mini sim so let me go ahead
and<00:03:54.330> put<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.810> here<00:03:55.020> I<00:03:59.090> hope<00:04:00.090> I'm<00:04:00.270> doing<00:04:00.300> it

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
and put that in here I hope I'm doing it

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.380 
and put that in here I hope I'm doing it
right<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:00.870> don't<00:04:01.050> know<00:04:01.850> goes<00:04:02.850> this<00:04:03.120> way

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
right I don't know goes this way

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.550 
right I don't know goes this way
actually<00:04:05.840> that's<00:04:06.840> something<00:04:06.959> it's<00:04:07.230> gonna<00:04:07.380> go

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
actually that's something it's gonna go

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.840 
actually that's something it's gonna go
down<00:04:07.800> like<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:09.860> let's<00:04:10.860> slide<00:04:11.220> this<00:04:11.400> in<00:04:11.640> here

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
down like that let's slide this in here

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.710 
down like that let's slide this in here
hopefully<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.480> put<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.780> in<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.019> right<00:04:13.170> way

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.190 

well<00:04:18.440> connected<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.190> iTunes<00:04:19.930> guess<00:04:20.930> I'm<00:04:21.049> not

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
well connected to iTunes guess I'm not

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.780 
well connected to iTunes guess I'm not
gonna<00:04:21.320> be<00:04:21.440> able<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.650> show<00:04:21.830> you<00:04:21.890> guys<00:04:22.100> anything

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
right now which is very fairly typical I

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.370 
right now which is very fairly typical I
can't<00:04:28.970> even<00:04:29.030> show<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.360> a<00:04:29.450> comparison<00:04:29.870> yet

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
can't even show you a comparison yet

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.450 
can't even show you a comparison yet
because<00:04:30.740> I<00:04:30.830> have<00:04:30.980> to<00:04:32.140> put<00:04:33.140> it<00:04:33.260> into<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.860> iTunes

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
because I have to put it into the iTunes

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.340 
because I have to put it into the iTunes
to<00:04:34.640> activate<00:04:35.090> then<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.750> can<00:04:35.930> show<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:36.140> guys<00:04:36.230> a
