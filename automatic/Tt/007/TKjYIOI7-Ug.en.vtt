there it's just a tight fit overall but

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.979 
there it's just a tight fit overall but
that<00:02:14.540> does<00:02:14.689> work<00:02:14.900> yeah<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.069> simple<00:02:16.989> gun

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989

pistol<00:02:26.650> I'll<00:02:27.069> probably<00:02:27.340> end<00:02:27.519> up<00:02:27.609> having<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
pistol I'll probably end up having to

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.670 
pistol I'll probably end up having to
put<00:02:28.150> something<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.569> here<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.989> protect<00:02:29.439> my

put something on here to protect my

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.199 
put something on here to protect my
finger<00:02:30.010> from<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.219> trigger<00:02:30.310> slap<00:02:30.849> that'll

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
finger from the trigger slap that'll

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.280 
finger from the trigger slap that'll
probably<00:02:31.390> end<00:02:31.719> up<00:02:31.810> happening<00:02:34.079> magazine<00:02:35.079> looks

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
probably end up happening magazine looks

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.420 
probably end up happening magazine looks
like<00:02:35.409> it<00:02:35.530> fits<00:02:35.680> well<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:37.650> did<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.799> assemble<00:02:39.310> it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
like it fits well I did this assemble it

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.830 
like it fits well I did this assemble it
and<00:02:39.459> I'll<00:02:39.640> go<00:02:39.760> ahead<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.000> do<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> disassembly

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
and I'll go ahead and do a disassembly

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.170 
and I'll go ahead and do a disassembly
video<00:02:41.439> after<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:41.920> do<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.189> range<00:02:42.400> video<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.120> if

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
video after I do the range video so if

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.009 
video after I do the range video so if
you<00:02:43.269> guys<00:02:43.359> are<00:02:43.420> interested<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.959> that

flashy gun MSRP Ana it's about five
hundred<00:02:51.310> dollars<00:02:51.790> I'll<00:02:52.329> go<00:02:52.510> through<00:02:52.719> some<00:02:52.780> of

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
hundred dollars I'll go through some of

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.339 
hundred dollars I'll go through some of
the<00:02:53.049> specifications<00:02:53.409> for<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.099> guys<00:02:54.280> here<00:02:55.349> 45

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
the specifications for you guys here 45

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.830 
the specifications for you guys here 45
ACP<00:02:57.040> does<00:02:57.519> like<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.849> steel<00:02:58.120> case<00:02:58.389> stuff<00:02:58.689> I

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
ACP does like the steel case stuff I

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.280 
ACP does like the steel case stuff I
guess<00:02:59.019> better<00:02:59.230> than<00:02:59.500> the<00:03:00.159> brass<00:03:00.400> case<00:03:00.790> stuff

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
guess better than the brass case stuff

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.020 
guess better than the brass case stuff
the<00:03:02.290> brass<00:03:02.530> case<00:03:02.859> I<00:03:03.069> guess<00:03:03.250> tends<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.730> swell

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the brass case I guess tends to swell

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.210 
the brass case I guess tends to swell
and<00:03:04.389> causes<00:03:05.139> cycling<00:03:05.409> issues<00:03:05.739> with<00:03:06.099> this

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
and causes cycling issues with this

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.770 
and causes cycling issues with this
particular<00:03:06.700> gun<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.180> matte<00:03:10.540> a

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
particular gun it is a matte a

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.710 
particular gun it is a matte a
electroless<00:03:11.530> nickel<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:12.549> that<00:03:13.209> includes<00:03:13.569> the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
electroless nickel and that includes the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.990 
electroless nickel and that includes the
barrel<00:03:14.079> and<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.500> inside<00:03:15.189> here<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.549> the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
barrel and the inside here of the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.800 
barrel and the inside here of the
receiver<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:17.260> barrel<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.680> also<00:03:18.810> nickel

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
receiver the barrel is also nickel

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.449 
receiver the barrel is also nickel
plated<00:03:20.109> which<00:03:20.200> is<00:03:20.319> kind<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.560> nice

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459

the inside and everything on this gun

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.879 
the inside and everything on this gun
I'll<00:03:31.030> show<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.269> in<00:03:31.629> a<00:03:31.780> disassembly<00:03:32.349> portion

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
I'll show that in a disassembly portion

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.939 
I'll show that in a disassembly portion
of<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.220> does<00:03:34.060> have<00:03:34.269> this<00:03:34.510> flip<00:03:35.169> fire<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.709> safe

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
of it does have this flip fire to safe

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.710 
of it does have this flip fire to safe
here<00:03:36.280> and<00:03:36.609> that<00:03:36.970> does<00:03:37.150> work<00:03:37.359> in<00:03:37.540> both

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
here and that does work in both

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.099 
here and that does work in both
directions<00:03:38.139> there<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.209> dry<00:03:40.540> fire<00:03:40.840> this

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
directions there you can dry fire this

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.629 
directions there you can dry fire this
we're<00:03:41.409> going<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.590> put<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.799> in<00:03:41.889> this<00:03:41.949> fire

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
we're going to put it in this fire

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.969 
we're going to put it in this fire
position<00:03:43.180> here<00:03:43.419> getting<00:03:44.169> checked<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.709> clear

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
position here getting checked it's clear

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:53.520 
position here getting checked it's clear
and<00:03:45.989> as<00:03:46.989> you<00:03:47.109> can<00:03:47.199> see<00:03:51.750> as<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.900> mentioned<00:03:52.959> before

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
and as you can see as I mentioned before

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.949 
and as you can see as I mentioned before
these<00:03:53.790> don't<00:03:54.790> really<00:03:55.239> have<00:03:55.449> that<00:03:55.659> good<00:03:55.840> of

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
these don't really have that good of

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.689 
these don't really have that good of
triggers<00:03:56.260> it's<00:03:56.500> just<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:57.190> way<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.459> bolt

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
triggers it's just the the way the bolt

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:02.369 
triggers it's just the the way the bolt
system<00:03:58.389> is<00:03:58.750> it's<00:03:59.019> it's<00:03:59.769> just<00:03:59.979> not<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:01.139> very<00:04:02.139> nice

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
system is it's it's just not a very nice

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.390 
system is it's it's just not a very nice
trigger<00:04:02.799> feel<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.459> it

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
trigger feel to it

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.770 
trigger feel to it
weight<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.699> pretty<00:04:07.180> heavy<00:04:07.329> it's<00:04:07.540> actually

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
weight is pretty heavy it's actually

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.390 
weight is pretty heavy it's actually
five-and-a-half<00:04:08.260> pounds<00:04:08.500> with<00:04:09.010> an<00:04:09.129> unloaded

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
five-and-a-half pounds with an unloaded

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.240 
five-and-a-half pounds with an unloaded
magazine<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.239> it<00:04:10.329> is<00:04:10.449> a<00:04:10.479> hefty<00:04:11.319> gun<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:11.769> for

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
magazine so it is a hefty gun but for

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.429 
magazine so it is a hefty gun but for
