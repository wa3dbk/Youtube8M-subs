00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.760
 days 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.000
 It is obvious that as the days go by, 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.159
 get out a little bit on the surface 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.920
 is made with very beautiful tan and 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.519
 natural this product is very good but 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.170
 so you get the result the 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.090
 desired result 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.410
 you need to know how to apply tourism 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.730
 professional you will not get a 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.090
 very cool result 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.549
 first of all you have to do 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.820
 a choice your audience then you use 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.970
 there your soap went before your product 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.750
 in sheet of body that you like in the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.690
 your blog and on paper well until then you 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.090
 Boyce lets another hour go, right? 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.860
 we take the goal has cooled the skin be the skin 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:49.569
 and you have been applying this 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:52.390
 product on the skin and in the city 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:59.200
 so these lines are discarded 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:02.230
 which come in plastic hair ink 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.860
 because it can stain the newspaper hands 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.050
 so to avoid getting your hand dirty you boot 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.400
 and begin to sneeze the product 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.840
 on body 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.830
 you can click anywhere in the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.040
 body if you will apply on the face is 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.300
 indicated in your mouth not to apply the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.360
 product in the mouth because I have 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.610
 witness manage in the eye you close well 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.050
 Do you know if you can put some 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.019
 so little in the eye to avoid 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.300

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.700

 with a tan body and I do not like it 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:44.440
 So you right on the hol in the body and 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.269

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.970

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.250
 if he will have a meeting in May and during 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.200
 eight hours in the time period you applied 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.110
 until the victory you can not take a shower 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.080

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.409

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:14.080
 No problem, it's a pretty cool tip. 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:18.190
 I was also wanting to play out not 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.170
 Throw away the friend to cop 15 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.050

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.850

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.810

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.280
 tan 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.430
 So for people who are in this period 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.160
 autumn-winter right you're not making tone 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.980
 just so what you might not have 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.510
 that time to treat her is a great time 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.300
 tip for you gets a tonality 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.060
 cool get bronze angel everyone 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.730
 will be curious wondering where 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.060
 You were a boy, what are you, 100? 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:05.380
 Only you tried Brasilia, too. 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.780

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.090
 producing cool and easy one 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.060
 application absorbs very well not 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.490
 it gets sticky do not stay told to 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.130
 person goes to him I never imagined that 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.870
 you have the target products it seems that 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.000
 It will come that we entered that you 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.950
 really went to the beach and if you are 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.890
 White will not dispense red 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.080
 You're not going to stay in there are many. 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.210
 benefits are very good indeed 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.290
 purpose of this product is super cool 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.690
 same 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.580
 an interesting tip is also the 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.800
 elbows and knee that at the moment 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.510
 are playing in our house the faults a 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.169
 slightly darker than the tonality of the 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.760
 skin you apply - lesser amount of 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.730
 that in the rest of the body 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.510
 because otherwise he'll be much better 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.450
 so tan 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.370
 and another thing people this product he does not 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.860
 has protection factor 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.350
 then you are advised to use and libra 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.690
 why catch sun and beach 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.540
 not indicated because it has no 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:07.360
 protection factor will not protect you from 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:10.180
 sun is then productive even for you 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.600
 use to pick a color to win 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:16.390
 cool maturity and natural shade 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.940
 It's good and you can replicate the product. 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:22.620
 I liked the product proposal too much 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.810
 Textile surpasses proven country 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.090
 not because the people that women like 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.220
 to share these little critters like that is 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.460
 it's also a product you never have 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.630

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:39.389
