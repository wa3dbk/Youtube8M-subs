hey<00:00:10.230> everyone<00:00:10.680> its<00:00:10.950> KITT<00:00:11.340> it's<00:00:11.969> time<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.480> do

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
hey everyone its KITT it's time to do

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.770 
hey everyone its KITT it's time to do
single<00:00:13.559> power<00:00:13.830> challenge<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.209> easiest

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
single power challenge it's the easiest

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.960 
single power challenge it's the easiest
power<00:00:16.200> that<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.560> can<00:00:16.860> think<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.220> which<00:00:17.910> is

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
power that I can think of which is

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.859 
power that I can think of which is
plasma<00:00:18.599> let's<00:00:19.590> go<00:00:20.270> alright<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.480> one<00:00:21.689> doesn't

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
plasma let's go alright this one doesn't

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.749 
plasma let's go alright this one doesn't
even<00:00:22.020> need<00:00:22.939> firepower<00:00:25.309> what<00:00:26.309> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.640> do

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
even need firepower what you can do

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.909 
even need firepower what you can do
though<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.380> charge<00:00:28.380> up<00:00:28.680> by<00:00:29.250> holding<00:00:29.820> down

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
though is charge up by holding down

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.660 
though is charge up by holding down
block<00:00:31.919> and<00:00:32.660> just<00:00:33.980> screwing<00:00:34.980> around<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
block and just screwing around with the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.470 
block and just screwing around with the
control<00:00:36.239> pad<00:00:38.149> whoa

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
control pad whoa

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.810 
control pad whoa
I<00:00:40.309> pressed<00:00:41.309> Y<00:00:42.060> instead<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.690> B<00:00:43.700> you<00:00:44.700> know

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
I pressed Y instead of B you know

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.870 
I pressed Y instead of B you know
according<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.300> Super<00:00:45.750> NES<00:00:45.870> reckoning<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.880> think

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
according to Super NES reckoning I think

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:59.210 
according to Super NES reckoning I think
that<00:00:48.090> was<00:00:48.770> okay<00:00:49.770> at<00:00:50.070> work

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.000 

surprised<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.060> didn't<00:01:00.270> take<00:01:00.420> care<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.720> it

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
surprised that didn't take care of it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.040 
surprised that didn't take care of it
well

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.740 

so<00:01:04.650> yes<00:01:04.860> plasma<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> pretty<00:01:05.760> easy<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.450> quick

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so yes plasma is a pretty easy and quick

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.790 
so yes plasma is a pretty easy and quick
power<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.470> take<00:01:07.980> care<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> I'm<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.650> do

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
power to take care of so I'm going to do

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.540 
power to take care of so I'm going to do
that<00:01:11.010> first<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:14.070> I'll<00:01:14.160> probably<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
that first and I'll probably have to

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.420 
that first and I'll probably have to
take<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.880> refreshing<00:01:15.420> pause<00:01:15.900> about<00:01:16.830> halfway

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
take a refreshing pause about halfway

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.100 
take a refreshing pause about halfway
through<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:20.460> get<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
through it just to get it in on the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.160 
through it just to get it in on the
right<00:01:22.260> time

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.510 

plaids<00:01:30.800> my<00:01:31.100> power<00:01:31.840> that<00:01:32.840> it's<00:01:33.020> one<00:01:33.520> cooked

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
plaids my power that it's one cooked

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.330 
plaids my power that it's one cooked
lobster<00:01:35.710> perhaps

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.910 

I<00:01:39.369> think<00:01:40.149> this<00:01:40.390> spark<00:01:40.930> has<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.590> greatest

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
I think this spark has the greatest

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.340 
I think this spark has the greatest
damage<00:01:42.520> per<00:01:42.820> second<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.659> them<00:01:44.049> I<00:01:46.049> could<00:01:47.049> aim<00:01:47.170> it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
damage per second of them I could aim it

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:56.940 
damage per second of them I could aim it
right<00:01:48.750> whoops<00:01:49.750> my<00:01:50.740> plasma<00:01:51.509> come<00:01:52.509> back

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.760 

that<00:01:57.579> is<00:01:57.700> one<00:01:57.850> dead<00:01:58.090> duck<00:01:58.539> or<00:01:58.899> penguin<00:01:59.380> or

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
that is one dead duck or penguin or

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.120 
that is one dead duck or penguin or
whatever<00:02:00.520> he's<00:02:00.670> supposed<00:02:00.969> to<00:02:01.060> be<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.920> this

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
whatever he's supposed to be with this

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.419 
whatever he's supposed to be with this
one<00:02:03.340> I'm<00:02:03.490> going<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.880> show<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.829> reactor

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
one I'm going to show the the reactor

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.320 
one I'm going to show the the reactor
core<00:02:06.969> fight<00:02:07.360> with<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.170> heart<00:02:08.379> of<00:02:08.500> Nova<00:02:09.330> it's

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
core fight with the heart of Nova it's

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.690 
core fight with the heart of Nova it's
not<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.569> very<00:02:10.840> exciting<00:02:11.140> fight<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.280> doesn't

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
not a very exciting fight and it doesn't

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.780 
not a very exciting fight and it doesn't
depend<00:02:13.180> on<00:02:13.599> your<00:02:13.780> power<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.500> for<00:02:15.310> other<00:02:15.489> ones

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
depend on your power so for other ones

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.870 
depend on your power so for other ones
I'm<00:02:15.970> going<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.180> be<00:02:16.239> skipping<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:17.019> well

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.020 

our<00:02:24.880> streaking<00:02:25.390> won't<00:02:25.570> save<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.260> now<00:02:26.470> bird

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
our streaking won't save you now bird

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.380 
our streaking won't save you now bird
Hadoken

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.650 

yeah<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.410> plasma<00:02:33.710> this<00:02:34.670> isn't<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.150> much<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.390> a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
yeah so plasma this isn't so much of a

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.170 
yeah so plasma this isn't so much of a
single<00:02:36.050> powered<00:02:36.350> challenge<00:02:36.770> as<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.250> single

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
single powered challenge as it is single

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.470 
single powered challenge as it is single
power<00:02:38.390> nuke<00:02:38.810> everything<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.560> sight

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.560 

case<00:02:44.480> in<00:02:44.690> point<00:02:45.880> that's<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:47.000> room<00:02:47.210> there's<00:02:47.450> some

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
case in point that's a room there's some

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.390 
case in point that's a room there's some
whoa<00:02:47.840> don't<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.830> eat<00:02:49.010> me

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
whoa don't you eat me

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.699 
whoa don't you eat me
that's<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.820> Kirby<00:02:50.150> thing

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.020 

yep<00:02:57.819> oh<00:02:58.019> come<00:02:59.019> on<00:02:59.219> have<00:03:00.219> a<00:03:00.250> little<00:03:00.370> too<00:03:00.700> greedy

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
yep oh come on have a little too greedy

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.550 
yep oh come on have a little too greedy
there

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.330 

people<00:03:08.190> typically<00:03:08.700> ready<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.270> review

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.460 

what<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:15.030> woman<00:03:15.420> I'm<00:03:15.900> probably<00:03:16.110> hear<00:03:16.319> me

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
what a woman I'm probably hear me

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.380 
what a woman I'm probably hear me
mashing<00:03:16.709> my<00:03:16.980> controller<00:03:17.400> like<00:03:17.640> mad<00:03:17.880> back<00:03:18.120> here

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
mashing my controller like mad back here

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.540 
mashing my controller like mad back here
trying<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.290> keep<00:03:19.440> my<00:03:19.560> hands<00:03:19.890> away<00:03:20.040> from<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.520> so

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
trying to keep my hands away from it so

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.880 
trying to keep my hands away from it so
that's<00:03:20.760> not<00:03:20.910> all<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.300> can<00:03:21.480> hear<00:03:22.760> yeah<00:03:24.890> I'm

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
that's not all you can hear yeah I'm

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.370 
that's not all you can hear yeah I'm
actually<00:03:26.040> not<00:03:26.670> doing<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.150> great<00:03:27.420> because

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
actually not doing that great because

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.710 
actually not doing that great because
this<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.980> easiest<00:03:29.280> power<00:03:29.610> I'm<00:03:30.330> pretty

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
this is the easiest power I'm pretty

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.449 
this is the easiest power I'm pretty
dang<00:03:30.930> sure

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.880 

actually<00:03:37.150> seems<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.720> can<00:03:37.900> power<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.620> to

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
actually seems like I can power it to
