00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.450
 mixing his 24 years I hope you 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.860
 be well then we find ourselves 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.820
 today for a new review ya 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.139
 two new taxes that are 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.490
 available in the packs so I 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.289
 risk of going on quite a bit at the level of 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.029
 revioo the first rovio is so the one 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.070
 by alexandre lacazette version team of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.750
 the season so the French scorer of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.580
 lyon is shifted into a league team 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.840
 1 with a lot of bones a match said ott 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.260
 a magazine that will be available on worlds 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.820
 in the weekend 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.019
 you have the game statins las cases 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.189
 and who will leap parades I you 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.910
 invites to 8 on break having to put in 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.020
 stop to better observe them 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.850
 for those who wish to buy 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.870
 wadifa credits as 5% in elections and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.680
 that coach jacques matte credit delivered 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.950
 within five minutes 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.290
 purchase 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.579
 according to available stocks so the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.719
 alexandre lacazette and what is it 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.000
 what can we say about him 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 start by talking about the price at the level 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.070
 the price is 90 me creates the game the review 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.020
 ie Thursday 13h so it's 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.210
 relatively interesting in the sense that 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.070
 toth basin and that 90 miles credit 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.510
 so that's not even a day it's 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.399
 in the packs that means that this 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.379
 weekend it will be significantly lower in 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.670
 terms of price and I could have put the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.500
 price in the positives it's true 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.150
 at the level of the negative points now 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.930
 I will follow up with these two 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.700
 negative points 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.420
 so the three stars bad foot its 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.310
 cause is still enough 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.930
 problematic when you're in front of 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.909
 cages his left foot is really 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.170
 bad he does not have a left foot I 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.670
 tempted some long hot girl 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.369
 left with it was not good at all 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.820
 the ball by any how and its 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.250
 physical 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.070
 so that stats in strength of 76 that's 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.290
 mytho he gets really moved 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.939
 really very very easily at the shoulder 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.110
 then on the other hand holds on his legs 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.560
 we feel 191 in balance but 176 in 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.210
 strength 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.360
 it spoils everything i was falling on david 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.009
 luiz on Kabul on the company's 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.390
 here simply has it destroyed at 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.820
 the shoulder makes it every time you 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.590
 how are you left? 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.049
 they come they put your hand on 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.299
 the shoulder you're really moving too 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.280
 easily even if sometimes it 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.290
 happened to hold but it's really 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.360
 rare so his physical bah is when 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.759
 even enough it's quite problematic 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.110
 for a scorer then at the level of 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.610
 positive pros now because that's 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.740
 the only negative points that I'm going 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.210
 find the finish then the finish 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.890
 on the inform I had put it in the east 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.759
 the more it's in the excitement there I put it that 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.650
 in the more because the finish he 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.599
 vastly better one penny 96 in finish 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.250
 this time we really feel it is 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.799
 feels good even if my miss a few 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.269
 stuff pretty awesome enough but 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.640
 good after that overall it was 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.079
 rather it was rather a quality of 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.220
 pass pretty good that's true but I 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.480
 did not put in the more but I want 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.670
 to specify nevertheless that its quality of 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.560
 pass remains remains more than correct at 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.450
 1.76 on the map and he made me 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.739
 some very interesting passes even 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.280
 if it has not been converted to a pass 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.360
 decisive 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.310
 by the way I made a decisive pass 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.750
 with him but she was not happy 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.680
 and that I did not understand I absolutely 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.450
 not understand why 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.489
 but here he decided not to 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.019
 technically count really very very 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.549
 strong is where he is still enough 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.549
 impressive this level of his technique 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.319
 four-star technical gesture and 185 in 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.329
 dribble so necessarily at the level of 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.190
 the execution of the dribbles that remains is 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.750
 good milk long shot I tried to 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.389
 some the ball goes very well 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.639
 even though I did not score 87 in cup 94 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.980
 in hitting power so that's when 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.989
 even interesting it remains a very 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.579
 interesting for those who for those who 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.500
 like to hit for those who love 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.670
 then hit the positioning 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.859
 now I pass I was going to 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.659
 positioning his positioning he's 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.819
 I really hesitate to put it in 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:17.650
 negatives too because he 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.120
 dezone enormously so he still 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.970
 the advantage of being very fast then that 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.379
 it is a positive point but it dezone 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.090
 so much that sometimes he found himself 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:26.530
 winger left winger right and so 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.280
 I really had problems with 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.530
 find in front of the goal 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.849
 so for that reason I actually hesitate 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.199
 to put it in the negative and 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.430
 well after all in all when I 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.769
 finds it right when he is well placed in 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.000
 the focused and that you find it beats to no 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.560
 problem in there really was a 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.129
 problem with him he's fine when he 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.379
 is well placed 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.599
 you turn with a hook and if you 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.949
 get to eliminate the opponent it's done 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.150
 goal and his head game he a game 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.940
 maybe more than correct for jeans 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.739
 to go to 1075 it to 1.83 with 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.209
 1.81 in precision of my head it is 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.030
 really okay even though I have not too much 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.349
 I did not focus too much but here is his camp 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.090
 I have when I had balloons on the 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.040
 head with him it was good so 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.900
 the alexandra kz2 you have the record that 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.190
 appears before your eyes so in the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.810
 negative points in the negative points 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.190
 way the physical so that's mostly it 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.609
 this childhood in fact that asked me 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.769
 problems 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.720
 I should have just put force because 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.549
 that's your balance is still 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.739
 interesting in the sense that even though this 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.239
 made to move there holds on his legs and 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.739
 its three bad foot stars that are 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.690
 still somewhat problematic for a 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.040
 scorer 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.120
 when you find yourself face to face 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.290
 time you bring him to hit left foot 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.640
 but he's his left foot is really 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.410
 very bad then at the level of 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.840
 positive points so his dribbling 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.370
 96 finish in a fairly wide finish 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.620
 that's what it takes for a scorer 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.970
 his speed he is really very fast 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.320
 even though sometimes I found that his 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.690
 speed on vers not felt really 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.070
 long shot the balloon not really very 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.860
 very much about the banks on his game of 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.320
 head positioning as I said well 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.940
 placed times but tends to too much 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.870
 to rezone and that can pose a problem in 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.850
 certain situations 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.680
 his striking power he hits very 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.940
 very strong and his four- star gesture 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.110
 technique I could have also put the 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.250
 pass quality but I did not put 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.140
 in the sense that I did not do too much 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.210
 too many assists either 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.610
 I thought I felt it was not 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.770
 necessarily too useful to put it in 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.750
 the positives so olaya balance sheet 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.760
 which is displayed will help you you have 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.890
 already balance sheet at his balance sheet level 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.570
 staff so seven games 11 goals 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.650
 there was a decisive pass but I did not 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.150
 do not know why she was not counted 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.430
 so seven games 11 goals and one pass 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.360
 twins I give it to myself anyway 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.610
 so that's still a very good balance sheet 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.380
 very interesting for a scorer we talk 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.810
 of a scorer toth and we talk about a scorer 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.550
 who intox who is alive and has already 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.960
 less than 100 miles while the first 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.910
 day and not even spend it does not even 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.770
 one day that he is in the bins and that 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.669
 is really very interesting for 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.300
 Lyon who wanted to redeem 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.950
 Lacazette 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.960
 do not hesitate and so I put a this is 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.180
 surely a very good note that we 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.220
 compared to lewandowski toys aguero 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.510
 tons stayed what I could tested 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.220
 previously he is still in 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.360
 but here it is not at all 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.220
 same budget year for the others one 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.350
 talking about players over 6600 between 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.790
 600 and 1 million 500 thousand credit there 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.620
 it's a player under 100 cases so 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.510
 it makes sense to have a little wait 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.130
 lower and in terms of quality 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.630
 still be less strong and not necessary 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.640
 forget that he has that 82 general on the 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.320
 map so it's true that here is 82 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.820
 general he has really in-game stats 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.320
 very interesting so that's all 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.730
 for the review of alexandre lacazette
