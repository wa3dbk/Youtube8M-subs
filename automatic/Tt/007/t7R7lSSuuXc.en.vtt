00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.179
 whiskey punkt.de meeting point fine 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.650
 spirits welcome to the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.099
 Whiskey store full of the meeting place 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.690
 Ghosts today we are back in 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:21.000
 Scotland at the distillery 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.609
 but it has an original bottling time 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.310
 given that singleton has and that 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.960
 singleton word you well on the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.480
 distillery data transfer 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.149
 So that's the singleton's unique 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.820
 the only one of may then comes and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.530
 if you breathe again, yes 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.000
 and the old bottles were also mostly 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.360
 At ten years old, this gentleman 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.860
 now so slowly to collector's item 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.079
 noted because otherwise no original 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.239
 bottling from the distillery tried 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.930
 I have ever had the oscars of the flora 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.050
 and fauna series which meanwhile as 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.930
 original is because they are a series of 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.430
 The owner of the breakdown is and not at all 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.370
 Of course, the big independent one is missing 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.340
 Bottler regularly has older bottles 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:14.549
 I have one in the art barn 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:18.530
 bottle of four of the traction doing that 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:23.640
 kammachi knows many of the specialists 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:31.579
 and they have an even raiskin here 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:36.530
 almost strength, and indeed from the year 1898 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:40.200
 21 1998 distilled the second 7 2012 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.009
 bottled alcohol strength 57 3 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.140
 volume percent 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.649
 that's the 146 bottle of 255 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.329
 bottles 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.329
 this was yes 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.530
 the special thing about them is the gram 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.350
 collection not filtered of course 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.120
 not dyed in strengthening pale and 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.619
 Manufacturer was so nice and has me so 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.390
 a small miniature with it given 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.420
 I do not have such a big bottle for her 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.560
 must attack because it does not exist 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.350
 many bottles of it and if they are 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.770
 popular then irritates me about each 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.510
 bottle that we tear here and the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.510
 there is no longer available for customers 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.030
 7 53 percent I'm sure 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.850
 for thin and now let's have a look 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.360
 on the nose of all the flavors 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.360
 arrives 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.150
 very much like us 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:05.799
 strong alcohol 753 drives honey very much 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.799
 nice honey sweetness united 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:17.220
 and this caramel together with the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:23.730
 Sweet reminds me a bit 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.650
 Caramel sweets a fruity 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.360
 component is there but sticks 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.340
 very strong back so the fruit 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.860
 is not as dominant for me as that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:47.640
 massive fas I have just that 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:49.230
 Warehouse locations exactly from this ob 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.440
 they now bottles comparatively little 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.230
 came out because it is almost in strength 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.590
 i was bottled 13 years ago 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.390
 little bit lost 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.840
 but still only 255 bottles 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.840
 enough 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:13.879
 it's getting a little spicier now 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.879
 makes itself indeed component noticeable 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:29.460
 but this strong city cham note the 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:31.669
 which carries everything something did not lead to 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.669
 a lot of 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:54.860
 now the fruity makes strong yes 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.589
 bear mother something like the raspberry 

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:11.710
 strawberries definitely bright red 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:13.300
 berry chronology gives way a bit 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:20.349
 back can not be this way anymore 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:21.520
 prevail and the humor I do 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.080
 earlier this pepper I played 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.649
 I'm now convinced about more 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.649
 direction korte 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.930
 officially means milder, too, I can 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:41.430
 do not notice 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:41.430
 not for you to try me 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:06:03.850
 or fruity comes a bit pillar 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:06.570
 he still uploads yes 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:12.300
 now the bitterness comes after 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:18.450
 This actually came quite Austria 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:22.510
 Blocher as such actually sun 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:24.550
 sun extremely spicy we have them 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.510
 Bitterness reaching red by distillery 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.510
 character does not have 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:35.590
 it is quite fruity and then on the finish 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:39.599
 This first one disappears the acid 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:42.720
 slight sweetness does not stay back too long 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:47.560
 left now to leave 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:50.430
 the fruit is the longest in 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.430
 this departure bears 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:59.439
 with the water is this red fruit 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:02.439
 note for me as now very clear 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:02.439
 recognizable 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.650
 officially it is still grape and 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:15.289
 give raisins but not found 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:19.400
 maybe in any case a 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:21.169
 distillery comparatively rare that it 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.750
 There is no original bottle 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:27.620
 here too, the pad does not work that way 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:30.080
 big a blend of a whiskey the 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:33.139
 usually go in the brenz looks 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.500
 in our shop system 25 bottles 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:39.530
 that means somewhere until the end of 2013 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.500
 they should stick out then starts 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:45.069
 slowly getting short 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.069
 thanks for watching
