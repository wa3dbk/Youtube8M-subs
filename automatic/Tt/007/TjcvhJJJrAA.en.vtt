00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.490
Today on this 2014 Honda CR-V, we&amp;#39;re going
to install part number BX7365.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.610
This is the Blue Ox Alpha Tow Bar, rated at
6500 pounds.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.940
First, thing we need to do is to check the
difference between the height of our tow vehicle,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.790
our CR-V, and the hitch on our motor home.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.410
It looks like we&amp;#39;ve got about 16 inches
from our tow bars, which is about the center

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.350
of the pin hole, down to the ground.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.660
Let&amp;#39;s check the center of our hitch on
our RV, it&amp;#39;s about 19 inches.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.300
We want to double check our label on our tow
bar, it has a difference of 4 inches max,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:54.980
either straight out from the tow bar 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:22.950
to 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:58.979
the RV 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:21.599
or 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:41.409
our 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:03:48.920
RV can be about 4 inches higher.
