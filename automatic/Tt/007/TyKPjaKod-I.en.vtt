that<00:01:57.299> raised<00:01:57.840> eyebrows<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.950> concerns<00:01:59.399> about

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that raised eyebrows and concerns about

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.639 
that raised eyebrows and concerns about
how<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.420> person<00:02:00.810> got<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> plane<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.530> who

how this person got on the plane and who

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.289 
how this person got on the plane and who
this<00:02:01.799> person<00:02:02.009> was<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.640> was<00:02:02.759> using<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
stolen passport then it emerged a short

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.609 
stolen passport then it emerged a short
while<00:02:05.490> later<00:02:05.759> than<00:02:06.060> an<00:02:06.180> Austrian<00:02:06.719> also<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.560> was

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
while later than an Austrian also it was

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.619 
while later than an Austrian also it was
a<00:02:07.710> similar<00:02:07.979> case<00:02:08.310> he<00:02:08.610> had<00:02:08.700> had<00:02:08.879> his<00:02:09.060> passport

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
a similar case he had had his passport

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.780 
a similar case he had had his passport
stolen<00:02:09.840> two<00:02:10.229> years<00:02:10.530> ago<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.800> phuket<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
stolen two years ago in phuket in the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.270 
stolen two years ago in phuket in the
same<00:02:12.000> area<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:13.050> Austrian<00:02:13.590> authorities

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
same area and the Austrian authorities

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.520 
same area and the Austrian authorities
from<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.700> he<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.060> also<00:02:15.450> alive<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.930> well<00:02:16.080> so

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
from that he is also alive and well so

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.590 
from that he is also alive and well so
this<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:16.709> obviously<00:02:17.010> raising<00:02:17.670> concerns<00:02:18.090> that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
this is obviously raising concerns that

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.300 
this is obviously raising concerns that
the<00:02:18.720> plane<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.620> may<00:02:19.860> not<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.160> been<00:02:20.190> an

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the plane this may not have been an

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.740 
the plane this may not have been an
accident<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:21.060> may<00:02:21.240> have<00:02:21.360> been<00:02:21.450> brought<00:02:21.690> down

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
accident it may have been brought down

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.720 
accident it may have been brought down
on<00:02:22.080> purpose<00:02:22.500> although<00:02:22.680> that's<00:02:22.920> speculation

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
on purpose although that's speculation

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.430 
on purpose although that's speculation
at<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.000> stage<00:02:24.330> but<00:02:24.750> lots<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.290> questions

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
at this stage but lots of questions

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.320 
at this stage but lots of questions
raised<00:02:25.980> by<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> fact<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.640> two<00:02:27.120> people

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
raised by the fact that two people

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.090 
raised by the fact that two people
apparently<00:02:27.780> at<00:02:28.230> least<00:02:28.440> two<00:02:28.620> people<00:02:28.980> with

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
apparently at least two people with

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.460 
apparently at least two people with
stolen<00:02:29.520> passports<00:02:29.670> were<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.020> plane<00:02:31.260> it

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
stolen passports were on this plane it

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.650 
stolen passports were on this plane it
seems<00:02:31.709> what<00:02:32.459> are<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> next<00:02:32.850> steps<00:02:32.970> Ryan<00:02:33.450> and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
seems what are the next steps Ryan and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.059 
seems what are the next steps Ryan and
how<00:02:33.780> long<00:02:33.959> do<00:02:34.170> we<00:02:34.290> believe<00:02:34.560> these<00:02:34.739> searches

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
how long do we believe these searches

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.479 
how long do we believe these searches
are<00:02:35.370> going<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:35.910> on<00:02:39.860> well<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.010> next<00:02:41.220> step<00:02:41.370> is

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
are going to go on well the next step is

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.240 
are going to go on well the next step is
obviously<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:42.060> try<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> find<00:02:43.500> any<00:02:43.770> any

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
obviously to try to find any any

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.130 
obviously to try to find any any
wreckage<00:02:44.819> any<00:02:45.120> survivors<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:45.959> that's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
wreckage any survivors if that's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.560 
wreckage any survivors if that's
possible<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:47.070> location<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.820> plane<00:02:48.030> then

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
possible the location of the plane then

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.870 
possible the location of the plane then
to<00:02:48.750> recover<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.680> plane<00:02:49.920> any<00:02:50.280> wreckage<00:02:50.730> that

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
to recover the plane any wreckage that

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.640 
to recover the plane any wreckage that
there<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.180> an<00:02:51.330> above<00:02:51.750> all<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.110> recover<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
there is an above all to recover the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.310 
there is an above all to recover the
voice<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.100> data<00:02:53.220> recorders<00:02:53.880> now<00:02:54.300> people<00:02:55.050> that

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
voice and data recorders now people that

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.840 
voice and data recorders now people that
are<00:02:55.440> familiar<00:02:55.560> with<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.070> conditions<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:56.730> that

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
are familiar with the conditions in that

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.970 
are familiar with the conditions in that
area<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.510> sea<00:02:57.720> say<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.470> depth<00:02:58.739> there

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
area of the sea say that the depth there

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.550 
area of the sea say that the depth there
is<00:02:59.100> only<00:02:59.280> about<00:02:59.459> 60<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.090> 80<00:03:00.390> meters<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.410> it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
is only about 60 to 80 meters so it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.590 
is only about 60 to 80 meters so it
should<00:03:01.860> be<00:03:02.010> easier<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.519> recover<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> data<00:03:03.269> and

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
should be easier to recover the data and

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.030 
should be easier to recover the data and
voice<00:03:03.750> recorders<00:03:04.350> than<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.830> previous

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
voice recorders than in previous

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.800 
voice recorders than in previous
instances<00:03:05.640> where<00:03:05.970> planes<00:03:06.239> have<00:03:06.420> gone<00:03:06.600> down

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
instances where planes have gone down

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.840 
instances where planes have gone down
over<00:03:06.840> open<00:03:07.500> ocean<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:07.890> has<00:03:08.010> taken<00:03:08.340> months<00:03:08.580> and

over open ocean and has taken months and

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.170 
over open ocean and has taken months and
even<00:03:08.940> longer<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.780> recover<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.850> vital<00:03:11.850> data

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
even longer to recover the vital data

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.240 
even longer to recover the vital data
that<00:03:12.600> is<00:03:12.720> required<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.230> unravel<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.920> mystery

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
that is required to unravel the mystery

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.250 
that is required to unravel the mystery
of<00:03:14.280> what<00:03:14.430> happened<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.910> flight<00:03:15.260> Ryan
