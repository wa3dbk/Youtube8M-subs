00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:31.119
 you know it's a schoolbook that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.030
 book is made of paper just like that 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.300
 one can paint on or on paper 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.300
 write 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:52.040
 paper also exists as a role if one 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.430
 you can handle the paper quite nicely 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.430
 To be long 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.210
 that here they are not that big roll 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.510
 are very hard and you need one 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.740
 forklift to move it 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.970
 Here you will be in a machine 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.200
 clamped 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.830
 It is a printing machine in the can 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.430
 you print paper from the huge one 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.229
 will be reading newspapers here 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.060
 not newspaper he will have the 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.610
 printing press standing in the newspaper 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.340
 news 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.310
 Much is considered from paper times 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.479
 There would be no paper 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.000
 reading book gap is a card game there 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:49.119
 There were no packaging 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.119
 banknotes and there would be no handkerchief 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.550
 if there was no paper would have animal on 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.190
 to write such slates like it 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.270
 your big and great grandparents in school 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.890
 still had to do 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.209
 that was pretty awkward but out 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.209
 What is paper? 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.690
 to find out what paper is 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.680
 we have to take a closer look 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.880
 No , you do not see anything like that yet 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.880
 maybe if we mature it through 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.290
 even better are the edges 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.540
 many small fibers escaped 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.920
 but to look at it very carefully 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.760
 we have such a thing here 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.950
 it's a microscope when you go in the top 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.850
 looks everything looks much bigger than 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.190
 With the naked eye we look 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.459
 together pure 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:00.870
 well here too loud fibers which 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:05.720
 mesh and these are fibers 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.720
 made of wood such wood from the forest 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.870
 paper is made of wood and old paper 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.870
 made
