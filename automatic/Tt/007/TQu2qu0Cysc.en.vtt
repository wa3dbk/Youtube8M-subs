00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.320 
underlying medical condition it could be
complicated<00:00:22.410> by<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> huge<00:00:23.640> consumption<00:00:24.090> of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
complicated by a huge consumption of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.820 
complicated by a huge consumption of
caffeine<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> short<00:00:25.140> period<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.410> time<00:00:25.470> so

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
caffeine in a short period of time so

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.029 
caffeine in a short period of time so
this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.789> these<00:00:27.090> are<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.420> cans<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.710> energy

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
this is these are two cans of the energy

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.560 
this is these are two cans of the energy
drink<00:00:29.400> they're<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> lot<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.119> different<00:00:30.210> kinds

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
drink they're a lot of different kinds

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
drink they're a lot of different kinds
of<00:00:30.599> energy<00:00:30.929> drink<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.260> these<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.560> two<00:00:31.679> 24

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
of energy drink but these are two 24

of energy drink but these are two 24
ounce<00:00:32.669> cans<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:34.010> how<00:00:35.010> much<00:00:35.160> caffeine

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
ounce cans so what is how much caffeine

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.920 
ounce cans so what is how much caffeine
is<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.760> sure<00:00:35.880> well<00:00:36.120> first<00:00:36.420> let's<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.719> clear

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
that there are a lot of different energy

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.619 
that there are a lot of different energy
drinks<00:00:38.550> we're<00:00:38.820> not<00:00:38.969> picking<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.450> this

germane to our story but there are all

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.119 
germane to our story but there are all
kinds<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.260> energy<00:00:43.469> drinks<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.829> parents

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
kinds of energy drinks that parents

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.760 
kinds of energy drinks that parents
should<00:00:44.160> be<00:00:44.309> aware<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.610> these<00:00:45.420> particular<00:00:45.780> two

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
should be aware of these particular two

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.080 
should be aware of these particular two
sizes<00:00:47.399> combined<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.800> 480<00:00:49.800> milligrams<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
sizes combined have 480 milligrams of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.819 
sizes combined have 480 milligrams of
caffeine<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.379> we're<00:00:52.590> gonna<00:00:52.680> say

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
caffeine what is that we're gonna say

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.180 
caffeine what is that we're gonna say
what<00:00:53.010> does<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.250> mean<00:00:53.430> well<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:55.190> so

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
what does that mean well here we have so

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.580 
what does that mean well here we have so
people<00:00:56.309> can<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.989> would<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> equivalent

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
people can see would be the equivalent

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.900 
people can see would be the equivalent
of<00:00:58.920> seven<00:00:59.579> shots<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.000> espresso<00:01:00.469> or<00:01:01.910> fourteen

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of seven shots of espresso or fourteen

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.350 
of seven shots of espresso or fourteen
cans<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.750> soda<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> equivalent<00:01:05.700> okay

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
cans of soda that is the equivalent okay

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
cans of soda that is the equivalent okay
and<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> issue<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.350> Anderson<00:01:07.860> let's<00:01:08.040> be

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and the issue here Anderson let's be

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.780 
and the issue here Anderson let's be
clear<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.030> issue<00:01:09.210> here<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.790> concentrated

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
clear the issue here is the concentrated

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.870 
clear the issue here is the concentrated
time<00:01:12.060> over<00:01:12.630> which<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.140> was<00:01:13.350> consumed<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.640> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
time over which this was consumed if you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.670 
time over which this was consumed if you
drink<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.240> over<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> week<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.960> wouldn't<00:01:16.619> do

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
drink this over a week it wouldn't do

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.050 
drink this over a week it wouldn't do
anything<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.460> drink<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.850> within

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
24 hours obviously and you have an

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.410 
24 hours obviously and you have an
underlying<00:01:20.400> condition<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.210> could

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
underlying condition this could

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.880 
underlying condition this could
complicate<00:01:21.750> did<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:22.530> how<00:01:22.770> much

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
thing Anderson is caffeine can cause

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
thing Anderson is caffeine can cause
something<00:02:09.810> call<00:02:10.050> something<00:02:10.229> called

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
something call something called

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.229 
something call something called
vasoconstriction<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.819> we<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> great

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
vasoconstriction so we have a great

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.480 
vasoconstriction so we have a great
graphic<00:02:12.510> here<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.110> blood

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
graphic here of a blood

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.600 
graphic here of a blood
so<00:02:13.670> on<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.600> left<00:02:14.840> side<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.800> normal<00:02:16.280> blood

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
so on the left side is a normal blood

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.950 
so on the left side is a normal blood
vessel<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.240> is<00:02:17.360> what<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.600> typically<00:02:17.870> looks

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
vessel that is what it typically looks

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.690 
vessel that is what it typically looks
like<00:02:18.140> your<00:02:18.290> blood<00:02:18.470> flows<00:02:18.710> through<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.100> on<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
like your blood flows through it on the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.550 
like your blood flows through it on the
right<00:02:19.910> side<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.480> when<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.960> blood<00:02:21.170> vessel

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
right side is when the blood vessel

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.670 
right side is when the blood vessel
narrows<00:02:22.100> or<00:02:22.460> becomes<00:02:23.060> constricted<00:02:23.810> then<00:02:24.500> you

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
narrows or becomes constricted then you

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.440 
narrows or becomes constricted then you
have<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.860> smaller<00:02:25.400> space<00:02:25.760> for<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.030> blood<00:02:26.210> to<00:02:26.300> go

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
have a smaller space for the blood to go

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.150 
have a smaller space for the blood to go
through<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:27.410> can<00:02:27.560> create<00:02:27.770> all<00:02:27.890> kinds<00:02:27.920> of

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
through and that can create all kinds of

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.470 
through and that can create all kinds of
or<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.460> is<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.580> dumb<00:02:28.760> question<00:02:28.940> but<00:02:29.270> when<00:02:29.390> you

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
or this is a dumb question but when you

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.000 
or this is a dumb question but when you
exercise<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.930> want<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.350> get<00:02:30.470> your<00:02:30.620> heart<00:02:30.770> rate

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
exercise you want to get your heart rate

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.860 
exercise you want to get your heart rate
up<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:31.400> what's<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> problem<00:02:32.390> with<00:02:32.540> getting

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
up so what's the problem with getting

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.390 
up so what's the problem with getting
your<00:02:32.930> heart<00:02:33.140> rate<00:02:33.260> up<00:02:33.320> if<00:02:33.650> with<00:02:33.860> caffeine

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
your heart rate up if with caffeine

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.680 
your heart rate up if with caffeine
sure<00:02:34.610> well<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.940> issue<00:02:35.090> will<00:02:35.390> get<00:02:35.510> your<00:02:35.600> heart

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
sure well the issue will get your heart

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.990 
sure well the issue will get your heart
rate<00:02:35.840> with<00:02:35.960> exercise<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.860> will<00:02:37.070> go<00:02:37.220> away<00:02:37.340> so

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
rate with exercise is it will go away so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.700 
rate with exercise is it will go away so
when<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.180> stop<00:02:38.450> exercising<00:02:38.660> your<00:02:39.230> heart<00:02:39.500> will

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
when you stop exercising your heart will

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.710 
when you stop exercising your heart will
normalize<00:02:40.220> heart<00:02:40.520> rate<00:02:40.610> will<00:02:40.730> normalize<00:02:41.150> with

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
normalize heart rate will normalize with

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.740 
normalize heart rate will normalize with
caffeine<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.710> an<00:02:42.890> extended<00:02:43.700> effect<00:02:44.120> over<00:02:44.720> a
