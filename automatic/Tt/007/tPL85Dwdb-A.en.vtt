00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
South Africa will make it on Doris US

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.159 
South Africa will make it on Doris US
and<00:03:47.829> Mexico<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:49.120> know<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.479> drawer<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:50.049> the

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
and Mexico you know the drawer is the

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.839 
and Mexico you know the drawer is the
drawing<00:03:50.560> is<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.709> first<00:03:51.040> time<00:03:51.250> they<00:03:51.400> had<00:03:51.549> a

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
drawing is the first time they had a

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.719 
drawing is the first time they had a
pure<00:03:52.659> draw<00:03:53.049> luck<00:03:53.409> of<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.590> draw<00:03:53.829> in<00:03:54.310> the

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
pure draw luck of the draw in the

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.599 
pure draw luck of the draw in the
CONCACAF<00:03:55.090> final<00:03:55.540> phase<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:55.720> qualifying<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:57.489> I

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
CONCACAF final phase of qualifying and I

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.270 
CONCACAF final phase of qualifying and I
think<00:03:57.879> you<00:03:58.540> know<00:03:58.659> even<00:03:58.810> though<00:03:59.109> on<00:03:59.620> paper<00:03:59.799> it

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
think you know even though on paper it

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.729 
think you know even though on paper it
sounds<00:04:00.699> like<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:00.879> very<00:04:01.090> tough<00:04:01.479> schedule<00:04:01.989> then

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
sounds like a very tough schedule then

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.030 
sounds like a very tough schedule then
you<00:04:03.129> can<00:04:03.310> look<00:04:03.519> at<00:04:03.639> the<00:04:03.849> half<00:04:04.449> for<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.769> glass

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
you can look at the half for the glass

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.550 
you can look at the half for the glass
half<00:04:06.280> full<00:04:06.310> if<00:04:06.819> they<00:04:07.449> get<00:04:07.629> points<00:04:08.049> away<00:04:08.349> on

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
half full if they get points away on

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.099 
half full if they get points away on
those<00:04:08.829> three<00:04:09.310> out<00:04:09.489> of<00:04:09.519> four<00:04:09.849> matches<00:04:10.329> then<00:04:10.690> you

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
those three out of four matches then you

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.580 
those three out of four matches then you
know<00:04:11.229> on<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.650> return<00:04:12.250> legs<00:04:12.870> they<00:04:13.870> have<00:04:14.139> to

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
know on the return legs they have to

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.680 
know on the return legs they have to
play<00:04:14.799> those<00:04:15.069> three<00:04:15.519> out<00:04:15.639> of<00:04:15.669> four<00:04:16.000> at<00:04:16.150> home<00:04:16.359> and
