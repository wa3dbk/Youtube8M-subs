00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:19.339
 once we have made the connection of the ports and programmed properly 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:20.579
 the commutator 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.089
 we can perform the quick installation process ocup 0 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.750
 this process he basically set up mail matica 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:30.579
 voice 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.420
 in which all exemptions from the system are assigned a mailbox 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.960
 the humor of general use or is the same of its corresponding exemption 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.140
 The steps to follow are those 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.530
 when connecting the mail 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.580
 we open the utilities menu 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.490
 default parameters 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.130
 adjust by default 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.840
 here we will enter the data corresponding to the computer model 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.190
 with which he is connected 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.140
 we click on accept 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.880
 and now we open utilities 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.830
 for blanks by default 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.830
 load by default 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.590
 at the end of the process that I would like in liza 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.380
 the system asks us to restart the computer 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 for which it enters mutually to the utilities menu 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.020
 but now at the initialization option he rebooted the system 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.350
 we choose to initialize system 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.770
 and enter the length of the mailboxes 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.920
 as well as the members of usoc of system administrators 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.040
 when the system is restored 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.520
 we are going to enter at least one putt idades 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.850
 quick configuration 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.660
 during this process 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.840
 did not display a window in which we have certain values â€‹â€‹such as 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.860
 payments from system administrators 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.770
 switch type 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.770
 integration mode and so on 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.149
 later he asks us if we want to do it auto configuration 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.620
 This process 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.730
 will not automatically detect exemptions 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.880
 and will generate their own mailbox to each of them 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.860
 it is recommended to delete all those men that are not necessary 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.369
 as can be the faxes 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.159
 we can avoid it, mailboxes that do know how to use 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.179
 here and there certain values 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:30.919
 as name and surname 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.919
 kind of service 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:39.559
 the procedure is going to continue with following buttons and accept 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.559
 until a message appears 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.559
 that the process has been completed 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.389
 the way to confirm that the integration alessio established with 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.679
 success is as follows 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.209
 of any exemption we have or do not have 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.290
 we mark alex cession elm moor floating in the mail 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.290
 if you answered a recording that welcomes us to the system 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.169
 it means that the configuration is correct 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.169
 let's do it now 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.909
 David Lee 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.589

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.739
 tel efe p 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.829
 but then come back the athlete and despite that pl 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.139
 if for some reason the collection was not successful 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.339
 You can review the following points 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.339
 the corridor is on 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:43.059
 check that the connections are correct and the cables are in good condition 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.379
 the commutator that is programmed appropriately 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.089
 and repeat the cruise procedure
