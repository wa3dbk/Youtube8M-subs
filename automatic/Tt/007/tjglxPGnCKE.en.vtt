right<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.680> Ireland<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.340> go<00:00:20.460> channel<00:00:20.939> search

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
we talked a little bit about am about to

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.130 
we talked a little bit about am about to
stare<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.059> channels<00:00:33.450> here<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.989> file

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
stare of your channels here just file

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.040 
stare of your channels here just file
it's<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.380> true<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.660> basically<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:36.930> this

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
it's going true and basically what this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.130 
it's going true and basically what this
box<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:39.120> does<00:00:39.329> two<00:00:39.570> particular

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
box can do and it does two particular

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.549 
box can do and it does two particular
things<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:41.070> lot<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.370> other<00:00:41.520> generic<00:00:42.059> and

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
things that a lot of other generic and

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.740 
things that a lot of other generic and
receivers<00:00:43.559> won't<00:00:44.100> do<00:00:44.340> okay<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> first

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
receivers won't do okay so the first

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.450 
receivers won't do okay so the first
thing<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.050> we'll<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.039> very<00:00:47.219> good

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
thing that we'll do which is very good

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.880 
thing that we'll do which is very good
is<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.059> actually<00:00:48.480> pulls<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.930> aged<00:00:49.289> Irish

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
is it actually pulls in the aged Irish

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.720 
is it actually pulls in the aged Irish
channels<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.289> okay<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.160> lot<00:00:53.699> of

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
channels and in one go okay a lot of

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.700 
channels and in one go okay a lot of
generic<00:00:54.329> receivers<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.559> do

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
generic receivers what you have to do

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979 
generic receivers what you have to do
it'll<00:00:55.920> only<00:00:56.160> detect<00:00:56.699> seven<00:00:57.149> channels<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
it'll only detect seven channels and the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.410 
it'll only detect seven channels and the
reason<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.399> there's<00:01:00.239> two

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
reason for this is that and there's two

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.420 
reason for this is that and there's two
channels<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.109> broadcast<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.890> opposite<00:01:02.250> ends

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
channels that broadcast at opposite ends

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.250 
channels that broadcast at opposite ends
of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> day<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.180> whether<00:01:03.539> or<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.719> broadcast

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
of the day and whether or not broadcast

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.960 
of the day and whether or not broadcast
under<00:01:04.409> dormant<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.129> certain<00:01:05.369> boxes<00:01:05.700> can't

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
under dormant and certain boxes can't

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.390 
under dormant and certain boxes can't
pick<00:01:06.180> them<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:06.960> means<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.100> an

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
pick them up which means that in of an

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.640 
pick them up which means that in of an
evening<00:01:08.570> let's<00:01:09.570> say<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> had<00:01:10.110> tuned<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.530> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
evening let's say if you had tuned it in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
evening let's say if you had tuned it in
during<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> day<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.939> tuned<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.510> again

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
during the day if you tuned it in again

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.330 
during the day if you tuned it in again
in<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:12.990> evening<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.590> would<00:01:13.710> pick<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> air

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
in the evening it would pick up the air

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
in the evening it would pick up the air
channel<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.330> age<00:01:15.540> Channel<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.290> should<00:01:16.500> say<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
channel the age Channel I should say and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.920 
channel the age Channel I should say and
it<00:01:17.759> would<00:01:17.850> additi<00:01:18.150> earnest<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:18.810> you

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
it would additi earnest so then you

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.690 
it would additi earnest so then you
would<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.110> VA<00:01:19.350> channels<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.250> know<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.610> all

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
would have VA channels you know for all

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.870 
would have VA channels you know for all
time<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:22.140> that's<00:01:22.950> fine<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.729> an

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
time and and that's fine so it's just an

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.190 
time and and that's fine so it's just an
inconvenience<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.450> you'd<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.960> scan<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
inconvenience that you'd have to scan a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
inconvenience that you'd have to scan a
second<00:01:25.650> time<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.369> box<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.939> actually

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
second time but this box is actually

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.910 
second time but this box is actually
clever<00:01:27.479> enough<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.140> even<00:01:28.560> though

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
clever enough to know that even though

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.010 
clever enough to know that even though
one<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.490> channels<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.970> dormant<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.869> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
one of the channels is dormant there is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.630 
one of the channels is dormant there is
actually<00:01:31.439> eight<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.009> will<00:01:32.159> pick<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> age

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
actually eight and it will pick the age

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.990 
actually eight and it will pick the age
up<00:01:32.850> in<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.829> okay<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.400> next<00:01:35.610> thing<00:01:35.729> that's

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
up in one go okay the next thing that's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
up in one go okay the next thing that's
actually<00:01:36.210> impressive<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.170> box<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.710> I'm

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
actually impressive on the box is I'm

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
actually impressive on the box is I'm
very<00:01:38.220> few<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.860> know<00:01:40.860> generic<00:01:41.460> receivers

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
very few and you know generic receivers

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.139 
very few and you know generic receivers
do<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:43.740> when<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.130> scans<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.729> all<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
do this is that when it scans in all the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.170 
do this is that when it scans in all the
channels<00:01:45.840> okay<00:01:46.229> you'll<00:01:47.009> see<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.790> my

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
channels okay you'll see here from my

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.090 
channels okay you'll see here from my
scan<00:01:48.570> when<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.229> goes<00:01:49.380> through<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.829> going<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
scan when it goes through it's going to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.069 
scan when it goes through it's going to
pick<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.369> several<00:01:50.670> transmitters<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
pick up several transmitters and you

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.800 
pick up several transmitters and you
know<00:01:52.200> pick<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.130> 24<00:01:53.670> channels<00:01:54.180> okay<00:01:54.420> so

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
know pick up up to 24 channels okay so

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.170 
know pick up up to 24 channels okay so
it'll<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.530> three<00:01:56.130> sets<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:56.790> from<00:01:57.000> three

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it'll be three sets of them from three

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.240 
it'll be three sets of them from three
different<00:01:57.360> transmitters<00:01:57.930> both<00:01:58.649> cleverly

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
different transmitters both cleverly

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.679 
different transmitters both cleverly
what<00:01:59.430> actually<00:01:59.790> does<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.210> works<00:02:00.479> out

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
what actually does is it works out

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.330 
what actually does is it works out
what's<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.079> best<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.130> that's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
what's the best one for you and that's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.330 
what's the best one for you and that's
the<00:02:02.579> only<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.090> saves<00:02:03.409> so<00:02:04.409> from<00:02:05.100> our

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the only one it saves so from our

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.190 
the only one it saves so from our
testing<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.939> boxes<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.630> things<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.990> this

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
testing of boxes and things like this

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.020 
testing of boxes and things like this
it's<00:02:07.439> one<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> very<00:02:07.979> few<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.459> actually<00:02:08.789> does

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
it's one a very few it actually does

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.930 
it's one a very few it actually does
this<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:10.140> that's<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.500> good<00:02:10.649> little<00:02:10.830> feature<00:02:11.160> so

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
this so that's a good little feature so

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.340 
this so that's a good little feature so
we're<00:02:12.209> coming<00:02:12.390> up<00:02:12.540> towards<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
we're coming up towards the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.180 
we're coming up towards the
here<00:02:13.680> now<00:02:13.920> I'm<00:02:14.220> you'll<00:02:14.460> see<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:16.040> you'll<00:02:17.040> see

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
here now I'm you'll see and you'll see

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.620 
here now I'm you'll see and you'll see
the<00:02:17.310> end<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.580> process<00:02:17.760> interestingly

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the end of the process interestingly

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.800 
the end of the process interestingly
enough<00:02:19.170> also<00:02:19.440> there's<00:02:19.920> m10<00:02:20.880> digital<00:02:21.420> radio

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
enough also there's m10 digital radio

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.320 
enough also there's m10 digital radio
stations<00:02:22.290> from<00:02:22.410> RTE<00:02:22.830> also<00:02:23.580> scanned<00:02:23.970> in<00:02:24.180> and

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
stations from RTE also scanned in and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.690 
stations from RTE also scanned in and
these<00:02:25.230> are<00:02:25.440> actually<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.830> DUP<00:02:26.130> channels<00:02:26.580> that

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
these are actually the DUP channels that

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.640 
these are actually the DUP channels that
are<00:02:26.760> broadcasting<00:02:27.510> through<00:02:27.720> them<00:02:27.990> through

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
are broadcasting through them through

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.260 
are broadcasting through them through
this<00:02:28.770> their<00:02:29.010> view<00:02:29.220> service<00:02:29.670> or<00:02:29.850> doubt<00:02:30.060> is

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
this their view service or doubt is

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.850 
this their view service or doubt is
going<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.600> be<00:02:30.660> rolled<00:02:30.900> out<00:02:31.110> at<00:02:31.230> some<00:02:31.410> point<00:02:31.680> in

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
going to be rolled out at some point in

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.680 
going to be rolled out at some point in
the<00:02:31.950> future<00:02:31.980> it's<00:02:32.610> probably<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.210> long<00:02:33.450> way<00:02:33.660> off

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the future it's probably a long way off

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.660 
the future it's probably a long way off
till<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.470> know<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.100> full<00:02:35.460> coverage

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
till you know we have full coverage

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.630 
till you know we have full coverage
across<00:02:36.120> Ireland<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:37.170> conveniently<00:02:38.160> they're

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
across Ireland but conveniently they're

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.520 
across Ireland but conveniently they're
broadcasted<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.720> air<00:02:39.900> view<00:02:40.050> service

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
broadcasted on this air view service

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.170 
broadcasted on this air view service
anyway<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.220> know<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.850> vast<00:02:42.030> majority

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
anyway so you know the vast majority

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.290 
anyway so you know the vast majority
people<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:42.960> get<00:02:43.110> them<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.440> way<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.030> you'll

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
people can get them this way so you'll

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.960 
people can get them this way so you'll
see<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.630> now<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.110> saved<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.970> what

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
see there now it's just saved so what

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.760 
see there now it's just saved so what
we'll<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.330> is<00:02:48.600> we'll<00:02:48.780> just<00:02:49.020> scroll<00:02:49.710> down

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
we'll do is we'll just scroll down

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.380 
we'll do is we'll just scroll down
through<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.190> list<00:02:50.280> there<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:50.910> see<00:02:51.120> even

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
through the list there you can see even

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.390 
through the list there you can see even
though<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.750> picked<00:02:51.990> up<00:02:52.110> 24<00:02:52.620> channels<00:02:53.070> which

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
though it picked up 24 channels which

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.100 
though it picked up 24 channels which
means<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.880> picked<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.270> eight<00:02:54.510> channels<00:02:54.960> from

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
means it picked up eight channels from

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.870 
means it picked up eight channels from
three<00:02:55.320> transmitters<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.430> only<00:02:56.640> actually

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
three transmitters it only actually

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.730 
three transmitters it only actually
saved<00:02:57.330> one<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.720> them<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:58.020> me<00:02:58.140> it's<00:02:58.320> worked<00:02:58.530> out

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
saved one of them for me it's worked out

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.140 
saved one of them for me it's worked out
that<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.370> best<00:02:59.550> one<00:02:59.760> for<00:02:59.970> me

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
that this is the best one for me

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.500 
that this is the best one for me
and<00:03:00.870> that's<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.130> one<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.460> only<00:03:02.610> saved<00:03:03.000> so

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
and that's the one it's only saved so

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.030 
and that's the one it's only saved so
that's<00:03:03.780> very<00:03:03.930> handy<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.440> that's<00:03:04.620> basically

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
that's very handy so that's basically
