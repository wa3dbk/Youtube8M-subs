00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
we can stay in that hardpoint zone the

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.300 
we can stay in that hardpoint zone the
better<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.350> while<00:03:37.530> we'll<00:03:37.680> still<00:03:38.040> take<00:03:38.250> a

we've blown up immediately a more

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.920 
we've blown up immediately a more

players down as the end of the room you
might<00:03:45.600> notice<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.170> couple<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.530> these<00:03:46.650> clips

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
might notice in a couple of these clips

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.949 
might notice in a couple of these clips
that<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.190> actually<00:03:47.340> use<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.120> fast<00:03:48.330> hands<00:03:48.630> perk

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
that I actually use the fast hands perk

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.690 
that I actually use the fast hands perk
originally<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.830> made<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:50.370> choice<00:03:50.640> because

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
originally I made this choice because

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.520 
originally I made this choice because
we're<00:03:51.180> using<00:03:51.330> so<00:03:51.690> many<00:03:51.810> pieces<00:03:52.080> of<00:03:52.290> equipment

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
we're using so many pieces of equipment

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.710 
we're using so many pieces of equipment
like<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.070> c4<00:03:53.549> in<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.730> tactical<00:03:54.209> grenades<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
like the c4 in the tactical grenades the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.240 
like the c4 in the tactical grenades the
fast<00:03:55.019> hands<00:03:55.260> Burke<00:03:55.560> would<00:03:55.739> make<00:03:55.950> throwing

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
fast hands Burke would make throwing

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.289 
fast hands Burke would make throwing
these<00:03:56.370> things<00:03:56.430> much<00:03:56.850> quicker

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
these things much quicker

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.030 
these things much quicker
I<00:03:57.450> don't<00:03:58.019> know<00:03:58.110> about<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.709> always<00:03:58.860> have

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
constantly gunned down even after I'd

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150 
constantly gunned down even after I'd
open<00:04:06.480> fire<00:04:06.660> first<00:04:07.019> I<00:04:07.320> decided<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.739> switch<00:04:07.980> out

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
open fire first I decided to switch out

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.910 
open fire first I decided to switch out
that<00:04:08.340> fast<00:04:08.519> hands<00:04:08.790> burn<00:04:09.120> for<00:04:09.420> toughness<00:04:09.920> after

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
that fast hands burn for toughness after

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.530 
that fast hands burn for toughness after
I<00:04:10.950> did<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.280> didn't<00:04:11.549> really<00:04:11.760> miss<00:04:11.940> fast<00:04:12.269> hands

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
I did so I didn't really miss fast hands

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.360 
I did so I didn't really miss fast hands
at<00:04:12.690> all<00:04:12.810> doing<00:04:13.470> those<00:04:13.590> see<00:04:13.799> falls<00:04:14.070> out<00:04:14.340> and

at all doing those see falls out and
throwing<00:04:14.760> those<00:04:14.910> flashbangs<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.720> really<00:04:16.109> a

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
throwing those flashbangs is really a

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.960 
throwing those flashbangs is really a
long<00:04:16.380> process<00:04:16.739> but<00:04:17.549> on<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.790> other<00:04:17.880> hand

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
long process but on the other hand

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.610
