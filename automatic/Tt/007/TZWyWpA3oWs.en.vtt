00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.920
 all good mood with you i 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.690
 Anthony today would like to show you 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.359
 my new building in my new 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.270
 a project that called anthony tapes and what 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.150
 this is a new construction this is my new 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.599
 cinema minecraft yes cinema 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.000
 I decided not to build today, but in general 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.880
 then build a cinema because somehow 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.070
 here yes here now very much as you know 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.500
 cinema became important for me too 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.960
 I often go to the cinema and decided to build 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.149
 cinema plus in comments I noticed that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 very many people asked for construction 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.890
 cinema and now may follow 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.260
 such a percentage they are type cho for garbage chi 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.390
 tobi shaders but it turned out that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.280
 report me for some reason now that's it 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.870
 now minkravt a little podlagivaet 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.670
 generally strange though like new 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.469
 bought a graphics card but still minekravt 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.710
 podlagivaet and therefore I have to 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.049
 meanwhile put in general and that is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.210
 remove all shaders completely and only 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.430
 texture is of course the name itself sad 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.490
 but I hope the next video is all 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.610
 I'll fix the cinema itself basically 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.170
 built in brown and red 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.350
 that is, in principle, quite trite 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.030
 for my city here it is built here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.040
 here here in the center that is for those who 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.900
 I still do not understand where it is located 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.479
 built here the hotel is there 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.470
 the beach is a shop here and here it is next to 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.540
 store the hotel itself and oh and the very 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.240
 cinema on a big to be honest here 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 If you look at it , it inspires such 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.470
 I donâ€™t know one too 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.780
 some kind of massive seems that there 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.549
 in general there is so much space and when 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.259
 come in it turns out that here instead of that 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.149
 so much really here 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.430
 there are two very large rooms that is 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.909
 I made two halls here for the red ones 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.970
 these here 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.130
 in blocks, there is one hall and a second hall, and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.869
 and the main place I took here every 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.450
 mechanisms that is , the exchange mechanism 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.090
 there and other things but actually 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.079
 let's get started then here I go 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.380
 own our cinema 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.789
 we have him here 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.200
 small hall what is here 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.270
 here are two braids on 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.640
 automatic exchange of emeralds on 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.380
 a ticket that is, we have it as a ticket 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.380
 here let me already have emeralds 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.480
 we throw 1 emerald 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.060
 we get the paper proper paper on 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.650
 serves as a ticket then seeds as a ticket to 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.769
 cinema that is we can take this 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.500
 paper to go home but of course as a 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.880
 toilet paper can not be used but 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.860
 just like to sit at home to sit 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.590
 home wait and now the movie 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.260
 will start you come and here's how us 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.319
 go into the hall itself is very 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.930
 just here either go here or here 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.840
 This is the first hall or here in the second hall 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.959
 There is looking where it will be and what movie these 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.120
 here let's say here the first hall we throw our 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.920
 ticket and and 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.080
 and something I did not have time to get to here 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.620
 such a minus is what I built so 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.060
 mechanism so that as soon as you throw in 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.769
 must pass because once on 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.959
 the next step can also follow you 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.299
 and therefore here it is necessary right here so 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.090
 here's a quick pass and this is how u 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.959
 us hall big 3 so here it is 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.480
 looks here is our big 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.070
 the big screen that is well here for me it 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.350
 basically big is here 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.660
 projector or what is it called bullshit 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.000
 which displays exactly the movie itself on 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.400
 our screen here is enough 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.500
 good is lighting and 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.420
 You can turn it off but about it 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.400
 a little bit later I also want to say that 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.470
 here I installed a special mod on 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.350
 furniture here here are the chairs here 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.000
 they see a little bit unusual here too 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.280
 there is such a cool 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.600
 addition that you can click pro 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.180
 mouse button, and you sort of village 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.430
 you can sit in this chair 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.100
 very comfortable here we actually visited 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.160
 first hall and first hall he will 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.500
 look exactly the same as 2 2 for 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.840
 we have exactly the same as I said and 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.600
 actually let's say a movie 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.340
 watched the movie yes and how do we get out 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.680
 you can click here to exit 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.359
 either here through the second floor now 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.470
 tell you what we have here 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.800
 here we are 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.959
 Himself as if the main office that is 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.130
 The administration of this cinema is here 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.920
 we are also sitting some kind of influential 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.570
 man is some kind of administrator and you 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.970
 can you ask any questions here 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.010
 there are even blinds with this mod too 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.090
 convenient garbage on me very much 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.520
 here it is a lot of any lighting 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.280
 watch that shows the time of the book 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.200
 there is generally shorter a lot of everything and not this 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.920
 really like it because i can do it all 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.900
 use 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.760
 Here you are, let's say, looked 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.740
 movie you can go down click on 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.540
 button and exit that is with the door 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.330
 it will close back and you will not be able to exit 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.330
 to come in . here we are so small 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.100
 a cafe that is you can if there 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.320
 some break can come down here 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.300
 eat something counting man 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.310
 remember put so boring little 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.660
 the lighting is again controlled by you 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.290
 You can turn on the mouse button 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.180
 turn off 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.970
 also very convenient and here actually 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.220
 such two small doors and what is it 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.390
 beyond the door and this is exactly the same room 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.700
 the person who will be responsible for 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.850
 lighting in general throughout the room here 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.130
 two levers where it is written and that means 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.550
 with completely all of the light that is the upper 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.890
 and on the ceiling and lower between the rows of color 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.490
 You can turn it off and this is exactly 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.650
 the movie is exactly the project projector not 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.660
 I remember how he says doctor projector 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.760
 that's it and you can include 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.010
 turn off i have lighting adjust 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.110
 here again there is a small library 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.780
 Ie books with instructions can 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.700
 sit pro mouse button click here and 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.310
 again lighting well in general here 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.169
 everything is in principle very simple also here 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.990
 there is again some other door to 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.070
 what is this door to this we have after 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.140
 how do you buy a ticket somewhere 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.670
 these tickets must go somewhere 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.540
 the emerald must be denied they all 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.900
 do wrong 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.820
 exactly that is fly right from yes here 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.520
 precisely fly because on funnels 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.410
 everybody here they go to this chest here 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.300
 there are already three emeralds, but I will take 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.890
 here they come from these two 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.590
 doors and you can them yes that is man 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.210
 who is responsible for the budget for 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.490
 money in general of this cinema 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.580
 come here collect emeralds and everything and 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.840
 can have fun and walk further here 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.000
 we are located very second room 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.920
 similar to the first one here is the same 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.720
 only with the second halls here can you 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.420
 same as i said light 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.390
 control also have music well 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.250
 of course our library and also here 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.440
 any kind of small buns that is 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.930
 in my opinion it is very convenient to a minimum 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.910
 here everything is arranged and somehow to me in 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.840
 Basically liked quite well, as I 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:49.910
 showed here we have an office 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:53.260
 administrations are in general in 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.120
 Basically, that is all, that is, I told 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.400
 my such here is a cinema which I 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.720
 built the other day and honestly say 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.110
 of course I have now very much 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.490
 sad about the fact that I can not yet 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.870
 use shaders you are honest here 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.000
 really just a little bit for now 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.350
 sadness also built such 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.870
 the lamps that is they are very nightly 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.690
 cool will shine I have tried and 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.840
 it really is very cool then 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.240
 there is an entrance you can see and that's it 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.130
 the name of this is our whole 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.200
 the cinema is also well lit 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.960
 also here i have already applied it to others 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.940
 my previous buildings well in general 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.600
 in principle, everything is just the sun 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:35.150
 sits down i mean i managed exactly on time 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:38.870
 On this, in principle, everything I am under our 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:41.480
 such a sunset and finish this note to all 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.350
 great mood all good and 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.260
 positive 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.180
 so what kind of wait my 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.100
 the following buildings I will try 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.480
 build yourself as soon as possible 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.720
 made a little vacation 

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:57.010
 in general already sat here okay everyone good luck 

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.010
 bye everyone
