00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hello to all the studio addicts and 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.040
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.720
 new video is for the video of 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.790
 presentation of my mac 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.280
 finally the moc that I had already presented 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.170
 to the slide show on my channel but here it is 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.380
 now in presentation per month I 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.680
 gives you a small overview 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.300
 first a big thank you to my 100 subscribers 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.470
 100 subscribers really it made me great 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.750
 pleasure of super content do not hesitate 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.100
 yet to subscribe if it's not 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 still done but without waouh subscribers 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.290
 I was super happy of course there is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.329
 who arrive at the million or sometimes 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.280
 2000 2006 already huge but but neither sense 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.120
 except that it is already good for 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.230
 lego star wars products 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.340
 So here we go to the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.800
 presentation of the moc 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.160
 I will try I say well tempted of his 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.100
 ranks five minutes to be able to avoid 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.830
 that the video is too long 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.490
 so here and then there is the part with 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:12.510
 the sea with waves and chimneys 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.950
 the droids that make a landing there 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.939
 there are mines in the aude saint piat the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.780
 beach the beach with palm trees 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.890
 usually I only had one 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.780
 pamiers but this time I bought 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.470
 palm leaves which allows me 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.729
 to see these baskets simply 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.000
 on the beach are small barricades 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.439
 like that there that are removed by the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.450
 clones nato pilot droids 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.210
 forgiveness for being able to pass the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.439
 tanks droid on the tanks 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.450
 there was scrambled commando who 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.280
 cling to the north 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.210
 there is spring that has exploded 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.189
 end support all the droids who who 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.189
 come 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:02:02.700
 in a hurry to storm the base there is 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.880
 the clones that what is done without with 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.239
 cannons that said the tanks that has 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.459
 two other cases where here is the part 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.160
 here is the part of the moc I like the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.690
 less 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.790
 except that it is a bit too busy 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.530
 I think I should have removed trees 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.220
 or a little too much of it a little bit 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.070
 too much detail 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.080
 finally for my taste here if you do that you 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.270
 also bothers told me what 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.950
 bother you the most about silence or six 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.330
 if instead you have you like 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.870
 well 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.120
 do not hesitate to say it in comment 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.880
 there is the waterfall at 4-4 which is the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.620
 first thing I did during the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.970
 building the mox you started 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.960
 by the waterfall and then I made the base 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.130
 then I go forward and as he goes 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.890
 there were two explosions 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.640
 an explosion there it will not insure on the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.420
 ping ball four years ago and from 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.910
 assassin droids who tries to get 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.860
 sneak between the rocks to enter 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.190
 in the ball in total it's a small 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.290
 information website in total I put 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.360
 more or less 18 hours to do 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.680
 allow all the water so that's all 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.990
 the small the very small parts 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.170
 blue that I so eugenie and in addition to 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.720
 that I made a double layer for us 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.640
 give a better quality take 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.560
 the blue water here is here at all of 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.860
 the earth with the water coming out of the base 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.930
 to go fight here what is 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.130
 forbidden stalled to kill the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.970
 droids on the base there are people 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.830
 scale that are actually therefore 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.800
 scales and but this time the 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.300
 minimal as protections for 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.770
 projectiles for the idea that they 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.430
 projectiles they come to break the 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.890
 windows that are behind I find that 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.290
 it's a pretty good 10 years I think 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.980
 I will be able to restart his sweat on 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.690
 future bases 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.850
 and then for the roof there is 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.560
 ah yes 12 years that illuminates the field of 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.960
 battle there are also sources 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.510
 of energy that are being sold here who are who 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.170
 actually come from attack republics 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:23.340
 gunship the 2 droid 2 clone of the 501st 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.570
 who escorts to Lille to his classes in 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.720
 communicating explosion at clones 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.860
 who shoot at the overly rich two 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.490
 guards who watch the door with 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.130
 electromagnetic electronic sticks 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.730
 this is then a lamp inside the 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:47.080
 little of the small base above the 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:50.290
 so dairy basis here that serves to 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:56.290
 watch the coast through the bay window 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:59.160
 who has the power is a little bit a little bit 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.960
 curved families from with angles 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.730
 which is pretty good I think if I 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.160
 could do it again clone war 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.200
 who have parliament vigil at night and who 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.260
 are being woken up since they 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.000
 are attacked at the cures our helmet 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.210
 there is one who still wants 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.760
 the West 25 to this clown with 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:23.710
 binoculars that brought back now 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.940
 also an antenna there for the interior of 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:31.360
 the bar here I've done kinds of 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.400
 joists here to support the plate 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.120
 customers on there are a lot of details 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:41.860
 like pipes here and windows that 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:44.370
 continue with trials so here 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.540
 full of clown who offers to beat us 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.270
 the armory with good weapons 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.190
 obviously and the bags there backpack of 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.020
 the Republic 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.530
 the command center which are in arc of 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.240
 circle 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:00.010
 with the technique of lÃ©lio rex 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:03.610
 production here a few 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:09.340
 computers and the meeting room with 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:12.449
 the 212nd name who applauded and obi wan and 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.729
 I think it's all ojeda 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.590
 little information is the last word 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.979
 that I do before the exam 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:24.010
 the last big one mocks the sequel it will be 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:26.650
 probably men of the objects 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.960
 and the presentation of my collection of 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.270
 lego star wars and lego city characters 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.280
 so if I introduce lego city and more 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.500
 although I'm not sure yet if I 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.300
 do but insist these are 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.530
 all that I showed you allegory 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.680
 of production the characters that will be 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.020
 present at his exhibition 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.970
 so I'm here that's it's actually lego 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:50.080
 my brother's city if we have more or less 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.419
 150 I think and I have 400 420 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.610
 characters more or less so I you 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:58.990
 present I will introduce you all this 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:01.570
 later and so if I do not know if I 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.130
 do not make too many videos for 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.960
 before the exam just because 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.610
 I would like to pass my exams because 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.010
 if I succeed and I have beautiful 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.840
 points obviously I would have a 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:14.620
 reward probably lego star wars 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.930
 so here I hope I can succeed and 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.000
 I'm going to focus on that and make 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.770
 less effort because at this time 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.460
 there I ask that it's a bit what all 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.130
 the world will do 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:28.599
 I hope for others and then 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:31.590
 still a big thank you to my 120 and elect 

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:31.590
 the next hi
