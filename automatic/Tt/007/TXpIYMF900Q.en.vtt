as I spend time out here in particular
in<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.460> forest<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:19.620> forest<00:02:19.860> allows<00:02:20.459> us<00:02:20.819> to

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
in the forest the forest allows us to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.150 
in the forest the forest allows us to
look<00:02:21.300> at<00:02:21.569> nature<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.319> see<00:02:22.620> how<00:02:22.920> nature
