00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 So let's start as I promised will be a review on 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.070
 every horse and first video is dedicated 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.349
 there is this mare because of here the snowflake i 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.369
 already given and or she just 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.400
 touch her so nice so nice on 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.750
 very smooth and all that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.900
 what struck me most is 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.539
 mare she is very light right now i'm not 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.000
 used to have a deed of grave but first 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.829
 what time and picked up in the hands of just me 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.920
 struck by the fact that it is really very 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.510
 easy to compare yourself expired in these 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.930
 marabou 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.079
 well and he harder guys really full 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.230
 harder and it's certainly a big plus 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.809
 maybe for someone it's a minus there the authors 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:01:00.410
 photorealistic was curly but no business 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:00.410
 till there is playing like that so here we start 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:12.630
 minus and plus 1 minus which i and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:19.350
 noticed this is the worst most studied 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:22.290
 this is what this is this headphone 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.820
 here is a hat I donâ€™t call and here 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.390
 these boots they are drawn and this is what 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.490
 reap but because in my opinion in the previous 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.860
 recruitment you which was pro sketch and ace 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.070
 on the bench and I was full there 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:44.070
 fat nail 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:47.340
 this way then another draw this 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.290
 small because besides fix a 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.860
 that's what i just opened but it was here in 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.530
 This position because the type is not to 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.689
 come on the grill okay guys well who 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.260
 involved in equestrian sports and already knows 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.220
 curtain saddle should be at least 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.940
 here the general need to be to be here 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.950
 but you know, well, in short, that's good 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.900
 we will put on the mane 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.630
 a little betrayal of nothing is 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.290
 I also cantator cubes from trolls and 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.110
 big because all petrov of the country 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:31.790
 this is normal device put it like this 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:35.540
 focus on here is also a minus score of rain 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.770
 This is the latest in the well itself 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.870
 options wonderful card minus this then 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.720
 what I got is probably a van 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.540
 will come across to me just got caught that 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.210
 Here I have such a smeared hoof but 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.330
 it may not be less 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.540
 proof of 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.300
 probably will not stay on the road but it 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.670
 prove that these nobles really they were 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.880
 manually because the machine is not done 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:07.280
 more then here giving back to the hospital now 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:13.930
 or obama nits and you will hear next 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.930
