00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
so that the card I want to force is on

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.109 
so that the card I want to force is on
the<00:00:13.650> top<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:15.480> two<00:00:15.630> cards<00:00:15.929> next<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.470> are

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119

trick<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.850> I'm<00:00:20.939> forcing<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:23.119> you'll<00:00:24.119> see

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
trick that I'm forcing so you'll see

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.300 
trick that I'm forcing so you'll see
that<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.630> two<00:00:24.750> cards<00:00:25.050> when<00:00:25.949> added<00:00:26.189> together

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
that the two cards when added together

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.109 
that the two cards when added together
are<00:00:26.789> add<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.779> 7<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.380> then<00:00:28.500> when<00:00:28.830> doubled<00:00:29.250> to

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
are add to 7 and then when doubled to

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.749 
are add to 7 and then when doubled to
get<00:00:30.420> us<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.660> number<00:00:30.869> between<00:00:31.019> 4<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.619> 52<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.460> we

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
get us a number between 4 and 52 so we

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.940 
get us a number between 4 and 52 so we
double<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:35.059> 14<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.170> 14th<00:00:37.590> card

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
double it so we get 14 so the 14th card

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.060 
double it so we get 14 so the 14th card
in<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.489> deck<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.719> 7<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.110> clubs<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.770> card

push<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.350> decks<00:00:55.559> together<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> actually

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
push the decks together but I actually

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
back on top of the rest of the pile so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.330 
back on top of the rest of the pile so
nothing's<00:01:00.570> actually<00:01:00.719> disturbed<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:02.190> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
nothing's actually disturbed so of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.299

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
course when you do that you kind of hide

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
course when you do that you kind of hide
it<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.489> your<00:01:05.640> hands<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.689> gives<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it with your hands and it just gives the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.410 
it with your hands and it just gives the
impression<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.470> you're<00:01:07.680> closing<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.159> deck

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the beginning to be a regular deck of

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.819 
the beginning to be a regular deck of
cards<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.140> course<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.710> this

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
cards and course I do that with this

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.420 
cards and course I do that with this
pile<00:01:32.009> too<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.860> then<00:01:35.990> if<00:01:36.990> there's<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.310> know

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
pile too and then if there's you know

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
pile too and then if there's you know
you<00:01:38.490> could<00:01:38.700> find<00:01:38.909> whatever<00:01:39.119> way<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:40.110> sure

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you could find whatever way you I'm sure

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.929 
you could find whatever way you I'm sure
you<00:01:40.380> could<00:01:40.530> come<00:01:40.650> up<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.920> good<00:01:41.369> method<00:01:41.759> of

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
you could come up with a good method of

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.149 
you could come up with a good method of
casually<00:01:42.810> moving<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> top<00:01:43.710> card<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.070> the

is<00:01:54.420> now<00:01:54.570> ready<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.969> all<00:01:56.969> we<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.299> now<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.689> get

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
is now ready and all we do now is we get

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020 
is now ready and all we do now is we get
a<00:01:57.840> spectator<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> grab<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.829> deck<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.369> they

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
a spectator to grab this deck and they

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.670 
a spectator to grab this deck and they
can<00:02:00.210> deal<00:02:00.420> off<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.810> many<00:02:00.930> cards<00:02:01.229> as<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:01.469> like

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
can deal off as many cards as they like

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.990 
can deal off as many cards as they like
and<00:02:02.390> you'll<00:02:03.390> notice<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> two<00:02:04.110> cards<00:02:05.000> for

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
and you'll notice that the two cards for

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.359 
and you'll notice that the two cards for
the<00:02:06.119> additional<00:02:06.630> part<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.140> trick<00:02:07.409> for<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the additional part of the trick for the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.859 
the additional part of the trick for the
addition<00:02:08.700> part<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.030> trick<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> two<00:02:09.539> cards

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
addition part of the trick the two cards

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.410 
addition part of the trick the two cards
that<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:10.800> want<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.009> force<00:02:11.280> actually<00:02:11.580> are<00:02:12.120> on

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
that we want to force actually are on

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.670 
that we want to force actually are on
the<00:02:12.540> very<00:02:12.720> bottom

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the very bottom

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.649 
the very bottom
that<00:02:13.829> the<00:02:13.920> first<00:02:14.129> cards<00:02:14.400> dealt<00:02:14.609> off<00:02:14.849> so<00:02:15.629> that

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
that the first cards dealt off so that

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.789 
that the first cards dealt off so that
when<00:02:15.930> they<00:02:16.019> go<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> deal<00:02:16.469> the<00:02:17.370> two<00:02:17.579> piles

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
when they go to deal the two piles

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.179 
when they go to deal the two piles
you'll<00:02:19.799> then<00:02:20.010> notice<00:02:20.219> that<00:02:21.469> the<00:02:22.469> 2<00:02:22.829> bottom

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
you'll then notice that the 2 bottom

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.330 
you'll then notice that the 2 bottom
cards<00:02:23.549> end<00:02:23.849> up<00:02:24.629> on<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.439> top<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.340> piles<00:02:26.900> now

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
cards end up on the top of the piles now

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.520 
cards end up on the top of the piles now
see<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.489> seems<00:02:29.730> like<00:02:29.909> they've<00:02:30.090> randomly<00:02:30.659> ended

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
see it seems like they've randomly ended

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.649 
see it seems like they've randomly ended
up<00:02:31.620> with<00:02:31.769> these<00:02:31.859> two<00:02:32.069> cards<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:33.299> really<00:02:33.569> of

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
up with these two cards but really of

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.209 
up with these two cards but really of
course<00:02:33.810> they<00:02:34.019> were<00:02:34.079> just<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.500> top<00:02:34.829> two<00:02:35.010> cards

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:35.219 
course they were just the top two cards

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.929 
course they were just the top two cards
and<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.579> from<00:02:36.389> the<00:02:36.480> original<00:02:36.840> deck<00:02:37.019> so<00:02:37.819> we<00:02:38.819> add

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
and the from the original deck so we add

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.550 
and the from the original deck so we add
the<00:02:39.060> two<00:02:39.180> cards<00:02:39.420> together<00:02:39.689> we<00:02:39.870> get<00:02:39.959> seven<00:02:40.379> we

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the two cards together we get seven we

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.199 
the two cards together we get seven we
double<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.069> we<00:02:41.219> get<00:02:41.370> 14<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:44.120> before<00:02:45.120> we

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
double that we get 14 so before we

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.360 
double that we get 14 so before we
actually<00:02:45.450> before<00:02:45.810> we<00:02:46.019> explain<00:02:46.470> all<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.680> we

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
actually before we explain all that we

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.610 
actually before we explain all that we
get<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.609> spectator<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.150> cut<00:02:48.269> this<00:02:48.599> deck<00:02:48.870> they

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
get the spectator to cut this deck they

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.440 
get the spectator to cut this deck they
can<00:02:49.769> cut<00:02:49.919> it<00:02:50.040> anywhere<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.180> lift<00:02:51.359> the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
can cut it anywhere and then we lift the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.659 
can cut it anywhere and then we lift the
bottom<00:02:51.569> portion<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.169> we<00:02:52.319> just<00:02:52.560> cross<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.370> over

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
bottom portion and we just cross it over

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.839 
bottom portion and we just cross it over
to<00:02:53.819> mark<00:02:54.120> our<00:02:54.269> cut<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.799> that's<00:02:55.799> our<00:02:56.129> setup<00:02:56.519> for

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
to mark our cut and that's our setup for

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.300 
to mark our cut and that's our setup for
the<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.359> believe<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.469> called<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.709> forced<00:02:59.040> cut

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
the I believe it's called the forced cut

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.220 
the I believe it's called the forced cut
there<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.299> cut<00:03:00.450> force<00:03:00.719> or<00:03:00.959> whatever<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:03.230> then

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
there the cut force or whatever so then

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.959 
there the cut force or whatever so then
we<00:03:04.379> go<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.620> explain<00:03:05.010> okay<00:03:05.159> we<00:03:05.400> get<00:03:05.549> seven

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
we go on to explain okay we get seven

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.500 
we go on to explain okay we get seven
and<00:03:06.419> if<00:03:06.659> we<00:03:06.719> double<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:07.139> we<00:03:07.230> get<00:03:07.409> 14<00:03:07.919> so<00:03:08.310> 14<00:03:08.609> is

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
and if we double that we get 14 so 14 is

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.709 
and if we double that we get 14 so 14 is
our<00:03:09.750> random<00:03:10.109> number<00:03:10.400> between<00:03:11.400> 4<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:11.939> 52<00:03:12.359> and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:12.719 
our random number between 4 and 52 and

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.349 
our random number between 4 and 52 and
then<00:03:13.590> we<00:03:13.769> look<00:03:14.010> at<00:03:14.280> what<00:03:14.909> card<00:03:15.180> they've

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
then we look at what card they've

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.050 
then we look at what card they've
randomly<00:03:15.840> cut<00:03:16.019> at<00:03:16.200> our<00:03:17.189> 7<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.579> clubs<00:03:17.729> which

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
randomly cut at our 7 of clubs which

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.530 
randomly cut at our 7 of clubs which
needless<00:03:18.659> to<00:03:18.750> say<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.049> forced<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:20.359> we<00:03:21.359> move

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
needless to say is forced and we move

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.240 
needless to say is forced and we move
over<00:03:21.810> then<00:03:21.989> now<00:03:22.229> to<00:03:22.290> this<00:03:22.620> deck<00:03:22.919> and<00:03:23.220> we<00:03:23.790> count

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
over then now to this deck and we count

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.159 
over then now to this deck and we count
14<00:03:26.250> cards<00:03:26.579> down<00:03:26.729> which<00:03:27.060> we<00:03:27.299> should<00:03:27.479> rive<00:03:27.690> at<00:03:27.870> 7

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
14 cards down which we should rive at 7

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:33.770 
14 cards down which we should rive at 7
of<00:03:28.229> clubs<00:03:28.319> 1<00:03:28.680> 2<00:03:28.979> 3<00:03:29.310> 4<00:03:29.790> 5<00:03:30.180> 6<00:03:30.599> 7<00:03:31.019> 8<00:03:31.439> 9<00:03:31.949> 10<00:03:32.340> 11<00:03:32.609> 12<00:03:33.090> 13

14<00:03:34.349> card<00:03:35.129> is<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.849> seven<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.239> clubs<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:36.750> then

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
14 card is the seven of clubs and then

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.809
