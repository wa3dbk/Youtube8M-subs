00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.370
 have already taken that have some 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.099
 probably even at facebook 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.949
 just read, I wanted long 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.930
 Hecktriebler already knows everything 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:21.449
 and today I need that again for 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.420
 you because I find it super delicious and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.410
 I just should rather that 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.710
 so I will again today 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.420
 make for you and yes because of that go 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.480
 We now in the kitchen and become 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.180
 Together we cook with pretty people 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.149
 I usually need this out now 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.670
 then we can to the coconut milk 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.670
 Need to be almonds here 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.200
 then we have the sugar pods 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:55.140
 here onion carrots then chili 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:59.879
 Of course, curry for seasoning and me 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.949
 have only piece of turkey breast so should 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.740
 it all looks so good 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.799
 the pods remain the nuts 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.080
 are usually hacked outside it's partie 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.140
 box cut both byrne and also 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.159
 the onion is clear what could do 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.420
 Of course you can still 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.360
 I really like zucchini 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.460
 but I had no zucchini 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.650
 women's team can the turkey you can 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.840
 shrimp but also has the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.409
 not because that's why it is now 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.579
 and then let's start that 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.049
 next step will do a bit 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:40.290
 butter in the trap and let that hot 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.299
 and now I'm going too 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.490
 hope that everything you have is ready 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.329
 It really easier if he already has 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.329
 have to stand next to it first 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.020
 second, the dead get big 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.560
 that means we are really beautiful 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.690
 then I did not read that 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.399
 a little coconut milk off I do 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.720
 always like to look in between 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.950
 I like to put everything in at the same time 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.230
 After all this is super good 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.510
 to have fried all the effort 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.319
 and all the stuff comes in that will 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.290
 replaced again 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.500
 with coconut milk then skin ingres 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.010
 just the nuts carrots paprika rest 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.830
 from the canary coconut milk to and 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.319
 then still beautiful season with curry 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.420
 you can leipheimer and pepper all 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.970
 you like your spices you can 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.970
 what a sharp purge rages you out 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.810
 I have something so round here 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:57.110
 can you portion the rice if you 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:59.410
 the house wants so you do this here 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.370
 so full 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:07.310
 then you work around here once 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.670
 make the lid there then push that 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.670
 down 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:25.209
 that was also our body out 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.820
 delicious do not play with food the same 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.500
 eat up 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.900
 I have liked me but it's is 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.480
 Great super delicious tasted great 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.180
 it is certainly the ingredients are one 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.820
 a bit much but also very healthy 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.140
 that's why and I hope 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.570
 I like it now I hope the food 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.320
 or reasonably good for you out of it 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.810

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.709
