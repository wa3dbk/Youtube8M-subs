but never had the third beer with us so

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.429 
but never had the third beer with us so
we<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.420> they'd<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.840> close<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
we have that they'd be close to the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.929 
we have that they'd be close to the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
pliers would be far enough away that he

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.260 
pliers would be far enough away that he
could<00:01:21.119> drop<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> pliers<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.840> he<00:01:21.900> needed<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:26.270> as

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
could drop the pliers if he needed to as

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.810 
could drop the pliers if he needed to as
I<00:01:27.360> said<00:01:27.540> he<00:01:27.659> makes<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.900> very<00:01:28.020> good<00:01:28.140> point<00:01:28.409> about

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
I said he makes a very good point about

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.440 
I said he makes a very good point about
changes<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> team

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
changes to the team

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.730 
changes to the team
I<00:01:30.479> think<00:01:30.720> we're<00:01:30.840> picking<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.200> best<00:01:31.439> players

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
I think we're picking the best players

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.830 
I think we're picking the best players
to<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.700> honest<00:01:32.970> everyone<00:01:33.930> continues<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.470> say

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840
