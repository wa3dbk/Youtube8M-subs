00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.040
 with the new Japanese government another side on the body promises promises 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.060
 revolutionizing the market is just one of many innovations that have an industry that 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.450
 is constantly renewed everything adds that the activity because it shows us this 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.450
 the fall of arm with saw is reported 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.900
 What do you think this family is doing? 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.430
 It sounds like that mime joke but it's so much more than it's pure 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.099
 technology 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.540
 this is the stretch benefited by a computer company 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.140
 the novelty we gave the institute that traditional control that makes the 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 machine-player interaction 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.010
 so I have to abide by recognizing state movements 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 through sensors 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 you can feel your soccer field 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.950
 on tracks of Formula 1 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 coates and a parade 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.540
 my multimedia fashion shows that chile 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.450
 - in the future then in a new era 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.370
 ceased to be a thing 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.720
 is turned to belini the teenager said that facing the club should be 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.340
 a school is a much more sociable thing ever more comprehensive 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.530
 the new concept in which he was the collaboration of the Brazilian 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.810
 so the videogame and was christened the natal city project where he was born 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.850
 said that I think people thought it would launch now 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.530
 by Christmas laughed and asked her commented 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.520
 temperature in the rs 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.970
 according to the company's marketing manager, which is a forecast of 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.160
 initial dvd release 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.600
 but this is not the only novelty in the market was recently launched in the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.350
 game that most seems to have a cinematographic production entitled 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.239
 the suspensory soundtrack 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.239
 very well designed counted the delegate 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.659
 I do not argue 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.609
 ten years after a conversation with a story 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:23.899
 the destroyed planet earth is under threat of an established occupation 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.659
 is a unit created to expedite to save your world 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.519
 We'll have to have a lot of determination. 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.459
 everything is dubbed beyond Portuguese has also been reduced to 1 306 languages 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.719
 I am a garnish on the player 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.999
 enjoy more I'll play to find out what's going to happen in stores 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.769
 he participates in orange interact and have fun with it 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.719
 I imagine a police officer killed a sawmill 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.199
 In this game you are the one who chooses the car model on the next path 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.219
 so you do not have to be an expert firsthand 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.399
 are more than 400 some real achievements 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.619
 street transport police told clues 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:12.449
 that was really it 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:15.449
 and has the possibility to offer a pilot 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.339
 the bike once having a ringworm can 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:23.459
 open bar fight and another side you can squeeze all the north of the river 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.809
 at the time the inter may have regulation 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.759
 and today many mechanics 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.739
 the season ended up playing the role 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.999
 all this technology applied in electronic games is the basis of everything 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:40.120
 for these students at this computer graphics school in sÃ£o paulo they 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:45.099
 learn to develop new customers are at least two years of 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.169
 imagination is what moved the students would be possible because 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:53.169
 example a surprise marked the third 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:57.049
 with the new cut 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.759
 we use 500 newest deaths in 3d 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.459
 kennedy with 7 line items 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:04.569
 since assuming 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.760
 have a girl 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.259
 The fighter tracks everything equal to the student can happen 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:17.039
 a set of contact with the technology dictated von teese linear readjustment to work 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.779
 real things of the market its national brands a national cause summoned 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.659
 International 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:28.999
 for the creation of a full day teachers meet to discuss the 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.460
 ideas 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.820
 then everything is put on paper 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.820
 the goal was to create a jungle scenery 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.720
 if bc will not make any sense 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.810
 fundamental step to define the details of the south 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.550
 in the computer everything is changing 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.779
 until this 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.039
 he was one of the students who developed it and next he said that the 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.630
 more interesting is that technology allows you to test new ideas 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.520
 and if they did not work out 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.219
 in action reflects 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.459
 but sometimes much information disturbs 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:21.409
 until the recent appearance is not arrested the program offers 20 years the 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.629
 nuclear program said tanks between this family business 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.759
 the goal was again in tweet but one thing is right for him 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.470
 this selection is 19 years old and when it is so 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.289
 is very well in the middle of the links 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.529
 he has worked on two international projects 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.529
 according to him the market is promising 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:43.650
 I had opportunities in Brazil in November. 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.110
 the dart game 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.910
 it is not 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.620
 will be focused on the finals of the national league 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.620
 the company's own project that also ended up going out 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.350
 and these urban made in respect and keita if it was launched now at the end of 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.539
 year just helping the staff 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.400
 he is also going through 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.400
 motivated by this motivation to create an own style 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:09.829
 and I know you play to get some cold water. 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.460
 we are watching in Brazil the house where the farmer 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:15.779
 sep 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:19.700
 this market is going to work, we have already done it today in Brazil 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.840
 which are references in the world producing some games so now I 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.789
 I believe so 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:29.439
 It's a great moment in Brazil. I see a fierce dispute but diversity. 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:35.770
 it's serious to research the apaf a music technology an action of 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.770
 technology that it may be favoring 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.070
 oma differentiated creativity that is what everyone believes is the great 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.610
 fact that the Brazilian has
