00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.040
 today we will talk about one more 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.590
 launch of the Galapagos here in Brazil 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.870
 which is the magic I got as a gift 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.730
 birthday late this week 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.400
 Let's see who's inside this box. 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 romantic for those who do not know is a game 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.199
 of the tic jackson games of the same creator 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.670
 of the salt units of other 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.609
 cool games there 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.330
 is a competitive game where players 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.210
 interpreters are adventurers entering 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.870
 dungeons and cascading treasures and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.850
 monsters and this game 's cause is that 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.979
 You can help your friends or not. 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.040
 preferably legal in this game you do not 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:49.260
 help them cherish you and train 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.000
 alliances and destroy everything and end 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.449
 friendship inside this box 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.239
 here inside this box has two 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.879
 A six- sided die with a 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.810
 a phase is different here customized 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.780
 cute and a new one the manual is very 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.720
 of course explained very well the rules as 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.670
 well defines Dinho's does not have much to do 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.060
 complicate a fairly simple game 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.270
 does not have very advanced rules and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.430
 playing well a good free fun and is 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.040
 only this that comes in the box I honestly 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.170
 I found this box a waste 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.100
 only for these two things times when 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.320
 next noise 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.480
 I thought this house might be smaller 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.310
 or it could be better harnessed not 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.500
 has no new case of flying 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.659
 here inside, these classics have come 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.210
 along with with the game then at least 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.040
 you can divide the two types of 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.380
 cards that have the game in two places in 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.370
 separated otherwise everything goes flying in. 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.350
 from the box 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.960
 my observations regarding this 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.090
 edition here gives galapagos is all 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.490
 translated a note accusing the letters 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.490
 are produced this game he is very 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.620
 strongly dependent on text the letters 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.479
 have enough text and besides having 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.010
 enough text because that letter does 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.810
 a different thing 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.670
 the cards have a humor that has a joke 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.830
 so this is an extremely 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.900
 difficult to represent a galley that 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.970
 did not know 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.489
 dominated English precisely because of 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.890
 And I have to take my hat off 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.989
 Galapagos Galapagos I do not know who it was that 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.970
 did the translation if it was she proved if it was 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.470
 another company but the translation of this game 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.879
 It's very good, the jokes are 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.859
 located the jokes make sense in 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.329
 Portuguese is not a mere translation of the 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.959
 English to Portuguese 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.689
 then the whole context of humor that 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.970
 have an original tac game is preserved 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.730
 then this is the definitive version for the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.920
 people from Brazil that do not handle 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.750
 English that does not have full English 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.930
 what will you play with people who do not have 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.760
 English language is the best option is 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.980
 much better than presenting this game 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.079
 English as I have seen happen of the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.090
 Personal Grandson This game out such 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.950
 pleasure to play and and people unfortunately 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.019
 they can not take advantage of the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.510
 cool of this game that are the jokes that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.400
 it's the mood that's all funny weather 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.599
 I hope you can get the game. 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.239
 understand what I mean by 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.489
 relation to the love of this localized game 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.859
 I can read exactly here. 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.510
 joke to launch a newcomer and has a 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.090
 plate indicating acre 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.310
 I thought it was sensational I did not expect 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.870
 by this type of localization produced and 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.250
 I found it fantastic that I have to say 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.349
 in relation to this game he is 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.239
 very well located very well translated 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.340
 the quality of the cards is very similar 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.810
 with the original letters including myself 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.370
 I think I can play with the expansions 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.959
 Foreigners because if I understood 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.870
 right the dimensions of the cards are 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.090
 Equal to the original Galatian letters 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.040
 has already released several expansions so it's 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.599
 this game he grows a lot has 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.940
 enough letter to put enough 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.549
 thing to interact with the space that 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.560
 This game occupies is very small but he 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.780
 depends on the amount of 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.430
 players because you will have at the table 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.319
 will be the two decks and the cards that 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.150
 people go down they go putting 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.959
 so I can imagine more or less 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.669
 a space equal to the attack on the image 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.400
 for you to a player here in my 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:12.610
 hands and there depending on how much the player 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.200
 is increasing more 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.640
 but here around then it 's a space 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.620
 very big a game fairly 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.299
 small he is well a barbecue kawele 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.430
 How do I say and can not I take one? 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.170
 barbecue and play with friends as 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.120
 against this game I think this 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.710
 box that is a waste but if you 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.600
 Are you thinking of buying yours? 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.280
 expansions buy more stuff until 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.940
 it's worth it because a lot of things are falling 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.580
 here inside 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.130
 The problem is to be completely loose. 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.690
 without large dividers and without 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.940
 big organizations in here then 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.160
 I think this is a standard box that 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.540
 Europe has not been doing for some games 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.030
 that is why they should have used this 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.800
 version here this game here I will win from 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.010
 late birthday when I said no 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.140
 beginning of the video and I wanted to make a 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.310
 mini shop advertising that sold 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.130
 This game for the person who 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.780
 presented the bookstore a chelsea and 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.870
 they make a deal I never had 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.410
 since it's already shipping with toast uses 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.870
 free 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.150
 then came the right size books 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.580
 right in the right amount for the game I 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.310
 I thought it was great. I would love that. 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.560
 would become standard for stores to sell 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.510
 games already with the books or buying a 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.250
 a little more expensive but sending 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.100
 free doing some kind of pleasure 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.550
 so congratulations to the stained headline 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.250
 This game leaves for 76 reais in the GalÃ¡pagos 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.680
 This game comes out for 74 reais and if you 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:33.250
 decides to buy the original version from outside 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.540
 in the queue curve costs $ 16 and in 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.540
 my calls too
