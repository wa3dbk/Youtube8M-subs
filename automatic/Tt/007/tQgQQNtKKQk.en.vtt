suck your card is ace of clubs flip it
back<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.730> then<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:45.120> pull<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.510> top<00:02:45.900> card

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
back and then you pull the top card

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.949 
back and then you pull the top card
which<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.470> really<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.160> sub<00:02:47.670> diamonds<00:02:48.239> they

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
which is really a sub diamonds they

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.270 
which is really a sub diamonds they
don't<00:02:49.140> know<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.799> think<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.100> an<00:02:50.190> ace

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
don't know that so I think it's an ace

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.699 
don't know that so I think it's an ace
of<00:02:50.430> clubs<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.390> switch<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.440> their

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
of clubs and you switch it with their

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.130 
of clubs and you switch it with their
ace<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.310> spades<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.630> then<00:02:54.750> you're<00:02:54.930> going<00:02:55.049> to

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
ace of spades so then you're going to

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.570 
ace of spades so then you're going to
say<00:02:55.230> okay<00:02:55.470> I'll<00:02:55.560> hold<00:02:55.739> your<00:02:55.860> ace<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.340> hand

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
say okay I'll hold your ace in this hand

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.580 
say okay I'll hold your ace in this hand
then<00:02:57.299> while<00:02:57.510> you're<00:02:57.630> talking<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.230> them<00:02:58.320> saying

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
then while you're talking to them saying

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.170 
then while you're talking to them saying
what<00:02:58.830> do<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:58.980> think<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.280> card<00:02:59.549> is<00:02:59.730> make<00:03:00.000> eye

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
they'll look at the card and then

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
they'll look at the card and then
casually<00:03:04.170> just<00:03:04.200> swap<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.920> with<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:06.320> ace<00:03:07.320> of

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530
