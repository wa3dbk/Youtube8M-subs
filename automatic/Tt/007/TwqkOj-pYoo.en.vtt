I've designed especially for game
creation<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.450> first<00:00:12.690> thing<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:12.990> will<00:00:13.080> do<00:00:13.290> is

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
creation the first thing we will do is

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.860 
creation the first thing we will do is
open<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.889> game<00:00:14.070> environment<00:00:14.639> scene<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.690> scene

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
open a game environment scene the scene

open a game environment scene the scene
itself<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> smart<00:00:16.830> object<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.430> already

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
itself is a smart object it already

itself is a smart object it already
contains<00:00:18.090> scripting<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.990> will<00:00:19.109> help<00:00:19.289> us

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
contains scripting that will help us

build our little game creating 3d assets
can<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.699> time-consuming<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.050> found<00:00:25.350> a

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
can be time-consuming so I found a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.960 
can be time-consuming so I found a
suitable<00:00:25.740> character<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.490> our<00:00:26.580> game<00:00:26.789> on

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
suitable character for our game on

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.240 
suitable character for our game on
Google<00:00:27.300> warehouse<00:00:27.740> we'll<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:28.920> drop<00:00:29.099> him

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
Google warehouse we'll just drop him

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.060 
Google warehouse we'll just drop him
into<00:00:29.460> creator<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.240> what<00:00:30.359> we've<00:00:30.510> got

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.460 

you

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.200 

we<00:00:44.470> don't<00:00:44.590> need<00:00:44.800> cameras<00:00:45.220> or<00:00:45.370> model<00:00:45.640> views<00:00:45.880> so

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
we don't need cameras or model views so

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.960 
we don't need cameras or model views so
i'll<00:00:46.300> delete<00:00:46.600> those<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:48.460> i<00:00:48.490> want<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:48.880> put

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
i'll delete those then i want to put

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.580 
i'll delete those then i want to put
them<00:00:49.060> into<00:00:49.240> a<00:00:49.390> group<00:00:49.720> so<00:00:50.140> they'll<00:00:50.290> be<00:00:50.410> ready

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
them into a group so they'll be ready

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.650 
them into a group so they'll be ready
for<00:00:50.830> our<00:00:50.890> keyboard<00:00:51.310> control

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.080 

that<00:00:57.560> also<00:00:57.739> makes<00:00:58.040> it<00:00:58.220> easy<00:00:58.430> for<00:00:58.550> us<00:00:58.820> to<00:00:58.850> move

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
that also makes it easy for us to move

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.760 
that also makes it easy for us to move
him<00:00:59.270> up<00:00:59.420> out<00:00:59.630> of<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.840> ground<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:03.320> texture<00:01:03.739> is

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
him up out of the ground the texture is

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.350 
him up out of the ground the texture is
pretty<00:01:04.040> dark<00:01:04.370> but<00:01:04.699> I<00:01:04.729> don't<00:01:04.970> want<00:01:05.120> to<00:01:05.180> add<00:01:05.330> any

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
pretty dark but I don't want to add any

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.480 
pretty dark but I don't want to add any
lights<00:01:05.870> to<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.200> scene<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:06.890> I'll<00:01:07.010> adjust<00:01:07.130> the

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
lights to the scene so I'll adjust the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.340 
lights to the scene so I'll adjust the
material<00:01:07.970> instead<00:01:08.330> by<00:01:08.600> increasing<00:01:09.170> its

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
material instead by increasing its

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.969 
material instead by increasing its
emissive<00:01:09.800> setting<00:01:11.590> now<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:12.740> we<00:01:12.830> can<00:01:12.920> see

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
emissive setting now that we can see

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.040 
emissive setting now that we can see
them<00:01:13.310> better<00:01:13.430> it's<00:01:13.970> obvious<00:01:14.479> he's<00:01:14.630> missing

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
them better it's obvious he's missing

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.109 
them better it's obvious he's missing
some<00:01:15.229> mapping<00:01:15.470> we<00:01:16.160> won't<00:01:16.340> be<00:01:16.430> very<00:01:16.670> close<00:01:16.940> to

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
some mapping we won't be very close to

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.790 
some mapping we won't be very close to
him<00:01:17.210> in<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.420> game<00:01:17.630> but<00:01:18.140> I'll<00:01:18.290> just<00:01:18.320> go<00:01:18.680> ahead

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
him in the game but I'll just go ahead

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.500 
him in the game but I'll just go ahead
and<00:01:18.979> put<00:01:19.280> some<00:01:19.400> mapping<00:01:19.670> coordinates<00:01:20.030> on<00:01:20.420> the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
and put some mapping coordinates on the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.270 
and put some mapping coordinates on the
other<00:01:20.660> side<00:01:20.960> of<00:01:20.990> him<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.410> push<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.100> map

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
other side of him and push the map

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.250 
other side of him and push the map
around<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.790> little

just in case the model you found needs a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.370 
just in case the model you found needs a
bit<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.150> tweaking

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.279 

that's<00:02:00.020> better<00:02:01.299> okay<00:02:02.299> let's<00:02:02.929> see<00:02:03.109> how<00:02:03.229> he

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
that's better okay let's see how he

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.980 
that's better okay let's see how he
measures<00:02:03.679> up<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.640> game<00:02:04.850> content<00:02:05.359> is<00:02:05.509> designed

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
measures up the game content is designed

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.770 
measures up the game content is designed
for<00:02:06.109> a<00:02:06.289> character<00:02:06.740> 75<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.549> 100<00:02:07.939> units<00:02:08.269> tall<00:02:08.509> if

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
for a character 75 to 100 units tall if

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.990 
for a character 75 to 100 units tall if
I<00:02:09.410> create<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.769> cylinder<00:02:10.280> object<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.789> just

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
I create a cylinder object that just

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.640 
I create a cylinder object that just
covers<00:02:11.180> him<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.660> can<00:02:12.200> see<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.500> he's<00:02:12.560> just

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
covers him I can see that he's just

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.270 
covers him I can see that he's just
about<00:02:13.099> 95<00:02:13.670> units<00:02:14.090> high<00:02:14.349> perfect<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.560> no<00:02:16.099> longer

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
about 95 units high perfect I no longer

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.690 
about 95 units high perfect I no longer
need<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.910> cylinder<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.690> I'll<00:02:17.810> just<00:02:17.870> delete<00:02:18.170> it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
need the cylinder so I'll just delete it

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.820 
need the cylinder so I'll just delete it
now<00:02:19.700> we're<00:02:19.910> ready<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:20.180> some<00:02:20.480> fun<00:02:20.690> check<00:02:21.680> out
