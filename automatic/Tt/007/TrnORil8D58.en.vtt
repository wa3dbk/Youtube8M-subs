00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello dear viewers with you 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.960
 Efimov Dmitri and today in our 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.969
 video tutorial I'll tell you about one 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.210
 very interesting program which 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.130
 called benchmark stalker call pripyat 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.430
 This program is intended for 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.970
 testing and assessing the quality of your 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.600
 gland 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.550
 both power and performance 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.280
 what this program did not like 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.100
 that it is very easy to use and 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.369
 requires no extra 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.170
 technical skills and knowledge 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.840
 the only thing left for you is 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.870
 download 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.810
 this site program from any 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.540
 online so she is very popular and 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.740
 common set to yourself on 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.560
 computer 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.870
 When installing this program, it does not 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.730
 has no limitations and no 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.800
 conflicted with any others 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.950
 programs and applications that 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.230
 installed on your computer and so 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.230
 after you have downloaded and installed 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.860
 this program we need them 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.000
 install and run so here we are 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.950
 launched this program with you 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.830
 only thing to do here 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:20.500
 install settings 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.500
 I recommend setting the maximum immediately 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.380
 Here, for example , Chen has full coverage 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.610
 direct x 10 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.610
 goes to 11 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.310
 and press the start button 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.290
 went analysis 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.290
 system configuration 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.760
 test 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.300
 enters mode 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.300
 analysis 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.630
 so our dough program started 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.180
 here we have it in action testing 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 somewhere around 10 minutes 4 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.330
 locations in Pripyat 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.280
 this night is heavy rain morning and afternoon 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.680
 testing occurs by scoring 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.250
 system and at the end of the test we are with you 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.960
 let's see what we got in 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.150
 the result of testing and collecting 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.150
 information in this program 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.750
 so our testing is over 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.750
 according to the results of our testing 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.739
 money 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.849
 but different weather conditions like 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.849
 day-night heavy rain 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.090
 my computer got the total 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.790
 results somewhere around 100 150 points 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.380
 at the moment if the result of this 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.400
 testing information gathering your 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.010
 computer or laptop 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.500
 will show among the number somewhere around 100 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.240
 points then consider that the test you passed 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:03.590
 well and also as a result of testing 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.960
 I recommend when watching video data 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.130
 you pay attention if the video 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.280
 starts to hang 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.280
 and 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.790
 slow down I recommend you reset 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.790
 to minimum or medium settings 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.530
 and also if you want to compare and 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:28.650
 put your test results in 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.650
 the internet is a button here 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.170
 and click on this button after it 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.440
 pressing 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.680
 your test with your analyzes so to speak 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.290
 your settings and system data 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.650
 sent to the official table 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.650
 official rating table 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.650
 given 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.330
 fan site 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.540
 where other users can 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.370
 see and evaluate 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.700
 your iron 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.590
 like this 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.739
 can you test your computer or 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.739
 a laptop 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.120
 the technique is very simple to cope with it 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.730
 even a schoolboy 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.150
 on this I had everything with you was efimov 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.400
 Dmitriy 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.400
 until the next meeting, thank you all
