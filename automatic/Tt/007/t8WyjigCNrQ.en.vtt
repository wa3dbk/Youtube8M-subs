00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.460 
finger stretched back onto the fifth
fret<00:01:04.189> ring<00:01:05.189> finger<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> 7th<00:01:06.420> fret<00:01:06.479> then

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470

pinky on the 7th fret it sounds like

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.850 
pinky on the 7th fret it sounds like
this<00:01:13.610> ok<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.420> stretch<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.259> awkward

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
this ok now if this stretch is awkward

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.130 
this ok now if this stretch is awkward
which<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.610> assume<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> will<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.540> especially<00:01:19.080> if

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
which I assume it will be especially if

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.380 
which I assume it will be especially if
you<00:01:19.200> haven't<00:01:19.320> been<00:01:19.500> playing<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.890> long<00:01:20.070> I

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
you haven't been playing that long I

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.730 
you haven't been playing that long I
really<00:01:21.390> use<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.659> chord<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> lot<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.439> more

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
really use this chord a lot in like more

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.310 
really use this chord a lot in like more
jazzy<00:01:23.009> stuff<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.119> could<00:01:24.270> just<00:01:24.299> play<00:01:25.080> that

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
jazzy stuff but you could just play that

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.870 
jazzy stuff but you could just play that
because<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.189> D<00:01:26.430> string<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.240> there

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.340 

doesn't<00:01:31.880> sound<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.210> bad<00:01:32.420> with<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:32.810> cord<00:01:33.079> or

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
doesn't sound so bad with the cord or

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.499 
doesn't sound so bad with the cord or
you<00:01:33.740> can<00:01:33.860> let<00:01:34.040> your<00:01:34.700> middle<00:01:34.909> finger<00:01:35.240> kind<00:01:35.450> of

you can let your middle finger kind of

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.469 
you can let your middle finger kind of
mute<00:01:35.689> it<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:39.500> it's<00:01:40.430> going<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.579> work<00:01:40.820> really

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
mute it and it's going to work really
