TBA explains the facial capture
technology<00:02:56.570> is<00:02:56.810> much<00:02:57.290> more<00:02:57.500> refined<00:02:57.920> it's<00:02:58.310> a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
technology is much more refined it's a

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.840 
technology is much more refined it's a
micro<00:03:00.220> technology<00:03:01.220> where<00:03:01.400> we<00:03:01.520> put<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
micro technology where we put the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.540 
micro technology where we put the
reflections<00:03:02.390> on<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.600> face<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.350> we<00:03:04.010> pass<00:03:04.280> them

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
reflections on the face and we pass them

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.030 
reflections on the face and we pass them
under<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.090> technology<00:03:05.600> for<00:03:05.810> scans<00:03:06.170> we<00:03:06.860> take

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
under the technology for scans we take

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.650 
under the technology for scans we take
pictures<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.430> them<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:07.730> then<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.150> comes<00:03:08.269> here

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
pictures of them and then it comes here

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.300 
pictures of them and then it comes here
in<00:03:09.320> a<00:03:09.670> facial<00:03:10.670> game<00:03:11.060> it's<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.110> 3d<00:03:12.560> scan<00:03:12.620> that's

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
in a facial game it's a 3d scan that's

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.790 
in a facial game it's a 3d scan that's
exactly<00:03:13.489> replica<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.350> athletes

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.640 

all<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.190> exercises<00:03:29.640> we've<00:03:29.910> done<00:03:30.150> our<00:03:30.650> like

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
all the exercises we've done our like

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.210 
all the exercises we've done our like
every<00:03:32.010> training<00:03:32.310> every<00:03:32.700> game<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:34.220> usual

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
every training every game and usual

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.250 
every training every game and usual
movements<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.450> it's<00:03:36.600> nothing<00:03:36.750> special

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
movements so it's nothing special

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.280 
movements so it's nothing special
nothing<00:03:37.650> different<00:03:38.810> being<00:03:39.810> on<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.080> fit

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
nothing different being on the fit

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.430 
nothing different being on the fit
really<00:03:40.950> being<00:03:41.220> on<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:41.610> field<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.060> it's<00:03:42.380> on<00:03:43.380> a

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
really being on the field so it's on a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.680 
really being on the field so it's on a
percent<00:03:43.950> what<00:03:44.400> we<00:03:44.520> were<00:03:44.580> doing<00:03:44.880> on<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.180> pitch

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
percent what we were doing on the pitch

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.590 
percent what we were doing on the pitch
their<00:03:46.380> games<00:03:46.560> as<00:03:47.430> talented<00:03:47.970> as<00:03:48.120> these<00:03:48.300> guys

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
their games as talented as these guys

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.630 
their games as talented as these guys
are<00:03:48.870> it's<00:03:49.170> clearly<00:03:49.530> not<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.860> same<00:03:50.250> thing<00:03:50.280> as

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
are it's clearly not the same thing as

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.030 
are it's clearly not the same thing as
being<00:03:51.000> out<00:03:51.300> on<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.570> pitch<00:03:51.990> and<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.800> presents

being out on the pitch and this presents

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.880 
being out on the pitch and this presents
quite<00:03:53.640> a<00:03:53.670> few<00:03:54.090> challenges<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.900> ea's<00:03:55.230> directors

were<00:04:01.560> playing<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:01.920> real<00:04:02.100> game<00:04:02.310> is<00:04:02.580> quite<00:04:02.880> quite

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
were playing a real game is quite quite

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.730 
were playing a real game is quite quite
often<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.420> get<00:04:03.510> like<00:04:03.660> quite<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.840> wooden<00:04:04.260> and

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
often you get like quite a wooden and

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.930 
often you get like quite a wooden and
performance<00:04:05.280> from<00:04:05.370> your<00:04:05.520> town<00:04:05.640> because

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
performance from your town because

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:06.890 
performance from your town because
they're<00:04:06.060> not<00:04:06.180> in<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.510> heat<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.810> moment

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
they're not in the heat of the moment

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.990 
they're not in the heat of the moment
they're<00:04:07.440> there<00:04:08.160> just<00:04:08.190> as<00:04:08.700> if<00:04:08.850> they're

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
they're there just as if they're

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.760 
they're there just as if they're
practicing<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.810> get<00:04:09.960> a<00:04:09.990> very<00:04:10.110> lackluster

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
practicing and you get a very lackluster

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.130 
practicing and you get a very lackluster
kind<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.100> emotion<00:04:11.790> from<00:04:12.120> them<00:04:12.360> so<00:04:12.510> I<00:04:12.690> think<00:04:12.930> the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
kind of emotion from them so I think the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.860 
kind of emotion from them so I think the
key<00:04:13.320> for<00:04:13.350> us<00:04:13.680> for<00:04:14.160> FIFA<00:04:14.550> is<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.970> really<00:04:15.510> try<00:04:15.780> and

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
key for us for FIFA is to really try and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.150 
key for us for FIFA is to really try and
get<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.019> actors<00:04:16.350> in<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.590> moment<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.100> make

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
get the actors in the moment and make

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.289 
get the actors in the moment and make
them<00:04:17.430> feel<00:04:17.549> like<00:04:17.670> they're<00:04:17.850> really<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.209> the

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
them feel like they're really in the

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.610 
them feel like they're really in the
game<00:04:18.450> they<00:04:18.630> need<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.930> motion<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.260> get<00:04:19.410> out<00:04:19.500> of

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
game they need the motion you get out of

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.250 
game they need the motion you get out of
the<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:20.400> head<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.420> event<00:04:21.630> is<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.989> much

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
the the head of the event is is much

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.650 
the the head of the event is is much
better<00:04:22.980> quality<00:04:23.340> lovely<00:04:23.640> so<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> variety<00:04:24.600> is

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
better quality lovely so a variety is
