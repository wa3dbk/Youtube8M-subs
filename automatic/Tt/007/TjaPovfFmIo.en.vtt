it<00:01:06.440> turns<00:01:06.710> off<00:01:06.950> automatically<00:01:07.549> like<00:01:07.820> that

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
it turns off automatically like that

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.880 
it turns off automatically like that
when<00:01:08.390> it's<00:01:08.540> done<00:01:08.750> which<00:01:09.170> is<00:01:09.350> kind<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.740> nice

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
feature now we're going to do the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:02:16.280 
feature now we're going to do the
nutribullet

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.619 

see<00:02:17.160> what<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.640> looks<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.120> we're<00:02:18.480> going<00:02:18.569> to

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
see what that looks like we're going to

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:28.509 
see what that looks like we're going to
pour<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.019> into<00:02:19.140> our<00:02:19.260> glass<00:02:24.440> looks<00:02:25.440> pretty<00:02:25.739> good

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.259 

everybody<00:02:29.519> see<00:02:30.480> how<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:31.640> chia<00:02:32.640> seeds<00:02:33.000> and

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
everybody see how the chia seeds and

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.150 
everybody see how the chia seeds and
grain<00:02:34.049> still<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.810> liquid<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:39.030> here's<00:02:39.239> the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
grain still in the liquid and here's the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.809 
grain still in the liquid and here's the
Vitamix<00:02:45.319> definitely<00:02:46.319> don't<00:02:46.530> see<00:02:46.950> many<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
Vitamix definitely don't see many of the

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:57.410 
Vitamix definitely don't see many of the
little<00:02:48.090> black<00:02:48.480> chia<00:02:48.840> seeds<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.440> there<00:02:56.420> think

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
little black chia seeds in there think

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.720 
little black chia seeds in there think
overall<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.840> both<00:02:58.170> did<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.410> pretty<00:02:58.709> good<00:02:58.950> job<00:02:59.010> but

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
overall I both did a pretty good job but

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.780 
overall I both did a pretty good job but
you<00:03:00.030> can<00:03:00.959> see<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.470> there's<00:03:01.829> more<00:03:04.489> finer<00:03:05.489> in

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
you can see this there's more finer in

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.520 
you can see this there's more finer in
here<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.540> can<00:03:06.720> see<00:03:06.959> little<00:03:07.110> more<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
here and you can see little more the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.270 
here and you can see little more the
seeds<00:03:07.829> in<00:03:08.040> here<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.549> think<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:10.290> texture<00:03:10.980> of

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
seeds in here and I think the texture of

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.250 
seeds in here and I think the texture of
the<00:03:11.640> nutribullet<00:03:11.970> one<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.569> little<00:03:12.930> bit

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
the nutribullet one is a little bit

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.660 
the nutribullet one is a little bit
thicker<00:03:15.319> way<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.379> make<00:03:16.620> sure<00:03:16.860> they<00:03:17.040> mixed<00:03:17.579> it

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
thicker way to make sure they mixed it

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.809 
thicker way to make sure they mixed it
up<00:03:17.819> nice<00:03:20.000> it's<00:03:21.000> creamy<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.630> frothy<00:03:22.350> and

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.530 

that's<00:03:25.819> it<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:27.620> try<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.640> mix<00:03:28.909> nutribullet

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
that's it so try to mix nutribullet

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.240 
that's it so try to mix nutribullet
challenge<00:03:30.250> after<00:03:31.250> tasting<00:03:31.790> them<00:03:31.909> both

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
challenge after tasting them both

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.520 
challenge after tasting them both
Vitamix

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
Vitamix

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.830 
Vitamix
definitely<00:03:36.530> smoother<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:37.730> salt<00:03:38.239> creamy<00:03:38.569> and

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
definitely smoother in salt creamy and

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.309 
definitely smoother in salt creamy and

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
this one from the nutribullet give

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.289 
this one from the nutribullet give
little<00:03:42.560> seeds<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:43.129> whatnot<00:03:43.730> stuck<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.180> my

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
little seeds and whatnot stuck in my

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.179 
little seeds and whatnot stuck in my
teeth<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:45.019> can<00:03:45.200> feel<00:03:45.409> a<00:03:45.439> little<00:03:45.590> lumps<00:03:46.010> in

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
teeth and you can feel a little lumps in

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.170 
teeth and you can feel a little lumps in
the<00:03:46.400> texture<00:03:48.400> Vitamix<00:03:49.400> definitely<00:03:49.819> wins<00:03:50.000> this

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
the texture Vitamix definitely wins this

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:58.500 
the texture Vitamix definitely wins this
challenge

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.300 

you

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.530 

so<00:04:02.120> we'll<00:04:02.300> start<00:04:02.540> with<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.930> Vitamix
