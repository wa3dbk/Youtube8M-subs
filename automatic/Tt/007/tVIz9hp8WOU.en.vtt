00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.870
 hi friends my name is Vasily for me 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.269
 frame as always helps permanent 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.200
 our lead evgrave we are making cocktails 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.749
 for channel 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.939
 12 and today by popular demand 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:20.160
 we are preparing a grasshopper cocktail for some reason 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.740
 people here are just a very unusual cocktail 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.650
 although in principle they can be understood because 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:31.320
 what is it really and delicious is all about 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.079
 the story of this cocktail can be told 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.600
 the next two things are all researchers 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.190
 cocktails comes down to what was originally 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.949
 he was shocked by layers first show 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.770
 coffee liqueur then mint and top 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.680
 cream but now classic serve 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.109
 this cocktail is considered mixing 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.129
 the whole thing is in the shaker and filing in 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.199
 picture 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.149
 The second fact that can be said about 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.250
 the history of this cocktail is 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.210
 that cocktail was coined in 1907 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.430
 long time ago he was more accurate 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.960
 published 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.140
 1907 , invented accordingly 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.259
 I suspect a few in advance 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.840
 it made a great borman bill cocktail 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.860
 he has this nickname and his name was William 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.409
 respectively, its peak of popularity 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.829
 cocktail caught somewhere in the forties 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.850
 not the very heyday came in the 70s 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.670
 and the 80s when the so-called children 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.840
 flowers started 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.780
 popularize all sorts of cocktails on 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.850
 based cream with added milk and 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.899
 other things like that cocktail called 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.540
 grasshopper 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.719
 due to the fact that it is greenish 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.899
 greenish color gives it menthol 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.869
 liquor is still a kind of brown 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.460
 grasshopper 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.920
 contrary to the fact that now they thought there 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.799
 added some coffee there is still 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.170
 flying grasshopper when instead of cream and 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.610
 vodka is added by the way it seems to me 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.170
 so a lot of cocktails 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.330
 can be called flying just 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.590
 replacing greddy 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.250
 vodka is also a version of what this 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.310
 cocktail is a variety 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.090
 classic cocktail alexander no 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.070
 bill cocktails 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.950
 hearing this version said he 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.410
 came up with it absolutely no 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.340
 alexander von and before that did not know and here 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.280
 it's his exact 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.470
 absolutely invention so today we 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.800
 we are preparing a grasshopper cocktail for us 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.900
 will need a shaker and ice and a grasshopper and 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.640
 grasshopper 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.490
 grasshopper's knees add itself end 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.120
 it gives a special refinement to this 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.209
 cocktail 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.510
 as I said it is based on 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.250
 mint liqueur forties word 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.370
 promotion of this cocktail took one 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.370
 liquor company and this 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.260
 one of the successes including popularity 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.709
 this cocktail 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.220
 chocolate liqueur or coffee liqueur goes 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.970
 the second 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.340
 we chose coffee use kalua and 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.640
 cream completes our composition all in 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.640
 equal parts 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.840
 we mix the whole thing in a shaker and 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.810
 we filter in our glass if 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.670
 talk about works 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.830
 literary or film art which 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.930
 also contributed to the popularization of this 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.000
 cocktail that is such a theory series 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.890

 1919 if I am mistaken, by the old guilder 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.800
