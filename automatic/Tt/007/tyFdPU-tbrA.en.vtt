00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.769
 hello addicts I am sentri today I come to 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.889
 tell you about two of the superheroes 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.660
 most powerful superman and sentri superman 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.880
 belongs to the world of cee and is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.220
 possibly the best-known superhero 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.740
 in the world it has a lot of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.900
 Amazing powers can move and fly 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.880
 at a super speed which allows you 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.680
 also travel in time as it has 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.750
 seen sometimes spinning 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.390
 around the earth at the speed of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.579
 light can create an energy field to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.800
 his around as a shield and do 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.829
 invulnerable what surrounds him for example 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.960
 his suit has a huge strength his 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.149
 physical endurance is extraordinary 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.730
 can resist impacts and forces of the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.950
 greatest magnitude its sense of noise 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.870
 it's superhuman concentrating you can 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.969
 listen to any sound at a distance 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.010
 huge can cause gale is 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.899
 blowing and also being an air with 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.480
 a very low temperature can 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.760
 freeze it practically all your vision 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.890
 touch perfection can emit by the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.259
 eyes two rays of light with a precision 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.090
 millimeter and an energy as high as 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.609
 to melt or burn most of the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.340
 materials you can also concentrate on 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:11.320
 a point 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.439
 and emit the rays as a projectile 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.659
 like two balls of fire pose and x-rays 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.789
 thus being able to see through any 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.979
 wall except if it is made of lead 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.590
 You can also see long distances with 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.959
 absolute clarity by vibrating their 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.270
 Superman atoms go to a state almost 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:30.789
 plasmatic thus getting to penetrate the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.709
 matter and transfer solid bodies by 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.840
 another side we have to center also 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.789
 known as the lookout that is part 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.890
 of the universe marvel center and also 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.990
 has a long list of powers 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.090
 physically belongs to class 100 of 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.159
 marvel is to say that it is in line with 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.229
 the most powerful and strong characters 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.509
 of the marvel universe its resistance 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.789
 physical could be described as infinite 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.049
 it is virtually all its effects 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.909
 invulnerable 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.250
 center and was disintegrated by man 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.200
 molecule and it came back to resurface that gives us 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.479
 to understand the unlimited scope of his 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.509
 physical resistance can project 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.340
 energy fields and control the light 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.440
 It has a much larger super senses 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.629
 that other super humans like daredevil or 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.610
 wolverine can fly and move to a 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.470
 super speed has great 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.030
 mental abilities and can control 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.030
 the energies as per 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.680
 the light your intelligence is classified 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.690
 as one of the brightest in the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.060
 marvel universe its power is simply 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.040
 of the most exaggerated thing that has been seen in 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.440
 the marvel comics in which I quote 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.720
 literally possesses the power of a million 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.819
 of suns exploiting their power is 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.560
 practically unlimited and it has only been 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.989
 seen using a lot in 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.819
 very extreme occasions like for example 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.069
 when they killed his wife and he could 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.319
 resurrect with unlimited power and a 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.660
 immortal physical we can do to the 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.550
 idea of why sentri is considered 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.800
 one of the most powerful superheroes in 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.870
 the entire Marvel Universe after seeing 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.760
 the powers of both heroes judge 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.709
 yourselves that we think is the most 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.600
 powerful my conclusion is that if 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.769
 there was a world full of superman is 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.769
 your hero would be entry
