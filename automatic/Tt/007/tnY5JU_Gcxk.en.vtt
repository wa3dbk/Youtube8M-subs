today we're going to be talking about

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.479 
today we're going to be talking about
the<00:00:40.110> vector<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.620> what's<00:00:40.800> my<00:00:40.950> favorite<00:00:41.340> class

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the vector and what's my favorite class

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.889 
the vector and what's my favorite class
to<00:00:41.670> use<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.540> we're<00:00:42.629> gonna<00:00:42.719> get

straight into it on screen now you can
see<00:00:44.670> my<00:00:44.820> vector<00:00:45.320> my<00:00:46.320> class<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
see my vector my class that I like to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.170 
see my vector my class that I like to
really<00:00:47.160> call<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.640> called<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.940> silent

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
really call this is called the silent

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.580 
really call this is called the silent
but<00:00:48.480> deadly<00:00:48.510> that's<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> nickname<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.410> have

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
but deadly that's the nickname I have

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.750 
but deadly that's the nickname I have
for<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.829> class<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.190> I'll<00:00:50.309> explain<00:00:50.550> that

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
for this class and I'll explain that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.520 
for this class and I'll explain that
little<00:00:50.940> bit<00:00:51.030> later<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.840> pretty<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
little bit later so pretty much is the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
little bit later so pretty much is the
vector<00:00:52.680> k10<00:00:53.100> with<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> quick-draw<00:00:54.180> handle

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
vector k10 with the quick-draw handle

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
vector k10 with the quick-draw handle
suppressor<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.199> fast<00:00:55.469> mag<00:00:55.739> i'm<00:00:55.980> using<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
suppressor and fast mag i'm using the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.160 
suppressor and fast mag i'm using the
primary<00:00:56.760> gunfighter<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.020> how<00:00:58.140> i

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
primary gunfighter now is that is how i

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.170 
primary gunfighter now is that is how i
have<00:00:58.350> three<00:00:58.590> attachments<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.250> don't<00:00:59.879> feel<00:01:00.059> as

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
have three attachments I don't feel as

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.549 
have three attachments I don't feel as
though<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.390> need<00:01:00.570> my<00:01:00.690> secondary<00:01:01.109> weapon<00:01:01.440> just

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
though I need my secondary weapon just

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.680 
though I need my secondary weapon just
because<00:01:01.859> I've<00:01:01.980> scavenging<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.480> enough

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
because I've scavenging I have enough

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.899 
because I've scavenging I have enough
ammo<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.140> I'm<00:01:04.260> don't<00:01:04.890> really<00:01:05.159> need<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
ammo so I'm don't really need to have a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.370 
ammo so I'm don't really need to have a
secondary<00:01:06.360> weapon<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:06.930> pretty<00:01:07.049> easy<00:01:07.260> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
secondary weapon and it's pretty easy to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
secondary weapon and it's pretty easy to
just<00:01:07.619> pick<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:07.920> off<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> ground<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.580> anyway

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
just pick one off the ground so anyway

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.730 
just pick one off the ground so anyway
as<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> already<00:01:09.960> said<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.439> gonna<00:01:10.619> have

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
as I already said I'm gonna have

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.890 
as I already said I'm gonna have
scavengers<00:01:11.369> my<00:01:11.490> second<00:01:11.790> perk<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.659> first

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
scavengers my second perk for my first

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.270 
scavengers my second perk for my first
perk<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.320> what<00:01:13.500> ghost<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
perk up what ghost this is where the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.399 
perk up what ghost this is where the
silent<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:14.760> deadly<00:01:14.790> comes<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:16.290> gonna

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
silent but deadly comes in so I'm gonna

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.630 
silent but deadly comes in so I'm gonna
be<00:01:16.560> running<00:01:16.680> around<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.009> lot<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.369> class

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
be running around a lot with this class

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.520 
be running around a lot with this class
and<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.180> what<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.780> ghost<00:01:18.990> perk<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> made

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and this is what the ghost perk is made

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.260 
and this is what the ghost perk is made
for<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.220> more<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.520> run<00:01:20.610> around<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.000> less<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
for the more you run around the less you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.420 
for the more you run around the less you
stay<00:01:21.450> off<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> enemy<00:01:21.840> radar<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.280> why

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
stay off the enemy radar and that is why

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.070 
stay off the enemy radar and that is why
the<00:01:23.490> suppressor<00:01:23.970> comes<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:24.570> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the suppressor comes in as well so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.359 
the suppressor comes in as well so
pretty<00:01:25.259> much<00:01:25.380> you're<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> ninja<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
pretty much you're like a ninja on the

five zero eight seconds so that is
pretty<00:02:21.900> quick<00:02:22.170> for<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.380> submachine<00:02:22.830> gun<00:02:23.010> it's

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
pretty quick for a submachine gun it's

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.880 
pretty quick for a submachine gun it's
got<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.940> very<00:02:24.210> low<00:02:24.480> hip<00:02:24.720> spread<00:02:25.020> which<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.680> on

got a very low hip spread which is on
the<00:02:26.040> rear<00:02:26.220> coil<00:02:26.430> from<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.730> hip<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.240> very

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
the rear coil from the hip so it is very

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.990 
the rear coil from the hip so it is very
low<00:02:27.660> which<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.960> good<00:02:28.110> thing<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.820> knife

you<00:03:01.860> reload<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.160> gun<00:03:02.310> when<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.550> empty<00:03:02.730> it's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
you reload the gun when it's empty it's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.940 
you reload the gun when it's empty it's
2.6<00:03:03.780> two<00:03:03.990> seconds<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.590> you're<00:03:04.710> better<00:03:04.860> off

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
2.6 two seconds so you're better off

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.340 
2.6 two seconds so you're better off
reloading<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:05.610> when<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.630> still<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.050> bullets

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
reloading it when you still have bullets

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.080 
reloading it when you still have bullets
in<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.470> because<00:03:07.650> it's<00:03:07.830> a<00:03:07.890> 1.9<00:03:08.460> second<00:03:08.820> relayed

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
in it because it's a 1.9 second relayed

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.600 
in it because it's a 1.9 second relayed
then<00:03:09.930> reloading<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:10.830> when<00:03:10.950> it's<00:03:11.100> fully<00:03:11.340> empty

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
then reloading it when it's fully empty

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.580 
then reloading it when it's fully empty
because<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:11.970> goes<00:03:12.150> up<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.450> 2.6<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.260> reload

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
because it goes up to a 2.6 to reload

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.260 
because it goes up to a 2.6 to reload
speed<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.100> as<00:03:14.310> always<00:03:14.820> you're<00:03:15.090> better<00:03:15.240> off

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
speed so as always you're better off

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.550 
speed so as always you're better off
relearning<00:03:15.630> when<00:03:15.840> they<00:03:15.930> still<00:03:16.140> bullet<00:03:16.350> in<00:03:16.470> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
relearning when they still bullet in the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.930 
relearning when they still bullet in the
clip<00:03:16.740> so<00:03:16.890> that's<00:03:17.040> all<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.250> stats<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.760> gun

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
clip so that's all the stats of the gun

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.000 
clip so that's all the stats of the gun
that<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.330> now<00:03:18.959> my<00:03:19.140> overall<00:03:19.500> opinion<00:03:19.620> on

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
that I have now my overall opinion on

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.790 
that I have now my overall opinion on
the<00:03:20.100> vector<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> great<00:03:21.420> way<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:22.020> great<00:03:22.590> gun

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
the vector it is a great way a great gun

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.949 
the vector it is a great way a great gun

in short-range combat in long range this
gun<00:03:25.170> sucks<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.130> horrible<00:03:26.790> in<00:03:26.910> long<00:03:27.090> range

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
I'm just prestiged in this game so that

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.010 
I'm just prestiged in this game so that
is<00:03:59.160> why<00:03:59.310> it's<00:03:59.670> only<00:03:59.880> UAV<00:04:00.390> wholesome<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:00.870> late

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
is why it's only UAV wholesome and late

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.130 
is why it's only UAV wholesome and late
start<00:04:01.290> because<00:04:01.350> just<00:04:01.709> random<00:04:02.370> kill<00:04:02.550> streaks

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
start because just random kill streaks

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.570 
start because just random kill streaks
but<00:04:04.140> yeah<00:04:04.290> as<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.620> already<00:04:04.739> mentioned<00:04:04.860> you<00:04:05.310> must

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
but yeah as I already mentioned you must

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.250 
but yeah as I already mentioned you must
stick<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.030> closed<00:04:06.300> corded<00:04:06.690> situations

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
stick to the closed corded situations

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.140 
stick to the closed corded situations
areas<00:04:07.590> in<00:04:07.709> maps<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.400> stick<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.820> edges

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
areas in maps so stick to the edges

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.940 
areas in maps so stick to the edges
because<00:04:09.209> that<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.540> where<00:04:09.739> most<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.860> the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
because that is where most of the

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.350 
because that is where most of the

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
enemies dent in the go the middle in

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.150 
enemies dent in the go the middle in
black<00:04:12.750> ops<00:04:12.930> 2<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.470> middle<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.739> all<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.010> mass

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
black ops 2 the middle of all the mass

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.949 
black ops 2 the middle of all the mass
in<00:04:14.310> black<00:04:14.489> ops<00:04:14.670> 2<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:15.030> where<00:04:15.630> all<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.780> action

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
in black ops 2 is where all the action

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.140 
in black ops 2 is where all the action
happens<00:04:16.169> so<00:04:16.590> try<00:04:16.830> stay<00:04:17.130> around<00:04:17.580> that<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:17.940> try

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
happens so try stay around that and try

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.130 
happens so try stay around that and try
Frank<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.480> enemies<00:04:18.750> from<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.989> back

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
Frank the enemies from the back

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.229 
Frank the enemies from the back
especially<00:04:19.709> with<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.190> vector<00:04:20.489> because<00:04:20.760> as<00:04:20.940> I

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
especially with the vector because as I

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.969 
especially with the vector because as I
said<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.900> horrible<00:04:22.650> from<00:04:22.800> long<00:04:22.950> range

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
said it is horrible from long range

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.130 
said it is horrible from long range
rather<00:04:23.820> than<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.300> vector<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.840> pretty

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
rather than that the vector is pretty

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.850 
rather than that the vector is pretty
powerful<00:04:25.440> from

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
powerful from

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.249 
powerful from
strange<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:27.150> doesn't<00:04:27.449> have<00:04:27.539> too<00:04:27.689> much<00:04:27.810> recoil

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
strange it doesn't have too much recoil
