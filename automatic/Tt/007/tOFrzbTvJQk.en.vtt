00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.020
 Hello everyone, following the launch of the 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.920
 Batman's second trailer versus 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.689
 superman that new dc comics movie 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.220
 Well, I wanted to make a small 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.029
 trailer comment because I have 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.460
 charmed 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.680
 the comic has also been leaked with the 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.599
 suicide squad squad trailers 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.300
 suicidal is the joker that I have seen and I 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.970
 love interpreted by jared leto that 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.460
 I think also the character of harley 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.230
 quinn played by margot robbie goes 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.300
 to be great, well, he was wanted 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.890
 talk a little about this batman 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.739
 versus superman because he has a pint 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.379
 awesome I really liked seeing 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.140
 ben affleck as bruce wayne running 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.239
 towards that danger not towards that struggle in 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.980
 the one that was the sun and the man of 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.920
 steel and superman in the first movie 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.929
 from zack snyder here we see a connection 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.059
 of events not between what was seen in 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.980
 that movie and what we 're going to see 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.800
 here in this one 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.530
 batman versus superman it seems that 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.860
 the events in which he had 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.590
 applied superman to motivate that the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.450
 character then be seen as a danger 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.850
 for society and for that superhero 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.400
 called batman who had there a 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.910
 metropolis building 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.950
 of your company wayne enterprises or as 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.290
 want it to be called in this new 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.420
 good movie because I liked it a lot 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.280
 see that Ben Affleck is good plus 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.280
 running and saving that girl for that 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.620
 face of hate with that fight that seems 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.260
 that will be very good between batman and 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.570
 superman with jeremy irons giving advice 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.280
 and replacing the character of michael 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.150
 caine in those movies of 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.810
 christopher nolan 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.180
 I also liked very much to see dot and 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.010
 as wonder woman and we will see if your 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.050
 character has enough time 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.110
 to be well built we also see 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.790
 Little moments of lois character 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.729
 lane interpreted again here by 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.180
 friend lambs again we will have to marta 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.020
 that in the mother of clark kent / superman 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.220
 do not 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.530
 of the character's adoptive and we see that 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.599
 is also lores facebook we owe a 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.099
 impressive sequence of action that 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.500
 remind the video games these 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:22.150
 they have recently left batman and we see 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.239
 a scene that recalls a lot the cover 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.040
 of the comic that night times in I think 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:28.540
 that this film is based a lot on that 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.489
 comic despite the fact that the story is going to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.140
 be different surely I liked 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.629
 a lot to see that it's going to be a fight 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.370
 fierce between those two superheroes 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.989
 that surely they will reach a 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.290
 agreement but it seems that it goes from the days to 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.329
 breads we also see jesse eisenberg 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.099
 interpreting the destroyer that is what 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.860
 only one that I do not like about the trailer 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.420
 I trust this actor and less with a wig 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.069
 I know that later he will be bald because he has 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.450
 appeared a photograph of him not 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.910
 I understand why they put us 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.340
 photograph of the former bald author and then 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.130
 they show us the trailer with hair we 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.260
 wants to surprise in the movie later 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.940
 like she loses her hair but in the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.099
 promotion of these days of these months 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.170
 previous we have seen him without hair to 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.670
 they have this was not going to lose their hair 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.770
 Well, do not show it because 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.740
 we have seen and if not then 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.530
 save yourself the bald photo and directly 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.530
 so that they surprise us seeing the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.530
 movie not good the trailer counts or 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.360
 they show us many scenes that are 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.150
 very well mixed so we do not know 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.710
 what are we going out of yet batman 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.930
 in a kind of desert attacked by 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.620
 a kind of army like superman 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.990
 is not 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.200
 superman soldiers I do not know if they will be 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.960
 allies of superman or a command against 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.250
 superman I do not know we 'll see it's a 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.230
 movie that I think will have a 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.000
 good script because here we have 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.190
 criterion that has worked with ben 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.410
 affleck on something that I really liked holly 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.090
 hunter a kind of senator I do not know what 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.680
 such will be his character 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.340
 I think it will represent a little 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.040
 what society thinks is not that fear 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.660
 of the government towards superman no and his 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.600
 also fight against batman that looks 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.850
 that is a little crazy not like 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.610
 said ben affleck himself is a batman 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.680
 as burned and that even the 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.810
 villains he finds on the street 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.820
 do not hesitate to make them like a tattoo 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.370
 batman does not burn them here since it's a 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.229
 uncle 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.880
 we do not know who the bastard is going to be 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.650
 batman and superman I think more are going to 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.900
 Superman is going to be there defending himself 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.300
 as I can because you will have to explode 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.280
 then it will appear with a hand that is going to 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.750
 have here all good because this is 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.460
 everything I wanted to comment on this 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.820
 second trailer of this batman versus 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.050
 superman who paint truly 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.050
 spectacular if you have not seen the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.570
 trailer take a look and if you can and what 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.780
 you find the suicide trailer 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.669
 squad so it paints phenomenally also a 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.880
 greeting and see you in the next video 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.880
 review 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.460
 s 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.460
 this
