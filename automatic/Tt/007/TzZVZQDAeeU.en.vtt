00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
around here that's not how I here's the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.720 
around here that's not how I here's the
trouble<00:00:39.270> Cena<00:00:39.950> looks<00:00:40.950> really<00:00:41.370> good<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> think

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
trouble Cena looks really good I think

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.360

but<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.410> there's<00:00:43.739> three<00:00:43.860> things<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.190> look<00:00:44.309> for

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
but so there's three things I look for

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.990 
but so there's three things I look for
all<00:00:45.270> right<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.800> accuracy<00:00:47.000> playability
