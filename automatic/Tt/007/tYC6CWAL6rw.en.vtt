00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
obviously a ratchet knockoff the movie

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.550 
obviously a ratchet knockoff the movie
ratchet<00:00:27.289> he's<00:00:29.990> pretty<00:00:30.990> much<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
ratchet he's pretty much just the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.790 
ratchet he's pretty much just the
standard<00:00:32.369> mold<00:00:32.930> as<00:00:33.930> I'm<00:00:34.140> looking<00:00:34.410> at<00:00:34.500> him<00:00:34.620> now

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
standard mold as I'm looking at him now

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.790 
standard mold as I'm looking at him now
I<00:00:34.829> mean<00:00:35.130> he<00:00:35.280> looks<00:00:35.460> tiny<00:00:36.210> bit<00:00:36.660> bigger<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.320> don't

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
I mean he looks tiny bit bigger I don't

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.709 
I mean he looks tiny bit bigger I don't
think<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.520> he's<00:00:38.640> any<00:00:38.820> different<00:00:38.879> actually

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
think that he's any different actually

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.830 
think that he's any different actually
other<00:00:40.379> than<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:42.059> back<00:00:42.239> part<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
other than the the back part here the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.650 
other than the the back part here the
legs<00:00:43.079> actually<00:00:43.649> are<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.100> little<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.180> little

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
legs actually are a little a little

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.660 
legs actually are a little a little
different<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.230> you'll<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.620> robot<00:00:46.920> mode<00:00:46.950> so

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
different as you'll see in robot mode so

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.770 
different as you'll see in robot mode so
I<00:00:47.700> don't<00:00:48.059> know<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.360> will<00:00:48.450> come<00:00:48.660> across

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
I don't know if that will come across

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.830 
I don't know if that will come across
but<00:00:49.289> he's<00:00:49.890> fractionally<00:00:50.760> longer<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.809> caramel

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.750 

other<00:00:55.379> than<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.710> his<00:00:55.920> main<00:00:56.129> big<00:00:56.370> difference

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
other than that his main big difference

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:09.289 
other than that his main big difference
is<00:00:56.879> he<00:00:57.000> does<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.329> lights<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.780> sounds

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.080 

like<00:01:10.299> so<00:01:10.679> and<00:01:11.679> then<00:01:12.100> as<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.399> can<00:01:12.490> see<00:01:12.549> he's<00:01:12.880> got

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
like so and then as you can see he's got

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.219 
like so and then as you can see he's got
a<00:01:13.890> fully<00:01:14.890> molded<00:01:15.159> plastic<00:01:15.820> top<00:01:16.030> here<00:01:16.329> and<00:01:17.109> I'll

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.100 

this<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:45.550> has<00:02:45.700> these<00:02:45.850> little<00:02:46.060> tabs<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.020> then

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
this that has these little tabs and then

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.360 
this that has these little tabs and then
a<00:02:47.170> little<00:02:47.410> notch<00:02:48.330> just<00:02:49.330> plug<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:50.280> kind<00:02:51.280> of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
a little notch just plug in kind of

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:06.720 
a little notch just plug in kind of
locks<00:02:51.550> it<00:02:51.730> together

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.960 

so<00:03:07.730> here<00:03:08.060> he<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.270> in<00:03:08.450> robot<00:03:09.260> mode<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.970> it's

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
so here he is in robot mode and it's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.880 
so here he is in robot mode and it's
pretty<00:03:11.540> much<00:03:11.720> what<00:03:11.930> you'd<00:03:11.960> expect<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.710> mean

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
pretty much what you'd expect I mean

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.810 
pretty much what you'd expect I mean
it's<00:03:13.990> pretty<00:03:14.990> ratchet<00:03:15.380> II<00:03:15.710> all<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.700> way

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
it's pretty ratchet II all the way

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.890 
it's pretty ratchet II all the way
across<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:18.500> little<00:03:19.130> size<00:03:19.400> comparison<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:20.780> can

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
across a little size comparison you can

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.240 
across a little size comparison you can
see<00:03:21.020> he's<00:03:21.140> much<00:03:21.440> taller<00:03:21.740> in<00:03:22.190> this<00:03:22.700> mode

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
see he's much taller in this mode

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.470 
see he's much taller in this mode
there's<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.340> little<00:03:25.610> bit<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:25.910> difference<00:03:26.300> in

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
there's a little bit of a difference in

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.610 
there's a little bit of a difference in
the<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:28.180> abdomen<00:03:29.180> here<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.810> adds<00:03:29.960> some<00:03:30.260> size

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
the the abdomen here that adds some size

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.250 
the the abdomen here that adds some size
and<00:03:31.490> you<00:03:31.550> can<00:03:31.580> see<00:03:31.810> side-by-side<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.840> these

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
and you can see side-by-side that these

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.070 
and you can see side-by-side that these
leg<00:03:33.560> pieces<00:03:34.040> here<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.340> little<00:03:34.580> longer<00:03:35.080> same

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
leg pieces here a little longer same

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.710 
leg pieces here a little longer same
thing<00:03:36.290> here<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.000> it's<00:03:38.000> mostly<00:03:38.240> like<00:03:38.390> he's<00:03:38.600> up

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
thing here so it's mostly like he's up

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.980 
thing here so it's mostly like he's up
on<00:03:38.870> stilts<00:03:39.850> which<00:03:40.850> may<00:03:41.060> or<00:03:41.120> may<00:03:41.270> not<00:03:41.300> suit<00:03:41.720> your

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
on stilts which may or may not suit your

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.810 
on stilts which may or may not suit your
aesthetic<00:03:42.860> tastes<00:03:43.720> kind<00:03:44.720> of<00:03:44.750> works<00:03:44.930> for<00:03:45.140> me

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
aesthetic tastes kind of works for me

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.570 
aesthetic tastes kind of works for me
but<00:03:46.820> his<00:03:47.650> big<00:03:48.650> difference<00:03:49.070> in<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.340> mode

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
but his big difference in this mode

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.340 
but his big difference in this mode
other<00:03:49.850> than<00:03:50.060> his<00:03:50.210> height<00:03:50.390> he<00:03:51.080> has<00:03:52.210> normal<00:03:53.350> peg

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
other than his height he has normal peg

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.630 
other than his height he has normal peg
hole<00:03:54.880> fists<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:57.140> he<00:03:57.260> can<00:03:57.410> hold<00:03:57.590> his<00:03:57.770> his<00:03:58.400> two
