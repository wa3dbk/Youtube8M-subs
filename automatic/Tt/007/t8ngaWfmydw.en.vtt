of techniques that you can use to find

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.349 
of techniques that you can use to find
what<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> call<00:00:22.920> hidden<00:00:23.130> jobs<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.880> company

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
what I call hidden jobs on company

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.810 
what I call hidden jobs on company
websites<00:00:24.859> many<00:00:25.859> people<00:00:26.160> tell<00:00:26.369> me<00:00:26.400> they<00:00:26.519> go<00:00:26.760> to

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
websites many people tell me they go to

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.220 
websites many people tell me they go to
websites<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.630> when<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:27.810> start<00:00:28.109> looking

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
websites and when they start looking

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.550 
websites and when they start looking
around<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:29.250> don't<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.820> anything<00:00:30.349> but<00:00:31.349> I

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
around they don't see anything but I

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.200 
around they don't see anything but I
know<00:00:31.710> they're<00:00:32.040> there<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.520> list<00:00:32.759> them<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.059> our

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
know they're there we list them on our

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
know they're there we list them on our
site<00:00:33.450> for<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.780> reason<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.070> see<00:00:35.309> here

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
site for a reason as you can see here

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.869 
site for a reason as you can see here
for<00:00:35.790> example<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.329> 218<00:00:37.290> companies<00:00:37.879> with

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
for example we have 218 companies with

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.510 
for example we have 218 companies with
overseas<00:00:39.629> jobs<00:00:40.020> currently<00:00:40.800> posted<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.399> their

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
overseas jobs currently posted on their

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.880 
overseas jobs currently posted on their
website<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.180> many<00:00:43.020> companies<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.739> them

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
website so many companies have them

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
website so many companies have them
there<00:00:44.070> yet<00:00:44.280> people<00:00:44.489> can't<00:00:44.879> find<00:00:45.210> them<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
there yet people can't find them and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.380 
there yet people can't find them and
there's<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> very<00:00:45.930> simple<00:00:46.230> reason<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.770> that

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
there's a very simple reason for that

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.840 
there's a very simple reason for that
let<00:00:48.390> me<00:00:48.420> give<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> an<00:00:48.809> example<00:00:49.200> using<00:00:49.850> this

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
let me give you an example using this

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.260 
let me give you an example using this
website<00:00:51.149> from<00:00:51.660> Rockwell<00:00:51.870> Collins<00:00:53.090> let's<00:00:54.090> say

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
website from Rockwell Collins let's say

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
website from Rockwell Collins let's say
that<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.600> were<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.440> job<00:00:55.469> in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that you were going to look for a job in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.639 
that you were going to look for a job in
maybe<00:00:56.160> Iraq<00:00:56.879> Afghanistan<00:00:57.260> Kuwait<00:00:58.260> someplace

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
maybe Iraq Afghanistan Kuwait someplace

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.950 
maybe Iraq Afghanistan Kuwait someplace
like<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.969> were<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.359> down<00:01:00.390> here

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
like that if you were to go down here

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
and do their basic search and let's say

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.899 
and do their basic search and let's say
look<00:01:02.940> under<00:01:03.210> location<00:01:04.129> then<00:01:05.129> as<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.760> were

look under location then as you were
scrolling<00:01:06.540> down<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.500> wouldn't

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
scrolling down through here you wouldn't

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.719 
scrolling down through here you wouldn't

possible jobs here but as you can see
nothing<00:01:19.770> shows<00:01:19.979> up<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:22.229> way<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.680> can

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
nothing shows up so one way that you can

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.410 
nothing shows up so one way that you can
look<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.780> use<00:01:25.490> some<00:01:26.490> words<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.880> these

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
look is to use some words that these

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080 
look is to use some words that these
companies<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.310> put<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> their<00:01:29.850> job

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
descriptions and what they'll do is I'll

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.140 
descriptions and what they'll do is I'll
have<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> job<00:01:33.170> listed<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> stateside

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
have the job listed with a stateside

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.090 
have the job listed with a stateside
location<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> requires<00:01:37.500> deploying

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
location but it requires deploying

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.789 
location but it requires deploying
overseas<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:39.930> example<00:01:40.380> if<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> went<00:01:40.710> up

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799

and did the search again this time you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.800 
and did the search again this time you
have<00:01:49.560> jobs<00:01:49.950> come<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.399> even<00:01:50.670> though<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.509> can

let's use Kandahar when we search with
Kandahar<00:02:29.959> we<00:02:30.959> come<00:02:31.200> up<00:02:31.380> with<00:02:31.560> these<00:02:31.740> two

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
Kandahar we come up with these two

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.770 
Kandahar we come up with these two
entries<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:35.430> if<00:02:35.580> we<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.880> back<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.450> use

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
sudden we have far more because these

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.740 
sudden we have far more because these
positions<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:50.150> have<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.300> tell<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:51.720> I

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
looked at these in advance I know but

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.340 
looked at these in advance I know but
for<00:02:54.690> example<00:02:55.080> here<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:57.480> location<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.200> this

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
for example here the location of this

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.080 
for example here the location of this
position<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:58.980> near<00:02:59.220> Charleston<00:02:59.880> South

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
position is near Charleston South

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.180 
position is near Charleston South
Carolina<00:03:00.150> however<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.290> may<00:03:01.440> be<00:03:02.150> requiring
