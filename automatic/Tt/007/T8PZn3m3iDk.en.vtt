00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.780
 good afternoon everybody my name is faith 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.720
 mazepina 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.820
 and in today's video lesson 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.920
 continue our acquaintance with you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.500
 fittings 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:24.860
 4 and we will take a look today with this view 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.590
 fittings like connecting rings or 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.140
 simply rings connecting rings 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.940
 plays an important role in making 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.730
 do-it-yourself jewelry wizard name 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:41.720
 connect the necessary elements with each other 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:47.140
 but also connecting rings can 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:50.269
 act as the main link that is 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.909
 make up a single decoration which 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:56.510
 will be collected from only one 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.879
 coupling rings for example 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.129
 photographs that you will now see on 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.839
 the monitor 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.940
 connecting rings differ between 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.090
 by myself 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:12.229
 color that is, they may be different in 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:17.330
 gold metal colors are silver and 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:20.090
 bronze copper but also their main 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.109
 distinctive feature is 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.659
 the diameter of the metal the thinner the ring 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.579
 easier to squeeze it 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.240
 just the opposite is also the denser 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.060
 ring so it is safer and harder it 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.149
 give birth for example, I took but rather in 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.729
 arm two connecting ringle 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.859
 golden and silver they 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.460
 differ as we immediately see by 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:49.609
 diameter one more the other less well and 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.130
 also the diameter of the metal that is, if 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.520
 we will pay attention now 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.409
 silver ring it is in diameter 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.899
 smaller here we try to open it 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.479
 tool and see that it is a little bit 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.319
 smaller than its more golden 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:10.880
 easier to give birth and then close up if 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:13.910
 give birth to his golden ring already 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.510
 how much harder it will be here already need two 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:22.790
 tool and here is the diameter of the metal wider 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:27.110
 Well, the consequence of that is more reliable that is 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.730
 each ring is used by the needlewoman 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.530
 depending on what she wants and 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.560
 to make in order to open 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.400
 ring in the work of the master uses two 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.400
 tool 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.370
 with one tool we grab 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.920
 ring on one side other 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.810
 tool hold the ring with another 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.990
 hand push the ring now 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.400
 diverting the tools against each other here 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.620
 so the raja ring can 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.400
 now connect the ring with the necessary 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:10.720
 you element such as lock togla 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:15.950
 we make a loop connecting ring 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:23.600
 pick up the tool and close the ring 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:24.940
 back all there are also rings with 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.950
 double twist 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.820
 This ring consists of two kind of them 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.840
 spiral and it turns out a ring with a double 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:40.040
 twisting surely each of you have 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:43.760
 and key chains with keys where 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.830
 such an element of furniture as a double 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.830
 ring only she looks a little bit 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.560
 more in size but the principle of work 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.110
 given ring is the same to us 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.360
 need to open 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:02.080
 one twisted ring and thread it 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.300
 necessary elements or link 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.500
 further fittings and it is believed that 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:13.930
 here is a double meek ring 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:18.620
 will be the most reliable restraint 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:21.410
 element and your decorations and parts 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.790
 which are connected in it will not be lost 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.430
 as the double-twisted ring opens 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:31.010
 exists in nature even special 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.670
 ring opening tool double 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.740
 twisting it can also be found in

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.680
 description 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.540
 I will show how to open such a ring I 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.370
 for work i will use two 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.050
 tool pliers 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:58.400
 by them i will take the extreme twisted ring 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.180
 it will be like this second instrument 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.120
 hold 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.990
 the rest of the ring design like this 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.380
 now only merchants are extremely twisted 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.380
 ring 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.560
 up like this you see me 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:20.300
 appears in here already lumen let go 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:23.180
 one tool further at that moment for now 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.290
 I keep the tank merchants this ring is extremely 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:29.419
 I take the next part of the fittings which 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.590
 no need to connect well let's say this 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:37.419
 here's a single ring spend it in 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:42.830
 space where is 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:46.000
 tool let him go all the little ring 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.630
 got now I spend it in a spiral 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.370
 along the whole 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:58.100
 the twist rings are all about it and on 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:02.060

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:05.240
 press the ring back just close 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:11.050
 a tool that is a sponge between each other and 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:15.340
 the little ring will be back all the great choices 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.360
