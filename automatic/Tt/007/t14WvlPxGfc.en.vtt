cross section of a building so

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.530 
cross section of a building so
I<00:02:11.160> mean<00:02:11.730> there's<00:02:11.970> even<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.980> light<00:02:13.980> socket<00:02:14.540> and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
I mean there's even a light socket and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.540 
I mean there's even a light socket and
cracks<00:02:15.960> in<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.350> wall<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.100> don't<00:02:17.400> really

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
cracks in the wall and I don't really

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.220

don't<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.970> explain<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.960> see<00:02:19.200> it

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
don't have to explain it you can see it

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.030 
don't have to explain it you can see it
I<00:02:19.620> guess<00:02:20.430> that's<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.730> window<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.920> know

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
I guess that's a window and you know

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.810 
I guess that's a window and you know
this<00:02:23.250> base<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:25.250> incredible<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.670> incredible

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
this base is incredible it's incredible
