00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
take out his his income and then i get

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.370 
take out his his income and then i get
my<00:01:18.330> own<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:18.960> i'll<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.170> okay

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
my own going and then i'll be okay

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.770 
my own going and then i'll be okay

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
because even though i had a late later

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.999 
because even though i had a late later
expansion<00:01:21.780> i<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.020> now<00:01:22.200> i<00:01:22.229> see<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> expansion

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.290 
wanted to try building archons because
people<00:02:39.190> have<00:02:39.280> been<00:02:39.400> saying<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.940> Blizzard

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
people have been saying and Blizzard

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.580 
people have been saying and Blizzard
themselves<00:02:40.690> have<00:02:40.810> said<00:02:40.960> that<00:02:41.080> archons<00:02:41.470> are

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
themselves have said that archons are

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.190 
themselves have said that archons are
intended<00:02:42.370> as<00:02:42.520> you<00:02:42.790> know<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:43.090> secondary<00:02:43.870> use<00:02:44.080> for

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
intended as you know a secondary use for

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.870 
intended as you know a secondary use for
high<00:02:44.290> templar<00:02:44.620> once<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:44.950> sighs<00:02:45.160> storm<00:02:45.460> and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
high templar once you sighs storm and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.370 
high templar once you sighs storm and
you're<00:02:46.480> out<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.600> energy<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.110> want<00:02:47.290> to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
you're out of energy and you want to

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.930 
you're out of energy and you want to
still<00:02:47.530> have<00:02:47.650> them<00:02:47.770> contribute<00:02:48.160> some<00:02:48.310> dps<00:02:48.610> you

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
still have them contribute some dps you

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.490 
still have them contribute some dps you
can<00:02:49.090> morph<00:02:49.420> them<00:02:49.540> into<00:02:49.720> archons<00:02:50.050> they<00:02:50.350> were

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
can morph them into archons they were

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.680 
can morph them into archons they were
fast<00:02:50.740> well<00:02:51.040> but<00:02:51.550> what<00:02:51.820> I<00:02:51.850> wanted<00:02:52.210> to<00:02:52.270> try<00:02:52.510> was

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
fast well but what I wanted to try was

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.970 
fast well but what I wanted to try was
you<00:02:52.810> know<00:02:52.900> what<00:02:53.140> if<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.290> go<00:02:53.410> straight<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.890> our

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
you know what if I go straight to our

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.320 
you know what if I go straight to our
cons<00:02:54.220> because<00:02:54.430> those<00:02:54.670> high<00:02:54.790> tempo<00:02:55.030> don't<00:02:55.240> have

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
cons because those high tempo don't have

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.520 
cons because those high tempo don't have
enough<00:02:55.480> energy<00:02:55.600> for<00:02:55.780> storm<00:02:56.020> yet<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.230> want<00:02:56.440> to

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
enough energy for storm yet I want to

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.010 
enough energy for storm yet I want to
push<00:02:56.650> right<00:02:56.830> now<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.220> they<00:02:58.030> boosted<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:58.900> this

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
push right now and they boosted in this

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.740 
push right now and they boosted in this

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
health that does one volley took away

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.780 
health that does one volley took away
from<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.530> from<00:03:05.680> your<00:03:05.770> zerglings<00:03:06.190> yeah<00:03:06.580> and

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
I really want to just fall in quick I

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.050 
I really want to just fall in quick I
really<00:03:08.740> wanted<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.160> see<00:03:09.340> if<00:03:09.460> that<00:03:09.610> splash

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
really wanted to see if that splash

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.060 
really wanted to see if that splash
increase<00:03:10.840> makes<00:03:11.350> it<00:03:11.470> different<00:03:11.800> I'm<00:03:11.950> gonna

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
increase makes it different I'm gonna

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.620 
increase makes it different I'm gonna
slow<00:03:12.340> down<00:03:12.490> just<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.790> little<00:03:13.060> bit<00:03:13.240> here<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.510> i

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
slow down just a little bit here so i

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.820 
slow down just a little bit here so i
just<00:03:13.660> want<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.900> see<00:03:14.050> exactly<00:03:14.200> how<00:03:14.530> much<00:03:14.650> damage

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
just want to see exactly how much damage

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.530 
just want to see exactly how much damage
look<00:03:15.130> how--look<00:03:15.340> how<00:03:15.550> much<00:03:15.820> simultaneous

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
look how--look how much simultaneous

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.300 
look how--look how much simultaneous
life<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.840> getting<00:03:16.930> lost<00:03:17.200> on<00:03:17.410> those<00:03:17.650> muta<00:03:18.070> lists

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
life is getting lost on those muta lists

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.910 
life is getting lost on those muta lists
now<00:03:18.460> can't<00:03:19.120> let<00:03:19.210> go<00:03:19.270> over<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.540> bun<00:03:19.800> some<00:03:20.800> see

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
now can't let go over that bun some see

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.140 
now can't let go over that bun some see
the<00:03:21.040> mutes<00:03:21.220> coming<00:03:21.460> down<00:03:21.610> without<00:03:21.820> any

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
the mutes coming down without any

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.910 
the mutes coming down without any
confusion<00:03:22.630> yeah<00:03:22.960> yeah<00:03:23.320> newts<00:03:23.650> are<00:03:23.740> just

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
confusion yeah yeah newts are just

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.580 
confusion yeah yeah newts are just
dropping<00:03:24.790> like<00:03:24.970> flies<00:03:25.080> really<00:03:26.080> quickly<00:03:26.410> I

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
dropping like flies really quickly I

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.140 
dropping like flies really quickly I
almost<00:03:26.950> like<00:03:27.160> this<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.370> more<00:03:27.610> effective

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
almost like this is more effective

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.760 
almost like this is more effective
positively<00:03:28.630> than<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.870> size<00:03:29.050> storm<00:03:29.350> maybe

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
positively than the size storm maybe

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.290 
positively than the size storm maybe
it's<00:03:29.980> equal<00:03:30.370> maybe<00:03:30.610> I'm<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.940> know<00:03:31.060> there's<00:03:31.270> a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
it's equal maybe I'm you know there's a

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.820 
it's equal maybe I'm you know there's a
good<00:03:31.390> chance<00:03:31.540> I'm<00:03:31.690> wrong<00:03:31.870> on<00:03:31.990> that<00:03:32.020> but<00:03:32.140> I<00:03:32.500> mean

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
good chance I'm wrong on that but I mean

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.860 
good chance I'm wrong on that but I mean
like<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.550> thing<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.030> thing<00:03:34.060> is<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.570> yeah<00:03:34.840> I

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
like the thing the thing is is yeah I

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.870 
like the thing the thing is is yeah I
mean<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:35.440> totally<00:03:35.620> agree<00:03:35.800> with<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.370> mean<00:03:36.760> the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
mean I totally agree with you I mean the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.640 
mean I totally agree with you I mean the
thing<00:03:37.300> about<00:03:37.450> archons<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:37.990> they<00:03:38.200> actually<00:03:38.350> do

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
thing about archons is they actually do

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.570 
thing about archons is they actually do
25<00:03:39.100> damage<00:03:39.490> plus<00:03:40.150> 10<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.870> biological<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:42.040> they

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
25 damage plus 10 to biological so they

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.480 
25 damage plus 10 to biological so they
do<00:03:42.640> 35<00:03:43.270> damage<00:03:43.690> today<00:03:43.870> any<00:03:44.110> zerg<00:03:44.380> unit<00:03:44.740> and

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
do 35 damage today any zerg unit and

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.840 
do 35 damage today any zerg unit and
that's<00:03:45.670> that's<00:03:45.910> like<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.330> lot<00:03:47.100> so<00:03:48.100> they're

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
that's that's like a lot so they're

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.040 
that's that's like a lot so they're
they're<00:03:49.090> really<00:03:49.390> effective<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:49.870> now<00:03:49.930> that

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
they're really effective and now that

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.510 
they're really effective and now that
they<00:03:50.110> have<00:03:50.140> a<00:03:50.260> good<00:03:50.470> good<00:03:50.770> size<00:03:50.980> splash<00:03:51.280> damage

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
they have a good good size splash damage

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.190 
they have a good good size splash damage
I<00:03:51.790> think<00:03:51.970> there<00:03:52.120> they<00:03:52.270> might<00:03:52.450> even<00:03:52.600> be<00:03:52.840> just<00:03:53.080> as

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
I think there they might even be just as

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.290 
I think there they might even be just as
good<00:03:53.380> maybe<00:03:54.280> as<00:03:54.460> they<00:03:54.610> were<00:03:54.760> before<00:03:54.940> in

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
good maybe as they were before in

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.540 
good maybe as they were before in
starcraft<00:03:55.990> one<00:03:56.170> because<00:03:57.130> it<00:03:57.280> definitely

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
starcraft one because it definitely

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.000 
starcraft one because it definitely
wasn't<00:03:57.850> like<00:03:58.090> my<00:03:58.210> four<00:03:58.600> by<00:03:59.200> four<00:03:59.470> stalkers<00:03:59.980> and

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
wasn't like my four by four stalkers and

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.180 
wasn't like my four by four stalkers and
two<00:04:00.730> centuries<00:04:00.970> i<00:04:01.150> took<00:04:01.390> down<00:04:01.630> your<00:04:01.780> 13<00:04:02.230> mutes

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
two centuries i took down your 13 mutes

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.030 
two centuries i took down your 13 mutes
yeah<00:04:03.700> i<00:04:03.730> mean<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:04.120> was<00:04:04.240> those<00:04:04.480> yes<00:04:05.020> five<00:04:05.320> it's<00:04:05.980> a

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
different combination of the Protoss

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.670 
different combination of the Protoss
ball<00:04:07.660> essentially<00:04:08.110> is<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.200> Protoss<00:04:08.500> ball

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
ball essentially is a Protoss ball

me right now you have you have 400
minerals<00:04:31.280> worth<00:04:31.430> of<00:04:31.520> army<00:04:31.759> that's<00:04:31.879> it<00:04:32.120> yeah<00:04:32.509> um

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
minerals worth of army that's it yeah um

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.270 
minerals worth of army that's it yeah um
so<00:04:33.169> I<00:04:33.199> really<00:04:33.530> should<00:04:33.680> have<00:04:33.770> pushed<00:04:33.979> here<00:04:34.159> but

so I really should have pushed here but

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.129 
so I really should have pushed here but
like<00:04:34.430> i<00:04:34.460> like<00:04:34.940> i<00:04:35.030> have<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.300> i<00:04:35.449> still<00:04:35.690> have<00:04:35.990> not

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
like i like i have it i still have not

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.140 
like i like i have it i still have not
seen<00:04:36.470> your<00:04:36.770> third<00:04:37.099> and<00:04:37.280> i'm<00:04:37.669> thinking<00:04:38.030> maybe

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
seen your third and i'm thinking maybe

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.760 
seen your third and i'm thinking maybe
you<00:04:38.360> might<00:04:38.569> have<00:04:38.720> more<00:04:38.930> in<00:04:39.080> your<00:04:39.229> in<00:04:39.440> your<00:04:39.470> net

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
you might have more in your in your net

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.680 
you might have more in your in your net
in<00:04:39.889> your<00:04:40.039> main<00:04:40.250> building<00:04:40.669> up<00:04:40.789> to<00:04:41.150> repel<00:04:41.449> such

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
in your main building up to repel such

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.869 
in your main building up to repel such
an<00:04:41.810> attack<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.590> know<00:04:42.710> because<00:04:43.190> if<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.699> took

00:04:43.869 --> 00:04:43.879 
an attack you know because if you took

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:44.980 
an attack you know because if you took
out<00:04:44.000> my<00:04:44.150> natural<00:04:44.449> that's<00:04:44.599> what<00:04:44.690> i<00:04:44.720> would<00:04:44.870> do<00:04:44.960> I

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
out my natural that's what i would do I

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.260 
out my natural that's what i would do I
would<00:04:45.139> I<00:04:45.409> wouldn't<00:04:45.740> send<00:04:46.430> unity<00:04:46.759> that<00:04:46.970> I<00:04:47.030> would

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
would I wouldn't send unity that I would

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.879 
would I wouldn't send unity that I would
build<00:04:47.449> up<00:04:47.569> in<00:04:47.690> my<00:04:47.810> main<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.229> hopefully<00:04:48.770> be

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
build up in my main and hopefully be

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.469 
build up in my main and hopefully be
able<00:04:48.949> to<00:04:49.159> to<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.819> know<00:04:49.909> repel<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.389> attack

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
able to to you know repel the attack

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.390 
able to to you know repel the attack
when<00:04:50.840> it<00:04:50.930> comes<00:04:51.080> yeah<00:04:51.259> so<00:04:51.500> it's<00:04:51.680> a<00:04:51.740> really<00:04:51.889> on<00:04:52.159> a

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
when it comes yeah so it's a really on a

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.830 
when it comes yeah so it's a really on a
better<00:04:52.669> move<00:04:52.909> on<00:04:53.060> your<00:04:53.240> end<00:04:53.389> would<00:04:53.569> have<00:04:53.659> been

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
better move on your end would have been

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.719 
better move on your end would have been
to<00:04:54.110> even<00:04:54.530> just<00:04:54.560> push<00:04:54.830> to<00:04:55.039> just<00:04:55.220> test<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.550> water

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
to even just push to just test the water

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:56.890 
to even just push to just test the water
see<00:04:56.030> what's<00:04:56.180> happening<00:04:56.449> well<00:04:56.599> now<00:04:56.720> you<00:04:56.780> see

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
see what's happening well now you see

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:57.879 
see what's happening well now you see
what<00:04:57.080> I'm<00:04:57.199> doing<00:04:57.289> is<00:04:57.470> I'm<00:04:57.500> putting<00:04:57.740> down<00:04:57.860> my

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
what I'm doing is I'm putting down my

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.010 
what I'm doing is I'm putting down my
robotics<00:04:58.220> facility<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:59.000> my<00:04:59.240> thinking<00:04:59.719> there

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
robotics facility and my thinking there

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.330 
robotics facility and my thinking there
is<00:05:00.050> that<00:05:00.379> I'm<00:05:00.469> going<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.650> get<00:05:00.800> one<00:05:01.039> observer

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
is that I'm going to get one observer

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.950 
is that I'm going to get one observer
out<00:05:01.580> Santa<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.240> your<00:05:02.360> main<00:05:02.479> see<00:05:02.659> what<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:02.810> have

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
out Santa to your main see what you have

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.510 
out Santa to your main see what you have
and<00:05:03.110> then<00:05:03.229> if<00:05:03.349> I<00:05:03.440> can<00:05:03.650> push<00:05:03.860> out<00:05:04.009> well<00:05:04.159> plus<00:05:04.370> I'm

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
and then if I can push out well plus I'm

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.159 
and then if I can push out well plus I'm
gonna<00:05:05.030> be<00:05:05.150> producing<00:05:05.479> units<00:05:05.780> this<00:05:05.840> whole<00:05:06.020> time

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
gonna be producing units this whole time

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:07.450 
gonna be producing units this whole time
so<00:05:06.650> I'll<00:05:06.710> push<00:05:06.860> with<00:05:06.979> an<00:05:07.099> even<00:05:07.310> stronger

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
so I'll push with an even stronger

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.520 
so I'll push with an even stronger
competition<00:05:07.759> than<00:05:08.180> what<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.300> have<00:05:08.449> now<00:05:08.479> and<00:05:09.259> my

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
competition than what I have now and my

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.649 
competition than what I have now and my
other<00:05:09.680> my<00:05:10.009> other<00:05:10.490> thinking<00:05:10.789> is<00:05:10.940> now<00:05:11.240> if<00:05:11.539> you

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
other my other thinking is now if you

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.089 
other my other thinking is now if you
look<00:05:11.780> at<00:05:11.930> income<00:05:12.020> it's<00:05:12.319> starting<00:05:12.620> to<00:05:12.710> even<00:05:12.979> add

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
look at income it's starting to even add

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.559 
look at income it's starting to even add
a<00:05:13.129> little<00:05:13.280> bit<00:05:13.460> where<00:05:13.699> use<00:05:14.180> your<00:05:14.360> still

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
a little bit where use your still

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.240 
a little bit where use your still
leading<00:05:14.750> on<00:05:14.930> income<00:05:15.229> but<00:05:15.379> I'm<00:05:15.560> catching<00:05:16.190> up

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
leading on income but I'm catching up

starting to even out the army resources

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.600 
starting to even out the army resources
sting<00:05:49.819> and<00:05:50.029> and<00:05:51.159> you're<00:05:52.159> building<00:05:52.460> your

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
sting and and you're building your

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.719 
sting and and you're building your
building<00:05:52.940> your<00:05:53.060> mutes<00:05:53.270> and<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:55.370> I'm<00:05:55.460> starting

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
building your mutes and and I'm starting

building your mutes and and I'm starting
the<00:05:55.789> economy<00:05:56.240> up<00:05:56.360> but<00:05:56.539> I<00:05:56.569> think<00:05:56.870> but<00:05:57.169> at<00:05:57.319> this

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
the economy up but I think but at this

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:58.390 
the economy up but I think but at this
point<00:05:57.560> I<00:05:57.680> still<00:05:57.860> think<00:05:58.009> that<00:05:58.039> you're<00:05:58.129> getting

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
point I still think that you're getting

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.769 
point I still think that you're getting
the<00:05:58.460> advantage<00:05:58.550> here<00:05:58.940> because<00:05:59.210> in<00:05:59.389> fact<00:05:59.509> you

00:05:59.769 --> 00:05:59.779 
the advantage here because in fact you

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.600 
the advantage here because in fact you
still<00:06:00.050> have<00:06:00.289> three<00:06:00.409> bases<00:06:00.740> and<00:06:00.979> I<00:06:01.279> still<00:06:01.460> have

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
still have three bases and I still have

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.309 
still have three bases and I still have
to<00:06:01.849> and<00:06:02.029> I<00:06:02.120> think<00:06:02.270> my<00:06:02.330> mains<00:06:02.539> almost<00:06:02.810> getting

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 
to and I think my mains almost getting

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:04.420 
to and I think my mains almost getting
close<00:06:03.590> but<00:06:03.740> he's<00:06:03.860> gotta<00:06:04.009> be<00:06:04.099> getting<00:06:04.250> close<00:06:04.279> to

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430
