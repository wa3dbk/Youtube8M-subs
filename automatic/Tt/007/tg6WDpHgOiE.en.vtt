live-streaming and I'm going to explain

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.940 
live-streaming and I'm going to explain
why<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.580> actually<00:01:12.540> takes<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> lot<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.439> work<00:01:13.740> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
why it actually takes a lot of work to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.249 
why it actually takes a lot of work to
live<00:01:14.159> surfing<00:01:14.760> there's<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.420> lot<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.720> behind<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
live surfing there's a lot of behind the

of<00:01:18.930> things<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.229> could<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:19.500> wrong<00:01:19.729> I'm<00:01:20.729> pretty

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
of things that could go wrong I'm pretty

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.969 
of things that could go wrong I'm pretty
lucky<00:01:21.720> because<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.080> haven't<00:01:22.380> had<00:01:22.590> too<00:01:22.860> many

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
lucky because I haven't had too many

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.370 
lucky because I haven't had too many
glitches<00:01:23.280> happened<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.000> me<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.299> did<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> few

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
glitches happened to me I did have a few

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.649 
glitches happened to me I did have a few
live<00:01:25.650> streams<00:01:26.100> where<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.580> started<00:01:27.060> late<00:01:27.299> or

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
live streams where it started late or

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.359 
live streams where it started late or
maybe<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> middle<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:28.979> stream

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
maybe in the middle of it the stream

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.620 
maybe in the middle of it the stream
went<00:01:29.579> down<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> little<00:01:30.270> bit<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
went down for a little bit with the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.020 
went down for a little bit with the
blacks<00:01:30.930> cream<00:01:31.350> cheese<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> most

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
blacks cream cheese but for the most

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.789 
blacks cream cheese but for the most
part<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.479> never<00:01:33.689> really<00:01:33.990> had<00:01:34.200> too<00:01:34.650> many

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
part I never really had too many

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.520 
part I never really had too many
problems<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:36.570> mainly<00:01:36.960> because<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.439> my

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
problems and that's mainly because of my

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.789 
problems and that's mainly because of my
preparation<00:01:38.479> before<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.509> livestream<00:01:40.140> would

so I don't know if that's because my
internet<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.599> BC<00:02:13.200> or<00:02:13.650> if<00:02:14.250> it's<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.610> because

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
internet is BC or if it's just because

of<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.780> cons<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.349> live<00:02:43.590> streaming<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.160> isn't

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
of the cons of live streaming this isn't

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.800 
of the cons of live streaming this isn't
even<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.730> reason<00:02:45.030> why<00:02:45.209> I'm<00:02:45.420> not<00:02:45.510> going<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.750> be

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
even the reason why I'm not going to be

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.199 
even the reason why I'm not going to be
live<00:02:46.019> streaming<00:02:46.410> this<00:02:46.530> year<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.430> main<00:02:47.730> reason

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
live streaming this year the main reason

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.580 
live streaming this year the main reason
why<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.360> don't<00:02:48.450> think<00:02:48.630> our<00:02:48.810> live<00:02:49.110> stream<00:02:49.440> is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
why I don't think our live stream is

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.059 
why I don't think our live stream is
because<00:02:50.069> of<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.340> spoilers<00:02:51.470> now<00:02:52.470> if<00:02:52.709> I'm<00:02:52.860> just

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
because of the spoilers now if I'm just

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.390 
because of the spoilers now if I'm just
playing<00:02:53.370> an<00:02:53.549> online<00:02:53.700> game<00:02:54.090> mode<00:02:54.950> if<00:02:55.950> I'm<00:02:56.160> just

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
playing an online game mode if I'm just

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.069 
playing an online game mode if I'm just
playing<00:02:56.610> maybe<00:02:56.790> some<00:02:57.060> regular-season<00:02:57.660> games

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
playing maybe some regular-season games

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.199 
playing maybe some regular-season games
of<00:02:58.319> my<00:02:58.470> career<00:02:58.799> I<00:02:59.010> might<00:02:59.310> live<00:02:59.579> stream<00:02:59.970> back

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
of my career I might live stream back

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.300 
of my career I might live stream back
but<00:03:00.810> live<00:03:01.049> stream<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> playoffs

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
but live stream in the playoffs

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.430 
but live stream in the playoffs
was<00:03:02.670> actually<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:03.090> mistake<00:03:03.329> last<00:03:03.959> year<00:03:04.230> because

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
was actually a mistake last year because

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.220 
was actually a mistake last year because
of<00:03:04.500> all<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.890> spoilers<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> good<00:03:06.450> example<00:03:06.599> is

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
of all the spoilers so a good example is

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.250 
of all the spoilers so a good example is
the<00:03:08.129> Los<00:03:08.370> Angeles<00:03:08.849> Laker<00:03:09.120> series<00:03:09.660> in<00:03:09.870> the

semifinals that series was really

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.770 
semifinals that series was really
entertaining<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.010> went<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.280> seven<00:03:14.639> games<00:03:14.850> but

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780

to manually approve each comment but the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.170 
to manually approve each comment but the
problem<00:03:49.919> is<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.190> these<00:03:50.400> videos<00:03:50.880> are<00:03:51.060> getting

the<00:06:00.759> current<00:06:01.120> gen<00:06:01.300> version<00:06:01.689> of<00:06:01.810> 2k<00:06:02.169> 14<00:06:02.469> are

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
the current gen version of 2k 14 are

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.010 
the current gen version of 2k 14 are
basically<00:06:03.219> just<00:06:03.520> practicing<00:06:04.120> getting<00:06:04.659> used

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
basically just practicing getting used

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.320 
basically just practicing getting used
to<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.289> game<00:06:05.469> the<00:06:05.740> controls<00:06:06.089> getting<00:06:07.089> ready

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
to the game the controls getting ready

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.779 
to the game the controls getting ready
for<00:06:07.509> the<00:06:07.659> next-gen<00:06:08.319> I'm<00:06:08.620> hoping<00:06:09.550> that<00:06:09.669> the

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
for the next-gen I'm hoping that the

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.820 
for the next-gen I'm hoping that the
next-gen<00:06:10.210> is<00:06:10.330> better<00:06:10.539> because<00:06:11.319> the<00:06:11.620> gameplay

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
next-gen is better because the gameplay

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.800 
next-gen is better because the gameplay
is<00:06:12.129> really<00:06:12.250> annoying<00:06:13.000> in<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.270> current<00:06:13.599> gen

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
is really annoying in the current gen

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.409 
is really annoying in the current gen
all<00:06:14.500> of<00:06:14.949> the<00:06:15.069> sagging<00:06:15.580> that<00:06:15.729> the<00:06:15.849> defense<00:06:16.240> is

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
all of the sagging that the defense is

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.929 
all of the sagging that the defense is
doing<00:06:16.649> and<00:06:17.649> a<00:06:17.800> lot<00:06:17.830> of<00:06:18.039> it<00:06:18.279> doesn't<00:06:18.460> even<00:06:18.669> make

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:18.939 
doing and a lot of it doesn't even make

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:21.179 
doing and a lot of it doesn't even make
sense<00:06:19.000> if<00:06:19.449> I<00:06:19.569> actually<00:06:19.750> make<00:06:20.199> a<00:06:20.229> video<00:06:20.469> on<00:06:20.830> this

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:21.189 
sense if I actually make a video on this

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.579 
sense if I actually make a video on this
loose<00:06:21.490> sagging<00:06:21.819> defense<00:06:22.389> it's<00:06:23.169> going<00:06:23.379> to<00:06:23.439> look

00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:23.589 
loose sagging defense it's going to look

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:24.990 
loose sagging defense it's going to look
ridiculous<00:06:24.009> there<00:06:24.250> was<00:06:24.370> actually<00:06:24.669> a<00:06:24.699> clip

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
ridiculous there was actually a clip

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.389 
ridiculous there was actually a clip
like<00:06:25.149> that<00:06:25.360> in<00:06:25.599> this<00:06:25.870> game<00:06:25.930> that<00:06:26.889> I<00:06:26.919> would<00:06:27.159> use

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:27.399 
like that in this game that I would use

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.339 
like that in this game that I would use
in<00:06:27.729> that<00:06:27.759> video<00:06:28.089> if<00:06:28.360> I<00:06:28.449> do<00:06:28.509> decide<00:06:28.779> to<00:06:29.139> make<00:06:29.319> it

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
in that video if I do decide to make it

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.499 
in that video if I do decide to make it
and<00:06:29.680> then<00:06:30.190> your<00:06:30.430> teammates<00:06:30.909> are<00:06:31.089> still<00:06:31.330> doing

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
and then your teammates are still doing

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.899 
and then your teammates are still doing
a<00:06:31.690> bad<00:06:31.899> job<00:06:31.930> of<00:06:32.440> maintaining<00:06:32.680> spacing<00:06:33.550> they've

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909 
a bad job of maintaining spacing they've

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:35.150 
a bad job of maintaining spacing they've
always<00:06:34.120> done<00:06:34.389> that<00:06:34.509> in<00:06:34.659> 2k

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
always done that in 2k

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.710 
always done that in 2k
now<00:06:35.310> that<00:06:35.520> the<00:06:35.640> defense<00:06:35.970> is<00:06:36.090> always<00:06:36.240> sagging

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
now that the defense is always sagging

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.390 
now that the defense is always sagging
in<00:06:36.810> the<00:06:36.900> paint<00:06:37.140> it's<00:06:37.530> like<00:06:37.740> okay<00:06:38.070> you<00:06:38.130> got<00:06:38.370> a

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
in the paint it's like okay you got a

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.100 
in the paint it's like okay you got a
slide<00:06:38.790> over<00:06:39.210> because<00:06:39.420> then<00:06:39.510> I<00:06:39.600> can<00:06:39.780> make<00:06:39.960> the

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
slide over because then I can make the

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.980 
slide over because then I can make the
pass<00:06:40.350> to<00:06:40.620> you<00:06:40.860> and<00:06:41.250> then<00:06:41.970> the<00:06:42.150> jump<00:06:42.540> shooting

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
pass to you and then the jump shooting

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.130 
pass to you and then the jump shooting
in<00:06:43.170> my<00:06:43.380> career<00:06:43.830> is<00:06:43.950> bad<00:06:44.220> I<00:06:44.570> make<00:06:45.570> more<00:06:45.780> shots

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
in my career is bad I make more shots

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.660 
in my career is bad I make more shots
with<00:06:46.380> the<00:06:46.470> defense<00:06:46.890> right<00:06:47.160> there

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
with the defense right there

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.910 
with the defense right there
then<00:06:47.970> when<00:06:48.150> I'm<00:06:48.270> open<00:06:48.690> which<00:06:48.870> is<00:06:49.050> very<00:06:49.500> strange

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 
then when I'm open which is very strange

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.110 
then when I'm open which is very strange
I<00:06:50.190> don't<00:06:50.340> know<00:06:50.430> if<00:06:50.520> that's<00:06:50.670> gonna<00:06:50.820> change

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
I don't know if that's gonna change

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.750 
I don't know if that's gonna change
maybe<00:06:51.540> as<00:06:51.720> out<00:06:51.900> grade<00:06:52.230> my<00:06:52.380> attributes<00:06:52.920> I<00:06:53.160> don't

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
maybe as out grade my attributes I don't

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.940 
maybe as out grade my attributes I don't
know<00:06:53.910> but<00:06:54.510> the<00:06:54.630> spacing<00:06:55.140> in<00:06:55.260> my<00:06:55.410> career<00:06:55.800> is

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
know but the spacing in my career is

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.060 
know but the spacing in my career is
really<00:06:56.190> annoying<00:06:56.640> it<00:06:57.060> really<00:06:57.420> makes<00:06:57.660> the<00:06:57.840> game

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
really annoying it really makes the game

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.190 
really annoying it really makes the game
not<00:06:59.070> fun<00:06:59.400> to<00:06:59.610> play<00:06:59.820> because<00:07:00.510> when<00:07:00.840> I<00:07:00.930> run<00:07:01.170> a

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200 
not fun to play because when I run a

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.830 
not fun to play because when I run a
pick-and-roll<00:07:01.650> a<00:07:02.100> lot<00:07:02.970> of<00:07:03.090> my<00:07:03.240> pick<00:07:03.480> and<00:07:03.630> rolls

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
pick-and-roll a lot of my pick and rolls

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.690 
pick-and-roll a lot of my pick and rolls
I<00:07:04.020> can't<00:07:04.410> even<00:07:04.530> take<00:07:04.860> a<00:07:04.890> step<00:07:05.310> in<00:07:05.490> any

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:05.700 
I can't even take a step in any

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.910 
I can't even take a step in any
direction<00:07:05.990> because<00:07:06.990> it's<00:07:07.140> already<00:07:07.350> clogged

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920 
direction because it's already clogged

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.440 
direction because it's already clogged
because<00:07:08.190> my<00:07:08.460> teammates<00:07:08.850> don't<00:07:09.000> want<00:07:09.210> to<00:07:09.300> move

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
because my teammates don't want to move

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.890 
because my teammates don't want to move
out<00:07:09.690> of<00:07:09.750> the<00:07:09.960> way<00:07:10.940> so<00:07:11.940> I'm<00:07:12.180> not<00:07:12.300> really<00:07:12.630> feeling

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
out of the way so I'm not really feeling

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.330 
out of the way so I'm not really feeling
the<00:07:12.990> current-gen<00:07:13.470> that's<00:07:13.680> why<00:07:13.800> I'm<00:07:13.920> basically

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
the current-gen that's why I'm basically

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.950 
the current-gen that's why I'm basically
just<00:07:14.430> waiting<00:07:14.640> and<00:07:15.060> practicing<00:07:15.600> for<00:07:15.630> the

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
just waiting and practicing for the

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.130 
just waiting and practicing for the
next-gen<00:07:16.350> diversion<00:07:16.770> but<00:07:17.250> you<00:07:17.400> see<00:07:17.550> I<00:07:17.580> earn

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
next-gen diversion but you see I earn

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.320 
next-gen diversion but you see I earn
666<00:07:19.140> VC<00:07:19.620> but<00:07:20.100> after<00:07:20.520> the<00:07:20.640> game<00:07:20.850> you<00:07:21.030> see<00:07:21.060> I'm

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.870 
666 VC but after the game you see I'm
not<00:07:21.480> going<00:07:21.660> to<00:07:21.720> get<00:07:22.040> 666<00:07:23.040> BC<00:07:23.460> I<00:07:23.670> only<00:07:24.180> have<00:07:24.800> 344

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.880 
not going to get 666 BC I only have 344

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.010 
not going to get 666 BC I only have 344
so<00:07:26.880> I<00:07:26.910> don't<00:07:27.180> know<00:07:27.240> what<00:07:27.480> happened<00:07:27.840> there<00:07:27.960> I

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
so I don't know what happened there I

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.410 
so I don't know what happened there I
got<00:07:28.350> hit<00:07:28.590> with<00:07:28.620> the<00:07:28.920> cheese<00:07:29.250> we<00:07:29.880> won<00:07:30.120> this<00:07:30.300> game

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:30.420 
got hit with the cheese we won this game

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.180 
got hit with the cheese we won this game
the<00:07:30.750> first<00:07:30.900> time<00:07:31.230> we<00:07:31.380> played<00:07:31.560> it<00:07:31.800> but<00:07:31.950> it<00:07:32.070> had

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.190 
the first time we played it but it had

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.980 
the first time we played it but it had
to<00:07:32.340> be<00:07:32.370> replayed<00:07:33.030> because<00:07:33.360> the<00:07:33.450> server<00:07:33.690> went

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
to be replayed because the server went

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.230 
to be replayed because the server went
down<00:07:34.020> so<00:07:34.380> now<00:07:34.500> we<00:07:34.560> lost<00:07:35.010> the<00:07:35.280> game<00:07:35.460> I<00:07:35.790> didn't

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240
