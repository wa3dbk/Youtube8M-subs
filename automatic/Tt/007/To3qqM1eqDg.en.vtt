00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
happens is normally and you know that's

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.479 
happens is normally and you know that's
the<00:02:10.170> part<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.500> pisses<00:02:10.709> me<00:02:11.039> off<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.430> just

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
the part that pisses me off like just

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.300 
the part that pisses me off like just
then<00:02:11.910> backing<00:02:12.150> out<00:02:12.480> like

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
then backing out like

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.860 
then backing out like
if<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.550> go<00:02:13.700> 5<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.120> 0<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.360> first<00:02:14.569> round<00:02:14.720> I

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
if I go 5 and 0 in the first round I

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.809 
if I go 5 and 0 in the first round I
guess<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.440> can<00:02:15.620> be<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.739> game<00:02:15.920> play<00:02:16.099> they<00:02:16.670> just
