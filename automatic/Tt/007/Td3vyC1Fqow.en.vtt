00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
they were that dangerous I do think that

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.200 
they were that dangerous I do think that
we<00:05:43.920> we<00:05:44.250> got<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.460> little<00:05:44.640> bit<00:05:44.850> too<00:05:45.000> comfortable

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
we we got a little bit too comfortable

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.200 
we we got a little bit too comfortable
there<00:05:46.160> and<00:05:47.160> thought<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.640> maybe<00:05:47.700> it<00:05:48.030> was

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
there and thought that maybe it was

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.450 
there and thought that maybe it was
going<00:05:48.390> to<00:05:48.450> be<00:05:48.540> easy<00:05:48.860> we've<00:05:49.860> seen<00:05:50.040> it<00:05:50.220> in<00:05:50.310> our

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
going to be easy we've seen it in our

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.130 
going to be easy we've seen it in our
league<00:05:50.640> before<00:05:50.880> where<00:05:51.300> we've<00:05:51.450> got<00:05:51.660> to<00:05:51.900> a<00:05:51.930> two

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
league before where we've got to a two

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.370 
league before where we've got to a two
goal<00:05:52.320> lead<00:05:52.380> and<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.370> other<00:05:53.520> team<00:05:53.760> quits

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
goal lead and the other team quits

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.630 
goal lead and the other team quits
obviously<00:05:55.380> there's<00:05:55.590> no<00:05:55.740> point<00:05:56.010> in<00:05:56.100> physical

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
obviously there's no point in physical

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.240 
obviously there's no point in physical
it<00:05:57.150> almost<00:05:57.360> feels<00:05:57.630> like<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:58.140> game<00:05:58.560> was<00:05:58.770> real<00:05:59.070> I

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
it almost feels like the game was real I

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.220 
it almost feels like the game was real I
mean<00:05:59.550> especially<00:06:00.000> the<00:06:00.360> last<00:06:00.510> 10<00:06:00.810> minutes<00:06:00.840> and

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
mean especially the last 10 minutes and

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.370 
mean especially the last 10 minutes and
it's<00:06:01.380> just<00:06:01.790> unbelievable<00:06:02.790> and<00:06:03.300> it's<00:06:03.810> a<00:06:04.020> sour

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
it's just unbelievable and it's a sour

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.230 
it's just unbelievable and it's a sour
taste<00:06:04.500> aren't<00:06:04.830> off<00:06:05.070> for<00:06:05.280> sure<00:06:05.310> to<00:06:05.820> lose<00:06:06.210> that

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240
