00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.029
 vitamin c media is presented and that free radicals 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.910
 we are going to need 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.739
 the tablets should be produced at the end 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:27.109
 the entry of tablets 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.050
 I will go in 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.710
 a hectic 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.710
 a container with water 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 Let's make the glass with water a little paint of it 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.140
 marin 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.420
 from the cited walkway 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.950
 watch how the water looks like brown 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.880
 what would represent the actors that oxidize and damage the cells diaadia 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.030
 as those caused by pollution 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.249
 in each center 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:57.700
 stress free radicals among others 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.700
 now we are going to submerge the aguacuentos panel 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.500
 we see how it runs off is the covenant 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.710
 mca hour let's pulverize the two bioshock tablets 2 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 we will achieve salvation 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.650
 look how the water completely changed color 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.260
 and let's see how little by little he goes back to his parents 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.460
 that is the effect of vitamin C although the accident was presented to the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.530
 presidency 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.130
 million pesos for sale 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.060
 there is born is not enough 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.939
 and that plus is a good option to complement the daily intake of this 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.320
 important vitamin 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.090
 before the excessive concentration in the hotel ahc of cherries teror 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
 one of the richest natural sources of vitamin c 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.320

 foam they wanted under stress because they want to protect their cells 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 include daily to three days of the end 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.080
 With this simple demonstration we can observe the antioxidant effect of 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.199
 Vitamin C must have been 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.199
