00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.069
 here is the tool we decided to put 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.040
 in place so that comes in form 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.629
 of binder with different cards that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.850
 will allow to take charge 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.890
 the child and his family deaf or 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.210
 hearing-impaired from his arrival at 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.210
 emergencies until his departure 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.629
 in a little over a year and a couple 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.089
 smiled explained at a 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.739
 consultation that they had waited two 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.300
 hours in waiting rooms because 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.440
 they did not know that they had to first 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.390
 to register 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.250
 so I discussed it with one of my 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.309
 colleagues who proposed it to create a 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.769
 tool to facilitate the reception of 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.040
 people are overloaded 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:09.409
 that's what it is or not his left 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.270
 serves but it does not hurt my sources 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.549
 are minorities and about 10 passages 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.860
 per year in emergencies currently 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.360
 but we are already at eight passages 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.799
 know that those conceded by year that are 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.420
 source is not always obvious to 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.040
 the child to be the translator of his 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.930
 parents while he is there as 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.220
 patient that's why we decided to 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.350
 set up something in order to 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.020
 take charge of the child and his family 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.520
 deaf or hard of hearing 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.990
 to emergencies until it goes out if I 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.060
 did not want to stay in the center too much 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.560
 because around me I was 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.210
 a thing I learned so ago 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.430
 several years sign language 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.560
 I wanted to spend time 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.240
 rightly welcome people are 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.880
 imposed on opportunities to facilitate them 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.680
 access I manage to flap yes so much 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.690
 that all we will look at if we have 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.450
 things to edit 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.399
 so if in France it's ok we have 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.070
 decided to do a binder with 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.360
 different cards and to know that 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.700
 so sign language is a language 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.610
 visual so we worked on a lot 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.860
 cards with pictures and sentences 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.450
 who have been also working and adapted 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.209
 to deaf people and their level 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.709
 understanding the difficulty who who 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.080
 showed up his more power 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.480
 adapt our sentences to people 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.800
 deaf their level of understanding is 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.780
 different from ours 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.970
 the syntax is different from ours 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.700
 I added the image for infusion 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.700
 as we had seen in premiere I 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.110
 modified also it confesses I'll tell you what 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.180
 that your doctor has made you 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.800
 an order for a deaf person 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.480
 we marked your doctor did 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.830
 a letter for us it's a sentence 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.830
 which is more understandable to you 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.280
 so we made the choice of 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.670
 ask deaf people their 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.220
 notice because given that for them 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.849
 French is reading it is enough 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.730
 difficult 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.519
 I wanted to know if what the words 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.370
 that we used 6 and is suitable for them 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.620
 or not such as for example when we have 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.950
 make the record at the surgery level 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.459
 we ask if the injury comes from a 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.739
 fall 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.349
 and when I took each 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.599
 individually to ask them 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.819
 what is it for you to applaud the 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.480
 machu and when they have him all have me 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.480
 fall 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:41.139
 this is useful for writing a 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:44.859
 French was told on Monday if you 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.400
 do not use more fashion hype we have a lot 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.079
 of sentences 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.739
 so it would be too long signed the 2 in 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.079
 lsf 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.620
 the structure is latent tax is 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.620
 different 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.500
 it's very important that it's a 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.730
 childcare assistant and an ice cream 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.260
 age that is 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.319
 carry the project because these soaps 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.269
 that the whole team and 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.239
 is involved in the improvement 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.039
 patient reception 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.300
 this project we presented it to 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.389
 night teams to day teams 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.949
 medical paramedic in April so he has 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.750
 been set up in April 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.130
 we are still experimenting 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.320
 still since we have not had yet 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.789
 many families with whom 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.530
 we could use it anyway 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:39.130
 some feedback from families 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.960
 concerned is good we hope in six 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.349
 month is still able to make a 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.349
 first evaluation
