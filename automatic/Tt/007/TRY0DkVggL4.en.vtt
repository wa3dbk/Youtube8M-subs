00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.340
 here we are guys in sardinia a 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.340
 present the new 2014 ktm range 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.679
 proc also here we have two and a half with 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.380
 a new engine much more substantial in the 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.640
 central part of the 3 and a half that I earn 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.919
 still a bit of horses and it becomes 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.759
 truly an incredible absurd thing 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.769
 to drive 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.660
 as handy as it is powerful 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.870
 we have the reggina 450 that anyway 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.339
 you always have to give her 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.019
 in these two days of trial we have 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.510
 also had the very big fortune of 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:45.500
 have the official ktm pilots here then 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:49.519
 the great tonino jeffrey herlings and 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.960
 take air that delighted us with gods 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.850
 track laps they showed us 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.339
 really what these bikes can do 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.829
 and how much these bikes actually are 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:02.719
 ready to race because you really don't 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.699
 he could almost see the difference 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.619
 beyond what is the graphic aspect for 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.810
 understand if they were on their bikes by 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.100
 race or you were on these bikes just 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.100
 baked from the factory 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.900
 difficult as it may seem 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.390
 however, also in 2014 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.310
 we had another evolutionary step of 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.410
 these bikes already very performing 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.150
 small details that still end 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.650
 at the fair year over year they do the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.510
 difference and carry this bike 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.890
 really at the top of the performance e 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.480
 especially ready to be used like this 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.220
 out of the dealership this 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.470
 spirit that has always distinguished 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.920
 these bikes always make them easier 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.950
 to use more usable and at the end 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.090
 of the fair also less expensive because at the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.740
 beyond what could be one 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.210
 personalization that one wants to do for 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.800
 really these deaths services can 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.470
 exploit myths as they are all 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.410
 induce this year take the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.729
 superstructures of the cross models and all 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.810
 the updates of detail that 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.610
 derive a little from the world prof 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.960
 look absolutely what place 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.960
 best to try this too 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.050
 beautiful new jewel of the house ktm la 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.790
 sixth ace sestese model even in 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.220
 honor of the season that will be there 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.990
 this year in late September in Sardinia 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.490
 then the asystel with colors not only 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.860
 Italians, but the Sardinian is the 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.390
 highest performing motorcycle newest in 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.940
 absolute is absolutely 2 and a half 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.250
 four times that takes a new shape 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.590
 completely born from the project between e 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.590
 medium where a head is positioned 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.020
 and a cylinder affixed to it from this 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.010
 absolutely more power comes more 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.170
 body in the lower part 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.650
 of delivery the other bikes take 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.570
 they too have many details including the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.310
 new front brake caliper that 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.230
 becomes the twin sister of the party 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.330
 of the clutch one to give a look a 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.100
 a little bit more homogeneous to the moto2 too 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.290
 to give much more modulation to 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.800
 braking that for ktm always been a lot 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.390
 powerful 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.020
 however also in some cases enough 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:11.940
 his is aggressive 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.830
 radiator frame suspension and installation 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.320
 exhaust as new this year 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.290
 they are produced by v p then it seems 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.680
 an internal company ktm but with a new one 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.680
 brand 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.510
 thanks to all from moto.it and see you 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.510
 the next ready
