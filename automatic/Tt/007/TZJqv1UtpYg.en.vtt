clumps<00:00:08.490> at<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> time<00:00:09.110> makes<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.320> lot<00:00:10.440> easier

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
clumps at a time makes it a lot easier

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.470 
clumps at a time makes it a lot easier
to<00:00:10.980> manage<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.460> if<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.670> tried<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:11.940> take<00:00:12.059> too

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
to manage it if you tried to take too

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.730 
to manage it if you tried to take too
large<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.139> amount<00:00:13.469> at<00:00:13.740> once<00:00:14.150> it's<00:00:15.379> just<00:00:16.379> it's

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
large and amount at once it's just it's

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.480 
large and amount at once it's just it's
too<00:00:16.980> difficult<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.779> bunches<00:00:18.779> up<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.350> gets<00:00:20.310> in

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
too difficult it bunches up and gets in

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.349 
too difficult it bunches up and gets in
the<00:00:20.609> way<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:21.420> push<00:00:22.490> extra<00:00:23.490> stuffing<00:00:24.029> into

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the way you can push extra stuffing into

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.400 
the way you can push extra stuffing into
this<00:00:24.750> area<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:28.320> idea<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.039> end

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
this area here and the idea is to end

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.780 
this area here and the idea is to end
stuffing<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.920> immediate<00:00:32.130> area<00:00:32.730> around

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
stuffing just the immediate area around

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.840 
stuffing just the immediate area around
the<00:00:33.329> hole<00:00:33.770> that's<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.920> little<00:00:35.100> too<00:00:35.340> much<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.760> I'm

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the hole that's a little too much so I'm

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.910 
the hole that's a little too much so I'm
gonna<00:00:35.969> take<00:00:36.450> some<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:38.420> pushing<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:42.920> the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
gonna take some out pushing that and the

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.160 
gonna take some out pushing that and the
way<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.129> stuff<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.820> important<00:00:45.420> because<00:00:45.629> if

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
way you stuff it is important because if

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.119 
way you stuff it is important because if
you<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:47.190> start<00:00:47.309> jamming<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.829> stuffing<00:00:49.829> into

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
you just start jamming the stuffing into

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.619 
you just start jamming the stuffing into
the<00:00:50.899> stuffed<00:00:51.899> animal<00:00:52.610> without<00:00:53.610> doing<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the stuffed animal without doing the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.840 
the stuffed animal without doing the
legs<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> head<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.100> tail<00:00:56.340> first

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
legs and the head and the tail first

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.979 
legs and the head and the tail first
you'll<00:00:57.750> end<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.440> really<00:00:58.649> flat<00:00:59.219> floppy

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
you'll end up with really flat floppy

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.700 
you'll end up with really flat floppy
legs<00:01:00.989> tail<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.890> head<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.840> in<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.019> tight<00:01:04.350> body

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
legs tail and head and in a tight body

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.789 
legs tail and head and in a tight body
so<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.729> way<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> head<00:01:06.869> first<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
so this way if we do the head first and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.270 
so this way if we do the head first and
then<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.670> legs<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.810> tail<00:01:10.049> then<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.070> end

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
then the legs and the tail then we end

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.890

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.850 

might<00:02:04.270> be<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.479> little<00:02:04.930> bit<00:02:05.110> harder<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.530> do<00:02:05.830> that

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
might be a little bit harder to do that

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.330 
might be a little bit harder to do that
really<00:02:06.310> but<00:02:07.119> if<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.020> stuffing<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.740> hanging

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.520 
really but if the stuffing is hanging
out<00:02:09.490> and<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.149> want<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.810> can<00:02:10.990> just<00:02:11.200> push<00:02:11.500> it

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
out and you want you can just push it

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.630 
out and you want you can just push it
push<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:11.950> in<00:02:12.280> there<00:02:12.459> tight<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.709> then<00:02:14.709> after

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
push it in there tight and then after

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.050 
push it in there tight and then after
you<00:02:15.760> finish<00:02:15.790> stitching<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.280> squeeze<00:02:18.790> and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
you finish stitching you can squeeze and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.110 
you finish stitching you can squeeze and
shift<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:20.709> stuffing<00:02:21.220> around<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.700> little<00:02:21.970> bit

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
shift the stuffing around a little bit

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.729 
shift the stuffing around a little bit
in<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.450> body<00:02:22.690> section<00:02:24.989> but<00:02:25.989> clear<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.440> away

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
in the body section but clear it away

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:37.559 
in the body section but clear it away
from<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.160> opening<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.239> can<00:02:28.480> work<00:02:28.690> easily

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.069 

okay<00:02:38.530> now<00:02:39.069> we're<00:02:39.670> pretty<00:02:40.120> tight

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
okay now we're pretty tight

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.729 
okay now we're pretty tight
to<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:41.950> end<00:02:42.129> here<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.349> we're<00:02:44.349> not<00:02:44.530> going<00:02:44.709> to

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
to the end here and we're not going to

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.920 
to the end here and we're not going to
knot<00:02:45.069> it<00:02:45.099> on<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.730> inside<00:02:46.180> because<00:02:46.569> we<00:02:46.599> can't

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
knot it on the inside because we can't

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.559 
knot it on the inside because we can't
