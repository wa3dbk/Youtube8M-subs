00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
almost like I've moved to gang in and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.810 
almost like I've moved to gang in and
they're<00:01:31.850> picking<00:01:32.180> on<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.660> big<00:01:32.870> ones<00:01:33.140> I<00:01:33.820> really

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
they're picking on the big ones I really

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.220 
they're picking on the big ones I really
thought<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.180> big<00:01:35.330> ones<00:01:35.540> were<00:01:35.720> gonna<00:01:35.840> eat<00:01:36.080> the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
thought the big ones were gonna eat the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.560 
thought the big ones were gonna eat the
little<00:01:36.380> ones<00:01:36.680> but<00:01:37.070> like<00:01:37.970> see<00:01:38.180> they're<00:01:38.330> just

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
little ones but like see they're just

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.890 
little ones but like see they're just
following<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.170> big<00:01:39.350> ones<00:01:39.560> around<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:40.900> don't

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
following the big ones around I don't

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.810 
following the big ones around I don't
think<00:01:42.260> I've<00:01:42.380> seemed<00:01:42.650> to<00:01:42.770> be<00:01:42.920> aggressive<00:01:43.670> with

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
think I've seemed to be aggressive with

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:53.910 
think I've seemed to be aggressive with
each<00:01:43.880> other<00:01:44.240> yet<00:01:45.280> notice<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.370> say<00:01:46.580> yet

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.160 

there's<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.880> babies<00:01:55.360> they're<00:01:55.600> not<00:01:55.780> eating

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
there's the babies they're not eating

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.340 
there's the babies they're not eating
the<00:01:56.290> autos<00:01:56.620> either<00:01:57.480> so<00:01:58.480> all<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.780> people<00:01:59.260> at

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
the autos either so all you people at

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.950 
the autos either so all you people at
think<00:01:59.680> that<00:01:59.950> more<00:02:00.850> puffers<00:02:01.420> could<00:02:01.660> not<00:02:01.780> be

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
think that more puffers could not be

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.530 
think that more puffers could not be
with<00:02:02.110> autos<00:02:02.790> looking<00:02:03.790> on<00:02:03.880> one's<00:02:04.060> freaking<00:02:04.420> out

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
with autos looking on one's freaking out

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.940 
with autos looking on one's freaking out
right<00:02:04.570> in<00:02:04.780> front<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.110> them<00:02:05.260> they're<00:02:05.710> not<00:02:05.890> doing

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
right in front of them they're not doing

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.140

anything about it

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.270 
anything about it
they<00:02:07.300> don't<00:02:07.480> care<00:02:10.170> why<00:02:11.170> did<00:02:11.380> that<00:02:11.500> plant<00:02:11.890> there

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
they don't care why did that plant there

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.400
