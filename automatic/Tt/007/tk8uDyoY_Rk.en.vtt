00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.080
 he did not imagine favorable booms 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.340
 befera I was very impressed of 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.730
 have ds these services on television 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.890
 in which a Neapolitan pizza maker to whom e 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.680
 he wondered why he uses flour and himself 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.839
 the flour answered , not as if it were there 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.769
 one flour for him was the flour 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:46.710
 00 flour and for many of us too 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:49.620
 actually that's when we go to 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.600
 make a sweet we want at home we want 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.920
 make pasta at home we go to buy 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.710
 flour 00 flour 00 and a strange 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.570
 what is man has never eaten one 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.949
 rome so in the sense that when you do 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.600
 he imagined the stone grain that is up to 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.610
 60 70 years ago it is a common thing 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.440
 imaginary grains jumper stones of the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.000
 last century that mills appeared 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.130
 steel with which they can be made 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.990
 fine flour and then 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.600
 sifting them, sifting them, you arrive 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.530
 to the so-called 00 flour the 00 flour 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.509
 represents a huge advantage for per 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.479
 for the trade and for the big one 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.090
 distribution because it has great advantage 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.119
 the 00 flour that was removed every 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.050
 the vital element to the bran is the germ 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.450
 of wheat 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.560
 I miss only the starches and some 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.630
 gluten is a bit of wheat protein in 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.780
 blatant advantage that never goes to 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.000
 badly here you can keep the 00 flour there 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.739
 for ten years for twenty years we go 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.259
 always good if the mice do n't go and 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:55.530
 pissing on it is always something 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.610
 good good good that is the sense that not 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.989
 it went wrong while you though 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.379
 take a flour made from wheat 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:07.500
 ground after a few weeks you 

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:09.539
 you realize that what the anci says a 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.110
 little bit no and after six months ago 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.879
 butterflies but no butterflies would be 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.590
 so stupid to go and put her own 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:22.400
 eggs in flour 00 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.800
 00 flour has become a common use 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.989
 habitual use 00 flour and flour 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.480
 zero is that they are very similar as 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:34.390
 however, composition is a factor 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.819
 very harmful to our diet 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.180
 in the very harmful factor why this 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:46.880
 yes extreme improvement of the grain of 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:49.489
 wheat causes these hamids to be 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.670
 much more easily attacked by 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.290
 our digestive enzymes if you want you can 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.440
 say that they are even more easily 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.989
 not digestible but this is not an advantage 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.209
 they are so easily digestible that 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.400
 free you know the starches are gods 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.500
 We are polymers of glucose polymers 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.190
 of by tens and thousands of thousands of 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.530
 billions of glucose molecules yes 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.150
 twist in the in the particles 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.950
 very small and very easily into 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.569
 gb so they raise the blood sugar a lot 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.730
 quickly but if the blood sugar level rises 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.530
 very quickly also of insulins the 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.850
 punk quickly produces this insulin 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.100
 brings a whole series of consequences 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.150
 metabolic substances that can be harmful 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.950
 for our health 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.200
 naturally favors you have it for 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.090
 example but blood sugar favors it 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.870
 also that filippo of tumors and therefore 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:43.040
 it would be good to move towards delle 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.989
 flours not so intensely refined 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.250
 like the ones proposed by the industry 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.410
 today unfortunately in normal supermarkets 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.630
 It is sometimes the flour 00 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.790
 flour 0 and then the flour is found 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.410
 integral you can make a dessert with the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.750
 whole wheat flour that is also good 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.640
 however it is not very fine for which it would be worth 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.980
 the penalty then to take the finances 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.040
 grail and sift it at home to remove 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.710
 the coarse bran, but it would be good 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.920
 that the supermarkets 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:17.080
 they also kept the sifted flour 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.940
 something that now some are starting to do 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.800
 the flour is called type 1 flour 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.240
 the type 2 flour I use for 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.610
 example to make desserts when there 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.970
 I want to do still refined contain 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.060
 even at least part of the rich substances 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.430
 that there are in the germ a little bit of 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.170
 fibers a little bit more than fiber la 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.210
 the most component protects us are the 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.460
 cereal fibers the substances they are 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.350
 associated fibers and substances there 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.830
 in the germ are all things that have been 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:48.880
 removed from the 00 flour 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.700
 personally I like it a lot 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.220
 make me bread and make pizza or make me 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.890
 piadine the so-called chapati we chapati 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.720
 in oriental culture and very often a 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.520
 I imagine my breakfast machine 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:06.250
 wheat chapatis for them and if the wheat and 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.530
 freshly ground and grinded by a few 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.720
 minutes when you make your bread the 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.910
 your chapati you notice the 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.100
 difference it takes me about five minutes 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.280
 to grind a little bit of grain for 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.840
 wash a hand to make me the 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.790
 morning breakfast and taste is 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.030
 really 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.030
 try to believe
