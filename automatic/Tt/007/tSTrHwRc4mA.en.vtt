00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
hope that doesn't it was for Paul there

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.610 
hope that doesn't it was for Paul there
is<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.420> bit<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.630> an<00:01:59.780> extra<00:02:00.020> consideration

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
is a bit of an extra consideration

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.480 
is a bit of an extra consideration
because<00:02:02.409> he<00:02:03.409> paddles<00:02:03.740> with<00:02:03.830> his<00:02:03.950> left<00:02:04.159> arm<00:02:04.370> but

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
because he paddles with his left arm but

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.680 
because he paddles with his left arm but
he<00:02:04.550> also<00:02:04.670> needs<00:02:04.909> to<00:02:05.000> be<00:02:05.090> able<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.300> hold<00:02:05.390> on<00:02:05.570> with

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
he also needs to be able to hold on with

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.350 
that's what so the this discern river
trip<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.680> just<00:04:16.709> an<00:04:17.010> extension

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.990
