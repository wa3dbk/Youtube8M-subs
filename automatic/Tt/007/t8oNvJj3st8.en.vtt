actually<00:03:03.180> they're<00:03:03.750> not<00:03:03.780> both<00:03:04.380> exactly<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
actually they're not both exactly the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.850 
actually they're not both exactly the
same<00:03:05.310> size<00:03:05.550> but<00:03:05.850> they<00:03:06.030> are<00:03:06.810> both<00:03:07.110> near<00:03:07.560> enough

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860

the same size and as you can see and the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.110 
the same size and as you can see and the
exterminator<00:03:11.580> gun<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.060> much<00:03:12.510> longer<00:03:12.840> than<00:03:13.080> the

but<00:03:20.370> i<00:03:20.400> think<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:20.760> sucker<00:03:21.030> arms<00:03:21.390> still

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
but i think the sucker arms still

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.380 
but i think the sucker arms still
remains<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.140> same<00:03:22.530> size<00:03:22.830> now<00:03:23.550> both<00:03:23.880> exactly

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
remains the same size now both exactly

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.930 
remains the same size now both exactly
the<00:03:24.540> same<00:03:24.840> color<00:03:25.200> though<00:03:25.410> but<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> body<00:03:26.490> has

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
the same color though but the body has

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.230 
the same color though but the body has
been<00:03:27.300> painted<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.990> red<00:03:28.770> color<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.370> lot<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.940> people

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
been painted a red color a lot of people

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.260 
been painted a red color a lot of people
think<00:03:30.450> that<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.200> color<00:03:32.100> on<00:03:32.460> the<00:03:32.820> body<00:03:33.030> is

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
think that the color on the body is

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.300 
think that the color on the body is

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.590 
the silver spheres that the new Daleks
have<00:03:48.830> I<00:03:49.830> think<00:03:50.310> they<00:03:50.460> are<00:03:50.610> actually<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.240> bit

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
have I think they are actually a bit

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.110 
have I think they are actually a bit
bigger<00:03:51.840> than<00:03:52.020> this<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:53.310> were<00:03:53.520> on<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
bigger than this is that were on the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.080 
bigger than this is that were on the
previous<00:03:54.870> new<00:03:55.140> series<00:03:55.560> Dalek<00:03:55.920> figures<00:03:56.250> that

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.020 
previous new series Dalek figures that
base<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.810> also<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.350> lot<00:03:58.800> bigger<00:03:59.340> at<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.760> bottom

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
base is also a lot bigger at the bottom

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.300 
base is also a lot bigger at the bottom
as<00:04:00.210> well<00:04:00.240> and<00:04:00.660> it<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.110> a<00:04:01.140> completely<00:04:01.800> different

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310

around<00:04:41.919> and<00:04:46.620> overall<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:47.860> think<00:04:47.949> this<00:04:48.370> figure

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
around and overall I think this figure

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.450 
around and overall I think this figure
is<00:04:49.050> absolutely<00:04:50.050> fantastic<00:04:50.259> it's<00:04:51.159> been

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
is absolutely fantastic it's been

articulation which doesn't need to be

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.769 
articulation which doesn't need to be
changing<00:04:59.469> my<00:04:59.620> opinion<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.479> an

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:01.779 
changing my opinion and it is an

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:03.269 
changing my opinion and it is an
absolutely<00:05:02.199> brilliant<00:05:02.469> addition<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:03.189> my

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:03.279 
absolutely brilliant addition to my

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.490 
absolutely brilliant addition to my
collection<00:05:03.310> I'm<00:05:04.300> really<00:05:04.539> happy<00:05:04.840> that<00:05:04.960> go<00:05:05.289> when

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
collection I'm really happy that go when

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.080 
collection I'm really happy that go when
I<00:05:05.529> did<00:05:05.830> because<00:05:06.099> I<00:05:06.340> think<00:05:06.580> this<00:05:06.669> figure<00:05:06.969> is

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
I did because I think this figure is

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.240 
I did because I think this figure is
going<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.479> sell<00:05:07.689> out<00:05:07.719> from<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.080> shops<00:05:08.349> very

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
going to sell out from the shops very

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.360 
going to sell out from the shops very
very<00:05:09.909> quickly<00:05:10.389> and<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:11.469> think<00:05:11.710> that<00:05:11.889> if<00:05:12.069> you're

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
very quickly and I think that if you're

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.089 
very quickly and I think that if you're
in<00:05:12.669> a<00:05:13.360> local<00:05:13.870> tire<00:05:14.050> shop<00:05:14.169> and<00:05:14.529> you<00:05:14.710> see<00:05:14.919> this

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
in a local tire shop and you see this

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.830 
in a local tire shop and you see this
figure<00:05:15.279> and<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:15.789> have<00:05:15.939> enough<00:05:16.180> money<00:05:16.419> for<00:05:16.539> it

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
figure and you have enough money for it

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.269 
figure and you have enough money for it
I<00:05:16.960> feel<00:05:17.469> you<00:05:17.529> should<00:05:17.650> definitely<00:05:17.860> buy<00:05:18.250> it

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:18.279 
I feel you should definitely buy it

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.980 
I feel you should definitely buy it
because<00:05:18.639> is<00:05:19.000> an<00:05:19.210> absolutely<00:05:19.750> brilliant

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990
