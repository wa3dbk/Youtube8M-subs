when<00:03:19.419> you<00:03:19.510> switch<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.930> two<00:03:20.139> it's<00:03:20.739> going<00:03:20.980> to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
when you switch it to two it's going to

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.920 
when you switch it to two it's going to
be<00:03:21.190> your<00:03:21.669> setting<00:03:22.060> whatever<00:03:22.449> setting<00:03:22.840> you
