00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
position which is very square notice how

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.720 
position which is very square notice how
the<00:00:12.630> club<00:00:12.929> head<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.200> above<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.099> shaft<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.639> can

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
the club head is above the shaft you can

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.460 
the club head is above the shaft you can
see<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.120> from<00:00:15.269> here<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.599> above<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:15.990> shaft

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
see it from here it's above the shaft

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.210 
see it from here it's above the shaft
now<00:00:16.830> when<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.550> take<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.090> back<00:00:18.740> you<00:00:19.740> can<00:00:19.890> see<00:00:20.070> the

here<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.789> parallel<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.030> my<00:01:03.329> spine<00:01:03.660> angle

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
here is parallel to my spine angle

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.830 
here is parallel to my spine angle
because<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.799> bowed<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:05.640> wrist<00:01:05.939> notice

again the leading edge at the same angle

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.020 
again the leading edge at the same angle
as<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:24.780> spine<00:01:25.110> angle<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.220> club<00:01:26.670> head<00:01:26.880> has
