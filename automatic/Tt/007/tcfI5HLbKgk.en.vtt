Opie<00:00:34.310> ever<00:00:34.520> since<00:00:34.790> this<00:00:34.940> game<00:00:35.180> released<00:00:35.720> and<00:00:36.079> I

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
Opie ever since this game released and I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.780 
Opie ever since this game released and I
don't<00:00:36.710> think<00:00:36.860> they<00:00:36.920> ever<00:00:36.950> did<00:00:37.280> anything<00:00:37.579> about

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
don't think they ever did anything about

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.520 
don't think they ever did anything about
it<00:00:37.970> I<00:00:38.150> don't<00:00:38.180> think<00:00:38.450> they<00:00:38.570> ever<00:00:38.600> nerfed<00:00:39.110> it<00:00:39.350> at

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
it I don't think they ever nerfed it at

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.100 
it I don't think they ever nerfed it at
all<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:40.100> ever<00:00:40.390> they<00:00:41.390> might<00:00:41.570> have<00:00:41.660> touched<00:00:41.870> the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
all so ever they might have touched the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.200 
all so ever they might have touched the
akimbo<00:00:42.470> version<00:00:43.040> correct<00:00:43.730> me<00:00:43.940> if<00:00:44.030> I'm<00:00:44.180> wrong

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
akimbo version correct me if I'm wrong

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.120 
akimbo version correct me if I'm wrong
but<00:00:44.450> for<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.230> most<00:00:45.410> part<00:00:45.530> I<00:00:45.770> don't<00:00:45.890> think<00:00:46.040> they

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
but for the most part I don't think they

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.950 
but for the most part I don't think they
ever<00:00:46.160> did<00:00:46.520> anything<00:00:46.910> about<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:47.420> gun<00:00:47.660> and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
ever did anything about this gun and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.320 
ever did anything about this gun and
that's<00:00:48.800> kind<00:00:49.010> of<00:00:49.100> inexcusable<00:00:49.400> but<00:00:50.060> at<00:00:50.240> the

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
that's kind of inexcusable but at the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.240 
that's kind of inexcusable but at the
same<00:00:50.540> time<00:00:50.750> you<00:00:51.410> know<00:00:51.560> we've<00:00:51.770> talked<00:00:52.010> about<00:00:52.130> it

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
same time you know we've talked about it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.060 
same time you know we've talked about it
before<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.910> pic<00:00:53.120> 10<00:00:53.360> system<00:00:53.900> made<00:00:54.770> everything

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
before the pic 10 system made everything

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.010 
before the pic 10 system made everything
strong<00:00:55.580> in<00:00:55.850> this<00:00:56.000> game<00:00:56.270> so<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.720> doesn't<00:00:56.960> matter
