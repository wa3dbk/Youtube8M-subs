00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
that the hair goes through so it kind of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.649 
that the hair goes through so it kind of
gives<00:01:16.040> it<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:17.150> more<00:01:17.960> honestly<00:01:18.950> ethnic<00:01:19.580> feel<00:01:19.909> so

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
gives it a more honestly ethnic feel so

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.460

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
not too stereotypical but that's what it

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.899 
not too stereotypical but that's what it
feels<00:01:27.350> like<00:01:27.440> that's<00:01:27.740> this<00:01:28.220> is<00:01:28.340> how<00:01:28.460> my<00:01:28.670> hair

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
flat and I think that that's because

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.130 
flat and I think that that's because
