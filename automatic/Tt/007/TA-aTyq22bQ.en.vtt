00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:13.379
Hi, in this video we teach how to unlock

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.380
a Canon IP2700 printer

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.640
This printer takes an integrated waste ink counter

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.140
which locks the printer, shows us

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.509
an error screen 5B00 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.230
and let the two LEDs flashing on the keypad.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.620
If our printer

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.070
is under warranty

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.130
Canon Technical Services can solve the problem for free.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.720
Normally we are out

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.300
of warranty period

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.090
Therefore, they charged us for repair but is not a failure

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.890
The manufacturer has designed the printer to make it happen.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.110
We recommended you a film: To Buy, To Throw Away, To Buy

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.420
The secret History of Planned Obsolescence

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.240
To solve the problem, we have to go to our web www.cleancolours.com/soporte

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.290
and download PCMservicetool.rar

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.780
to your computer.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.210
The first stetp is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.740
turn off our printer

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.420
and then press and hold Resume button

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.790
and press ON button whitout releasing.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.930
Then press 5 times Resume button

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.540
and release both buttons.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.800
Then, the printer will start

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.500
and stop flashing LEDs.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.920
At this point, we have to unzip

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.300
PCM_servicetool.rar

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.779
Once unzipped, run it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:13.849
and look Main Button.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.499
We have to wait a few seconds

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.889
and accept the popup.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:25.459
Then press EEPROM Clear button

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.459
and accept the popup.

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.869
Finally, we need to turn our printer off

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.999
and on again.

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:43.309
Now our printer is ready to continue working.

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:47.649
