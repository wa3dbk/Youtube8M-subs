of people don't like iOS 6 because well
there's<00:00:14.190> map<00:00:14.490> gate<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.000> there's<00:00:15.240> no

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
there's map gate and there's no

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.080 
there's map gate and there's no
untethered<00:00:15.900> jailbreak<00:00:16.109> thus<00:00:16.560> far<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:17.340> iOS<00:00:17.760> 6

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
untethered jailbreak thus far for iOS 6

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.580

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.140 
on stitch like we said earlier and then
you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.780> select<00:01:33.960> your<00:01:34.200> ipsw<00:01:35.070> here<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.640> go

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
you can select your ipsw here so go

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.569 
you can select your ipsw here so go
ahead<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.360> select<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> ipsw

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
ahead and select that here is the ipsw

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.730 
ahead and select that here is the ipsw
the<00:01:38.670> firmware<00:01:39.000> file<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.420> 5.1<00:01:39.900> point<00:01:40.259> 1<00:01:40.409> select

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the firmware file for 5.1 point 1 select

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.530 
the firmware file for 5.1 point 1 select
that<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> should<00:01:41.189> recognize<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.909> tell<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
that it should recognize it tell you

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.260 
that it should recognize it tell you
what<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.810> they<00:01:43.229> build<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:43.799> iphone<00:01:44.549> 3<00:01:44.820> comma

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
what it is they build for iphone 3 comma

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.510 
what it is they build for iphone 3 comma
1<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:46.079> now<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.290> want<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> select<00:01:46.890> local

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
1 and now you want to select local

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.510 
1 and now you want to select local
because<00:01:47.970> i<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.299> my<00:01:48.600> blog<00:01:49.350> save<00:01:49.799> locally<00:01:50.369> if

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
because i have my blog save locally if

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.069 
because i have my blog save locally if
you<00:01:50.610> don't<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.149> select<00:01:51.329> city<00:01:51.689> i<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you don't you can select city i know to

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.230 
you don't you can select city i know to
try<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> pull<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.680> from<00:01:52.920> cydia<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.970> have

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
try to pull it from cydia so you have

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.300 
try to pull it from cydia so you have
some<00:01:54.420> options<00:01:54.630> there<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:55.890> what<00:01:56.159> it's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
some options there so now what it's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.130 
some options there so now what it's
doing<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:56.850> combining<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.600> two<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
doing is it's combining the two to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.399 
doing is it's combining the two to
create<00:01:58.439> one<00:01:58.770> new<00:01:59.009> ipsw<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> custom<00:02:00.479> ipsw<00:02:00.630> that

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
create one new ipsw a custom ipsw that

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.709 
create one new ipsw a custom ipsw that
stitches<00:02:01.890> your<00:02:02.310> blob<00:02:02.640> together<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
stitches your blob together with the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.539 
stitches your blob together with the
firmware<00:02:04.350> file<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.369> actually

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
firmware file so that you can actually

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.389 
firmware file so that you can actually
use<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.049> restore<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.619> an<00:02:07.740> older<00:02:08.160> firmware

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
use this to restore to an older firmware

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.430 
use this to restore to an older firmware
even<00:02:08.970> though<00:02:09.060> Apple<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.539> no<00:02:09.720> longer<00:02:09.959> longer

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
even though Apple is no longer longer

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.550 
even though Apple is no longer longer

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
point one which is really cool so here

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.210 
point one which is really cool so here
is<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.540> blob<00:02:14.750> stitching<00:02:15.230> confirmation<00:02:16.069> that

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
is the blob stitching confirmation that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.910 
is the blob stitching confirmation that
it's<00:02:16.340> complete<00:02:16.760> click<00:02:17.540> OK<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:17.930> there<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.650> your

it's complete click OK and there is your

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.589 
it's complete click OK and there is your
new<00:02:19.099> firmware<00:02:19.550> file<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.970> can<00:02:20.060> see<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
new firmware file you can see that the

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.750 
new firmware file you can see that the
number<00:02:21.349> I've<00:02:21.560> actually<00:02:21.890> zero<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:22.580> out<00:02:22.730> just

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
number I've actually zero that out just

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.510 
number I've actually zero that out just
for<00:02:23.209> privacy<00:02:24.050> concerns<00:02:24.410> on<00:02:24.590> my<00:02:24.770> part<00:02:25.040> but

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
for privacy concerns on my part but

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.360 
for privacy concerns on my part but
you'll<00:02:25.910> have<00:02:26.060> your<00:02:26.180> ecid<00:02:26.630> as<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.140> prefix<00:02:27.860> on<00:02:28.099> the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
you'll have your ecid as a prefix on the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.740 
you'll have your ecid as a prefix on the
new<00:02:28.489> firmware<00:02:28.700> file<00:02:29.060> now<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.269> other<00:02:29.510> two

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
new firmware file now the other two

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.970 
new firmware file now the other two
files<00:02:29.989> you<00:02:30.170> can<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.440> leave<00:02:30.590> them<00:02:30.709> there<00:02:30.920> for

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
files you can just leave them there for

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.920 
files you can just leave them there for
now<00:02:31.250> but<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.790> new<00:02:32.060> one<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.239> what<00:02:32.480> we<00:02:32.599> really

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
now but this new one is what we really

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.330 
now but this new one is what we really
want<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.110> concentrate<00:02:33.260> on<00:02:33.739> so<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.220> don't

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
want to concentrate on so just don't

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.530 
want to concentrate on so just don't
worry<00:02:34.519> about<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.849> other<00:02:35.000> two<00:02:35.239> for<00:02:35.450> now

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
worry about the other two for now

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.240 
worry about the other two for now
because<00:02:35.750> they<00:02:36.319> don't<00:02:36.500> really<00:02:36.650> play<00:02:36.920> any<00:02:36.950> more

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
because they don't really play any more

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.339 
because they don't really play any more
parts<00:02:37.640> in<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:38.150> process<00:02:38.450> now<00:02:39.050> go<00:02:39.170> back<00:02:39.290> to

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
parts in this process now go back to
