00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.912
 Shall we go to the arcade tomorrow? 

00:00:10.513 --> 00:00:12.267
 First games from me. 

00:00:12.748 --> 00:00:15.187
 Do we play double in the same team? 

00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:18.265
 We're always on the same team. 

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.194
 Good evening. News flash. 

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:23.122
 Kevin Flynn is reported missing. 

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.801
 A forward-thinking icon and CEO of ENCOM ... 

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:28.480
 ... in the tech industry. 

00:00:28.781 --> 00:00:31.151
 He was last seen at the house with his son Sam. 

00:00:31.152 --> 00:00:34.448
 He left behind an Imperial and orphaned child. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.673
 Sam, I got a call last night. 

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:47.296
 The call came from your father's office in the arcade hall. 

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:52.323
 Alan, you're acting like I'm gonna find him working in his office. 

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:02.528
 Where am I? 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.080
 Someone different. 

00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:21.563
 Your father was creative. 

00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:24.102
 She never thought you'd see her again. 

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:27.130
 - Daddy. - Sam? 

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:29.644
 - It was a long time since we met. - You don't know how. 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.693
 Grid. A place where there are countless possibilities. 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.140
 Unbelievable! 

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:40.895
 Better than my dreams ... 

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:45.336
 ... but more dangerous than I ever imagined. 

00:01:47.837 --> 00:01:49.143
 What happened? 

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:51.433
 The revolt I have created has rebelled against me. 

00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:53.794
 Kevin Flynn! 

00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:56.343
 Where are you? 

00:01:59.527 --> 00:02:01.048
 What should I do? 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.290
 Survive. 

00:02:08.084 --> 00:02:09.653
 We have to get you out of here. 

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:12.806
 It's a new world out there! 

00:02:12.807 --> 00:02:14.171
 They're coming! 

00:02:14.172 --> 00:02:15.672
 Outside... 

00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:20.513
 ... our destiny! 

00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:20.513
