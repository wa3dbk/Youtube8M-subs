00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.310 
just fine you do have it applying them
on<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> little<00:01:29.939> tricky<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.780> you're<00:01:30.930> doing<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
on is a little tricky if you're doing it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.859 
on is a little tricky if you're doing it
for<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> first<00:01:31.710> couple<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.189> times<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.909> have

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
for the first couple of times you have

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.350 
for the first couple of times you have
to<00:01:33.930> make<00:01:34.259> sure<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.710> put<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.250> really<00:01:35.759> close<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
to make sure you put it really close to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.700 
to make sure you put it really close to
your<00:01:36.420> lash<00:01:36.600> line<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.049> hold<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.680> there

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
your lash line and just hold it there

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.740 
your lash line and just hold it there
for<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.100> while<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.670> band<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
for a while because the band is so so

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.960 
for a while because the band is so so
thick<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.380> apply<00:01:40.500> more<00:01:40.770> glue<00:01:40.970> so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
thick you have to apply more glue so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.630 
thick you have to apply more glue so
it's<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.049> tricky<00:01:43.549> when<00:01:44.549> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it's a it's a little tricky when you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.990 
it's a it's a little tricky when you
first<00:01:44.939> start<00:01:45.360> using<00:01:45.630> them<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:47.610> get<00:01:47.820> used

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
first start using them but you get used

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.100 
first start using them but you get used
to<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:49.340> also<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:51.119> great<00:01:51.540> great<00:01:51.840> thing

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
to it so also the great great thing

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.389 
to it so also the great great thing
about<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.759> reuse<00:01:54.119> them<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
about it is that you can reuse them and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.130 
about it is that you can reuse them and
the<00:01:56.399> ones<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.180> right<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:57.810> I've

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the ones that I have on right now I've

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.760 
the ones that I have on right now I've
reused<00:01:58.680> them<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.869> would<00:02:00.869> say<00:02:00.990> six<00:02:01.259> times<00:02:01.439> which

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770
