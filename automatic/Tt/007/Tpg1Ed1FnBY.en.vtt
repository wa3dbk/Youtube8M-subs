that is called ghosts people assume that

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.649 
that is called ghosts people assume that
it<00:02:04.590> means<00:02:04.830> ghosts<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.909> ghost<00:02:06.150> being<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
it means ghosts so the ghost being the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.919

an entirely new story and cast that it

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.140 
an entirely new story and cast that it
does<00:02:22.440> make<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.620> wonder<00:02:22.740> where<00:02:23.250> does<00:02:23.490> ghost

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.320 
guessing that we will just literally
have<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.650> wait<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.130> what<00:02:53.520> happens<00:02:53.550> on<00:02:54.090> the
