sure<00:03:59.260> now<00:04:00.260> if<00:04:00.350> you<00:04:00.470> ever<00:04:00.590> had<00:04:00.829> plant<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.250> little

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
sure now if you ever had plant a little

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.160 
sure now if you ever had plant a little
tomato<00:04:01.880> plant<00:04:02.269> out<00:04:02.420> there<00:04:02.450> was<00:04:02.720> a<00:04:02.780> little<00:04:03.019> too

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
tomato plant out there was a little too

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.960 
tomato plant out there was a little too
tender<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.709> you<00:04:03.799> came<00:04:03.980> out<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.250> next<00:04:04.459> day<00:04:04.579> and

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
tender and you came out the next day and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.670 
tender and you came out the next day and
it<00:04:05.480> looked<00:04:05.660> like<00:04:05.780> somebody<00:04:06.019> snipped<00:04:06.410> it<00:04:06.500> off

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
it looked like somebody snipped it off

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.910 
it looked like somebody snipped it off
at<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.400> ground<00:04:07.519> for<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.209> pair<00:04:08.359> of<00:04:08.420> scissors

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
at the ground for the pair of scissors

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.500 
at the ground for the pair of scissors
well<00:04:09.920> that's<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.280> little<00:04:10.400> critter<00:04:10.760> that<00:04:11.000> did<00:04:11.150> it

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
well that's a little critter that did it

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.690 
well that's a little critter that did it
see<00:04:12.139> it's<00:04:12.380> curled<00:04:12.680> up<00:04:12.799> around<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:13.190> little<00:04:13.340> stem

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
see it's curled up around a little stem

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.860 
see it's curled up around a little stem
and<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.450> ground

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
and the ground

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.789 
and the ground
that's<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.620> grub<00:04:15.859> Lavo<00:04:16.400> type<00:04:16.639> thing<00:04:17.799> Japanese

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
that's a grub Lavo type thing Japanese

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.279 
that's a grub Lavo type thing Japanese
beetle<00:04:19.130> looks<00:04:19.280> a<00:04:19.370> little<00:04:19.519> like<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:20.139> but<00:04:21.139> the

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
beetle looks a little like that but the

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.649 
beetle looks a little like that but the
heads<00:04:21.500> not<00:04:21.739> quite<00:04:21.979> there<00:04:22.159> way<00:04:22.340> but<00:04:23.120> he<00:04:23.390> just

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
heads not quite there way but he just

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.750 
heads not quite there way but he just
goes<00:04:23.840> around<00:04:24.050> it<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.710> eats<00:04:24.950> it<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.460> it's<00:04:25.700> like

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
goes around it and eats it and it's like

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.110 
goes around it and eats it and it's like
it's<00:04:26.090> cut<00:04:26.300> off<00:04:26.450> with<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.810> purses

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
it's cut off with the purses

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.210 
it's cut off with the purses
so<00:04:29.120> that's<00:04:29.450> what<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:29.810> wanted<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.140> show<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:30.350> and

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
so that's what I wanted to show you and

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.030 
so that's what I wanted to show you and
he's<00:04:31.910> going<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.180> get<00:04:32.360> stepped<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:32.810> but<00:04:33.500> see<00:04:34.010> all

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
he's going to get stepped on but see all

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.680 
he's going to get stepped on but see all
this<00:04:34.310> sole<00:04:34.580> on<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:34.940> bottom<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.330> all<00:04:35.480> these

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
this sole on the bottom of all these

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.830 
this sole on the bottom of all these
roots<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.380> don't<00:04:37.310> want<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.580> lose<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:37.840> all

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
roots I don't want to lose that all

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.630 
roots I don't want to lose that all
these<00:04:39.080> roots<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.740> all<00:04:39.830> this<00:04:40.010> soil<00:04:40.310> will

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
these roots and all this soil will

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.010 
these roots and all this soil will
decompose<00:04:41.630> or<00:04:42.400> compost<00:04:43.400> them<00:04:43.670> and<00:04:44.630> this<00:04:44.810> thing

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
decompose or compost them and this thing

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.780 
decompose or compost them and this thing
probably<00:04:45.260> weighs<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:46.040> can't<00:04:46.340> pick<00:04:46.460> it<00:04:46.580> off<00:04:46.670> the

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
probably weighs I can't pick it off the

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.870 
probably weighs I can't pick it off the
ground<00:04:47.030> it's<00:04:47.270> probably<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:48.470> know<00:04:49.130> 60<00:04:49.550> 70

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.180 
pounds and 2/3 of its probably soil so
if<00:04:56.690> I<00:04:56.840> was<00:04:56.990> put<00:04:57.170> these<00:04:57.350> weeds<00:04:57.590> on<00:04:57.770> top<00:04:57.980> of<00:04:58.100> that

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
if I was put these weeds on top of that

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:59.860 
if I was put these weeds on top of that
see<00:04:58.400> I'd<00:04:58.490> introduce<00:04:58.970> weeds<00:04:59.270> now<00:04:59.630> if<00:04:59.720> that

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
see I'd introduce weeds now if that

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.440 
see I'd introduce weeds now if that
compost<00:05:00.290> pile<00:05:00.590> one<00:05:00.800> but<00:05:00.950> a<00:05:00.980> foot<00:05:01.220> tall<00:05:01.450> you

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
compost pile one but a foot tall you

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.970 
compost pile one but a foot tall you
could<00:05:02.660> put<00:05:02.840> this<00:05:03.020> in<00:05:03.230> there<00:05:03.410> if<00:05:03.470> you<00:05:03.560> wanted<00:05:03.800> to

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
could put this in there if you wanted to

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.470 
could put this in there if you wanted to
as<00:05:04.130> long<00:05:04.160> as<00:05:04.340> you<00:05:04.490> put<00:05:04.700> more<00:05:04.730> stuff<00:05:05.120> on<00:05:05.270> it

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
as long as you put more stuff on it

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.300 
as long as you put more stuff on it
because<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.870> compost<00:05:06.320> pile<00:05:06.590> has<00:05:06.800> natural

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
because the compost pile has natural

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
warm the Sun will kill all those weed

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.200 
warm the Sun will kill all those weed
seeds<00:05:12.410> but<00:05:13.160> when<00:05:13.220> you<00:05:13.400> put<00:05:13.550> it<00:05:13.640> on<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:13.940> top

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210

raise the temperature up enough to kill
it<00:05:19.130> and<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:20.060> can<00:05:20.240> actually<00:05:20.390> put<00:05:20.780> a<00:05:20.810> copper

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
it and you can actually put a copper

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
water will burn you if you run it

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.930
