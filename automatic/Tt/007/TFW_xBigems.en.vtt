00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.729
 ah 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.950
 hello everyone today in my recipes we are going to 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:10.450
 make orange donuts for that in 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.460
 a big bowl 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.800
 we throw out all the liquid ingredients 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.560
 Oil 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.020
 it's the orange juice 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.810
 the anise 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.410
 and then we will finally 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.410
 lemon zest 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.830
 we beat it 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.700
 and when we have it shake it will be when 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.700
 let's start throwing 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.710
 we have it we take the blender this is 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.710
 a touch simply 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.500
 now that we have it 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:02.010
 we stop beating 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.190
 the flour is sifted and we add 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.550
 the yeast envelope 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.360
 mix with the fork and we'll start 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.760
 add the flour 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.220
 in the big bowl 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.500
 when we have it all added is the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.780
 time to make the donuts 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.780
 ok let's add 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.560
 the mass is made is heavy because then 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.560
 we will make the snails 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.350
 to make each donut the sugar and the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.500
 cinnamon is for the end of the video when 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.590
 let's have the donuts done 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.340
 we will present the final dish rebozando 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.340
 the sugar and cinnamon to present 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.020
 and have the touch 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.399
 of some traditional donuts 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.799
 we are stopping and adding more flour 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.710
 can do in one in another kind of 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.439
 blender type thermomix or a 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.459
 processor what you want no longer 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.970
 Needs neither times nor temperatures 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.970
 special or more 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.300
 there's going to be a moment that takes that 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.430
 I have the manual rod because it takes 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.430
 the manual rod to follow 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.830
 the mother has to stay 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.660
 consistent because we're going to have to 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.170
 work it with your hands doing each 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.170
 roll 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.780
 I put the oven to heat 160 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.400
 degrees and when I put the donuts 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.459
 I'll put the oven up and down 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.790
 and we finished pouring the flour that we 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.790
 remains 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.340
 we take the rods because we do not go 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.340
 to be able 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.130
 we will not be able to with the blender 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:12.330
 You see the mass has been left more 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:14.100
 consistent and we're going to be doing 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.800
 The donuts 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.630
 who likes can add a 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.480
 little sugar to the dough but as 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.480
 then they carry sugar and cinnamon already in 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.460
 in the final batter I have not done 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.400
 mass 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:37.099
 and nothing remains a stretched mass 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.990
 and with the oven source prepared with 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.220
 albal paper 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.220
 what we do is 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.930
 start making the rolls 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.120
 worms and that the pieces of 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.120
 the mass united 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.040
 you can take a mass to the fountain 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.739
 little oil 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.209
 so that the rolls do not stick 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.209
 It costs a lot to get them out 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.280
 easier is also if you want to take 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.280
 a piece of dough 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.169
 with your finger you are doing the way 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.659
 more you like the little ones just going to 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.639
 pass pump doing the rolls and nothing 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.499
 friends I stay here doing 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.749
 rolls and now it was taught after the 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:40.360
 oven as we have been and how 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:42.659
 pass them through sugar and cinnamon until the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.659
 same 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.830
 good friends here you have me rebozando 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.930
 every roll in sugar and cinnamon we have 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.020
 expected to cool down a bit because 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.819
 If too much sugar is stuck and is not 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.860
 we're not taking anything from the source 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.599
 we have prepared a plate mixing 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.939
 sugar and cinnamon that you can mix 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.520
 with a fork or good I 've done it 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:10.240
 with strainer but 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.150
 and nothing you do, you go around and 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.190
 you have a prepared dish where you go 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.849
 accumulating all the rolls and 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.129
 prepared with sugar and cinnamon and nothing 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.800
 a delicious recipe for the time of 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:26.490
 breakfast coffee or snack until the 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.490
 next recipe
