DeRose<00:00:12.389> well<00:00:13.080> today<00:00:13.469> we've<00:00:13.650> seen<00:00:13.860> every<00:00:14.370> kind

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
DeRose well today we've seen every kind

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.010 
DeRose well today we've seen every kind
of<00:00:14.759> weather<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.210> far<00:00:15.240> while<00:00:15.660> we've<00:00:15.809> been<00:00:15.929> on

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
of weather so far while we've been on

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.720 
of weather so far while we've been on
the<00:00:16.139> water<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:17.130> figured<00:00:17.430> out<00:00:17.520> how<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
the water and we figured out how to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.490 
the water and we figured out how to
catch<00:00:17.940> him<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.240> swimmin<00:00:18.570> grub<00:00:18.750> let's<00:00:19.289> see<00:00:19.410> if

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
catch him on a swimmin grub let's see if

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:31.190 
catch him on a swimmin grub let's see if
we<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.740> continue<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.430> refine<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> pattern

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.680 

another<00:00:32.200> one<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:34.030> one<00:00:34.210> thing<00:00:34.360> we<00:00:34.510> could<00:00:34.660> say

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
another one it's one thing we could say

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.320 
another one it's one thing we could say
about<00:00:34.840> today<00:00:35.820> every<00:00:36.820> time<00:00:37.000> we've<00:00:37.150> had<00:00:37.270> a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
about today every time we've had a

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.870 
about today every time we've had a
change<00:00:37.690> in<00:00:37.930> weather<00:00:38.050> conditions<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.760> know

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
change in weather conditions you know

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.460 
change in weather conditions you know
we've<00:00:40.060> had<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.270> adjust<00:00:40.510> whether<00:00:41.080> it<00:00:41.230> be<00:00:41.320> the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
we've had to adjust whether it be the

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.470 
we've had to adjust whether it be the
speed<00:00:41.890> or<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.220> height<00:00:42.730> of<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:43.030> retrieve

whether we're bringing in a surface when
we're<00:00:46.059> there<00:00:46.180> dragging<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:46.930> bottom<00:00:47.290> with<00:00:47.470> it

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
we're there dragging the bottom with it

the clouds they're just lower in the
water<00:01:02.080> column<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:03.010> all<00:01:03.190> we<00:01:03.310> do<00:01:03.430> is<00:01:03.550> adjust

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
water column and all we do is adjust

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.600 
water column and all we do is adjust
just<00:01:04.570> continue<00:01:04.990> to<00:01:05.020> adjust<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:06.160> probe<00:01:06.460> the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
just continue to adjust and probe the

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.460 
just continue to adjust and probe the
water<00:01:06.790> column<00:01:07.060> from<00:01:07.270> top<00:01:07.479> to<00:01:07.509> bottom<00:01:07.690> slow<00:01:08.410> to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
water column from top to bottom slow to

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.650 
water column from top to bottom slow to
fast<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.160> sooner<00:01:09.940> or<00:01:09.970> later<00:01:10.030> you'll<00:01:10.420> figure<00:01:10.570> a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
fast and sooner or later you'll figure a

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.460 
fast and sooner or later you'll figure a
mo

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.700 

and<00:01:18.470> there<00:01:18.680> is<00:01:18.830> another<00:01:19.760> one<00:01:19.970> on<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.150> grub<00:01:20.710> and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
and there is another one on the grub and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:33.020 
and there is another one on the grub and
he<00:01:21.830> ate<00:01:21.950> my<00:01:22.100> tail<00:01:22.930> get<00:01:23.930> him<00:01:24.080> back<00:01:24.229> in<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.409> water

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.730 

then<00:01:33.570> we<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> bit<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.229> unique<00:01:34.530> situation

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
then we have a bit of a unique situation

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.010 
then we have a bit of a unique situation
today<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> fact<00:01:35.760> that<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.060> mid<00:01:36.330> June<00:01:36.690> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
today in the fact that it's mid June and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.780 
today in the fact that it's mid June and
the<00:01:37.500> water<00:01:37.680> temperatures<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.340> still<00:01:38.549> pretty

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the water temperatures are still pretty

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.960 
the water temperatures are still pretty
cold<00:01:39.000> 62<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> 65<00:01:40.560> degrees<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.909> some

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
cold 62 to 65 degrees so we do have some

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.910 
cold 62 to 65 degrees so we do have some
spawning<00:01:42.570> fish<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> area<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.680> there's<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
spawning fish in the area but there's a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.410 
spawning fish in the area but there's a
big<00:01:44.159> rush<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.520> fish<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.940> are<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.090> shallow

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
big rush of fish that are in shallow

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.140 
big rush of fish that are in shallow
feeding<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.409> bait<00:01:46.590> fish<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.759> saw<00:01:47.940> we

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
feeding on bait fish so as you saw we

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.120 
feeding on bait fish so as you saw we
started<00:01:48.509> off<00:01:48.630> with<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.900> Power<00:01:49.530> Team<00:01:49.830> lures

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
started off with that Power Team lures

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.910 
started off with that Power Team lures
krogger<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.880> small<00:01:51.270> craw<00:01:51.750> 3.5<00:01:52.590> inches

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
krogger of that small craw 3.5 inches

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.620 
krogger of that small craw 3.5 inches
and<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.759> only<00:01:53.880> time<00:01:54.119> they<00:01:54.270> were<00:01:54.330> really

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and the only time they were really

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.450 
and the only time they were really
really<00:01:55.050> going<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.920> was<00:01:56.159> when<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.310> was

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
really going at it was when I was

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219 
really going at it was when I was
reeling<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.970> in<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.659> noticed<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.080> they

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
reeling it in so I noticed that they

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.289 
reeling it in so I noticed that they
were<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.710> bait<00:01:59.009> feed<00:01:59.310> so<00:01:59.940> we<00:02:00.060> switched

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
were on that bait feed so we switched

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.990 
were on that bait feed so we switched
over<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.869> 4-inch<00:02:01.259> Power<00:02:01.470> Team<00:02:01.770> grub<00:02:02.159> what
