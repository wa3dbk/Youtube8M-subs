 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.860
 maxiforex 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.860
 and today i 'm doing a tutorial on how 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.250
 increase fps minecraft first way 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:24.189
 suitable for versions 152 and below i.e. 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:28.539
 147 132 like and 125 and we go in 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:31.119
 control panel click java then 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.120
 java view tab 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.149
 and here we enter a certain 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.239
 the value of memory operational which we 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.480
 we can and want to highlight I will write there 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.270
 four gigabytes yes because me 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.050
 imperative allows you to do it click 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.850
 apply 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:55.770
 ok it was all a way for versions 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.609
 152 and below proceed to the second method. 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.090
 open license launcher 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.090
 minecraft 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.190
 see the edit profile tab 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.170
 click our put a tick here 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:14.170
 timing argument and enter here right here 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.840
 us number I put 4 gigabytes again 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.470
 same because my operating system and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.960
 my system requirements allow there 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.310
 click play 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.980
 comes in the game comes in quickly go 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.430
 because we have allocated as many as 4 gigs 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.430
 RAM 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.160
 so put that coffee off to 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:49.490
 you made sure so here we go in we 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.980
 all fought and here we went absolutely 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.260
 nothing lags here at the top we see 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.990
 how much memory is used 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.330
 of how many memories have been set 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.850
 that is, 3641 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:08.390
 and another 500 megabytes echelon launcher himself 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.090
 let's put the shaders now 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.690
 there for example 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.290
 press ok oh screen case did not 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.710
 and here we see the fact that nothing lags 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.630
 everything is fine everything is breaking well not 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.210
 lags 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.990
 you can throw out watermelons can be in the lava 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.650
 swim the same way i did the first way 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.010
 Few people are already up to playing on versions 152 but 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.770
 These are mostly those who play with mods. 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.900
 people with mods there create in borka to 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.840
 not lag of course you can do 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.700
 put a little more RAM 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.370
