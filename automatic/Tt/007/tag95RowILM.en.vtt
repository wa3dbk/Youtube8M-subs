00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello everyone and we continue to do our 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.770
 strategy and today we will do so 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.269
 we could mine our clay 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.380
 let's begin but as you can see i added 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.179
 new sprite on our clay sprites but 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 just like we did with stones 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.350
 I have to add a new private 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.080
 changes here this site 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.170
 well let's add but private ones 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.170
 variable let's call clay 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.689
 and we will initially have decay 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.689
 60 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.239
 so now let's do it for sure 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.190
 events like we did with ours here 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.309
 this house is green only dota now 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.079
 do it all with our red house 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.690
 as you understood, we have no more 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.629
 houses I think add new houses here 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.530
 here you yourself can now not think I 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.489
 already done the next lesson will add more 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.690
 probably three or four houses 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.049
 window now we do 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.790
 clay mining so now let 's go around 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.479
 so that we could make our 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.310
 the building here is this red building only on 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.380
 this is our spiral 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:23.360
 that is, on the sprite 18 so well let's 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.360
 make such an event if our sprite 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.939
 sprite touch sprite 18 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.130
 then only then can we deliver our 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.390
 buildings so well let's try 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.910
 let's see here take our house here 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.680
 we can put and put here 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.830
 we can deliver as you see 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.820
 he put it just need to be 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.860
 replace layer layer we set 4 and here 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.860
 this sprite we do not see 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.960
 we do not see him 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:16.540
 Well , as you see, we have everything right 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.580
 works but now let's do exactly 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.290
 the same events as we did with our 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.160
 green house so that we have 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:29.320
 walked our prey jesus note reduced 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.740
 mining speed let's say three 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.130
 so seconds , well, basically we will 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:41.400
 make the same events do 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:46.530
 such an event if our cheese and buildings 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.530
 touches our sprite 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.650
 eighteen something from our spiro this 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.620
 will be deducted our global 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:02.020
 variable private variable well 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.220
 let's say -1 so who will do us 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.750
 such an event to make it happen 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.090
 action through some amount 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:13.030
 seconds well say 4 seconds through 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.040
 4 seconds we will have our deducted 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.160
 global variable private 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.160
 variable 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.790
 so here so here we go so 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.239
 so that we could destroy this one 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.700
 our collect 18 and our clay if we all 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:47.379
 mined for this we will do such 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:52.459
 event if the spread has 18 clay 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:55.930
 less is 0 then the sprite is 18 here 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.930
 destroyed and 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:07.810
 and let's go for the cause new events if 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.140
 if our sprite 18 touches 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:25.699
 our clay that is up to sprites 3 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:29.150
 check to 104 you have to go through 4 then 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:32.990
 sprite 4 we destroy that is our 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.760
 clay is also destroyed another 20 he is so 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.669
 so that we would have here such 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.190
 a cross on our house if we donâ€™t 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:42.350
 We touch made pancakes Well 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.030
 let 's do it for this need 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:55.520
 will create a new animation 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:05:00.200
 nazim animation not put again like this 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:06.490
 let's copy this picture set 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.490
 here it is the valley and draw a cross 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.540
 on red will probably not be red 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:16.630
 very clearly visible yes let's do 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:22.090
 dark red even black so 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:26.560
 brown well here with you maxim and 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.900
 done let's put the point and we 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.720
 stands in the middle of them in this house 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:36.100
 we are not worth point put point 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:44.850
 in the middle and let's prescribe such 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:44.850
 events if if we don't touch 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:57.700
 to our place where we can insert 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:02.260
 our sprite ie if our if our 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:07.650
 sprite 11 touches 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:10.650
 spiral 18 then it starts the animation 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.650
 standard 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.520
 so see the name exactly the name 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:38.930
 and if at us he doesn't touch that 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.930
 we are getting animation not to put 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.900
 so here we have this all right 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:54.860
 working here we can put our 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.770
 we put the building only on clay right here 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.699
 we have nowhere can put well here 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:05.240
 as you can see, everything works correctly 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:07.009
 I think with a stone and clay, we figured out but 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.160
 and I think in the next lesson we will do 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:12.590
 so that we could mine shit on 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.370
 the lake we will mine some 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.199
 units ie robot body and man for 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:22.280
 people i don't know who we will be there 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:24.080
 to mine or here such squares well we 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.110
 with him a little bit different our prey 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.900
 resources but you will be a small home 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.940
 I suggest you to do the job here 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.780
 Here in this yushku more here such here 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.900
 houses 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:40.550
 but the more you do the better it will be 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:42.680
 for you but thank you all for watching
