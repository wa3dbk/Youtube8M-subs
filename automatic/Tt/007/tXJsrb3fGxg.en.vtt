00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.760 
experimented to get the color correct
and<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> remembered<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.170> hot<00:02:01.290> dark<00:02:01.560> rums

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
and then I remembered a hot dark rums

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.609 
and then I remembered a hot dark rums
going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> change<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> color<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:04.350> kind

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
going to change the color so that kind

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.819 
going to change the color so that kind
of<00:02:04.680> ruined<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.399> use<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> lighter<00:02:06.030> darkroom<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:07.140> I

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
of ruined so use a lighter darkroom I I

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.949 
of ruined so use a lighter darkroom I I
had<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.819> was<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> black<00:02:09.300> seal<00:02:09.569> was<00:02:09.690> what<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.869> was

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
had it was the black seal was what I was

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.600 
had it was the black seal was what I was
testing<00:02:10.319> with<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.770> figured<00:02:11.099> if<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.430> close

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
testing with so I figured if I get close

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.760 
testing with so I figured if I get close
this<00:02:12.420> would<00:02:12.720> come<00:02:12.870> out<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.230> little

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
this would come out a little

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.790 
this would come out a little
later<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.870> since<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.020> was<00:02:16.110> kind<00:02:16.320> of<00:02:16.380> late<00:02:16.590> when

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
later and since it was kind of late when

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.200 
later and since it was kind of late when
I<00:02:16.890> was<00:02:17.010> coming<00:02:17.190> up<00:02:17.340> with<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:17.610> idea<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:18.030> using

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
I was coming up with this idea of using

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.400 
I was coming up with this idea of using
this<00:02:18.450> recipe<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.930> reason<00:02:19.290> I've<00:02:19.380> been

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
this recipe and the reason I've been

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.470 
this recipe and the reason I've been
putting<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.010> off<00:02:20.100> it's<00:02:20.430> when<00:02:20.580> people<00:02:20.700> don't

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
putting it off it's when people don't

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.940 
putting it off it's when people don't
give<00:02:21.660> me<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.930> right<00:02:22.170> measures<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.800> any

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
give me the right measures or any

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.160 
give me the right measures or any
measures<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:26.060> tend<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.150> get<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.390> little<00:02:27.540> lazy<00:02:27.810> and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
measures I tend to get a little lazy and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.380 
measures I tend to get a little lazy and
it<00:02:28.290> takes<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.920> lot<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.100> work<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.460> go<00:02:29.670> kind<00:02:30.270> of

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
it takes a lot of work to go kind of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.460 
it takes a lot of work to go kind of
figure<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.780> out<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.070> slack<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:34.260> I've<00:02:34.290> had

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
figure it out so I slack so I've had

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.450 
figure it out so I slack so I've had
like<00:02:34.620> under<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.920> little<00:02:35.100> bit<00:02:35.390> little<00:02:36.390> bit<00:02:37.460> that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
like under a little bit little bit that

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.820 
like under a little bit little bit that
was<00:02:38.610> full<00:02:38.910> out<00:02:39.060> yet<00:02:39.500> actually<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.590> might<00:02:40.740> have

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
was full out yet actually I might have

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.340 
was full out yet actually I might have
been<00:02:40.950> more<00:02:41.700> than<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.940> firehouse<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:43.200> might

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
been more than a firehouse you might

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.090 
been more than a firehouse you might
have<00:02:43.440> been<00:02:43.550> double<00:02:44.550> we'll<00:02:45.390> find<00:02:45.630> out<00:02:45.920> ty<00:02:46.920> would

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
have been double we'll find out ty would

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:59.270 
have been double we'll find out ty would
be<00:02:47.220> too<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:50.750> yeah<00:02:52.490> so<00:02:53.490> look<00:02:53.610> pink<00:02:56.570> yeah<00:02:57.570> yeah<00:02:58.280> so

be too so yeah so look pink yeah yeah so

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.220 
be too so yeah so look pink yeah yeah so
that<00:02:59.400> might<00:02:59.520> yeah<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.360> might<00:03:00.630> have<00:03:00.720> put<00:03:00.870> over

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
that might yeah I might have put over

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.170 
that might yeah I might have put over
the<00:03:01.650> amount<00:03:01.920> i<00:03:02.040> needed<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.580> put<00:03:02.790> for<00:03:03.150> the

the amount i needed to put for the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.780 
the amount i needed to put for the
specific<00:03:03.810> oj<00:03:10.190> just<00:03:11.190> going<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.370> mean<00:03:11.520> I<00:03:11.550> got<00:03:11.760> a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
you shake it when it's not tight yeah

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.900 

so<00:03:35.349> I<00:03:35.380> might<00:03:35.739> almost<00:03:35.920> have<00:03:36.130> us<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.400> half<00:03:36.670> and

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
so I might almost have us a half and

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.559 
so I might almost have us a half and
half<00:03:37.060> here<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:39.310> as<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.330> cream<00:03:41.370> no<00:03:42.370> as<00:03:42.730> in<00:03:43.000> equal

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
half here but as in cream no as in equal

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.380 
half here but as in cream no as in equal
parts<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.930> more<00:03:47.200> like<00:03:47.790> no<00:03:48.790> wasn't<00:03:49.209> equal

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
parts it's more like no wasn't equal

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.880 
parts it's more like no wasn't equal
parts<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.810> was<00:03:49.900> not<00:03:50.260> in<00:03:50.350> equal<00:03:50.530> parts<00:03:50.650> that

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
parts it was not in equal parts that

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.699 
parts it was not in equal parts that
might<00:03:51.360> there's<00:03:52.360> no<00:03:52.510> way<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.989> was<00:03:53.080> a<00:03:53.290> one<00:03:53.620> to

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
might there's no way it was a one to

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.800 
might there's no way it was a one to
four<00:03:53.890> if<00:03:54.010> I<00:03:54.069> even<00:03:54.250> if<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.400> poor<00:03:54.670> full<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.120> its

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
four if I even if I poor full to its

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.750 
four if I even if I poor full to its
unequal<00:03:56.290> no<00:03:57.010> yeah<00:03:57.700> half<00:03:59.280> so<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.550> going<00:04:00.640> to

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
unequal no yeah half so it is going to

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.339 
unequal no yeah half so it is going to
probably<00:04:00.910> be<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.180> little<00:04:01.480> wider<00:04:01.870> right<00:04:02.140> off

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
probably be a little wider right off

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.030 
probably be a little wider right off
because<00:04:02.830> of<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.819> bubbles<00:04:04.330> in<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.569> aeration

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
because of the bubbles in the aeration

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.920 
because of the bubbles in the aeration
but<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:07.090> is<00:04:07.330> a<00:04:07.360> pink<00:04:07.630> fairy<00:04:09.930> realistically

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
but that is a pink fairy realistically

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.530 
but that is a pink fairy realistically
you<00:04:11.709> want<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.010> darker<00:04:12.250> add<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:13.150> little<00:04:13.390> more

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
you want it darker add a little more

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.750 
you want it darker add a little more
cranberry<00:04:13.989> want<00:04:14.590> it<00:04:14.650> later<00:04:14.890> add<00:04:15.220> a<00:04:15.519> little

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
cranberry want it later add a little

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.219 
cranberry want it later add a little
more<00:04:15.940> oj<00:04:16.690> or<00:04:16.870> j<00:04:17.380> less<00:04:17.769> cranberry<00:04:18.510> or<00:04:19.510> let's<00:04:19.959> or

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
more oj or j less cranberry or let's or

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.870 
more oj or j less cranberry or let's or
yeah<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:20.560> could<00:04:20.799> do<00:04:20.889> track<00:04:21.160> however<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.729> can

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
yeah you could do track however you can

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.159 
yeah you could do track however you can
mix<00:04:22.060> it<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.300> way<00:04:22.389> you<00:04:22.450> want<00:04:22.690> it's<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.960> fruit

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
mix it the way you want it's the fruit

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.870 
mix it the way you want it's the fruit
juices<00:04:23.560> you<00:04:24.040> probably<00:04:24.250> don't<00:04:24.430> want<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.729> go<00:04:24.820> too

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
totally different this is not as potent

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.810

to a tasting but we got to buy more of
this<00:04:56.700> they<00:04:57.700> have<00:04:57.850> like<00:04:58.030> four<00:04:58.270> brands<00:04:58.690> i<00:04:58.780> think

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990

now<00:04:59.140> at<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.350> liquor<00:04:59.500> store<00:04:59.590> seems<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.130> have<00:05:00.250> a

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
now at the liquor store seems to have a

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.790 
now at the liquor store seems to have a
bit<00:05:00.460> yeah<00:05:01.060> it's<00:05:01.390> it<00:05:01.690> was<00:05:01.900> one<00:05:02.200> and<00:05:02.440> then<00:05:02.770> two

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
bit yeah it's it was one and then two

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.920 
bit yeah it's it was one and then two
and<00:05:03.039> then<00:05:03.310> three<00:05:03.550> so<00:05:03.700> it's<00:05:03.729> kind<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.150> picking

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
and then three so it's kind of picking

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.230 
and then three so it's kind of picking
up<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.380> am<00:05:06.310> i<00:05:06.460> guessing<00:05:06.669> if<00:05:06.910> it's<00:05:07.030> doing<00:05:07.210> that

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
up and am i guessing if it's doing that

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.260 
up and am i guessing if it's doing that
a<00:05:07.330> state<00:05:07.690> control<00:05:08.080> state<00:05:08.800> weight<00:05:09.700> control

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
a state control state weight control

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.360 
a state control state weight control
state<00:05:10.660> then<00:05:11.350> it<00:05:11.680> will<00:05:11.800> probably<00:05:12.010> be<00:05:12.160> even

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
state then it will probably be even

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.740 
state then it will probably be even
doing<00:05:12.669> better<00:05:12.940> and<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.150> state<00:05:13.360> where<00:05:13.510> people

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
doing better and a state where people

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.960 
doing better and a state where people
could<00:05:13.840> buy<00:05:13.990> free-range<00:05:16.740> very<00:05:17.740> if<00:05:18.669> you've<00:05:18.850> ever

texture<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:51.060> it<00:05:51.090> from<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.390> oj<00:05:51.870> not<00:05:52.860> as<00:05:53.070> tired

as I thought it would be from the from
for<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.490> cranberry<00:05:56.730> juice<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.830> really<00:05:58.830> I

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
for the cranberry juice and really I

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.830 
for the cranberry juice and really I
think<00:05:58.920> that<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.640> Florida<00:06:00.030> Konya<00:06:00.480> is<00:06:00.540> what<00:06:00.750> I'm

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
think that the Florida Konya is what I'm

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.050 
think that the Florida Konya is what I'm
using<00:06:01.050> here<00:06:01.170> kind<00:06:02.130> of<00:06:02.220> just<00:06:02.400> give<00:06:02.820> it<00:06:02.880> a<00:06:02.940> little

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
using here kind of just give it a little

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.040 
using here kind of just give it a little
extra<00:06:03.270> mature<00:06:04.230> sweetness<00:06:04.800> to<00:06:05.010> it<00:06:06.050> definitely

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
extra mature sweetness to it definitely

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.210 
extra mature sweetness to it definitely
not<00:06:07.230> as<00:06:07.380> potent<00:06:07.680> as<00:06:07.710> I<00:06:07.770> thought<00:06:07.980> was<00:06:08.070> going<00:06:08.160> to

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
not as potent as I thought was going to

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:15.620 
not as potent as I thought was going to
be<00:06:11.780> yet<00:06:12.780> i<00:06:12.810> think<00:06:13.260> if<00:06:14.100> you<00:06:14.160> use<00:06:14.670> a<00:06:14.700> horse<00:06:15.450> spirit

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
be yet i think if you use a horse spirit

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.870 
be yet i think if you use a horse spirit
that<00:06:15.840> had<00:06:15.990> more<00:06:16.170> berlin<00:06:16.680> you<00:06:17.160> get<00:06:17.400> more<00:06:17.520> burn

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
that had more berlin you get more burn

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.070 
that had more berlin you get more burn
right<00:06:18.120> there<00:06:18.300> because<00:06:18.450> you<00:06:18.510> could<00:06:18.660> taste<00:06:18.930> the

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
right there because you could taste the

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.040 
right there because you could taste the
spirit<00:06:19.530> this<00:06:20.040> is<00:06:20.190> a<00:06:20.220> very<00:06:20.400> tasty<00:06:20.810> rather<00:06:21.810> than

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
spirit this is a very tasty rather than

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.070 
spirit this is a very tasty rather than
put<00:06:22.620> off<00:06:22.830> for<00:06:22.860> potency<00:06:23.430> it's<00:06:24.060> tasty<00:06:24.510> I<00:06:24.660> like<00:06:24.930> it

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
put off for potency it's tasty I like it

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.480 
put off for potency it's tasty I like it
so<00:06:25.590> that<00:06:25.860> is<00:06:26.660> the<00:06:27.660> pink<00:06:28.050> fairy<00:06:28.530> make<00:06:29.250> it<00:06:29.400> as
