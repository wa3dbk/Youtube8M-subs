00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.320
 Hello and welcome today 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.480
 to a screencast again on the mac 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.119
 and it's about how today 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.779
 I connect from my mac from me 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.119
 a server to transfer data 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.690
 either over load on the mac or 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.910
 just from mac on the server plays 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.400
 it does not matter what that server 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.620
 is so it can one be it or 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.170
 some other release him well 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.530
 network is available and also the 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.160
 different protocols and indeed 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.660
 Here we go to the fine talk here 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.040
 finders must stand on the top left 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.480
 Driver must be activated 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.300
 and then you can go over to and then 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.460
 connect with server with that 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.930
 call dialog window you see it too 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.180
 already here it will be available shortly 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.880
 apple button and then came give the whole 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:15.210
 well yes and then goes exactly this 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.650
 window on connect with server 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.470
 I'll explain something to you here 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.050
 already in it is here in the beginning 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.940
 the first three letters show here 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.130
 on what protocol during 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.409
 connecting in the case is about 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.310
 samba that's the protocol that 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.580
 mainly from microsoft and windows 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.520
 is used 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.670
 then comes colon and double / 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.020
 then in this case the ip-address too 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.850
 the server to which I am here 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.490
 wants to connect the stands in the local 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.640
 network with me here and is under the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.409
 192 168 0 2 to reach 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.229
 Of course it is also here 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.030
 Network name as you do not have the ip 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.000
 enter the address but with the IP address 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.320
 I think it's clearer here we come 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 but later back to it 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.240
 then comes again / the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.399
 slash and then release name 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.440
 in my case, this is media it 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.459
 can also follow / and more 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.549
 It could be with any folder 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:21.459
 go on yes if the address 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.019
 you can register here on the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.970
 plus then she comes down here 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.459
 into the preferred server with pure 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.480
 you have a quicker choice around you 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.409
 connect to 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.599
 then there is also a small one 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.590
 History button there is simply in there 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.950
 which server not recently yes 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.390
 was associated 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.040
 You can also delete these 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.549
 delete last used server 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.200
 then this is empty yes and after 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.330
 We have the right address here and that 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.830
 correct protocol and release 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.230
 names everything you have clicked you click 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.519
 just connect 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.870
 then go to the small moment and at 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.549
 I can do that with me now 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.920
 here are the series I 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.489
 have recorded and movies are there 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.349
 on the server and if you are here 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.110
 accordingly in fine settings 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.180
 have adjusted that the server or 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.819
 Connected drives will be displayed 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.709
 should then be the drive to the 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.260
 we found each other with his 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.930
 Release took now also here 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.310
 all data on how big the whole is 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.310
 how much is free and so on 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.799
 yes we will do the dialog window now 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.590
 again because I have the server 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.579
 not just for samba 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.130
 Of course there are others 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.459
 protocols such as apple 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.410
 file protocol hfp is called the whole 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.680
 so we'll just swap it up front 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.980
 just the protocol name I click 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.480
 I have to enter here once 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.579
 identify and then easy 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.790
 under the other protocol we do 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:04:01.030
 the same release again on yes and 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.500
 which, of course, comes to us 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.560
 not only the samba 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.660
 protocol not only the apple file 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.019
 protocol use but it works 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.940
 the ftp protocol so the file transfer 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.950
 protocol 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.900
 there is also plenty of servers in the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.870
 maybe you also have internet 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.150
 somewhere to distant address one 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.590
 a server on which he access 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.990
 also want to go here with the 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.449
 on board the enemies of mac os 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.840
 6 brings that means you do not need 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.000
 times a ftp program here too 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.979
 Then we click after we all 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.770
 just have to connect to connect 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.770
 I have to stay here again 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.770
 identify 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.690
 and now he has all the release yet 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.320
 once opened and now with the 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.760
 ftp protocol 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.590
 this does not matter for us now 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.810
 difference and yes you can just 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.420
 all three protocols connect around you 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.150
 connect to one and the same server 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.710
 or with any servers easy 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.760
 using the appropriate 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.740
 protocol also brings here 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.960
 dialog window here below also one more 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.180
 browse button with if he is on it 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.640
 clicks it comes automatically goes in here 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.460
 enemies fine window on and you 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.890
 you see already is the rubric 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.020
 network and be selected here 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.880
 virtually all released and server the 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.590
 available anywhere on your network 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.130
 are and are findable here 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.500
 displayed when you see this on the front 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.290
 rider clicks to open the whole 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.970
 then we can already see the releases here 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.920
 which this server provides 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.820
 depending on some servers it is 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.680
 even forbidden by certain 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.960
 restrictions for the user or for 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.360
 a hospitable at all to indicate that 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.920
 released because there are depending on the if 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.570
 the unlocked is that a guest 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.120
 then you can see that too 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.790
 Here are some release names already in there 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.980
 here are links below the releases 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.050
 dive these dive the most 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.690
 Participants from this list also except 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:09.790
 that enemy window should be too small 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:11.320
 that's why the rubric network yes me 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.310
 Just recommend it to everyone 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.920
 try 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.660
 maybe here with one too 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.430
 a corresponding network name not 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.690
 necessarily with the ip-address maybe 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.790
 also with a server somewhere in the 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.520
 Internet stands and I think that's one 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:27.010
 very comfortable simple variant without 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.690
 great in the app in addition to 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.480
 just use one here 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.920
 network drive to connect and data 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.170
 to copy back and forth 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.440
 thank you very much for the next time 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.440
 watch
