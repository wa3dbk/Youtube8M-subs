00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.869
 start telling 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.119
 and so I'm glad if you then 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.869
 times a recipe then tried 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.860
 my turkish asian pasta salad and 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.790
 now it can start with the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.950
 ingredients 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.240
 we either need glass noodles or 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.030
 rice noodles and you can find them at 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.540
 asians or even larger 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.490
 grocery stores should you the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.939
 find everywhere and water now first 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.740
 for the noodles in themselves are so here 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.740
 now already noodles 100 grams 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.380
 a bowl and you can put those in the 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.480
 So packaging separate a son 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.300
 because here is always 100 sick 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.010
 are then always five pieces in it and 100 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.810
 km are enough here now in the first 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:02:00.530
 here and there comes hot water 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:02.450
 on it so beautifully covered and then there 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.240
 it something so if you have it in the pot 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.430
 make a cover or keep it on and 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.380
 let it rest for about eight minutes 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.680
 and in the meantime you can go to 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.910
 example vegetable balances so I have that 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.910
 Of course, vegetables now 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.540
 I have prepared here 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.860
 spring onions i find myself in the ring 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.990
 then I have cut 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.480
 cocktail tomatoes have something bigger 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.350
 I then paid attention then I have here 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.330
 pointed paprika red and a carrot the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.160
 I just found myself in such donors 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.990
 cut and the quantities found 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.960
 her as always all down in the infobox 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.580
 or because they are the variant of kerstins 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.910
 Kitchens dream to do in their 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.670
 infobox and that's what we need here now 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.280
 vegetables and vegetables will be here 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.320
 pure in the bowl and mix it 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.390
 now a little bit in it 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.040
 so that afterwards easier with the 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.040
 distributed glass noodles 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.340
 and I admit also first for now 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.490
 side so and now we come to 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.500
 tracking and here is the now 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.470
 part of me then, so to speak, something 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.280
 I 've changed something 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.980
 sesame oil then I have olive oil for you 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.080
 Here I have a pomegranate syrup 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.180
 radek bowl calls itself and me 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.220
 love the whole and I have the last 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.530
 day as I said already fit 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.590
 excellent in this salad then have 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.050
 I have a hot pepper market here 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.820
 So it fits the sheep I have because I 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.430
 now here do not send chili pods 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.100
 I use this here and here 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.650
 i have so jallohs i use one 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.050
 without flavor enhancer without glutamate 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.570
 so without chemical produced 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.880
 glutamate contains soy sauce by itself 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.260
 even natural glutamate 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.750
 and here I have one with the juice 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.170
 I also squeezed out lemon 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.590
 chilli flakes here really 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.770
 very very spicy chiliflocken something 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.630
 sugar and garlic and if not 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.040
 then I give it then almost like that 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.770
 yes, I'm right , I'll give one more 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.040
 Add a little salt so I would have 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.060
 now first my knobler in the 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.530
 current runs in then I give something of 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:25.100
 my pastor paprika and although a 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.100
 heaped teaspoon around the soy sauce 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:43.549
 then some of the pomegranate zero olive oil 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:46.469
 sesame oil and also sugar 

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:51.389
 chiliflocken and now everything will be nice 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:52.799
 together vermixt me there's yet 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.579
 a little salt purely because I 

00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:57.899
 I took a little less soy sauce 

00:04:55.579 --> 00:05:00.779
 and that's why I'm taking it with me now 

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:02.669
 the salt from so my noodles I have 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.949
 let me drain already and now 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.779
 under the cold water a bit 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.019
 played out because they were too hot for me 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:13.939
 and that's fine 

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:19.289
 and now I give my vegetables that 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:20.729
 and of course the dressing wish 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.039
 I have two Fork Me and it goes 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.029
 easier with glass noodles or just 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.949
 white noodles 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:31.229
 I just have everything with it 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:33.389
 so unfortunately you are with each other 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.610
 Of course the vegetables are not quite in the 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.139
 Distribute noodles if you want you can 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.879
 the noodles too with a shard like this 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.129
 cut a bit smaller 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:43.139
 what shall I leave it so me 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.929
 I do not mind that I give it vegetables 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.959
 so just do something about it and 

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:51.779
 finished a delicious turkish 

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:54.419
