 pigments with you I am well, that's probably Kostya 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.859
 long-awaited review of my computer 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.700
 there will be a full full review now 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.559
 computer not be lazy I tell you how u 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.250
 I do not have a super camera I will shoot on 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.760
 iphone 4s pretty good camera 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.340
 certainly not like 5s but I think that's enough 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.119
 well let's start with the monitor this 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.300
 television 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.170
 I connect him to xbox computer now 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.040
 connected via hdmi cable diagonal 32 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.040
 an inch 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.950
 pretty good tv but everything 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.510
 same size and resolution to such 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.989
 small size it is not enough headphones 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.070
 razer tiamat 71 beautiful sound 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.579
 the price is of course up to high these headphones 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.190
 for me they are worth it now sound 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.500
 No, we are still quite normal 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.699
 pulls sound like there is this support 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.619
 sim1 when the money will be purchased 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.330
 myself and there is some sound 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.270
 inexpensive thousand for 6 I removed the cap 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.880
 The front of the case of the musa was all visible 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.180
 and now this keyboard so give keyboard 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.540
 stalker something like this and a trader of course 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.189
 also the rug is also a raiser mouse 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.759
 super true elite 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.869
 exim because razer taipan soon ko 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.530
 I will come what is the case of the case cooler 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.189
 master 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.130
 se combination let's say 1 and 2 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.500
 but much more expensive than the first and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.689
 cheaper 2 let's say the golden mean 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:54.689
 so well, probably now the insides will 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:58.740
 watch computer start with ssd ssd on 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.780
 120 gigabytes cost him 5,000 her 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.420
 hard on 1 terabyte 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.810
 it cost me about 3,500 somewhere like that 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.209
 video card 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.099
 gtx690 took from asus 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:21.730
 if you took not from asusa saved b6000 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:25.810
 us i love thermaltake power pack 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:29.209
 1200 watt gold series and he got me in 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.080
 12,500 somewhere so well, or 12 is not exactly 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.940
 I remember ask why such power well 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.830
 Probably then I will sell 1 690 palette 780 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.220
 whether two titanium oars and put in 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.430
 overall extra power will not interfere with the processor 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.700
 intel core i7 3770k 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.630
 it cools all this matter so ready 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.410
 and a layer called thermaltake 760 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.739
 plus a lot thermaltake does not cool 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.810
 very good here is pure prose for him 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.630
 by now the houses are connected very well 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.599
 cools down the processor is not heated well 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.500
 here is itself a cold motherboard 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:15.980
 me asus 5 extreme pretty good 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.980
 motherboard so RAM RAMA 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.989
 me 2 slats of 8 gigabytes kingston 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.420
 superfood pucker x Purity 2400 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.980
 very good RAM think now 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.950
 I do not need more than 16 completely 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.489
 so his hands were shaking back and forth it is necessary to go 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.910
 buy or super truper expensive camera and 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:44.030

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.019

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.170
 Dimensions Well, they stuck to him the number 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:55.250

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.160
 drive water drive or how is it shorter from 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.290
 this and the elephant failed to shove it 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.900
 basically me 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.680
 Indian me, do not use Windows 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.750
