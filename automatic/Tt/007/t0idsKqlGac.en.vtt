00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.019
 there we have it, it's that simple 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.260
 we could close this I'll leave you the 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.149
 link also below so that 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.630
 accedÃ¡is it fast and come to us 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.390
 downloads we open downloads and here what 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.460
 we have this application works for 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.979
 the following way as is and you have it 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.229
 in downloads do not download applications 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.810
 we go to applications and here we have it 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.899
 then you double click 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.350
 it opens and here we have and this already 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.729
 we could if you want to close here 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.280
 the way I use it myself and I 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.649
 it works quite well enough and it gives me 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.070
 few problems is the following we give 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:39.970
 to this to this sign of the most you give here 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.000
 and here there are many versions worth 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.329
 I do not know why not yet no no I do not know why 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.360
 this happens to me still but the one that better me 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.420
 it works is this the last version that 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.729
 have a md speed 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.700
 we select this and we give it here 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.170
 download urges and we say yes and 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.170
 here you start to download 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.140
 and here we would have it this is all that 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.209
 we need a ticket and now we are going to 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.890
 create from here to create the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.870
 wrapper is valid for the application in 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.989
 this exe point case that we want not 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.440
 then we apply it with this in blue and 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:25.599
 we prick you here to create new bank reason 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.750
 or new wrap something like that here 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:32.060
 normally the name of the game is put 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.090
 the launcher or the application that you want 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.660
 install even from windows that I in 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.950
 this case let's go let's do I 'm going to 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.950
 to do is a little bit smaller 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.660
 and in this case you want to install this 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.950
 as you can see exe is a launcher of a 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.590
 game that I want to prove that I have been told 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.390
 that is pretty good then here what 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.290
 what we would have to put is the name 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.290
 of the game this 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.110
 h 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.750
 to her 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.750
 I put it like that and I give it to ok 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.790
 in study we could close it 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.090
 and nothing here has to wait a bit like 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.090
 forever 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.200
 we have to wait it does not take long but 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.390
 something slow here is generating queues and 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.490
 that tells you that there is the launcher that 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.410
 we are creating vale that I will teach you 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.390
 where is it you can change it if you want 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.390
 of site also good 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.569
 ok here you give ok ok ok what 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.510
 teaches in the finder veis says that it has 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.110
 created within you use in this case my 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.360
 name applications and within the is 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.020
 wayne skin vale we give him that he does not 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.690
 teach you see here is this although it has 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.959
 this drawing is worth everything goes with 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.230
 this drawing but the environment is already 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.740
 windows within the brand is worth so that 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.140
 you can 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.650
 put the game there in this case it's worth 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.129
 here we could close this 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.290
 and in this case here we double click 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:16.680
 if for whatever it is not opened it is worth 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.970
 then you give nothing here to open because there 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.820
 Sometimes it does not open with double click 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.460
 we give nothing and here what we 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.300
 let's do is install 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.190
 the executable that we want exe 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.289
 here as if they were windows then you 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.920
 we give install we give this to the 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.730
 first i'm setup 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.830
 Here he tells us to choose the file that 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.290
 we want or that is the document that we want 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.190
 how is it theoretically is of 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:48.660
 agreement I give here and choice and here 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.030
 starts 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.900
 ok this takes a little bit but you see 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.850
 this is the launcher that is for windows 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.930
 it's really worth it from a game they say 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.000
 that we are very well that I want it 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.180
 to prove the truth it's ok in Russian I'll 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.890
 I understand Russian but more or less I already 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.810
 read how it works is this is already the 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.730
 launcher of this is already what it looks like in 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.420
 windows you do not eat your head so much 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.760
 a virtual windows and it does not take away so many 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.650
 resources and here I am downloading 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.630
 game is worth it for whatever it is 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.100
 depending it takes more or less is this worth 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.470
 it would be good windows, you can see it 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.200
 which is how good it is then 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.700
 nothing here I leave it unloading 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.700
 and what I want to teach you 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.070
 if I did not have the finder here open 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.639
 that we have told you about April 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.850
 you go to your disk good to follow the 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:43.320
 route that they that the program has 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.290
 said said users worth 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.690
 william applications and here we have 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.400
 the program and in here if everything 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.190
 it's fine has to be the file that 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.300
 it is being generated now 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:59.030
 and here we have it later for 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.550
 start the game or the program that 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.590
 install you have to come to this logo os 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.080
 can you create 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.580
 an alias or what you want for example 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.580
 see create alias 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.300
 and the alias of grace 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:23.170
 and itching loyal fall within this 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.640
 of the game that in theory is windows ok 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.280
 I do not expect anything that has served you and 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.610
 if for whatever reason you have some problem 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:36.270
