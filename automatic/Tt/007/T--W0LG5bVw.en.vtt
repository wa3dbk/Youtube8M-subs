00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
as I know though he hasn't picked one

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.350 
as I know though he hasn't picked one
for<00:00:59.469> a<00:00:59.829> nest<00:01:00.280> he<00:01:00.640> tends<00:01:01.390> to<00:01:01.600> go<00:01:01.720> up<00:01:01.750> at<00:01:02.019> night

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
for a nest he tends to go up at night

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.820 
for a nest he tends to go up at night
and<00:01:04.360> I<00:01:04.509> really<00:01:04.780> just<00:01:04.809> don't<00:01:05.080> know<00:01:05.290> where<00:01:05.530> we

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
and I really just don't know where we

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.590 
and I really just don't know where we
have<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.070> many<00:01:06.159> nest<00:01:06.460> boxes<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:07.060> mean<00:01:07.360> so<00:01:07.509> many

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
have so many nest boxes I mean so many

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.510 
have so many nest boxes I mean so many
nests<00:01:07.869> in<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.170> trees<00:01:11.040> speaking<00:01:12.040> of<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.250> so

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
nests in the trees speaking of that so

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.490 
nests in the trees speaking of that so
there's<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:12.909> box<00:01:13.119> if<00:01:13.600> you<00:01:13.690> follow<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:14.080> big

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
there's the box if you follow this big

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.100 
there's the box if you follow this big
old<00:01:14.970> thing<00:01:15.970> there's<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.619> big<00:01:17.619> nest<00:01:17.950> right<00:01:18.190> there

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
old thing there's a big nest right there

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.060 
old thing there's a big nest right there
when<00:01:20.110> every<00:01:20.350> time<00:01:20.380> I<00:01:20.560> look<00:01:20.679> at<00:01:20.770> this<00:01:20.890> one

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
when every time I look at this one

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.730 
when every time I look at this one
that's<00:01:21.220> just<00:01:21.280> getting<00:01:21.490> bigger

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.870
