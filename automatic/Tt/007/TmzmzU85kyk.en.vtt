00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
forward beyond the galaxy s3 but it is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.229 
forward beyond the galaxy s3 but it is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
taking that phone inching it a little

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.119 
taking that phone inching it a little
throwing<00:00:45.629> almost<00:00:45.840> every<00:00:46.230> spec<00:00:46.469> imaginable<00:00:46.980> in

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.799 
throwing almost every spec imaginable in
it<00:00:47.250> getting<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> screen<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> little<00:00:48.390> bigger<00:00:48.570> so

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
it getting the screen a little bigger so

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
it getting the screen a little bigger so
it's<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.170> nice<00:00:49.320> little<00:00:49.469> push<00:00:49.770> forward<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.640> them

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it's a nice little push forward for them

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.470 
it's a nice little push forward for them
and<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.210> going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.449> very

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
and I think it's going to be very

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.200 
and I think it's going to be very
successful<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:52.829> far<00:00:53.070> as<00:00:53.190> s3<00:00:53.640> users<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.120> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
successful as far as s3 users is it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.060 
successful as far as s3 users is it
worth<00:00:54.420> them<00:00:54.780> breaking<00:00:55.110> contract<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> get<00:00:55.949> this

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
worth them breaking contract to get this

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.979 
worth them breaking contract to get this
phone<00:00:56.250> you'll<00:00:56.940> probably<00:00:57.149> not<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.780> know<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
phone you'll probably not and we know it

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:58.819 
phone you'll probably not and we know it
depend<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.230> what<00:00:58.350> kind<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.530> deals<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
depend on what kind of deals that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.229 
depend on what kind of deals that
carriers<00:00:59.219> offer<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.609> they<00:00:59.760> come<00:00:59.910> back<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
carriers offer if they come back and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
carriers offer if they come back and
they<00:01:00.329> say<00:01:00.510> well<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.199> extend<00:01:02.070> your

off<00:01:04.040> possibly<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.460> don't<00:01:05.640> think<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
off possibly but I don't think are the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.090 
off possibly but I don't think are the
outset<00:01:06.479> not<00:01:06.780> really<00:01:07.020> an<00:01:07.320> outside<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
jumping platforms I mean do you really

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.609 
jumping platforms I mean do you really

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
hands on the s4 no I don't know anything
if<00:01:15.810> maybe<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.009> somebody's<00:01:17.460> really

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
committed to iOS they always have been

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.840 
committed to iOS they always have been
there<00:01:19.409> probably<00:01:19.619> always<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.640> I

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
there probably always going to be so I

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.670 
there probably always going to be so I
don't<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.689> phone<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.170> particular

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
don't see this phone in particular

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620 
don't see this phone in particular
making<00:01:23.310> someone<00:01:23.610> switch<00:01:23.790> over<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> Android<00:01:24.390> I

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
making someone switch over to Android I

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.999 
making someone switch over to Android I
think<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.350> difficult<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.830> talk

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
think it's really difficult to talk

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.039 
think it's really difficult to talk
about<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.400> s4<00:01:26.820> release<00:01:27.090> without<00:01:27.299> talking

about the s4 release without talking

about the phone because then they'd be

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.830

think yesterday was quite what they

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.350 
think yesterday was quite what they
should<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:16.890> done<00:02:16.980> as<00:02:17.610> far<00:02:17.880> as<00:02:18.030> some<00:02:18.210> of<00:02:18.270> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
should have done as far as some of the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.150 
should have done as far as some of the
performances<00:02:18.690> on<00:02:18.960> stage<00:02:19.080> but<00:02:19.470> it's<00:02:19.890> very

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
performances on stage but it's very

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.560

Samsung<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.940> do<00:02:21.060> what<00:02:21.180> they<00:02:21.270> did<00:02:21.330> yesterday

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
Samsung to do what they did yesterday

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.420 
Samsung to do what they did yesterday
little<00:02:22.170> bizarre<00:02:22.320> try<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> little<00:02:23.130> crazy

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
little bizarre try to be a little crazy

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.610 
little bizarre try to be a little crazy
but<00:02:23.640> maybe<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.660> execution<00:02:25.110> not<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.470> what

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
but maybe the execution not really what

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.380 
but maybe the execution not really what
it<00:02:25.710> should<00:02:25.890> be<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.580> think<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.150> really

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
it should be do you think it really

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.170 
it should be do you think it really
resonated<00:02:27.930> with<00:02:28.050> their<00:02:28.260> target<00:02:28.740> audience

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180

resonated with their target audience
well<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.210> don't<00:02:30.390> think<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.990> don't<00:02:31.110> know

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
well I don't think that I don't know

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.720 
well I don't think that I don't know
what<00:02:31.380> their<00:02:31.530> target<00:02:31.830> audience<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.550> guess

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
what their target audience is I guess

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.370
