00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.289
 like everyone else it's schumi is 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.300
 today I will teach you to 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.669
 how to remove a legal notice 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.430
 of authorship then actually you are 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:25.340
 many to have this type of problems to 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.919
 know a copyright of often by a 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.169
 music that stops you from being able to - 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.300
 use your videos and of course it's 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.710
 which is quite blocking especially that this 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.630
 can take you later before a 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.430
 strike and if you are partners in 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.950
 within the detours that it can you too 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.410
 take you to be fired from your own 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.660
 network so that can actually be 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.530
 solution for those who wish to leave 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.180
 from their own network 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.860
 however, care must be taken 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.590
 that these also gets to strike 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.510
 they were very careful so 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.120
 this video I used a string 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.920
 as an example it is the chain i famous eagle 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.660
 sports to which of course invites you 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.250
 to subscribe if you are a fan of ea 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.440
 sports 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.119
 so we will go on manager of 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.920
 videos 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.479
 it must be fast on video manager 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.490
 you will see here said his great 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.630
 height then if you do not have an opinion 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.979
 copyright is quite 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.139
 normal because you do not have 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.179
 of strike denis david of rothschild reviews 

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:18.920
 of copyright necessarily on video this 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.840
 which is very very good for 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.310
 you unfortunately for this channel 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.209
 it's a bad example 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.920
 selanne of the class she has notices of 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:28.579
 the author and that's exactly what we're going 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.310
 identify 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:36.529
 so we see on it and the first 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.529
 thing that homework identify this is 

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:41.450
 at the display level 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:41.869
 this is the warning to reach at 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.060
 copyright 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.909
 you have to know that a warning is 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.969
 a strike and after three strike 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.999
 your youtube account is removed is 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.459
 blocked we could have access a 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.139
 so the bag is very very very 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.759
 Warning 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:00.859
 so there we can see yao k strike 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.139
 so it's perfect we can go there 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.359
 on the other hand at the level of 

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:07.350
 content correspondence there is the 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.929
 bonnet is the bonnet of a donkey 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.450
 so we'll go on we'll start 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.819
 by which we will start by going on 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.610
 the fraq minsk movie go it's gone 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.920
 we're going to change what we can see 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.440
 a massey mark if the presence of a 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.930
 copyright content we see them on 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.090
 monetization and here is what appears to 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.989
 ewi that's what's blocking us 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.209
 and yes you have something like that 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.100
 necessarily everything and crisis and could nothing 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.930
 to do that we hear that your 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.200
 video is not monetizing it however 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.390
 that's what said hey yes you can 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.819
 delete the romantic piece and is 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.500
 just spent what we're going to do 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.069
 so we go then I block the music 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.319
 for Easter 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.630
 finally the music are earlier and here 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.290
 that's really the thing youtube could 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.930
 we bring 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.810
 know that this novelty dates very 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.150
 recent it dates from March 17 a its very end 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.850
 not of the week of March 17th when really 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.069
 youtube could improve their system 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.820
 musical identification and what is 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.410
 really top 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.230
 because we can ourselves we 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.390
 can just delete this copyright 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.440
 so we can monetize our videos 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.980
 what is top then and what we 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.770
 interest me the most it's his voice the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.810
 see 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.380
 that's just that sentence she 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.070
 is magic she is totally magical 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.770
 that is, we can very well 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.890
 removed this is this android content 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.750
 port us credit in short one in 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.030
 just click delete this 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.910
 title is of course if you do not like 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.640
 not that there is a throne a hole at the level 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.220
 of sound compared to your video you 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.610
 can of course add music 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.560
 among the hundred and fifty thousand titles 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.340
 contents within the library 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.770
 youtube what you give to enough choice 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.650
 quite a lot, we have to say it well 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.260
 heard if you add a life 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.810
 a music from the library and that 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.180
 you do to the buttocks excuse me and 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.820
 that you do a faith how tahri 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.730
 necessarily it will suppress your voice and 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.959
 it'll put the music on it so 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.930
 which is quite problematic 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.090
 unfortunately we have the same time we have 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.790
 that you do not have the technologies between 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.230
 voice identification and help with 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.020
 music in the background which is enough 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.600
 difficult and you understand yourself well 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.030
 So this is not simply that is how 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.100
 delete a notice from the author 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.710
 simply to remove that title from 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.270
 to record and know where I 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.670
 let go and if what is six media 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.580
 or care to leave an hour and 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.720
 check if the video is automatically 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.400
 rv 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.100
 excuse me part claimed but at the top 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.230
 automatically monetize your video this 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.590
 is not the case words used by you 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.630
 even the video of course so that's it 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.640
 you know a little while while by 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.800
 relation to how to remove to life from 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.720
 the author do not hesitate to share this 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.730

 even questions so do not hesitate 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.860
