in<00:01:33.440> what<00:01:33.890> is<00:01:34.040> obviously<00:01:34.430> not<00:01:34.729> an<00:01:34.910> airtight

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
in what is obviously not an airtight

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.970 

now<00:01:56.690> when<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.930> tower<00:01:57.110> first<00:01:57.350> came<00:01:57.590> out<00:01:57.740> the

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
now when the tower first came out the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.800 
now when the tower first came out the
very<00:01:58.160> first<00:01:58.190> version<00:01:58.730> of<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.910> car<00:01:59.150> you<00:01:59.720> know

very first version of the car you know

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.970 
very first version of the car you know
there<00:01:59.990> was<00:02:00.080> something<00:02:00.230> of<00:02:00.440> enema<00:02:00.710> instead

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
there was something of enema instead

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
there was something of enema instead
which<00:02:01.100> was<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.250> little<00:02:01.460> bit<00:02:01.550> uncharitable

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
which was a little bit uncharitable

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.170 
which was a little bit uncharitable
perhaps<00:02:02.480> saying<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:04.430> Mahindra<00:02:04.640> design

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
perhaps saying that the Mahindra design

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.760 
perhaps saying that the Mahindra design
team<00:02:05.420> really<00:02:05.660> had<00:02:05.780> fun<00:02:05.990> with<00:02:06.230> this<00:02:06.350> vehicle

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
thought I said the same on CNB as well

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.750 
thought I said the same on CNB as well
that<00:02:33.320> hey<00:02:33.680> hang<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:33.950> guys<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:34.700> a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
that hey hang on guys this is just a

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.100 
that hey hang on guys this is just a
little<00:02:34.940> bit<00:02:35.030> too<00:02:35.180> crude<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.570> plastic<00:02:35.930> quality

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
little bit too crude the plastic quality

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.650 
little bit too crude the plastic quality
the<00:02:36.800> way<00:02:36.920> it's<00:02:37.040> been<00:02:37.130> fit<00:02:37.370> together<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:38.090> not

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
the way it's been fit together it's not

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.050 
the way it's been fit together it's not
really<00:02:39.020> working<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:40.220> big<00:02:40.370> missing<00:02:40.670> point

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
really working and the big missing point

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.550 
really working and the big missing point
the<00:02:41.270> missing<00:02:41.540> link<00:02:41.750> was<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.140> fact<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.380> there

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
the missing link was the fact that there

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.380 
the missing link was the fact that there
was<00:02:42.680> no<00:02:42.860> air<00:02:43.400> conditioning<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.120> now<00:02:44.239> you've

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
was no air conditioning and now you've

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.440 
was no air conditioning and now you've
got<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.440> again<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.700> has<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.030> chance<00:02:47.239> to

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
got that so again it has the chance to

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.210 
got that so again it has the chance to
really<00:02:47.630> sort<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:47.930> boost<00:02:48.140> itself<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.739> become<00:02:49.040> a

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
really sort of boost itself and become a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.360 
really sort of boost itself and become a
little<00:02:49.640> bit<00:02:49.850> more<00:02:49.910> lifestyle<00:02:50.510> oriented<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
little bit more lifestyle oriented the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.880 
little bit more lifestyle oriented the
big<00:02:52.550> huge<00:02:52.940> truck<00:02:53.840> like<00:02:54.020> steering<00:02:54.260> wheel<00:02:54.590> the

big huge truck like steering wheel the

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
very basic instrument cluster and the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.350 
very basic instrument cluster and the
crude<00:02:57.680> sort<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.100> plastics<00:02:58.459> continue<00:02:58.910> here<00:02:59.150> on

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
crude sort of plastics continue here on

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.820 
crude sort of plastics continue here on
the<00:02:59.540> AC<00:02:59.959> you're<00:03:00.200> not<00:03:00.290> really<00:03:00.470> sure<00:03:00.530> how<00:03:00.769> the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
the AC you're not really sure how the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.460 
the AC you're not really sure how the
functionality<00:03:01.549> works<00:03:01.790> off<00:03:02.030> on<00:03:02.750> is<00:03:03.080> just<00:03:03.380> for

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
functionality works off on is just for

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.350 
functionality works off on is just for
the<00:03:03.530> heater<00:03:03.739> not<00:03:04.160> for<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.430> AC<00:03:04.610> then<00:03:05.269> you've

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
the heater not for the AC then you've

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.090 
the heater not for the AC then you've
got<00:03:05.450> another<00:03:05.510> off<00:03:05.840> on<00:03:06.110> over<00:03:06.320> here<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.950> it's<00:03:07.040> a

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
got another off on over here so it's a

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.560 
got another off on over here so it's a
little<00:03:07.280> confusing<00:03:07.430> you're<00:03:08.000> not<00:03:08.090> sure<00:03:08.269> the<00:03:08.420> red

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
light really means the point I'm trying

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.390 
light really means the point I'm trying
to<00:03:10.580> make<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.170> once<00:03:12.170> again<00:03:12.260> same<00:03:13.160> thing<00:03:13.310> I

this<00:03:35.420> is<00:03:35.600> great<00:03:35.989> for<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.260> sort<00:03:36.500> of<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.590> rural

audience but it continues to remain just

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.229 
audience but it continues to remain just
a<00:03:39.620> little<00:03:39.799> bit<00:03:39.890> lacking<00:03:40.100> up<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.790> price<00:03:41.000> if<00:03:41.150> you

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
a little bit lacking up the price if you

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.910 
a little bit lacking up the price if you

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
one's been souped up it's not just the

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
base standard spec you've got this huge

base standard spec you've got this huge
bull<00:05:01.040> bar<00:05:01.250> in<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.460> front<00:05:01.730> with<00:05:01.940> extra<00:05:02.780> fog

bull bar in the front with extra fog
lights<00:05:03.200> on<00:05:03.440> it<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:04.010> bumper<00:05:04.310> itself<00:05:04.640> has<00:05:04.880> a

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
lights on it the bumper itself has a

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.130 
lights on it the bumper itself has a
little<00:05:05.180> extension<00:05:05.450> it<00:05:05.720> sort<00:05:05.900> of<00:05:05.960> sticks

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
little extension it sort of sticks

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.770 
little extension it sort of sticks
outwards<00:05:06.650> and<00:05:07.300> makes<00:05:08.300> the<00:05:08.419> whole<00:05:08.570> way<00:05:08.720> you

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
outwards and makes the whole way you

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.140 
outwards and makes the whole way you
look<00:05:09.080> even<00:05:09.410> more<00:05:09.440> butch<00:05:09.860> than<00:05:10.130> it<00:05:10.250> is<00:05:10.370> in<00:05:10.850> black

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
look even more butch than it is in black

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.460 
look even more butch than it is in black
it<00:05:11.360> tends<00:05:11.510> to<00:05:11.570> look<00:05:11.720> a<00:05:11.750> little<00:05:11.870> upmarket<00:05:12.260> and

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
it tends to look a little upmarket and

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.870 
it tends to look a little upmarket and
so<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:12.740> think<00:05:12.980> some<00:05:13.130> of<00:05:13.160> those<00:05:13.310> additions<00:05:13.700> might

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
so I think some of those additions might

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.330 
so I think some of those additions might
work<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.990> side<00:05:15.200> steps<00:05:15.530> been<00:05:15.770> added<00:05:16.070> on<00:05:16.190> as

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
work the side steps been added on as

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.590 
work the side steps been added on as
well<00:05:16.520> that's<00:05:16.730> not<00:05:16.850> standard<00:05:17.390> it's<00:05:17.510> an

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
well that's not standard it's an

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.360
