see<00:02:20.280> kind<00:02:21.280> of<00:02:21.400> convinced<00:02:21.850> me<00:02:22.150> now<00:02:22.690> with<00:02:23.110> soft

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
see kind of convinced me now with soft

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.960 
see kind of convinced me now with soft
scrub<00:02:23.680> that's<00:02:23.920> more<00:02:24.100> of<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.250> liquidy<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:24.820> we

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
scrub that's more of a liquidy so we

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.460 
scrub that's more of a liquidy so we
really<00:02:25.300> don't<00:02:25.480> need<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.660> fool<00:02:25.989> around<00:02:26.140> too

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
really don't need to fool around too

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:36.470 
really don't need to fool around too
much<00:02:26.620> with<00:02:26.800> water<00:02:27.130> put<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.790> soft<00:02:28.030> car

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.010 

now<00:02:37.020> in<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.319> case<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.830> would<00:02:38.220> you

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
now in a case like this would you

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.390 
now in a case like this would you
probably<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.290> looks<00:02:40.319> like<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:40.950> almost<00:02:41.190> would

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
probably it looks like it almost would

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.770 
probably it looks like it almost would
be<00:02:41.550> easy<00:02:41.760> buddy<00:02:42.090> do<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.330> whole<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.750> whole

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
be easy buddy do the whole the whole

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:56.559 
be easy buddy do the whole the whole
area<00:02:43.379> okay<00:02:44.280> all<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.540> area<00:02:45.989> okay<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.870> often

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.330 

this<00:02:57.569> unsure<00:02:58.019> works<00:02:58.319> way<00:02:58.590> better<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340
