well<00:04:34.139> my<00:04:34.320> powers<00:04:34.680> absolutely<00:04:35.160> worthless<00:04:35.370> here

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.670 

the<00:04:38.910> power<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.660> wheels<00:04:42.139> go<00:04:43.139> through<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.500> door

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
the power of wheels go through the door

00:04:43.680 --> 00:05:01.159 
the power of wheels go through the door
could<00:04:43.979> be<00:04:50.030> careful<00:04:51.030> let's<00:04:51.150> pitch<00:04:51.419> ah<00:04:59.660> no<00:05:00.660> not

the<00:05:01.380> exploding<00:05:01.770> coconut<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:03.410> at<00:05:04.410> least<00:05:04.560> this

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
the exploding coconut is at least this

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.230 
the exploding coconut is at least this
time<00:05:04.919> they're<00:05:05.130> actually<00:05:05.370> growing<00:05:05.790> on<00:05:06.030> trees

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
time they're actually growing on trees

time they're actually growing on trees
so<00:05:06.690> somewhat<00:05:07.290> kind<00:05:07.710> of<00:05:07.889> rational<00:05:09.620> eat<00:05:10.760> ouch

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
so somewhat kind of rational eat ouch

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.629 
so somewhat kind of rational eat ouch
and<00:05:12.750> I<00:05:12.840> lose<00:05:12.960> wheely<00:05:13.350> power<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.979> I<00:05:14.340> get<00:05:14.490> it
