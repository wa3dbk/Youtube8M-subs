00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.570 

we<00:00:28.880> really<00:00:29.270> wanted<00:00:29.600> something<00:00:30.110> unique<00:00:30.580> and

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
we really wanted something unique and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.290 
we really wanted something unique and
real<00:00:32.360> incentive<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.910> thought<00:00:34.910> it<00:00:35.060> would<00:00:35.180> be

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
real incentive and thought it would be

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.110 
real incentive and thought it would be
really<00:00:35.480> nice<00:00:35.690> to<00:00:35.750> have<00:00:36.080> a<00:00:36.140> taste<00:00:36.890> of<00:00:37.130> the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
really nice to have a taste of the

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.260 
really nice to have a taste of the
hitman<00:00:38.450> fantasy<00:00:41.380> basically<00:00:42.380> we<00:00:42.590> were

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
hitman fantasy basically we were

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.540 
hitman fantasy basically we were
discussing<00:00:44.270> a<00:00:44.510> lot<00:00:44.660> how<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:44.900> make<00:00:45.230> a

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
discussing a lot how to make a

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.549 
discussing a lot how to make a
interesting<00:00:46.550> free<00:00:47.180> or<00:00:47.270> incentive<00:00:47.870> for<00:00:48.500> a

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
interesting free or incentive for a

00:00:48.559 --> 00:01:07.470 
interesting free or incentive for a
solution

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.480 

we<00:01:08.480> had<00:01:08.600> all<00:01:08.750> kinds<00:01:09.080> of<00:01:09.140> ideas<00:01:09.320> about<00:01:09.950> what<00:01:10.370> we

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
we had all kinds of ideas about what we

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.760 
we had all kinds of ideas about what we
could<00:01:10.670> do<00:01:10.760> with<00:01:10.880> levels<00:01:11.360> or<00:01:11.570> characters<00:01:12.530> or

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
could do with levels or characters or

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.550 
could do with levels or characters or
weapons<00:01:13.100> and<00:01:13.370> then<00:01:13.520> there<00:01:14.300> was<00:01:14.420> this<00:01:14.660> we<00:01:15.440> had

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
weapons and then there was this we had

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.380 
weapons and then there was this we had
like<00:01:15.830> an<00:01:15.950> old<00:01:16.130> design<00:01:16.550> of<00:01:16.880> like<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.090> sniper

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
like an old design of like a sniper

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.350 
like an old design of like a sniper
challenge<00:01:17.810> map<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.950> was<00:01:19.070> not<00:01:19.220> meant<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.210> be<00:01:20.330> a

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
challenge map it was not meant to be a

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.150 
challenge map it was not meant to be a
part<00:01:20.660> of<00:01:20.720> hitman<00:01:21.020> solution<00:01:21.470> was<00:01:21.560> not<00:01:21.710> meant<00:01:21.979> to

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
part of hitman solution was not meant to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.710 
part of hitman solution was not meant to
be<00:01:22.190> anything<00:01:22.550> other<00:01:22.790> than<00:01:22.940> just<00:01:23.300> fun<00:01:23.479> for<00:01:23.660> the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
be anything other than just fun for the

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.750 
be anything other than just fun for the
company<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.650> was<00:01:24.800> actually<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:25.220> fun<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:25.460> the

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
company it was actually so fun that the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.640 
company it was actually so fun that the
rest<00:01:26.300> of<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.479> house<00:01:26.630> started<00:01:27.050> playing<00:01:27.260> it<00:01:27.440> you

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
rest of the house started playing it you

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.800 
rest of the house started playing it you
know<00:01:27.800> without<00:01:28.280> really<00:01:28.580> being<00:01:28.670> prompted<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:29.660> do

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
know without really being prompted to do

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.360 
know without really being prompted to do
so<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.260> that<00:01:30.440> told<00:01:30.650> us<00:01:30.740> we<00:01:30.860> had<00:01:30.890> something

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
so and that told us we had something

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.340 
so and that told us we had something
that<00:01:31.400> was<00:01:31.550> a<00:01:31.880> little<00:01:32.240> bit<00:01:32.600> out<00:01:33.080> of<00:01:33.140> the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
that was a little bit out of the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.050 
that was a little bit out of the
ordinary<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.950> we<00:01:34.070> figured<00:01:34.580> at<00:01:34.670> some<00:01:34.700> point

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
ordinary and we figured at some point

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.999 
ordinary and we figured at some point
that<00:01:35.240> this<00:01:35.810> might<00:01:36.050> actually<00:01:36.320> be<00:01:36.740> a<00:01:36.770> map<00:01:36.979> that

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
that this might actually be a map that

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.430 
that this might actually be a map that
we<00:01:37.310> can<00:01:37.460> use<00:01:37.490> for<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.970> for<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.210> game<00:01:38.450> we<00:01:39.229> knew

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
we can use for the for the game we knew

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.050 
we can use for the for the game we knew
that<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.740> fun<00:01:39.950> factor<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.430> quite<00:01:40.670> high<00:01:40.820> so<00:01:40.850> we

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
that the fun factor is quite high so we

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.180 
that the fun factor is quite high so we
just<00:01:41.360> needed<00:01:41.660> to<00:01:41.810> look<00:01:41.930> into<00:01:42.290> how<00:01:42.950> do<00:01:43.009> we

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
just needed to look into how do we

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.859 
just needed to look into how do we
implement<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:43.729> into<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.119> king<00:01:44.690> in<00:01:44.840> the

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
implement this into a king in the

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:54.160 
implement this into a king in the
hypnotist<00:01:51.310> it's<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.430> little<00:01:52.550> contained<00:01:53.509> game

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
hypnotist it's a little contained game

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.810 
hypnotist it's a little contained game
on<00:01:54.380> its<00:01:54.470> own<00:01:54.649> if<00:01:54.830> your<00:01:54.979> world<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:55.310> simple<00:01:55.700> you

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
on its own if your world it's simple you

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.520 
on its own if your world it's simple you
shoot<00:01:56.030> two<00:01:56.149> people<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.630> then<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:56.810> have<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:56.960> to

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
shoot two people and then you have to to

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.719 
shoot two people and then you have to to
figure<00:01:57.770> out<00:01:57.830> what<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.190> puzzle<00:01:58.490> you<00:01:58.610> have

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
figure out what is the puzzle you have

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.240 
figure out what is the puzzle you have
to<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:59.240> solve<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.630> not<00:01:59.750> alert<00:02:00.050> everyone<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:01.070> we

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
to to solve to not alert everyone and we

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.620 
to to solve to not alert everyone and we
actually<00:02:01.399> took<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.970> whole<00:02:02.090> concept<00:02:02.330> and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
actually took that the whole concept and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.499 
actually took that the whole concept and
said<00:02:02.750> okay<00:02:02.960> if<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:03.560> were<00:02:03.619> to<00:02:03.800> do<00:02:04.610> this<00:02:04.640> as<00:02:05.450> a

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
said okay if we were to do this as a

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.570 
said okay if we were to do this as a
product<00:02:05.840> how<00:02:06.050> would<00:02:06.229> that<00:02:06.320> then<00:02:06.560> be<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.010> that

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
product how would that then be and that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.190 
product how would that then be and that
turned<00:02:07.820> into<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.149> sniper<00:02:08.360> towers<00:02:08.720> it's

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
turned into the sniper towers it's

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.440 
turned into the sniper towers it's
teasing<00:02:09.500> a<00:02:09.739> lot<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:10.070> of<00:02:10.340> little<00:02:11.030> moments<00:02:11.420> that

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
teasing a lot of of little moments that

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.920 
teasing a lot of of little moments that
you<00:02:11.570> will<00:02:11.750> go<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:11.959> in<00:02:12.320> absolution

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
you will go to in absolution

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.990 
you will go to in absolution
but<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.409> not<00:02:13.560> directly<00:02:14.189> linked<00:02:14.459> that's<00:02:14.700> also

advanced AI and a lot of options so the
initial<00:02:29.280> phase<00:02:29.700> was<00:02:29.939> just<00:02:30.150> trying<00:02:30.359> to<00:02:30.420> figure

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
initial phase was just trying to figure

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.490 

really<00:04:34.090> wanted<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.750> create<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.020> bus<00:04:35.230> with<00:04:35.380> the

sniper<00:04:35.680> challenge<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.310> what<00:04:36.580> we<00:04:36.670> really

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
sniper challenge and what we really

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.340 
sniper challenge and what we really
thought<00:04:37.000> is<00:04:37.180> that<00:04:37.210> okay<00:04:37.900> we<00:04:38.020> do<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.170> few

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
thought is that okay we do a few

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.350 
thought is that okay we do a few
leaderboards<00:04:38.980> as<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.340> said<00:04:39.400> originally<00:04:40.240> this

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
leaderboards as I said originally this

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.000 
leaderboards as I said originally this
started<00:04:40.780> in<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.080> house<00:04:41.230> right<00:04:41.470> but<00:04:41.860> people

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
started in the house right but people

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.410 
started in the house right but people
actually<00:04:42.340> just<00:04:42.520> started<00:04:42.820> playing<00:04:43.000> it<00:04:43.120> for<00:04:43.270> fun

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
actually just started playing it for fun

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.480 
actually just started playing it for fun
and<00:04:43.690> they<00:04:44.110> also<00:04:44.260> started<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.710> competing<00:04:45.280> on

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
and they also started the competing on

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.710 
and they also started the competing on
the<00:04:45.580> leaderboard<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.090> figure<00:04:46.390> out<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.540> most

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
the leaderboard to figure out the most

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.390 
the leaderboard to figure out the most
creative<00:04:46.990> way<00:04:47.170> to<00:04:47.290> go<00:04:47.920> about<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.340> mission

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
creative way to go about the mission

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.860 
creative way to go about the mission
creativity<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.580> what<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.120> do<00:04:52.270> combined<00:04:52.660> with

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
creativity and what you do combined with

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.430 
creativity and what you do combined with
the<00:04:52.960> skull<00:04:53.230> was<00:04:53.710> freedom<00:04:54.640> etc<00:04:54.820> on<00:04:55.300> fire<00:04:55.540> so<00:04:56.320> we

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
the skull was freedom etc on fire so we

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.660 
the skull was freedom etc on fire so we
also<00:04:56.560> thought<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:56.890> you<00:04:57.040> know<00:04:57.190> what<00:04:57.490> makes

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
also thought that you know what makes

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.430 
also thought that you know what makes
most<00:04:57.910> sense<00:04:58.030> is<00:04:58.300> also<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.630> be<00:04:58.750> able<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:59.140> talk<00:04:59.320> to

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
most sense is also to be able to talk to

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.960 
most sense is also to be able to talk to
your<00:04:59.560> friends<00:04:59.770> about<00:04:59.830> how<00:05:00.010> you<00:05:00.190> scored<00:05:00.490> so

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
your friends about how you scored so

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.250 
your friends about how you scored so
that's<00:05:01.180> why<00:05:01.330> we<00:05:01.360> came<00:05:01.750> up<00:05:01.810> with<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.110> concept

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
that's why we came up with the concept

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.900 
that's why we came up with the concept
of<00:05:02.530> just<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:03.040> know<00:05:03.070> separating<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.760> few

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
of just you know separating a few

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.460 
of just you know separating a few
different<00:05:04.120> leader<00:05:04.420> boats<00:05:04.660> personally<00:05:05.380> I

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
different leader boats personally I

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.960 
different leader boats personally I
would<00:05:05.740> never<00:05:05.890> figure<00:05:06.250> on<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.430> worldwide

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
would never figure on the worldwide

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.760 
would never figure on the worldwide
leader<00:05:07.000> board<00:05:07.480> but<00:05:07.720> I<00:05:07.930> do<00:05:08.050> know<00:05:08.290> how<00:05:08.440> I<00:05:08.470> would

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
leader board but I do know how I would

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.380 
leader board but I do know how I would
fare<00:05:09.070> against<00:05:09.220> my<00:05:09.400> friends<00:05:09.730> right<00:05:09.850> and<00:05:10.060> it's

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
fare against my friends right and it's

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.670 
fare against my friends right and it's
in<00:05:10.690> that<00:05:10.810> way<00:05:10.960> it's<00:05:11.110> much<00:05:11.260> more<00:05:11.440> fun<00:05:11.500> to

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
in that way it's much more fun to

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.590 
in that way it's much more fun to
compete<00:05:12.040> with<00:05:12.190> people<00:05:12.430> you<00:05:12.520> know<00:05:15.270> there's<00:05:16.270> all

some of it we're kind of hinting at and
other<00:05:27.130> things<00:05:27.370> we<00:05:27.520> were<00:05:27.610> keeping<00:05:27.820> secret<00:05:28.360> for

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
other things we were keeping secret for

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.360 
other things we were keeping secret for
players<00:05:28.750> to<00:05:28.870> find<00:05:29.200> out<00:05:29.320> by<00:05:29.500> themselves<00:05:29.620> and

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
players to find out by themselves and

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.550 
players to find out by themselves and
looking<00:05:31.270> like<00:05:31.570> talking<00:05:31.990> with<00:05:32.110> her<00:05:32.200> friends

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
looking like talking with her friends

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.410 
looking like talking with her friends
finding<00:05:32.890> out<00:05:33.010> what<00:05:33.550> was<00:05:33.730> it<00:05:33.880> that<00:05:34.000> they<00:05:34.180> did

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
finding out what was it that they did

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.660 
finding out what was it that they did
that<00:05:34.600> actually<00:05:35.080> made<00:05:35.350> them<00:05:35.560> improve<00:05:36.040> so

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
that actually made them improve so

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.700 
that actually made them improve so
drastically<00:05:37.180> on<00:05:37.390> their<00:05:37.570> score

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.629 

gameplay-wise<00:05:41.710> we<00:05:41.979> really<00:05:42.189> wanted<00:05:42.400> to<00:05:42.460> make

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
gameplay-wise we really wanted to make

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.700 
gameplay-wise we really wanted to make
it<00:05:42.789> so<00:05:42.909> that<00:05:43.090> when<00:05:43.659> you<00:05:43.779> play<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.139> game<00:05:44.289> and<00:05:44.590> as

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
it so that when you play the game and as

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.170 
it so that when you play the game and as
you<00:05:44.860> improve<00:05:45.099> your<00:05:45.189> skills<00:05:45.610> and<00:05:45.909> your<00:05:45.939> unlock

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
you improve your skills and your unlock

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.909 
you improve your skills and your unlock
stuff<00:05:46.449> in<00:05:46.689> the<00:05:46.779> sniper<00:05:46.960> challenge<00:05:47.080> that<00:05:47.800> it

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
stuff in the sniper challenge that it

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.439 
stuff in the sniper challenge that it
actually<00:05:48.039> unlocks<00:05:48.550> an<00:05:48.639> absolution<00:05:49.029> as<00:05:49.270> well

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
actually unlocks an absolution as well

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.450 
actually unlocks an absolution as well
so<00:05:49.930> we<00:05:50.050> wanted<00:05:50.289> to<00:05:50.319> create<00:05:50.710> that<00:05:50.919> tie<00:05:51.159> in<00:05:51.219> to

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
so we wanted to create that tie in to

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.739 
so we wanted to create that tie in to
make<00:05:51.580> them<00:05:51.759> feel<00:05:51.969> that<00:05:51.999> they<00:05:52.330> are<00:05:52.360> connected

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:52.749 
make them feel that they are connected

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:54.600 
make them feel that they are connected
even<00:05:53.409> if<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.740> sniper<00:05:53.949> challenge<00:05:54.039> is<00:05:54.430> mainly

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
even if the sniper challenge is mainly

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.489 
even if the sniper challenge is mainly
about<00:05:54.729> sniping<00:05:55.089> and<00:05:55.449> absolution<00:05:56.110> is<00:05:56.229> about

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:56.499 
about sniping and absolution is about

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:00.029 
about sniping and absolution is about
everything<00:05:57.099> else<00:05:57.370> hit<00:05:57.580> man<00:05:57.789> if<00:05:57.939> you
