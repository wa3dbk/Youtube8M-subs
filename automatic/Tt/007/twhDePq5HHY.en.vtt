00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.640
 Then I will use it 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.380
 me 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.300
 From the side of the root 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.920
 We are doing it firmly toward it in the hair 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.130
 If you do so then 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:39.000
 Tabata I think maybe Kanto 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:41.060
 You can feel the root soft because it is kept a little 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.780
 dj 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.780
 eme 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.110
 like this 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.980
 Later I was able to is included 4 massive 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.980
 Aim for spray only where you want to keep a little high 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.840
 I will apply 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.460
 Then 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:18.070
 The same texture from the root to the tip is soft in one seat 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:20.850
 A feeling of bunching and texture is born, so it's nice to be able to keep it as it is 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.850
 It's a spray 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 No 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:40.679
 I do not want to be heavy at all, so it's okay to use it uniformly from the whole root to the hair tip 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.270
 So first of all, use a finger while wiping the spray firmly on the surface of the hair flow. 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.770
 I will 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.770
 After the 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.000
 I guess this will be the inner roll while expecting a finger here 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.900
 When it does so with a bunch sense of this finger 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.930
 We firmly N beautiful flowers fool to Tose Akanga hair 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.760
 And that 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:05.290
 Because the width is born in the same card top texture from the root to the hair tip 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.290
 Airy is a little more Teru 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.580
 Using the spray of Japan I think I want to design 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.910
 First of all 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.810
 Swing move veil like this short 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:58.080
 And the first overall volume feeling I used this 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.080
 It 's only soft I think that I want to make a soft texture 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.600
 Firmly from the root to the whole 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.980
 By the spray 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:15.930
 Sense of volume to the whole style that has become Pettanko a short style 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.860
 I will keep it soft and not just too hard, so firmly from the root to the tip of the hair 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.900
 The 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:25.590
 In we will put out a sense of volume let alone to use this hold hit bait to the next 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:29.950
 I will keep a little bit of hair accents 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:34.450
 I use a spray because I can keep it so soft 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:39.120
 Because the little I want a little accent or short and want bristles of a good accent 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.120
 Spray directly on where you want to 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.220
 Just as a feature 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.990
 Because it stops very lightly and high 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.220
 It 's such an accent because people who do n't like it don't say anything 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.220
 Is perfect spray required 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:05.960
 These two easy- to-use short styles with these two sprays 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.960
 I think I should change to a short style with a work cent
