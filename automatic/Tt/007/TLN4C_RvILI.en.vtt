00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
want to draw the back foot and then

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.560 
want to draw the back foot and then
right<00:01:36.720> next<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> trunk<00:01:37.380> his<00:01:37.560> front<00:01:37.860> foot

body then add just a few details

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.630 
body then add just a few details
elephants<00:01:52.500> tend<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.860> some<00:01:53.040> wrinkles<00:01:53.490> in

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
elephants tend to have some wrinkles in

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.069 
elephants tend to have some wrinkles in
the<00:01:53.729> trunk<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.180> we're<00:01:54.299> gonna<00:01:54.390> draw<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.869> few

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the trunk so we're gonna draw up a few

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.080 
the trunk so we're gonna draw up a few
lines<00:01:55.320> here<00:01:55.670> just<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> give<00:01:56.880> them<00:01:57.000> those

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
lines here just to give them those

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.719 
lines here just to give them those
wrinkles<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.890> then<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.979> course<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.340> toast

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
wrinkles and then of course is toast

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.270 
wrinkles and then of course is toast
which<00:01:59.880> you're<00:02:00.000> going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.509> three

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
which you're going to be just three

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.920 
which you're going to be just three
little<00:02:02.280> half<00:02:02.460> circles<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.240> each<00:02:03.360> foot

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
little half circles on each foot

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.490 
little half circles on each foot
just<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.010> give<00:02:06.130> that<00:02:06.160> nice<00:02:06.580> total<00:02:07.180> shape<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
just to give that nice total shape and
