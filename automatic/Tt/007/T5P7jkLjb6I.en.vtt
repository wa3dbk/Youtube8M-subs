types<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.600> will<00:04:13.780> give<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:13.990> a<00:04:14.050> 4<00:04:14.320> out<00:04:14.350> of<00:04:14.470> 5<00:04:14.740> for

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
types I will give it a 4 out of 5 for

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.979 
types I will give it a 4 out of 5 for
that<00:04:15.100> but<00:04:15.520> it's<00:04:15.670> so<00:04:15.910> close<00:04:16.270> to<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.540> three<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.959> a

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
that but it's so close to a three to a

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.750 
that but it's so close to a three to a
four<00:04:17.080> just<00:04:17.560> because<00:04:17.770> it<00:04:17.890> is<00:04:17.980> cumbersome<00:04:18.489> and

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
four just because it is cumbersome and

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.699 
four just because it is cumbersome and
just<00:04:19.359> not<00:04:19.480> a<00:04:19.510> big<00:04:19.690> fan<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.840> belts<00:04:20.290> in<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.500> first

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
just not a big fan of belts in the first

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.680 
just not a big fan of belts in the first
place<00:04:20.950> so<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.310> went<00:04:21.609> into<00:04:21.700> this<00:04:21.910> review<00:04:22.240> already

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
place so I went into this review already

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.570 
place so I went into this review already
with<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.080> in<00:04:23.229> my<00:04:23.350> mind<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:23.740> it<00:04:23.800> did<00:04:24.040> not<00:04:24.220> win

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
with that in my mind and it did not win

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.120 
with that in my mind and it did not win
me<00:04:24.760> over

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
me over

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.670 
me over
by<00:04:25.340> any<00:04:25.520> means<00:04:25.700> price<00:04:26.230> four<00:04:27.230> out<00:04:27.380> of<00:04:27.470> five

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
by any means price four out of five

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.380 
by any means price four out of five
again<00:04:28.370> it's<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.580> borderline<00:04:28.970> three<00:04:29.210> out<00:04:29.300> of

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
again it's a borderline three out of

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.820 
again it's a borderline three out of
five<00:04:29.540> just<00:04:29.750> because<00:04:29.900> I'm<00:04:30.140> not<00:04:30.350> sure<00:04:30.590> if<00:04:30.740> you're
