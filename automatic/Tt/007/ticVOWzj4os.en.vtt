00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 to another video of the accessibility project 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.730
 digital technology for everyone in this 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.580
 I am presenting my 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.769
 braille learning mini pets or 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.380
 also called foundation smash 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.839
 we can all help is basically a 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.090
 adaptation to catch a nice stuffed animal 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.420
 that the children might like and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.710
 we add 6 points that you can see here 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.449
 in little dolls' bellies 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.789
 we call I'm going to show them better 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.760
 we add 6 points so then the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.320
 child with visual impairment can 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.969
 learn the braille system that the one that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.559
 I'm showing on this little leaf the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.230
 braille system is with is 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.899
 constituted by cells let's say space 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.850
 here with six points inside the letter is 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.860
 the first point then the child goes to 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.780
 to be able to catch his little hair that in this 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.490
 case they have six little eyes stuck together 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.790
 magnetic form take off 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.890
 and the child can then simply 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.630
 paste them with the teacher's help 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.270
 practicing to put for example in the 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.910
