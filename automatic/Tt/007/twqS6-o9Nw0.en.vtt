 then the interests related to the assistance 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:09.379
 what poses 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.379
 for proof still of people 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.619
 that is, there is no 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.310
 let's start with very short races 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.749
 on the other hand we reduce everything that it does 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.749
 and it must be warmed up in front of the posts a little further 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.179
 the powerful head 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.280
 and finally 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.530
 we will take breaks and 45 minutes 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.720
 for the example 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.720
 happy enough 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.820
 what does it matter who 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.630
 it seems not out of reach 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.940
 then to all departments 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.160
 also made the short positions of the screws and become July 29 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.470

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.470
 screaming pelletier traffic 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.590
 watercolor pastels and police 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.310

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.220

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.770
 third theme of this trend 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.330
 investors 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.770
 people who sing songs that happen as comedian 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.770
 and often they are French students 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.140
 there are also some 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.240
 it's about 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.360

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.360
 those people who are used to drinking to be in the presence 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.090
 datuk teams who know 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.110

 disturbed by the map 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 and there are people who do not get along 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.500
 to be able to maintain these positions 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.140
 we regularly intervene 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.180
