00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.370
 It is factoring more in 196 schools in Ikegami. 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.579
 You can do it in the smallest possible lawsuit 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:12.389
 gdp is constant 9118 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.089
 I broke it twice again 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.779
 49 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.329
 Next is the 7.4 theme 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.989
 Then I'm riding in Japan 7 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.869
 It becomes like this 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.239
 Make it a form that can be based on this 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.640
 Private enterprise 7- 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.820
 It's about certification I stopped by the information in my heart and I met Mr. Koizumi 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.180
 I will do it 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.610
 The people 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.080
 But this time has passed 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.870
 I could express it like this 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.700
 I told you to expand it to 1.96 million pixels 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.120
 More than 140,000 people if I repay this form 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.890
 196 is 14 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.260
 Or lower 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.360
 That it has become a two-jo square 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.020
 First of all, I would like to draw in 350 as early as in Tokachi. 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.560
 Then I told 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.430
 We decided capacity 200 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.040
 Sun rose 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.460
 It is high 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.460
 en next 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.910
 village 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.140
 Industrialization 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 Stop device in Australia 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.160
 Then phase one port opening 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.020
 In Australia 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.270
 Then you have 350 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.140
 It's like this when you're on the Japan-Korea mooring public service 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.400
 Do you go along and choose card authentication? 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.010
 To say 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.750
 If there is not enough riding in this root park, something is a drinking spot 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.120
 It is said that 350 is the index of this 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.070
 However, it is not 25 at all, so it's the number of shares 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.770
 It is not square 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 Then what should I do? 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.109
 Knit Innocent or one by one 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.089
 If you give a daily allowance, 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.889
 It will be more than people who are all ready 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.459
 Then 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.189
 While singing Japan-Korea 95 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.189
 Kinki in the form of four or more 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.409
 From 14 days 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.219
 It means that it is divided by the square of the number of 70 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.449
 If the author exceeds the problem 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.609
 What side dishes should be served with the houses 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.449
 What kind of side dish should I take over? Nippon 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.379
 I should do it with a rose 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.749
 The lecture took second grade 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.629
 Back to Quasi-class 4 public benefit 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.409
 I'm doing 14 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.369
 Then the people will be 25 like this again and again 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.460
 Employed 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.379
 Become a place for activities that are going at 7 o'clock 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.379
 Because I won, I became more than a way activist 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:15.109
 Become more than 70 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.770
 This is the end of the description
