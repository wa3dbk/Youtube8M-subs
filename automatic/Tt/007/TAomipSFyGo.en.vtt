my lid is just to even out the color of
my<00:00:26.179> lids<00:00:27.179> because<00:00:27.419> I<00:00:27.569> have<00:00:27.720> veins<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.289> things

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
my lids because I have veins and things

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.009 
my lids because I have veins and things
like<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.400> taking<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.060> light<00:00:30.689> brown

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
color and sweeping that into the crease

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.960 
color and sweeping that into the crease
now<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.590> buildable<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.490> had<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.820> keep

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
now it's buildable so I had to keep

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.690

black<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.530> believe<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:00.420> starting<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.560> the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
black I believe so starting with the

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.770 
black I believe so starting with the
winged<00:01:02.130> liner<00:01:02.790> what<00:01:03.270> you're<00:01:03.360> gonna<00:01:03.450> do<00:01:03.660> is

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
winged liner what you're gonna do is

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.780 
winged liner what you're gonna do is
make<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.140> line<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:04.980> and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.640> you're

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
make a line going out and then you're

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.000 
make a line going out and then you're
going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> connect<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.630> fill<00:01:07.050> in<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.800> line

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
going to connect and fill in the line

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.460 
going to connect and fill in the line
this<00:01:08.550> is<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.940> trickiest<00:01:09.360> part<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.080> since<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
this is the trickiest part but since it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.950 
this is the trickiest part but since it
is<00:01:10.620> a<00:01:10.650> pencil<00:01:11.010> liner<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:12.030> use<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> q-tip<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
is a pencil liner you can use a q-tip to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.770 
is a pencil liner you can use a q-tip to
erase<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.000> reapply

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:31.530 

way<00:01:20.710> away<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:25.330> far<00:01:25.690> from<00:01:26.880> yesterday<00:01:30.420> next<00:01:31.420> is

way away not far from yesterday next is
mascara

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
mascara

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.200 
mascara
now<00:01:32.380> I've<00:01:32.560> never<00:01:32.860> used<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:33.340> mascara<00:01:33.759> like<00:01:34.000> this

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
now I've never used a mascara like this

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.240 
now I've never used a mascara like this
before<00:01:34.570> what<00:01:35.049> you<00:01:35.200> do<00:01:35.470> it's<00:01:35.800> kind<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.130> like

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
before what you do it's kind of like

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.010 
before what you do it's kind of like
those<00:01:36.399> lip<00:01:36.640> glosses<00:01:37.090> where<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.540> click<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.899> at

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
those lip glosses where you click it at

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.389 
those lip glosses where you click it at
the<00:01:38.110> bottom<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.590> then<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> product<00:01:39.070> comes<00:01:39.250> at

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
the bottom and then the product comes at

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.550 
the bottom and then the product comes at
the<00:01:39.520> top<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:39.970> it's<00:01:40.509> got<00:01:40.659> a<00:01:40.690> brush<00:01:41.020> on<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.409> end

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
the top and it's got a brush on the end

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.920 
the top and it's got a brush on the end
or<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.800> comb<00:01:42.070> on<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.280> end<00:01:42.369> so<00:01:42.970> you're<00:01:43.270> able<00:01:43.720> to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
or a comb on the end so you're able to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.920 
or a comb on the end so you're able to
comb<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.799> product<00:01:45.190> onto<00:01:45.399> each<00:01:45.880> every<00:01:46.180> single

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
comb the product onto each every single

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.499 
comb the product onto each every single
little<00:01:47.049> lash<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:48.220> this<00:01:48.700> one<00:01:48.880> might<00:01:49.119> take<00:01:49.299> some

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
little lash so this one might take some

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.850 
little lash so this one might take some
practice<00:01:49.659> as<00:01:49.990> well<00:01:50.259> so<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.470> don't<00:01:50.560> get<00:01:50.740> it

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
practice as well so you don't get it

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.109 
practice as well so you don't get it
everywhere<00:01:51.340> then<00:01:52.119> taking<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.869> set<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:54.119> false

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
everywhere then taking a set of false

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.719 
everywhere then taking a set of false
eyelashes<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:55.899> they<00:01:56.020> provided<00:01:56.410> also<00:01:56.740> these

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
eyelashes that they provided also these

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.730 
eyelashes that they provided also these
can<00:01:58.119> be<00:01:58.240> really<00:01:58.600> tricky<00:01:58.840> because<00:01:59.259> they<00:01:59.530> are

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
can be really tricky because they are

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.100 
can be really tricky because they are
not<00:02:00.220> natural<00:02:00.909> lashes<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:01.479> they<00:02:01.630> can<00:02:01.869> be<00:02:02.080> a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
not natural lashes so they can be a

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.559 
not natural lashes so they can be a
little<00:02:02.440> bit<00:02:02.710> stiff<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:03.369> make<00:02:03.880> sure<00:02:03.909> that<00:02:04.090> you

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569
