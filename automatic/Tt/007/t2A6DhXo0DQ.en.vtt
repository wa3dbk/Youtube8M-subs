00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
messing around with this now so this

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.830 
messing around with this now so this
this<00:01:35.520> would<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.729> good<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:36.030> getting<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.329> of

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
this would be good for getting out of

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.210 
this would be good for getting out of
tight<00:01:37.020> situations<00:01:37.229> because<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.890> mean<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> lot<00:01:38.100> of

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
tight situations because I mean a lot of

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.490 
tight situations because I mean a lot of
times<00:01:38.460> you're<00:01:38.610> attacking<00:01:39.000> bases<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.689> you're

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
times you're attacking bases and you're

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.569 
times you're attacking bases and you're
basically<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.920> doing<00:01:41.130> straight<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.520> your

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
basically just doing straight for your

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.870 
basically just doing straight for your
parachute<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> mean<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.049> quick<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
parachute so I mean it's quick and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.280 
parachute so I mean it's quick and
doesn't<00:01:44.880> use<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> lot<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.450> resources<00:01:45.840> or<00:01:46.140> money

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
doesn't use a lot of resources or money

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.080 
doesn't use a lot of resources or money
just<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.560> boost<00:01:46.920> away<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.549> quickly<00:01:47.790> with

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
just to boost away really quickly with

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.080 
just to boost away really quickly with
this<00:01:48.270> yeah<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.950> got<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.189> little<00:01:50.250> bar<00:01:50.820> up

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
there it overheats but it pretty quickly

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.359

jumps<00:01:54.600> down<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.590> fly<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.280> this

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
jumps down you can just fly with this

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.480 
jumps down you can just fly with this
forever<00:01:56.790> yeah<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.630> pretty<00:01:57.810> good<00:01:58.250> last<00:01:59.250> one
