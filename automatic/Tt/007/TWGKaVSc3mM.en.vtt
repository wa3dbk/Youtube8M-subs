00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
take it to the store and get them to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.400 
take it to the store and get them to
take<00:00:38.210> a<00:00:38.270> look<00:00:38.480> at<00:00:38.660> it<00:00:38.720> and<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:38.960> very<00:00:39.170> first

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
take a look at it and the very first

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.010 
take a look at it and the very first
thing<00:00:39.559> they<00:00:39.770> typically<00:00:40.190> do<00:00:40.370> is<00:00:40.870> reset<00:00:41.870> your

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
thing they typically do is reset your

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.819 
thing they typically do is reset your
network<00:00:42.320> settings<00:00:43.149> well<00:00:44.290> instead<00:00:45.290> of<00:00:45.350> taking

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
network settings well instead of taking

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.009 
network settings well instead of taking
that<00:00:45.950> trip<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.399> store<00:00:46.640> why<00:00:47.329> not<00:00:47.510> reset<00:00:47.929> the

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
that trip to the store why not reset the

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.040 
that trip to the store why not reset the
network<00:00:48.140> settings<00:00:48.820> yourself<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.780> you<00:00:50.839> can

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
network settings yourself so you can

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.079 
network settings yourself so you can
save<00:00:51.350> yourself<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:52.010> trip<00:00:52.370> and<00:00:52.640> if<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:52.850> works

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
save yourself that trip and if it works

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.259 
save yourself that trip and if it works
great<00:00:53.449> if<00:00:53.780> it<00:00:54.109> doesn't<00:00:54.589> then<00:00:55.160> you<00:00:55.910> can<00:00:56.089> take

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
great if it doesn't then you can take

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.380 
great if it doesn't then you can take
further<00:00:56.539> steps<00:00:56.859> which<00:00:57.859> usually<00:00:58.300> consists<00:00:59.300> of

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
further steps which usually consists of

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.599 
further steps which usually consists of
calling<00:00:59.899> tech<00:01:00.109> support<00:01:00.159> but<00:01:01.159> at<00:01:01.249> least<00:01:01.399> you

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
calling tech support but at least you

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.390 
calling tech support but at least you
can<00:01:01.760> do<00:01:01.909> this<00:01:02.320> first<00:01:03.320> without<00:01:03.890> having<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.280> make

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
can do this first without having to make

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.240 
can do this first without having to make
a<00:01:04.460> trip<00:01:04.730> out<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:04.970> your<00:01:05.360> carrier<00:01:06.140> store<00:01:06.500> now<00:01:07.190> the
