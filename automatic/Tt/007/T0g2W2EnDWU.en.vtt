00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
what was doing so I went away to point

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.430 
what was doing so I went away to point
blank<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.390> I'm<00:00:39.570> sort<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.930> start<00:00:40.140> picking<00:00:40.380> up

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
it was a really positive experience for

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.670 
it was a really positive experience for
me<00:02:23.640> just<00:02:23.910> means<00:02:24.150> that

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
me just means that

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.250 
me just means that
I can<00:02:25.299> plus<00:02:26.299> what<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.540> was<00:02:26.689> trying<00:02:27.079> to<00:02:27.140> teach

I can plus what I was trying to teach

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.780 
I can plus what I was trying to teach
myself<00:02:27.439> anyway<00:02:27.950> because<00:02:28.159> I'm<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.400> bit<00:02:28.519> older

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
myself anyway because I'm a bit older

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.059 
myself anyway because I'm a bit older
and<00:02:28.879> I<00:02:28.939> wanted<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.450> learn<00:02:29.659> this<00:02:29.840> stuff<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.859> kind

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
and I wanted to learn this stuff it kind

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.619 
and I wanted to learn this stuff it kind
of<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.489> set<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.730> on<00:02:31.849> a<00:02:31.879> course<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.390> set<00:02:32.569> you

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
of just set you on a course to set you

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.720 
of just set you on a course to set you
on<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.780> path<00:02:32.989> of<00:02:33.260> finding<00:02:34.010> out<00:02:34.099> you<00:02:34.310> find<00:02:34.519> out

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
on the path of finding out you find out

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.910 
on the path of finding out you find out
a<00:02:34.969> little<00:02:35.480> bit<00:02:35.629> about<00:02:35.930> sidechaining<00:02:36.590> so

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
a little bit about sidechaining so

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.130 
a little bit about sidechaining so
therefore<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.519> logic<00:02:37.819> manual<00:02:38.150> becomes<00:02:38.569> that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
therefore the logic manual becomes that

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.280 
therefore the logic manual becomes that
bit<00:02:39.379> less<00:02:39.620> scary<00:02:40.120> because<00:02:41.120> you've<00:02:41.269> heard<00:02:41.510> my

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
bit less scary because you've heard my

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.869 
bit less scary because you've heard my
teacher<00:02:42.530> nils<00:02:42.859> you<00:02:43.159> I've<00:02:43.310> heard<00:02:43.489> him<00:02:43.609> talking

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
teacher nils you I've heard him talking

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.629 
teacher nils you I've heard him talking
about<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.329> during<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.689> day<00:02:44.719> and<00:02:45.109> I<00:02:46.010> can<00:02:46.400> refer

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
about it during the day and I can refer

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.580 
about it during the day and I can refer
to<00:02:46.670> my<00:02:47.000> notes<00:02:47.030> which<00:02:47.569> had<00:02:47.689> now<00:02:47.840> been<00:02:48.049> broken

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
to my notes which had now been broken

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.069 
to my notes which had now been broken
down<00:02:48.709> into<00:02:48.980> idiot<00:02:49.909> speak<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:50.689> know<00:02:50.840> so

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
down into idiot speak you know so

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.660 
down into idiot speak you know so
therefore<00:02:51.439> the<00:02:51.530> logic<00:02:51.799> manual<00:02:52.129> stops<00:02:52.370> being

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
therefore the logic manual stops being

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.940 
therefore the logic manual stops being
the<00:02:53.120> scariest<00:02:53.659> thing<00:02:53.780> on<00:02:53.900> earth<00:02:54.019> and<00:02:54.230> a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
the scariest thing on earth and a

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.220 
the scariest thing on earth and a
doorstop<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.000> become<00:02:56.810> something<00:02:57.079> that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
doorstop and become something that

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.080 
doorstop and become something that
you're<00:02:57.500> happy<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.159> you<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.549> it's<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:58.849> really

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
you're happy to you so it's just really

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.220 
you're happy to you so it's just really
a<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.900> was<00:03:00.019> just<00:03:00.139> really<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.379> key<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.859> kind<00:03:01.069> of

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
a it was just really a key to kind of

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.960 
a it was just really a key to kind of
videos<00:03:03.230> just<00:03:03.439> a<00:03:03.590> key<00:03:03.769> to<00:03:03.980> understand<00:03:04.669> stuff<00:03:04.849> a

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
videos just a key to understand stuff a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.000 
videos just a key to understand stuff a
bit<00:03:05.090> better<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.419> think<00:03:05.720> that's<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.200> level<00:03:06.349> that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
bit better I think that's the level that

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.649 
bit better I think that's the level that
I<00:03:07.069> took<00:03:07.220> it<00:03:07.579> to<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.760> mean<00:03:07.939> you<00:03:08.030> can<00:03:08.150> get<00:03:08.329> you<00:03:08.450> can

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
I took it to I mean you can get you can

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.089 
I took it to I mean you can get you can
do<00:03:08.750> lots<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.379> different<00:03:09.500> courses<00:03:09.889> there<00:03:10.219> and

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
do lots of different courses there and

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.949 
do lots of different courses there and
I'm<00:03:13.099> tempted<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.549> go<00:03:13.730> back<00:03:13.969> in<00:03:14.180> try<00:03:14.719> and<00:03:14.780> get

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
I'm tempted to go back in try and get

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.670 
I'm tempted to go back in try and get
some<00:03:14.989> you<00:03:15.500> know<00:03:15.530> more<00:03:16.040> knowledge<00:03:16.370> now<00:03:17.680> bigger

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
some you know more knowledge now bigger

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.199 
some you know more knowledge now bigger
city<00:03:18.889> has<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.069> great<00:03:19.310> place<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.819> I'd<00:03:19.939> recommend

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
city has a great place and I'd recommend
