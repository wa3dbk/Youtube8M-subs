 i 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.580
 [Music] 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.490
 hello how are friends are welcome 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.289
 to this new video I am carlos web and 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.099
 because this time I come to show you 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.939
 a very simple way of how we can 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:27.939
 reset or delete a gp partition 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.949
 of our hard disk's protective 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.810
 the computer good what is this 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.190
 partition these partitions give us a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.989
 problem at the moment that we 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.480
 we want to install an operating system 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.300
 in them let's say that if you have a 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.059
 Protective gpt partition so you do not get 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.000
 will stop formatting then click on this 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.119
 same partition I have a format in fps 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.369
 a format for 32 therefore will not let you 

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:54.280
 install any operating system in the 

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:57.400
 same or when you want to format 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.000
 this gpt partition to one for a 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.570
 partition for 32 or ntfs what we will do 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.380
 it will be then let's start anything before 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 the cmd as administrator 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.840
 if you are in windows 7 windows 8 you know 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.610
 in start you can search with cmd click 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.220
 right to execute it as 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.890
 administrator 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.830
 and here in the administrator or in the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.170
 symbol of the system 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.160
 we will put 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.280
 bartz 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.280
 [Music] 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.090
 very well then we will live 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.670
 He says 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.259
 and then it will give us a result of the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.659
 partitions that we have in our 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.140
 computer as you can see I have a 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.990
 partition that is called because good the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.289
 size makes 14 gigabytes and partition 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.939
 or the disk the disk practically 14 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.899
 say byte is because it has the gpt format 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.490
 this format as I said 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.409
 previously does not let us install a 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.069
 operating system on it or it does not let us 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.579
 format it for 32 or ntfs which are the 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:11.009
 common formats in windows what 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:12.989
 we will do it, it will simply be because once 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.170
 that we have detected where is in what 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:22.430
 number in this case would be disk two the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.430
 partition in gpt gp we will give you cl 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:30.600
 and we will put the number assigned to the disk 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.870
 that has the gp format in this case is 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.030
 on the 2nd we give enter and it will tell us that the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.890
 Disk 2 is now the selected disk 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.959
 in my case it is number 2 in your case 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.350
 the next step may vary 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.420
 so you can delete this partition and 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.260
 create a new a new partition with 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.850
 a format in effect ntfs or for 32 is 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.280
 the next one we have to eliminate this 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.050
 partition before doing it obviously me 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.600
 I recommend that you check that in 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.430
 the disk that you're working on 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.900
 partition that you're going to eliminate is not the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.959
 partition which contains your system 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.890
 operating very careful in that and well not 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.190
 I'm responsible for some error 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.200
 your or a misinterpretation of 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.819
 this video ok then what do you 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.219
 I recommend that before doing 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.810
 this method of defections that in 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.549
 this position you do not have data 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.790
 important if you have data what 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.769
 you can move to one partition or another 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.300
 simply to your windows in a new 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:34.230
 folder then we will proceed to write 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.480
 read this what will make us eliminate 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.980
 completely the entire partition and it's what 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.430
 what we have to do to erase 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.740
 this gpp format and create a new one 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.890
 new partition with an ntfs format or 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.380
 for 32 yo then I 'll click on 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.050
 enter since I know what the partition is in 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.740
 this case is disk two with a size 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.780
 of 14 gigabytes and with the gp format like 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.850
 can you see here is now 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.890
 working at this moment the disk already 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.350
 that this partition belongs to a disk 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.810
 external and good well this video too 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.330
 I've done it because a person 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.580
 asked in the video how to install 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.400
 windows 10 on your computer told me that 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.680
 he missed an error when he wanted to install 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.900
 which said that the partition was a 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.850
 gpp partition and could not install the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.430
 system for the operating system in 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.320
 said partition and it's obvious because then 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.420
 in these cases it does not let you do 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.980
 absolutely nothing or format or 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.750
 change it or is practically not 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.009
 you can change this partition format 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.779
 the only way is by working from him 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.759
 symbol of the system as we are 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:40.580
 doing at this moment now 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:43.339
 we will wait for it to finish eliminating the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.219
 partition to again give you a new 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:49.669
 format and then already have a new 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:53.089
 partition either in nfts format or for 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.180
 32 good as you can see already since we 

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:57.469
 says dispar has cleaned the disc 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.660
 satisfactorily then we can 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:03.690
 simply close the 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.480
 system symbol writing successes and 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.700
 successes ok then good what we will do 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.100
 now it will be to go again to 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.310
 windows explorer in team we will give 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.680
 Right click and we will manage 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.240
 in administering we will go again 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.880
 record management 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.789
 and then we will find the 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.530
 partition that we just cleaned 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:29.410
 practically that we just eliminated 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.740
 will be with a black band and what 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.080
 means that is that you do not have this is a 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.240
 volume is that this is a space not 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.190
 assigned of the partition then 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.979
 we will right click on it we will give 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.500
 click on new simple volume we give 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.690
 next next 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.690
 this is the letter that will be assigned 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.120
 to this partition we give you following and 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:56.139
 how can you see the file system 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.300
 it will be in fat32 and we will also have this 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.389
 is the default not obviously and 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.940
 we will right click on the next one and 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:07.710
 finalize and good in this way 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:12.910
 we will finish removing the gpt format 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:15.340
 protective to this disc position 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.950
 and as you can see we will see 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.870
 back to the windows explorer in 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.380
 discs as you can see here is the 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.760
 partition already available and obviously 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.820
 as it says here 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.170
 the type of format from psec to 32 if 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.210
 we go again to what would come 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.670
 being also the cmd so that it 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.840
 make sure and see that already the partition 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:42.670
 gpt ceased to exist we will again 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.670
 this park 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:50.689
 and we wrote my discs 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:54.229
 and as you can see here is the disk 214 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:56.389
 gb and obviously gpt obviously is no longer 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:58.039
 then friends that is the procedure 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.379
 that we have to continue to be able to 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:02.089
 remove a protective gpt partition from 

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:03.800
 our operating system 

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:06.559
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.839
 most of all they have served and well what 

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:10.969
