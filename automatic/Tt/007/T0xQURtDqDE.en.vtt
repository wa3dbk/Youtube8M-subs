00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.200
 hello guys 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:11.030
 for came on June 11th 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.330
 second decade 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.380
 here it is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.250
 winter garlic 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.900
 way off and planted it 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.900
 and already looked throw 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.660
 mean I heard on give arrows 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.990
 need to delete 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.080
 because i heard they take up 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.000
 30 percent harvest 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.100
 30 percent multiply that eggs protection 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.620
 which arrows when arrow you 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.680
 develop the arrow 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.450
 such a bud opens here and here 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:50.050
 garlic seeds 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:51.150
 it doesn't take 30 percent i want to 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.990
 this year 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:59.190
 take a picture if u want to show i don't 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.190
 stalkers leave 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.350
 I will not open and fall when will 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.950
 do we want to see how this is a battle 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.950
 in that 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:26.240
 or will write something to say it now 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:29.330
 I read what's being done for what I, too, with 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.250
 the end nardo the matter concerned him 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.280
 cut the icicle and passed there but with 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:41.340
 different when the level of 5 times where it is wild 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:46.219
 Sonata do how delicious it is . 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.679
 every matter of taste of every person is well 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:52.020
 like you do not want to do though you can and 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.130
 earlier from us to assign take these 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.700
 here are the things and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.060
 finely finely crushes and dries and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.630
 then change and you add seasonings 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.729
 its about this year in a circle a little bit and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.030
 for listening to these 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:18.209
 the stalks are these what comes out of them 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:21.530
 always do with them like this 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.750
 boil and then I take here and so 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.470
 shears cicada but so finely finely cut 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.299
 this kind of call it bucket them and pour 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.180
 by water 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.760
 I fill it with water and I have it for about a week 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:41.099
 maybe more than a hundred and then it's all sour 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.099
 this water plays there like that and then 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:47.180
 I drop it here it is water 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:51.690
 filter through a strainer there through 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.900
 nylon stocking tracking and here i am 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:00.140
 I spray these solutions 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.359
 when so for years does not appear caterpillars 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.189
 i scour us how effective she is i 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.920
 I do not know because this year 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.290
 the caterpillars literally all eat everything and 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.569
 no chemicals help me 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.450
 so I haven't caused anything yet 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.400
 I used to have garlic brew 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.939
 feel the spring added 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:26.349
 with soap, mix and spray fairly 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:26.349
 effectively so now i'm here it is 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.419
 pluck out they are being withdrawn 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:48.500
 and sometimes it comes off as a draw 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:52.489
 usually part of the dried part soak here 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.379
 so it will be interesting what you do with 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.180
 by these 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.720
 write in the comments what you do with 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.870
 these lines or how to call them 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.870
 you have a camera cleaning write I will teach 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.130
 I ripped and there is still much left well 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.820
 here is the most interesting can someone 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.959
 spent with these such as they say 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.630
 experiments when it's better to pull out 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.400
 when he just starts coming out here with 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.650
 this but with a stem 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.360
 or when it is already so twisted 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.630
 then there may be something like this 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.420
 aligned begins to unfold i 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.910
 somehow this value was not sold as 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.910
 so can anyone sell this 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.800
 value to me is a matter of a pound it 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.290
 maybe such an experiment is obtained 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.600
 start here a few pieces like that 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.720
 mainly today ivalise 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:55.570
 on earlier it was possible just like that seeing 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:57.490
 soaking out clapping wrong there 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.150
 I cried when stretched and stretched 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.310
 promo shoot 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.530
 and today he mostly came off but 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.070
 nothing mean now what i do i take 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:11.320
 so here it is and leave I will cut 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:14.669
 and cut and try to dry and you 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.669
 doing something they want 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.610
 grind so they are denser when they 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.240
 Here is such a heap they are not bad for 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.380
 flowers 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:32.740
 and I'm happy this will soften the hips and bucket 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.729
 here is this bucket zalyu water and put 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.219
 denechek and let her 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:40.069
 but it is soaked and then this solution 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:44.330
 now that's how i dislike people 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:48.819
 when people don't get ready it's not 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.819
 hiding now show wearing 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.770
 last year's solution I last year this 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:01.039
 such a thing this year is not going anywhere 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.650
 sprayed and apply feet in this a 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:06.259
 he, too, just throw reluctance 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.629
 somewhere to apply it know here 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:15.129
 cut into such an hour pour lizards 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:19.849
 I repeat by water and let them not and 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:23.749
 Once again, please share my experience 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:28.399
 who does what of these so to speak 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:31.909
 Canadian line that's a fool cut 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:32.539
 bikini liters of species cut how much she 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:38.240
 it turns out 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:41.539
 pouring water on them carbohydrates and let them stand 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.209
 rivers and I do a little so rinse 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:47.240
 I'll cut the veranda of the floor 

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:50.300
 letting dry love never did 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:54.909
 This does not know this will work but 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:59.959
 here I read it later it will be 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:07:01.830
 a little ball of them juice found water and 

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:09.200
 this is so 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:13.100
 then here it is now home than 

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.100
 below the fleet to dry
