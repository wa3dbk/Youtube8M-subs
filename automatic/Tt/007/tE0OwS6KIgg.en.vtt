00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.789
 Welcome to my new tutorial 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.680
 Rogue subtlety in this video I'm going to 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.080
 teach the macros that I use the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.360
 talents the glyphs and the gems and 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.750
 enchantments that I have been advising 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.420
 and explaining why good we start 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.540
 I will start teaching my talents as 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.610
 You see I have 56 points in the subtlety branch 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.610
 with the most useful talents in my opinion 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.530
 and so I can put three points in the 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.170
 improved gouge 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.920
 and finish with the 12 points in the branch 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.920
 of murder 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.420
 good I will continue for the macros remember 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.449
 that I will leave the macros in the description 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.940
 as in all my macro tutorials of 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.940
 expose armor this macro will seem 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.190
 very strange but it is very curious serves 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.019
 to get out of stealth with low blow and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.240
 when you are out of stealth to use 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.610
 expose armor since the low blow and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.500
 exposing armor does not inflict damage and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.570
 I can do it to the opponent while he is in 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.570
 bang and then start the fight 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.149
 leaving the target with 20% less 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.670
 macro armor of shadow dance 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.560
 this macro only activates the dance of 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.690
 the shadows and the orc racial at the same time 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.539
 so the burj will be a little more damage 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.890
 macro of trade secrets with this 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.319
 macro we launch our skill 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 secrets of the trade to our companion 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.090
 of sand without arlo card 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.190
 unguarded macro with this macro 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.409
 I can disarm my goal or if I 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.110
 I combine with the alt key I can disarm 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.330
 to focus if you do not want to combine it with 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.630
 'the later I will teach the macro of 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.640
 disarm the macro focus of distracting this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.710
 macro only works if you're one of the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.000
 you press the key more than once to 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.340
 that the area where are you going 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.990
 throw distract the green circle not 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.450
 disappear until thrown or 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.940
 canceled with another macro skill of 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.010
 I poke at the focus this macro just 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.770
 used to be used by race on the focus 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.200
 no need to card give macro of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.510
 kick to the focus just like the macro 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.580
 previous with this macro we use kick to the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.730
 arles focus without card 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.830
 gouge macro to the focus again this 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.350
 macro launches gouge to focus without having to 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.810
 card macro unguard the 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.180
 focus this macro disarms the focus 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.100
 perfect for occasions when you're 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.530
 hitting someone and a warrior comes 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.110
 with edge jijiji storm macro of 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.300
 blindness to focus this macro is very useful 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.250
 next to the macro macro this macro 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.160
 launches blindness to focus without having to 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.830
 card him and last step macro 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.900
 from the shadows to the focus this macro serves 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.600
 to move from the shadows to the focus 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.580
 If the focus is a gel and you combine this 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.070
 macro with the kick macro to the focus 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.410
 you can silence the gel practically 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.660
 a scare I forgot to say that I did not 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.610
 I use the typical knockout macro that 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.810
 it only serves to find characters in 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.910
 stealth but yes 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.480
 I will put it anyway in the 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.239
 description 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.549
 now I will show you my glyphs of 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.830
 vigor this glyph I recommend taking it to 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.080
 all the rogues have the talents 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.319
 that have 10 energy points 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.420
 more is vital and must be carried all 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.970
 glyph of hemorrhage this glyph increases 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.280
 damage 40% to targets that are 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.950
 affected by hemorrhage this is also 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.830
 vital for the subtlety glyph of gouge 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.049
 this glyph reduces the energy cost 15 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.480
 points to the gouge many rogues carry 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.640
 the glyph of sprint to me personally I 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.400
 like this one more since I can use the 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.650
 gouge more easily glyph to fade 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.440
 this glyph increases the speed of 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.329
 movement 30% after vanishing 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.840
 this takes about two or three seconds 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.150
 approximately glyph to distract this 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.220
 glyph increases the reach 5 meters of the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.379
 distracting ability I prefer to carry 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.720
 this to the glyph of safe fall as it is 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.519
 the glyph alone would serve to make old age 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.799
 and the distracting glyph is valid for 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.900
 any moment speed glyph 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.609
 blurred this glyph makes you can 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.690
 walk through the water while the 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.760
 sprint 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.620
 yes I already know that this only serves only to 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.960
 old age but is that there are no others 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.330
 Useful to put hehehe 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.430
 and finally I will show you my equipment to 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.160
 that you see the gems and enchantments 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.840
 I advance that I am a jeweler and a blacksmith in 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.030

 the power of 32 power is also very effective 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.620
 attack the 2 enchantments are very 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.840
 well and I also wear a red gem of

 Disarm effects I put the poison 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.970
 obstructive to leave the rival always 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.100
 slow and a purple penetration gem

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.840
 bonus 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.000
 well before finishing the tutorial I 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.040
 I would like to explain the reason why 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.780
 I have armor penetration instead of 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.300
 agility or attack power as the 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.370
 Most rogues subtlety in the first 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.620
 place I do not like agility the 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.570
 agility to attack power and critical and 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.730
 the rogue already gets many critics without 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.650
 need for agility I only have the 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.630
 option to get me gems of power of 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.460
 attack or penetration of armor and 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.500
 I preferred to put the penetration of 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.720
 armor since I need to do more 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.150
 damage to the plates to those I make them 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.400
 decent damage and of course the damage to 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.380
 the plates increases me more ignoring their 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.500
 armor that increasing me the power of 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.280
 attack good that's all thanks for watching 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.370
 the video 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.370
 dale like comments and subscribe greetings
