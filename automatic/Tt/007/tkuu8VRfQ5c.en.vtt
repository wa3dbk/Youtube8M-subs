used test because he got a zero how in

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:48.609 
used test because he got a zero how in
the<00:01:46.520> hell<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.270> gonna<00:01:47.569> get<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.810> zero<00:01:48.080> on<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.319> test

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
the hell you gonna get a zero on a test

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.279 
the hell you gonna get a zero on a test
it<00:01:48.890> doesn't<00:01:49.700> even<00:01:49.759> matter<00:01:50.030> because<00:01:50.390> even

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
it doesn't even matter because even

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.809 
it doesn't even matter because even
though<00:01:51.410> this<00:01:51.560> test<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:52.009> supposed<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.520> affect

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
though this test is supposed to affect

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.219 
though this test is supposed to affect
the<00:01:53.060> weapon<00:01:53.390> they're<00:01:53.509> going<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.840> get<00:01:53.959> it

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
the weapon they're going to get it

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.690 
the weapon they're going to get it
doesn't<00:01:54.709> matter<00:01:54.860> because<00:01:55.099> Guren<00:01:55.489> just

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
doesn't matter because Guren just

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.639 
doesn't matter because Guren just
decides<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.030> interrupt<00:01:56.599> class<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.140> he<00:01:57.410> pulls

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
decides to interrupt class and he pulls

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.290 
decides to interrupt class and he pulls
out<00:01:57.800> his<00:01:58.009> cursed<00:01:58.340> weapon<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:58.910> he<00:01:58.970> basically

out his cursed weapon and he basically

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.880 
out his cursed weapon and he basically
tells<00:01:59.599> the<00:01:59.750> class<00:01:59.959> if<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.530> can<00:02:00.679> withstand

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
tells the class if you can withstand

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.460 
tells the class if you can withstand
this<00:02:01.459> demonic<00:02:01.940> energy<00:02:02.569> then<00:02:03.080> you'll<00:02:03.289> be
