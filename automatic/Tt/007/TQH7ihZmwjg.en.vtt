00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.490
 ay zawari al zawari 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.680
 hello, girls, how much is it to me? 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.090
 you say that there was more day left and this video 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.500
 I think you may like it a lot I come 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.930
 to tell you about my last 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.140
 Discoveries or my latest purchases 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.200
 low cost and how good I think you 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:37.239
 can you like me personally is 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:40.420
 Well, I'm not doing his paper 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.940
 I'm very happy with each of them 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.320
 and that's why I wanted to teach you and apart 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.020
 Well, if it's good, better price 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.200
 you better not so good because we will 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.200
 start 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.680
 first of all I wanted to tell you about this one 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.900
 the labial of mix ni is a low signature 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.830
 cost that he used many years ago and 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.270
 I like it, I like it quite honestly 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.890
 I think you have good products to a 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.860
 good price also then the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.690
 quality-price is perfect this product 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.760
 in question I really like what I wear 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.910
 put in the video that I posted on Monday 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.990
 is a good ryan has gross format 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:21.420
 Even the applicator is very similar but 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.570
 the finish is like lipstick is a mixture 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.630
 between lip gloss because it has a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.330
 it has the cover maybe of labial but 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.670
 the glossy finish of a gloss and 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.990
 it is also long-lasting and something else 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.690
 good that you have to prove is that if you 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.820
 you've been here for a whole hour or even less 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.430
 the lips and then remove it with paper 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.900
 from the toilet itself or a napkin if 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.910
 it's going to look like you're wearing a dye 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.369
 lipstick so I think you can take it out 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.229
 a lot of game and I do not know I think it's a 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.650
 good product so you know that you 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.660
 I leave all the info for 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.090
 you can buy them or even give them a 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.760
 look just below this video the 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.890
 information box 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.590
 continuing with the labials this 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.590
 I also liked it a lot and it's good 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.500
 one pass is a nice pretty red e 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.540
 Intense pigmented finish is matte 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.990
 but then what these lipsticks have 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.930
 is that they do not dry in excess, fix them 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.620
 please in colors that I do not know if it is appreciated 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.620
 to see if you can see it 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.390
 I do not know if he 's looking good but he's 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.830
 much more intense than how they come out in 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.220
 camera is a red or red with a point of 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.760
 Strawberry 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.980
 and wait and do a validation check 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.030
 is that I wanted to see if it was similar 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.110
 the dragon girl 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.270
 this is the dragon girl rode and as 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.980
 You see, it's a little different, it's a 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.890
 little clearer but good this is the one of 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.450
 anise and I find it beautiful apart and you 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.220
 I say it 's pretty opaque of the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.750
 Finish regulation plus innovation 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.980
 much more elegant lipsticks 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.800
 matte finish and well I told you 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.390
 that is wonderful and that of course what 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.010
 I recommend 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.700
 I do not know if done but removing melo 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.200
 that leaving the hand very clean good 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.879
 the last thing next is I want 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.700
 teach the enamel that I wear 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.769
 right now that we go has nothing to 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.450
 see what it looks like on camera so 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.730
 see if I can upload a photo to my 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.430
 social networks so you can see it sometimes 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.129
 if it is better appreciated it is a color 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.500
 totally neon is a coral but 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.810
 striking bright phosphorescent 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.819
 totally and as you see in camera it seems 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.730
 a coral color I do not understand it to see if 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.690
 if he pushed it farther away when I put the rubber on 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 it looks but 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.740
 but hey, he has not just appreciated 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.070
 it is very beautiful the only thing that I do not 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.110
 convinces of this enamel is the brush not 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.670
 is not accurate and you have to be careful 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.900
 because if you do not get stained by 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.030
 side and the truth is that it is not very 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.470
 comfortable but otherwise I like it has 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.720
 good coverage and durability 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.260
 also pretty good and then the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.180
 last time I went to the boy 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.010
 you know that it has many colors 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.620
 of enamels and well I like to spend 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.209
 once in a while to entertain me and 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.220
 always the truth is that something good falls 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.260
 that I take this nail base 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.870
 because the truth is that he did not have any 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.790
 and the girl who answered me said that 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.699
 it was very good so that it did not yellow in the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.930
 nail because you already know that if you just 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:21.260
 paint them go very often at the end 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.789
 it ends up taking a color like this 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.060
 yellowish that the truth is that it is not 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.650
 very aesthetic and also what it does is 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.180
 prepare the nail to keep them 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.919
 let's put below then we 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.310
 endure much longer and protect 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.070
 also the nail 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.990
 so well then it's also used 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.120
 just to light with the product 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.650
 above no glaze on top but it 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.630
 there is a little bit more then I 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.760
 I prefer to put a layer of this first 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.440
 and then the enamel in question that 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.870
 fact is how I wear it already 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.520
 last I wanted taught this product of 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.220
 kiko that I bought very little ago I think 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.310
 which is limited edition format 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.200
 that fits in tube and also brings a 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.000
 dispenser 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.470
 and it's also perfect for oily skin 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.800
 because it does not contain any kind of 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.060
 oils are quickly absorbed into the skin and 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.890
 good about him that is a moisturizer 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.960
 sorry I got stuck is a moisturizer 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.900
 of day of little you are going to see with my hand 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.330
 red sticky that so that I know that 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.480
 taketh me with the door has a color 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.400
 champagne but 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.400
 yes, it is true that when he blurs 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.460
 It has a very smooth texture the smell 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.889
 it's practically I do not know practically no 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.229
 It has a smell and I tell you that they spread 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:35.330
 very well the soft texture is about 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.850
 also quickly and what in the end 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.889
 leaves are a few finite flashes is 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.020
 say as luminosity the skin and see 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.060
 that time is coming because I think that these 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.410
 products are essential apart 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.900
 has a sun protection factor of 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.820
 10 and apart stimulates the renewal 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.680
 cellular and contributes to the increase in 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.470
 soto collagen production that 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.740
 honestly I'm using a lot and 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.419
 nothing then that, so really 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.620
 these are the low cost products in a 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.360
 very little term that I'm using 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.360
 I'll be a pity ball, I hope 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.760
 as well I told you that everyone has 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.890
 liked a lot as a rule and for 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.270
 I wanted to teach that so nothing 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.010
 this is the video built for today 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.450
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.890
 I have commented as I always say 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.630
 If you have recently done some 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.520
 crazy discovery do not forget disarm 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.590
 the comments because I'm interested and 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.450
 nothing that many thanks for being 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.440

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.440
 soon goodbye
