00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.760
 vw has been working since the wolves get in 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.040
 germany have settled on it 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.390
 the acceptance for the wolves in the 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.880
 to demand population 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.580
 We'll do that, for example 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.289
 leaflets but also with 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.930
 information boards in 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:39.360
 various wildlife parks of ifa 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.699
 has for the wolfs times in the wild park 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.330
 eekholt an information board 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.979
 funded in the spread of the 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:56.670
 wolf is presented 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:59.070
 in all of germany we have ourselves completely 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.680
 Many thoughts were made on how to get the theme 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.629
 wolf can communicate well and an idea 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.220
 was there the e commerce mile will wander 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.990
 first very much up to 70 kilometers 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.580
 in the day and we want the information 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.500
 has not been so concentrated on a point 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.180
 but in passing quite a lot 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.100
 Themes including the spread 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.600
 skate very up to date because many too 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.440
 There are surprises in Germany 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.909
 wolves again 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.520
 there is holstein again in schleswig 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.200
 wolves and the whole wolfs have mile 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.630
 we with the support of many great 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.009
 partner also managed the thw of 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.780
 International Animal Welfare Fund has us 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.780
 For example, here really great support 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:51.030
 educate about the wolves extremely important 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.009
 because of this the success of the return 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.020
 The wolves depend on it without an acceptance 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.359
 we would get that in the population 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.520
 impossible I have to think about where 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.189
 there's maybe fears or prejudices 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.299
 and how are those that I stored that 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.460
 maybe not right 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.210
 information management or old fairy 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.210
 you still have in your head 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.940
 the ifa as financed where it 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.920
 necessary is 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.670
 monitoring measures that is to say 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.910
 determine where are twelve at all 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.819
 and then we advise livestock owners 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.610
 all shepherds in wooded areas like them 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:36.130
 Best protect your sheep 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.630
 You can definitely sheep 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.370
 protect effectively allegations there are 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.290
 a whole range of opportunities to 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.760
 consider a minimum protection 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.230
 it starts at 90 , for example 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.280
 but there are also centimeters 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.390
 herding dogs so if you 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.760
 really a wolf pack 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.110
 then you have the sheep already 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.220
 Protect more clearly so there is quite 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.750
 many starting points 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.310
 the important thing is the acceptance in the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.239
 Population so that the wolves again 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.239
 have a chance in germany
