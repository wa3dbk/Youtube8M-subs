00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.380 
was July when where I hid for training
camps<00:02:28.829> so<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.609> just<00:02:29.640> kind<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.030> getting<00:02:30.180> him

back out and comfortable with the
current<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:33.000> little<00:02:33.180> bit<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.299> the<00:02:33.450> swell<00:02:33.690> he

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
current and a little bit of the swell he

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.720 
current and a little bit of the swell he
did<00:02:34.380> great<00:02:34.620> he<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.100> know<00:02:35.220> he<00:02:35.370> did<00:02:35.519> great<00:02:35.670> i

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
did great he you know he did great i

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.400 
did great he you know he did great i
think<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.329> was<00:02:36.450> really<00:02:36.720> interesting<00:02:36.959> for<00:02:37.319> him

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
think it was really interesting for him

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.660 
think it was really interesting for him
it<00:02:37.500> was<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> little<00:02:37.709> bit<00:02:37.829> like<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.130> freeway<00:02:38.519> out

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
it was a little bit like the freeway out

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.520 
it was a little bit like the freeway out
there<00:02:38.940> dodging<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.569> a<00:02:39.660> lot<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.870> people<00:02:39.989> but<00:02:40.470> I

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
there dodging and a lot of people but I

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.400 
there dodging and a lot of people but I
think<00:02:40.859> the<00:02:41.250> good<00:02:41.280> part<00:02:41.730> was<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.049> we<00:02:43.049> land<00:02:43.260> up

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
think the good part was that we land up

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.470 
think the good part was that we land up
landing<00:02:43.829> up<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.130> group<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:44.940> he<00:02:45.120> realized

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
landing up in a group so he realized

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.580 
landing up in a group so he realized
that<00:02:45.720> there's<00:02:45.930> gonna<00:02:46.019> be<00:02:46.169> a<00:02:46.199> lot<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.380> people

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
that there's gonna be a lot of people

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.620 
that there's gonna be a lot of people

a lot of questions we're going to kind
of<00:03:23.760> really<00:03:23.970> get<00:03:24.209> down<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.600> detail<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:25.380> think

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
of really get down to the detail I think

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.290 
of really get down to the detail I think
I<00:03:26.190> think<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.730> all<00:03:26.819> just<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.209> little

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
I think this is all just a little

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.199 
I think this is all just a little
overwhelming<00:03:27.900> for<00:03:27.959> him<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:29.730> know<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.970> first
