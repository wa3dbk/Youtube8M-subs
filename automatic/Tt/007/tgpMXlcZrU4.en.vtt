cable tie it off as you go it's nice and
neat<00:02:38.659> now<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.440> tricky<00:02:39.830> part<00:02:40.069> here<00:02:40.159> is<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.430> get

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
neat now the tricky part here is to get

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.330 
neat now the tricky part here is to get
the<00:02:40.819> wires<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.510> cable<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:41.900> we've<00:02:42.019> got

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
the wires and the cable that we've got

itself<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:45.860> what<00:02:45.980> I'm<00:02:46.129> going<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.280> do<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.580> I've

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
itself so what I'm going to do is I've

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.400 
itself so what I'm going to do is I've
got<00:02:46.730> an<00:02:46.910> old<00:02:47.060> wooden<00:02:47.480> skewer<00:02:47.840> I've<00:02:48.049> cut<00:02:48.379> down

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
got an old wooden skewer I've cut down

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.740 
got an old wooden skewer I've cut down
to<00:02:48.650> size<00:02:48.830> I'm<00:02:49.640> going<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.849> tape<00:02:50.000> my<00:02:50.150> wires<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.660> it

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
to size I'm going to tape my wires to it

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.119 
to size I'm going to tape my wires to it
I'm<00:02:50.900> going<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.140> use<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.560> thread<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:51.980> through

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
I'm going to use it to thread it through

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.650 
I'm going to use it to thread it through
a<00:02:52.280> grommet<00:02:52.640> that's<00:02:52.790> pretty<00:02:53.060> existing<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.569> the

thread<00:02:59.239> through<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.569> grommet<00:02:59.930> it's<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.560> good

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
thread through the grommet it's a good

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.140 
thread through the grommet it's a good
idea<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:01.129> make<00:03:01.310> sure<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.790> cover<00:03:02.060> the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
wires right up like this so that they

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.069 
wires right up like this so that they
aren't<00:03:04.400> damaged<00:03:04.970> when<00:03:05.269> pulled<00:03:05.569> through<00:03:05.810> into

aren't damaged when pulled through into
the<00:03:06.170> cabin<00:03:06.530> now<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.459> need<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.940> terminate<00:03:08.180> the

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
the cabin now we need to terminate the

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.059 
the cabin now we need to terminate the
two<00:03:08.750> wires<00:03:09.049> that<00:03:09.290> we've<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:09.680> pulled<00:03:09.859> through

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
two wires that we've just pulled through

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.400 
two wires that we've just pulled through
into<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.430> cabin<00:03:10.790> strip<00:03:11.629> a<00:03:11.660> centimeter<00:03:12.170> or<00:03:12.379> so

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
into the cabin strip a centimeter or so

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.170

of the insulation from each wire and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.819 
of the insulation from each wire and
then<00:03:14.599> measure<00:03:14.840> just<00:03:15.109> how<00:03:15.290> much<00:03:15.470> you're<00:03:15.680> going

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
then measure just how much you're going

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.410 
then measure just how much you're going
to<00:03:15.980> need<00:03:16.310> and<00:03:16.519> then<00:03:16.760> trim<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.209> wire

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
to need and then trim the wire

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.030 
to need and then trim the wire
accordingly<00:03:18.019> that<00:03:18.440> will<00:03:18.620> check<00:03:18.799> with<00:03:18.920> your

while<00:03:30.980> you're<00:03:31.099> doing<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:31.430> now<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.239> might<00:03:32.480> be

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
while you're doing that now you might be

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.120 
while you're doing that now you might be
wondering<00:03:32.810> what<00:03:33.139> the<00:03:33.290> third<00:03:33.560> problem<00:03:33.859> the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
wondering what the third problem the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.129 
wondering what the third problem the
switch<00:03:34.370> is<00:03:34.549> for<00:03:34.790> that's<00:03:35.630> if<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.900> want<00:03:35.930> to

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
switch is for that's if you want to

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.979 
switch is for that's if you want to
illuminate<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.799> label<00:03:37.099> LED<00:03:37.849> light<00:03:38.599> that's<00:03:38.840> on

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
illuminate the label LED light that's on

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.780 
illuminate the label LED light that's on
the<00:03:39.079> switch<00:03:39.290> itself<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:40.130> all<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.340> need<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.579> do

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
the switch itself and all you need to do

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.030 
the switch itself and all you need to do
is<00:03:41.209> basically<00:03:41.780> run<00:03:41.989> that<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.410> an<00:03:42.500> earth<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:42.980> to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
is basically run that to an earth so to

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.159 
is basically run that to an earth so to
the<00:03:43.370> body<00:03:43.549> of<00:03:43.639> the<00:03:43.730> vehicle<00:03:44.150> in<00:03:44.359> my<00:03:44.750> case<00:03:44.989> I'm

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
the body of the vehicle in my case I'm

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.479 
the body of the vehicle in my case I'm
not<00:03:45.260> going<00:03:45.410> to<00:03:45.470> worry<00:03:45.620> about<00:03:45.769> it<00:03:46.010> I'm<00:03:46.160> not<00:03:46.190> too

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
not going to worry about it I'm not too

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.949 
not going to worry about it I'm not too
fussed<00:03:46.669> about<00:03:46.849> having<00:03:47.239> that<00:03:47.359> light<00:03:47.540> on<00:03:47.720> or<00:03:47.870> off

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
fussed about having that light on or off

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.690 
fussed about having that light on or off
I'll<00:03:48.590> certainly<00:03:48.889> know<00:03:49.069> when<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.340> lights<00:03:49.549> are

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
I'll certainly know when the lights are

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.530 
I'll certainly know when the lights are
on<00:03:49.849> that's<00:03:50.060> for<00:03:50.239> sure<00:03:51.519> so<00:03:52.519> now<00:03:52.760> we<00:03:52.819> need<00:03:53.150> to<00:03:53.209> run

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
on that's for sure so now we need to run

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.569 
on that's for sure so now we need to run
the<00:03:53.660> other<00:03:53.840> two<00:03:54.230> insulated<00:03:54.980> wires<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:55.459> are

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
the other two insulated wires that are

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.909 
the other two insulated wires that are

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
hot such as the radiator but as we can

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.229 
hot such as the radiator but as we can
see<00:04:09.919> we've<00:04:10.099> got<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.250> fair<00:04:10.549> bit<00:04:10.700> of<00:04:10.760> slack<00:04:11.060> left

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
see we've got a fair bit of slack left

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.000 
see we've got a fair bit of slack left
over<00:04:11.569> on<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.750> driver<00:04:12.019> side<00:04:12.139> and<00:04:12.590> it's

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
over on the driver side and it's

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.379 
over on the driver side and it's
important<00:04:13.400> that<00:04:13.519> we<00:04:13.579> manage<00:04:13.730> this<00:04:14.000> correctly

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
important that we manage this correctly

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.330 
important that we manage this correctly
for<00:04:14.629> a<00:04:14.660> couple<00:04:14.959> of<00:04:15.049> reasons<00:04:15.230> number<00:04:15.650> one<00:04:15.950> we

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
for a couple of reasons number one we

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.529 
for a couple of reasons number one we
need<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:16.609> keep<00:04:16.760> it<00:04:16.910> away<00:04:17.000> from<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.389> heat

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
need to keep it away from the heat

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.089 
need to keep it away from the heat
source<00:04:17.720> which<00:04:17.989> in<00:04:18.109> our<00:04:18.200> case<00:04:18.260> is<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.709> radiator

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
source which in our case is the radiator

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.069 
source which in our case is the radiator
up<00:04:19.310> front<00:04:19.549> here<00:04:19.729> and<00:04:19.910> in<00:04:20.570> things<00:04:20.959> like
