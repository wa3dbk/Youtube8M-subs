00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
so you can see even with all of those

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.250 
so you can see even with all of those

things that has a playroom and then like

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.780 
things that has a playroom and then like
these<00:03:02.440> two<00:03:02.680> plays<00:03:02.889> that's<00:03:03.129> just<00:03:03.340> pretend<00:03:03.730> like

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
these two plays that's just pretend like

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.920 
these two plays that's just pretend like
those<00:03:03.970> weren't<00:03:04.209> there<00:03:04.389> for<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.569> minute

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
those weren't there for a minute

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.690 
those weren't there for a minute
usually<00:03:05.379> there's<00:03:05.560> still<00:03:05.799> tons<00:03:06.099> of<00:03:06.310> stuff<00:03:06.519> left

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
usually there's still tons of stuff left

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.039 
usually there's still tons of stuff left
in<00:03:06.849> here<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.299> I<00:03:07.329> have<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.569> feeling<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.019> don't

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.470 
in here so I have a feeling that I don't
have<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.319> go<00:03:08.440> through<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.980> edit<00:03:09.579> out<00:03:09.819> a<00:03:10.090> couple

have to go through and edit out a couple

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.229 
have to go through and edit out a couple
more<00:03:10.599> times<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:12.519> kind<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.819> weed<00:03:13.090> out

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
more times just to kind of weed out

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.580 
more times just to kind of weed out
things<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.599> aren't<00:03:13.870> being<00:03:13.959> used<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.440> that

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
things that aren't being used and that
