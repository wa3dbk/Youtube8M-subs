to<00:03:17.939> say<00:03:18.120> nothing<00:03:18.449> slow<00:03:18.780> down<00:03:18.989> nothing's<00:03:19.319> sped

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
to say nothing slow down nothing's sped

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.170 
to say nothing slow down nothing's sped
up<00:03:19.769> but<00:03:20.009> it's<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.459> like<00:03:20.579> water<00:03:20.909> in<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
up but it's just like water in the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.729 
up but it's just like water in the
background<00:03:21.540> which<00:03:21.689> would<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.169> would<00:03:22.319> be<00:03:22.470> cool

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
background which would it would be cool

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:23.869 
background which would it would be cool
but<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:23.040> wouldn't<00:03:23.220> really<00:03:23.340> make<00:03:23.489> sense<00:03:23.729> for

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
but it wouldn't really make sense for

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.659 
but it wouldn't really make sense for
the<00:03:23.970> map<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.689> it's<00:03:25.049> crazy<00:03:25.379> cause<00:03:25.620> like<00:03:25.680> it's

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
the map but it's crazy cause like it's

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.670 
the map but it's crazy cause like it's
literally<00:03:27.090> not<00:03:27.239> another<00:03:27.780> word<00:03:27.930> base<00:03:28.229> and<00:03:28.530> it's

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
literally not another word base and it's

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.740 
literally not another word base and it's
insane<00:03:29.009> like<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.639> freakin<00:03:29.909> city<00:03:30.180> it's

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
insane like it's a freakin city it's

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.589 
insane like it's a freakin city it's
literally<00:03:31.199> a<00:03:31.319> city<00:03:31.739> underwater<00:03:32.389> how<00:03:33.389> is<00:03:33.509> this

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
literally a city underwater how is this

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.210 
literally a city underwater how is this
like<00:03:34.079> how<00:03:34.229> did<00:03:34.290> they<00:03:34.470> even<00:03:34.500> get<00:03:34.859> there<00:03:35.069> you

need to explain to us for the actual

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.509 
need to explain to us for the actual
easter<00:03:39.180> egg<00:03:39.299> um<00:03:39.509> dude<00:03:40.500> they<00:03:40.889> just<00:03:41.069> end<00:03:41.280> up

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.330 
easter egg um dude they just end up
underwater<00:03:42.209> atlases<00:03:43.079> underwater<00:03:43.709> city<00:03:44.129> I

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
underwater atlases underwater city I

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.119 
underwater atlases underwater city I
mean<00:03:44.939> this<00:03:45.239> is<00:03:45.419> in<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.989> future<00:03:46.409> and<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:46.919> is

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
mean this is in the future and this is

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.280 
mean this is in the future and this is
Atlas<00:03:47.609> a<00:03:47.669> huge<00:03:48.060> corporation<00:03:48.720> ton<00:03:49.199> of

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
Atlas a huge corporation ton of

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.159 
Atlas a huge corporation ton of
technology<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.400> maybe<00:03:50.790> it's<00:03:51.209> underwater<00:03:51.750> city

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
technology so maybe it's underwater city

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.929 
technology so maybe it's underwater city
but<00:03:52.470> you're<00:03:52.590> actually<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:53.129> enclosed<00:03:53.669> in

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
but you're actually like enclosed in

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.929 
but you're actually like enclosed in
some<00:03:54.180> tube<00:03:54.859> type<00:03:55.859> thing<00:03:56.129> around<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.519> map<00:03:56.699> and

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
some tube type thing around the map and

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.149 
some tube type thing around the map and
your<00:03:57.329> enclosed<00:03:57.629> in<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.959> certain<00:03:58.229> area<00:03:58.469> and<00:03:58.709> a

your enclosed in a certain area and a

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.679 
your enclosed in a certain area and a
rest<00:03:59.639> of<00:03:59.759> the<00:03:59.819> map<00:03:59.969> is<00:04:00.120> water<00:04:00.329> but<00:04:00.509> you<00:04:00.569> can

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
rest of the map is water but you can

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.420 
rest of the map is water but you can
actually<00:04:00.810> go<00:04:01.049> there<00:04:01.199> because<00:04:01.379> your<00:04:02.040> inclusion

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
actually go there because your inclusion

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.819 
actually go there because your inclusion
or<00:04:02.759> your<00:04:03.060> income<00:04:03.359> included<00:04:04.139> with<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.680> whole

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
oxygen sort of facility type thing in

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.659 
oxygen sort of facility type thing in
the<00:04:07.109> city<00:04:07.379> or<00:04:07.769> maybe<00:04:07.979> you're<00:04:08.159> just<00:04:08.189> flat-out

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
the city or maybe you're just flat-out

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.670 
the city or maybe you're just flat-out
in<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.180> city<00:04:09.449> and<00:04:09.689> it's<00:04:09.840> just<00:04:09.989> water<00:04:10.319> over<00:04:10.620> the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
in the city and it's just water over the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.719 
in the city and it's just water over the
place<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.039> you<00:04:11.129> probably<00:04:11.340> have<00:04:11.519> like<00:04:11.579> an

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
place and you probably have like an

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.089 
place and you probably have like an
oxygen<00:04:12.060> tank<00:04:12.509> type<00:04:12.780> thing<00:04:13.079> maybe<00:04:13.889> up<00:04:14.069> to

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
oxygen tank type thing maybe up to

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.849 
oxygen tank type thing maybe up to
refill<00:04:14.639> it<00:04:15.049> maybe<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.229> have<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.409> go<00:04:16.560> around

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
refill it maybe you have to go around

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.520 
refill it maybe you have to go around
get<00:04:17.699> your<00:04:17.820> new<00:04:17.969> one<00:04:18.209> or<00:04:18.449> you<00:04:18.840> have<00:04:19.049> like<00:04:19.229> five

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
get your new one or you have like five

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.319 
get your new one or you have like five
minutes<00:04:19.799> from<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.219> star<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.639> map<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:21.209> get

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
minutes from the star of the map to get

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.060 
minutes from the star of the map to get
your<00:04:21.449> oxygen<00:04:21.900> tank<00:04:22.139> instead<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.529> like<00:04:22.770> instead

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
your oxygen tank instead of like instead

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.620 
your oxygen tank instead of like instead
of<00:04:23.130> going<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.400> get<00:04:23.580> your<00:04:23.669> exosuit<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.449> have<00:04:24.570> to

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
of going to get your exosuit you have to

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.080 
of going to get your exosuit you have to
get<00:04:24.750> your<00:04:24.810> oxygen<00:04:25.260> tank<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.710> then

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
get your oxygen tank and then

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.330 
get your oxygen tank and then
you<00:04:26.150> don't<00:04:26.300> make<00:04:26.449> it<00:04:26.510> there<00:04:26.780> in<00:04:26.810> time<00:04:27.050> or<00:04:27.680> if

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
you don't make it there in time or if

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.770 
you don't make it there in time or if
you<00:04:28.460> don't<00:04:28.580> make<00:04:28.669> it<00:04:28.790> there<00:04:29.090> by<00:04:29.240> around<00:04:29.480> five

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
you don't make it there by around five

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.020 
you don't make it there by around five
let's<00:04:30.110> say<00:04:30.320> then<00:04:31.130> you<00:04:31.220> basically<00:04:31.370> die<00:04:31.760> or<00:04:32.000> you

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
let's say then you basically die or you

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.150 
let's say then you basically die or you
slowly<00:04:32.720> run<00:04:32.990> out<00:04:33.110> of<00:04:33.139> oxygen<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.650> lose<00:04:33.860> health

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
slowly run out of oxygen you lose health

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.610 
slowly run out of oxygen you lose health
you<00:04:34.729> come<00:04:35.210> weaker<00:04:35.600> slower<00:04:35.990> stuff<00:04:36.440> like<00:04:36.560> that

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
you come weaker slower stuff like that

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.740 
you come weaker slower stuff like that
so<00:04:37.340> they<00:04:37.520> can<00:04:37.669> they<00:04:37.880> can<00:04:37.910> add<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.210> lot<00:04:38.600> of

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
so they can they can add a lot of

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.900 
so they can they can add a lot of
interesting<00:04:39.380> gameplay<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.919> this<00:04:40.190> map<00:04:40.400> if<00:04:40.669> it

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
interesting gameplay to this map if it

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.310 
interesting gameplay to this map if it
is<00:04:41.030> an<00:04:41.210> underwater<00:04:41.540> city<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.080> it's<00:04:42.169> just

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
is an underwater city and it's just

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.920 
is an underwater city and it's just
flat-out<00:04:42.699> city<00:04:43.699> and<00:04:43.940> then<00:04:44.030> water<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.600> that's

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
flat-out city and then water and that's

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.760 
flat-out city and then water and that's
it<00:04:45.110> no<00:04:45.560> no<00:04:45.889> crazy<00:04:46.250> tank<00:04:47.080> underwater<00:04:48.080> base<00:04:48.410> type

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
it no no crazy tank underwater base type

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.050 
it no no crazy tank underwater base type
thing<00:04:49.040> no<00:04:49.250> enclosed<00:04:50.210> tube<00:04:51.520> oxygen<00:04:52.520> Center

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
thing no enclosed tube oxygen Center

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.969
