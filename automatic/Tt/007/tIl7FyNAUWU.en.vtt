connector each connector have a tab at

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
connector each connector have a tab at
the<00:01:06.450> back<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> push<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the back of it that you have to push to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.149 
the back of it that you have to push to
release<00:01:08.630> each<00:01:09.630> coil<00:01:09.960> has<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.260> locking<00:01:10.890> tab<00:01:11.130> that

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
release each coil has a locking tab that

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.000 
release each coil has a locking tab that
these<00:01:11.640> snap<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.049> what<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
these snap on to so what you do is you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.310 
these snap on to so what you do is you
push<00:01:14.250> back<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> locking<00:01:15.180> tab<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.810> lot<00:01:16.259> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
push back on the locking tab a lot of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.210 
push back on the locking tab a lot of
times<00:01:16.470> you'll<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.799> give<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.100> little

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
times you'll have to give it a little

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.880 
times you'll have to give it a little
wiggle<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.390> slide<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.750> off<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.740> do

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
wiggle and you slide it off and you do

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.630 
wiggle and you slide it off and you do
that<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.100> each<00:01:20.250> coil<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:23.070> pop<00:01:23.280> them<00:01:23.460> off

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that on each coil and you pop them off

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.330 
that on each coil and you pop them off
now<00:01:24.600> sometimes<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.470> can<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> little<00:01:26.220> bit

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
now sometimes these can get a little bit

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
now sometimes these can get a little bit
difficult<00:01:26.549> once<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.930> done<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.409> can

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
difficult once you get that done you can

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.300 
difficult once you get that done you can
slide<00:01:28.860> all<00:01:29.189> four<00:01:29.610> off<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.799> you<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.979> pull<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
slide all four off and you can pull the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.330 
slide all four off and you can pull the
ignition<00:01:32.670> coil<00:01:32.909> harness<00:01:33.329> off<00:01:34.189> after<00:01:35.189> you've

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
ignition coil harness off after you've

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.880 
ignition coil harness off after you've
removed<00:01:35.520> all<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> connectors<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.500> pull

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
removed all the connectors you can pull

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980 
removed all the connectors you can pull
the<00:01:38.040> ignition<00:01:38.400> coils<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.450> simple<00:01:39.840> they

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the ignition coils out very simple they

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.710 
the ignition coils out very simple they
just<00:01:40.140> pull<00:01:40.350> straight<00:01:40.770> up<00:01:41.270> there<00:01:42.270> are<00:01:42.479> some

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
just pull straight up there are some

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.929 
just pull straight up there are some
tools<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.200> there<00:01:43.229> they<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.560> use<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.670> remove

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
tools out there they can use to remove

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.370 
tools out there they can use to remove
these<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.570> make<00:01:45.720> your<00:01:45.869> life<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.200> little

you apply pressure evenly and they'll

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.649 
you apply pressure evenly and they'll
come<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.619> you'll<00:01:56.430> all<00:01:56.640> sometimes<00:01:56.909> end<00:01:57.329> up<00:01:57.479> with

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
come up you'll all sometimes end up with

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
some of this on the ignition coils this

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.899 
some of this on the ignition coils this
is<00:02:00.090> pretty<00:02:00.329> standard<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:01.020> you'll<00:02:01.140> find<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.680> a

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
is pretty standard that you'll find on a

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
is pretty standard that you'll find on a
regional<00:02:02.909> equipment<00:02:03.479> coil<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.869> being<00:02:04.500> your

that<00:02:28.489> will<00:02:29.090> lock<00:02:29.300> into<00:02:29.540> place<00:02:29.720> on<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.050> valve

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
that will lock into place on the valve

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.280 
that will lock into place on the valve
cover<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:31.180> there<00:02:32.180> on<00:02:32.330> either<00:02:32.540> side<00:02:33.020> so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
cover and there on either side so

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.190 
cover and there on either side so
basically<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:33.830> slide<00:02:34.069> it<00:02:34.220> down<00:02:34.340> in<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:35.200> you

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
a pressure to get them popped over the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:50.590 
a pressure to get them popped over the
spark<00:02:39.440> plug<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:49.400> will<00:02:49.640> sound<00:02:50.000> audibly

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
spark plug it will sound audibly

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.449 
spark plug it will sound audibly
sometimes<00:02:51.110> when<00:02:51.290> they<00:02:51.380> snap<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.890> on<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.370> the

sometimes when they snap on on to the

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:08.039 
sometimes when they snap on on to the
plug<00:02:52.700> like<00:02:52.880> that

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.830
