00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
can also take off so you don't have to

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.620 
can also take off so you don't have to
have<00:00:18.130> it<00:00:18.279> and<00:00:18.669> you<00:00:18.790> can't<00:00:19.000> clip<00:00:19.180> it<00:00:19.300> on<00:00:19.390> with

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
have it and you can't clip it on with

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.659 
have it and you can't clip it on with
the<00:00:19.720> little<00:00:19.869> clips<00:00:20.169> on<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:20.470> side<00:00:20.680> the<00:00:21.460> case

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:21.669 
the little clips on the side the case

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.659 
the little clips on the side the case
itself<00:00:22.119> has<00:00:22.480> a<00:00:22.509> rubber<00:00:23.220> silicon<00:00:24.220> I<00:00:24.400> think<00:00:24.579> it

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:24.669 
itself has a rubber silicon I think it

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.339 
itself has a rubber silicon I think it
is<00:00:24.789> around<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.270> outside<00:00:25.660> of<00:00:25.689> it<00:00:25.930> the<00:00:26.199> rubber

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
is around the outside of it the rubber

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.480 
is around the outside of it the rubber
actually<00:00:26.680> goes<00:00:26.830> all<00:00:27.010> the<00:00:27.039> way<00:00:27.130> around<00:00:27.279> the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
actually goes all the way around the

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.950 
actually goes all the way around the
phone<00:00:27.670> and<00:00:27.880> covers<00:00:28.150> up<00:00:28.300> all<00:00:28.449> the<00:00:28.570> buttons<00:00:28.840> but

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
phone and covers up all the buttons but

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.330 
phone and covers up all the buttons but
you<00:00:28.990> still<00:00:29.230> get<00:00:29.349> access<00:00:29.439> to<00:00:29.769> them<00:00:29.890> your<00:00:30.010> volume

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
you still get access to them your volume

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.470 
you still get access to them your volume
buttons<00:00:30.640> your<00:00:30.820> silent<00:00:31.150> button<00:00:31.269> there's<00:00:31.449> a

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
buttons your silent button there's a

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.630 
buttons your silent button there's a
little<00:00:31.689> I<00:00:31.840> thinking<00:00:32.320> pull<00:00:32.559> out<00:00:32.739> there<00:00:32.949> for

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
little I thinking pull out there for

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.000 
little I thinking pull out there for
that<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:34.120> headphone<00:00:34.780> jack<00:00:35.080> the<00:00:35.110> power<00:00:35.530> button

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
that the headphone jack the power button

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.890 
that the headphone jack the power button
I<00:00:36.220> pretty<00:00:36.610> much<00:00:36.730> everything<00:00:37.120> even<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.480> USB

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
I pretty much everything even the USB

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900 
I pretty much everything even the USB
there's<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.470> little<00:00:38.680> thing<00:00:38.830> that<00:00:38.860> pops<00:00:39.730> in

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
there's a little thing that pops in

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.759 
there's a little thing that pops in
there<00:00:40.030> really<00:00:40.210> snug<00:00:40.540> you<00:00:41.080> can<00:00:41.230> open<00:00:41.470> that<00:00:41.500> up

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
there really snug you can open that up

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:43.229 
there really snug you can open that up
if<00:00:41.920> you<00:00:42.010> wanted<00:00:42.220> to<00:00:42.339> charge<00:00:42.580> your<00:00:42.790> phone<00:00:42.970> and

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
if you wanted to charge your phone and

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.479 
if you wanted to charge your phone and
then<00:00:43.780> the<00:00:43.900> layer<00:00:44.049> under<00:00:44.559> it<00:00:44.589> it's<00:00:45.159> actually

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
then the layer under it it's actually

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.130 
then the layer under it it's actually
really<00:00:45.820> heavy<00:00:46.030> it<00:00:46.210> adds<00:00:46.360> a<00:00:46.510> lot<00:00:46.780> of<00:00:46.900> weight<00:00:47.110> to

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
really heavy it adds a lot of weight to

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.450 
really heavy it adds a lot of weight to
your<00:00:47.470> phone<00:00:47.680> which<00:00:47.890> I<00:00:48.040> don't<00:00:48.100> that's<00:00:48.400> the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
your phone which I don't that's the

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.619 
your phone which I don't that's the
reason<00:00:48.699> I<00:00:48.729> don't<00:00:48.790> like<00:00:48.909> the<00:00:49.089> OtterBox<00:00:49.420> cases

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
reason I don't like the OtterBox cases

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.509 
reason I don't like the OtterBox cases
is<00:00:49.930> just<00:00:50.110> because<00:00:50.260> they're<00:00:50.379> so<00:00:50.589> heavy<00:00:50.799> and

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
is just because they're so heavy and

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.189 
is just because they're so heavy and
they're<00:00:51.640> bulky<00:00:51.879> this<00:00:52.360> one<00:00:52.510> itself<00:00:52.869> actually

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
they're bulky this one itself actually

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.380 
they're bulky this one itself actually
isn't<00:00:53.350> too<00:00:53.530> bulky<00:00:53.739> if<00:00:54.610> you<00:00:54.909> have<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.089> clip<00:00:55.269> on

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
isn't too bulky if you have the clip on

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.600 
isn't too bulky if you have the clip on
it's<00:00:55.600> super<00:00:55.839> bulky<00:00:55.989> though<00:00:56.290> now<00:00:57.159> but<00:00:57.309> anyways

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
it's super bulky though now but anyways

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.460 
it's super bulky though now but anyways
this<00:00:58.119> actually<00:00:58.510> clips<00:00:58.750> together<00:00:58.930> with<00:00:59.290> two

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
this actually clips together with two

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.770 
this actually clips together with two
clips<00:00:59.769> or<00:01:00.010> three<00:01:00.190> clips<00:01:00.430> there's<00:01:01.030> one<00:01:01.479> on<00:01:01.600> each

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
clips or three clips there's one on each

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.810 
clips or three clips there's one on each
side<00:01:02.080> and<00:01:02.320> there's<00:01:02.470> one<00:01:02.710> at<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.070> top<00:01:03.339> the

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
side and there's one at the top the

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.100 
side and there's one at the top the
screen<00:01:03.909> protector<00:01:04.119> covers<00:01:04.629> up<00:01:04.750> your<00:01:04.809> screen

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
screen protector covers up your screen

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.390 
screen protector covers up your screen
and<00:01:05.260> will<00:01:05.379> still<00:01:05.590> give<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:05.770> access<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.159> it<00:01:06.340> so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
and will still give you access to it so

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.500 
and will still give you access to it so
you<00:01:06.490> don't<00:01:06.549> get<00:01:06.700> scratches<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.210> stuff<00:01:07.360> like

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
you don't get scratches and stuff like

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.390 
you don't get scratches and stuff like
that<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:08.320> since<00:01:08.530> it<00:01:08.680> does<00:01:08.799> have<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.010> lip<00:01:09.250> around

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
that and since it does have a lip around

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.580 
that and since it does have a lip around
the<00:01:09.580> screen<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:10.060> should<00:01:10.479> protect<00:01:10.810> for<00:01:11.350> most

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
the screen I should protect for most

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.499 
the screen I should protect for most
drops<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.430> won't<00:01:12.640> crack<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.030> screen<00:01:13.270> if<00:01:13.390> it

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
drops so it won't crack the screen if it

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.660 
drops so it won't crack the screen if it
hit<00:01:13.630> first<00:01:13.899> yeah<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:14.920> then<00:01:15.039> over<00:01:15.250> on<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.460> back

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
hit first yeah and then over on the back

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.099 
hit first yeah and then over on the back
it<00:01:15.850> actually<00:01:15.939> covers<00:01:16.270> up<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.600> Apple<00:01:17.020> logo

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
it actually covers up the Apple logo

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.660 
it actually covers up the Apple logo
there's<00:01:17.380> also<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.619> piece<00:01:17.799> there<00:01:18.009> and<00:01:18.280> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
there's also a piece there and the

there's also a piece there and the
camera<00:01:19.060> hole<00:01:19.210> doesn't<00:01:19.899> have<00:01:20.079> any<00:01:20.229> plastic

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.289 
camera hole doesn't have any plastic
cover<00:01:20.679> so<00:01:20.890> you<00:01:21.250> wouldn't<00:01:21.460> want<00:01:21.549> a<00:01:21.850> piece<00:01:22.270> of
