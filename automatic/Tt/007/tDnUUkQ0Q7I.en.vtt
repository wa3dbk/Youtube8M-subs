00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.219
 they took four French 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.860

 when I saw I tell myself this is it there 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.700
 fell in love again in his head he 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.120

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.410
 heat the scooter 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.789
 one of the things the show go 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.230
 to find a job is good 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.370
 first time that dutch contribute to 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.809
 Reverse the curve of unemployment 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.949
 still three and a half million 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.350
 emissions of the unemployed 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.239
 france allah for unemployed youth 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.060
 and the tremendous measures announced a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.729
 unpaid civic internship it's called 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.680
 work for free before had the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.659
 unemployment with money his job but 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.200
 in a new concept the boulou without 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.869
 money 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.310
 then from a poll prince 97% of 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.380
 French estimate that françois hollande 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.700
 failed in the fight against unemployment 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.640
 the other three percent do not have 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.530
 understood the question no but the call 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.689
 things françois hollande expects he does 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.340
 a good score with his show people 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.670
 talked about it because the next day by 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.969
 nabila the plant and his good guy 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.890
 fucked by a good woman it's 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.600
 no françois fillon and jean pierre played 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.610
 they have trouble because of a lunch 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.319
 so I explain fillon hope to 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.360
 to become top chef and it ends up a nightmare 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.890
 in the kitchen 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.959
 so from July fillon him would have 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.240
 asked to speed up proceedings against 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.670
 sarkozy but fillon said it was 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.829
 not true and he has a witness but it's a 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.899
 buddy to him then july said that 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.220
 fillon had never said that except he 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.780
 told reporters that one 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.799
 May-July recorded attractiveness 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.509
 do you understand then fillon he is in 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.890
 anger and defend to the newspaper of 20 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.310
 hours he is at the top of nervousness 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.930
 fiss pissed that's how it's crazy 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.310
 because edgy fillon he is no longer 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.310
 calm that sarkozy the normal state 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.670
 fillon tell me it's a plot 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.720
 against him and no but excuse me who 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.859
 make me a conspiracy against fillon is 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.000
 so friends of jean-pierre july 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.040
 they say he's clumsily 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.579
 an awkwardness is the new pure word 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.470
 lie 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.500
 no no darling i did not cheat on her 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.510
 clumsiness as the saying goes men 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.910
 politicians too talkative is found in 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.550
 a duck 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.209
 otherwise arles or drunk motorcycle go back to 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.290
 the school to become a top leader 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.140
 35000 euros the few weeks and the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.250
 pint is rarely doubled 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.660
 montebourg he first feminized 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.610
 the economy in switzerland then knew that he 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.989
 had gaps actually arnaud 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.860
 montebourg he takes a shower and when 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.860
 they try to undress 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.610
 if not after a sarkozy book retells to 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.379
 the ump is all idiots I expect 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.420
 can not believe that Nicolas Sarkozy 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.700
 expresses himself like that it's not at all 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.769
 shock of sarkozy non sarkozy could 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.180
 to say it's big stupid stupid cons 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.349
 shit yes the guy from the cgt he did 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.569
 per hundred thousand euros of work in 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.470
 his apartment but it's not his 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.379
 fault because they did not know 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.819
 how much does it cost and no he learned the 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.959
 amount of work by the press the 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.670
 next time the contractor is going 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.110
 send it directly from life to the duck 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.610
 chained cgt how to win jobs 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.989
 the guy called the bridge I do not know 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.989
 he should have known that the wheel turns 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.209
 but that is what touched me is 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.580
 when the president in his show he 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.260
 said I could make mistakes myself 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.000
 I think that's what you said 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.860
 pronounced all the time you discovered 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.909
 you go see your banker I could 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.620
 make mistakes 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.629
 you could say that by cutting without 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.989
 doing it on purpose I could commit 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.540
 errors 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.349
 you voted francois hollande I was able 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.349
 make mistakes 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.829
 so if both the president you have 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.989
 a great revelation he said I 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:17.880
 tour the bistrots for 30 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.049
 30 years of bistro because it's 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.590
 find that's where he developed his 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.930
 program 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.669
 no no at the lond he was very happy 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.010
 that's when he talked about the jo of 2024 he 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.539
 said it will be a moment of fervor 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.100
 joy and joy 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:33.720
 inevitably he will be there anymore finally the 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.210
 president to speak on TV for 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.169
 bounce and there if he wants to bounce me I 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.110
 see more than one solution these 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.820
 trampoline championships games either 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.289
 part ii means I cling I 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.870
 clinging to me it was big pony you want 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.300
 not bouncing no I'm encouraging 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.710
 Francois Holland to bounce with a little 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.430
 of luck he might even fall back into 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.139
 another country no I find it sad 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.710
 this story of nabila frankly that 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.330
 makes me sad 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.450
 people they do not want to believe that his 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.500
 buddy he stabbed himself alone so 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.030
 it's not because it's not credible 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.440
 that it's not possible I say that can 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.620
 happen for example you see you me 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.880
 missing a steak and instead of taking 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.669
 a fork you take a knife 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.830
 okay, you make your beta fork 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.210
 therefore agree to the guy looks for 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.400
 pick up his fork there he has his 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.360
 knife then she to laugh back 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.360
 a pat on the back 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.980
 and you saw his subscribers of the 11 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.380
 November last year it was whistled 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.080
 then this year it was blue sky and 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.800
 that girl like me must keep 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.200
 hope 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.350
 Holland under the sun is there 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.880
 reverse the curve of the weather 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.010
 anyway we should have listened victor 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.790
 lanoux had warned us an elephant 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.790
 it's a big mistake
