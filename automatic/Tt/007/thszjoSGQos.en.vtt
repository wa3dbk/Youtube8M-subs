00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello to you all pour and my new 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.930
 heading tips tankmen before 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.110
 start i want to tell a little bit 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.150
 why in general I decided to create it I 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.099
 sure that each of you are already having 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.080
 some experience playing tanks more than once 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.480
 noticed mistakes the actions of allies or 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.730
 opponents how many times have you seen how 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.160
 inexperience firefly merged into the first 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.869
 note of combat or as the most armored 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.480
 cars in the game and interpreted anything 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.920
 besides my armor with time i started 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.109
 notice some errors 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.570
 allowed by so many players in 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.210
 almost every fight and not even all 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 know what they are doing here 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.219
 such moments I decided to base 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.379
 Tips for tank crews and probably 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.719
 the most common mistake in randomness 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 inability to play properly from relief 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.760
 after all, go beyond the knoll so as not to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.829
 to get damage, too, need to be able to and if 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.210
 This is for example the Chinese technology where there was 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.829
 do not go down and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.960
 it's triple and harder to start 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.969
 imagine that on the other side of you 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.769
 worth enemy tank for clarity I 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.960
 He took Rayna whose drum on 6 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.580
 shells, many believe that there will be 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.830
 right in such a situation roll out 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.270
 through the mound directly and give damage 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.270
 let me do it 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.700
 and what was the result of such a maneuver 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.880
 I have lost almost half my strength 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.570
 up in response only 430 damage is it worth 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.759
 she look like it is easy and convenient 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.679
 it was throwing lorraine and leaving 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.840
 like this even the most inexperienced tank 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.670
 the enemy in his place will be able to give damage 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.729
 in response to almost no seat 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.039
 And now look around on terrain as you 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.020
 see if you drive off a little to the left then 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.640
 the slope of the hill is much smoother here 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.860
 which means that from here we can 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.349
 shoot at the enemy without rolling over 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.110
 count and as a result only show in hand 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:05.149
 the tower of the tank while the enemy will be much 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.280
 harder guessing where you come out 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.590
 which will not give him the opportunity to fully 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.299
 come down to one point also want 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.280
 pay attention to what if the enemy 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.319
 looking at you should not wait for full 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.480
 information remember because the marriage in this 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.640
 case of already reduced pants so you 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.260
 just go give a shot and quickly 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.370
 backwards 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.260
 admit you won't always be like that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.959
 disappear but then take damage in 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.400
 the answer is a chance is much lower 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.440
 look from the side of an enemy tank 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.260
 notice how easy it is 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.299
 confused I don't know where the enemy will come out 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.459
 lit up and much to the left but the tank itself 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.140
 leaves noticeably further and it's second 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.049
 mistakes enough to go with impunity 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.239
 get damage add more to all this 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.459
 pretty ricochet and strong towers 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.260
 many tanks and inflict damage in such 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.829
 position is possible only with a certain 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.139
 of luck 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.900
 because in targeting them either vulnerable 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.880
 points out of the question still want to give 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.920
 a little tip for novice players or 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.290
 owners of weak computers who do not 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.209
 can quickly target an enemy tank for 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.609
 so short a time turn it on 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.319
 sight of course he will be less effective 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:09.200
 but still better with him than delayed 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.660
 the enemy has the most difficult target 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.660
 playing relief on tanks dedalo bad 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.730
 goes down I took the Chinese t-34 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.680
 one if I go out in the same place in porridge 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.239
 good part of your board before 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.819
 I can lower tunberg 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.010
 but pay attention to the relief a bit 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.470
 further the hill is much smoother with respect 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.480
 to and rhine and drove just a little to the left 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.209
 I can already shoot easily from the tower 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.980
 through the same slide yes to me here 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.970
 have to cut a little longer a 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.160
 then I will be longer in the shot 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.130
 but anyway even so get by me 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.450
 very audible 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.130
 also I want to draw all this 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.050
 note that if the enemy is just 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.210
 drive you like situations try 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.250
 hide and pass past the slope where he will 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.780
 come and you can always you 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.480
 building before u have time 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.670
 will roll just like he threw it 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.710
 rhine in the very first attempt to leave for 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.450
 it completion to my video I want 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.580
 pokozat great fight in practice 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.570
 which demonstrates very well 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.120
 a game of relief 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.160
 if you noticed the beginning of the video I 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.980
 showed exactly this fight where it is now 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.140
 for the first went to miss the hill and for 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.880
 that time, the opponents succeeded in coming to 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.100
 us to the base through the lower burkhan and 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.359
 was the only one who arrived 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.570
 protect the base 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.260
 And now pay attention to the enemy 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.360
 face 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.700
 he makes the very mistake 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.130
 trying to just roll out at me through 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.740
 directly over the top of the slide and give no 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.810
 damage as a result, he just takes damage 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.419
 I have not had time to drop us not muzzle 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.820
 the second thing I want to draw attention to 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.540
 I try to leave a little each time 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.870
 another place 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.820
 because if I went out every single 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.919
 the same side and being u not 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.169
 it would be difficult to come down to one point 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.640
 and wait for me to go out and my cardboard 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:58.650
 tower tower unlikely this is a good 3 on 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.050
 I want to pay attention try 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.270
 always finish and control exactly 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.610
 most dangerous opponents like i did 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.470
 case of scotch because at that moment when 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.720
 he rolled out i could see you as vesa 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.000
 6 so and he I could not even 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.689
 guess what you want to roll back so 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.849
 did not 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.559
 shot guided me at that moment 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.080
 Thoughts that I have done a few 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:21.599
 shots on isu sixth but he never 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.969
 drove off grabbing means that most likely 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.099
 he will stand still for a long time and if I 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.169
 give up back he won't be for me 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.299
 pose a danger but wants to 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.749
 rolls out on me and if i'm nothing 

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:36.749
 will he not only give damage and exactly 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:38.969
 also so i don't get iso which 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:42.089
 only 7 levels with a very spit cannon 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:45.059
 I can not lower the barrel in this 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:47.489
 position and finish off the left photo with which 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:50.209
 Not noticeably harder to shoot at 

00:05:47.489 --> 00:05:52.529
 Overall there is to take the game clubs this 

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:55.289
 a combination of so many nuances and 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.360
 situations repeat the same maneuver 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.459
 u or play a few times from one and 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.539
 same mound probably not equally 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:02.999
 never happens 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.949
 example if you noticed the enemy was one 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.989
 artillery that's why I tried 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.179
 stop only at the moment of the shot 

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:10.050
 all the rest of the time I did any 

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:12.239
 movements 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.969
 and now let's say the place was the enemy was 

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:17.069
 three arts or even more afraid of such 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:18.989
 situations after death 100 6 I was 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.239
 please take pictures on the hill or 

00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:23.339
 I went down to the city because there was one successful 

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:26.610
 hitting the arts can send me to 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:28.800
 hangar on top of all this i want 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.659
 give some advice that is possible 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.369
 helped me learn how to play relief 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:34.110
 terrain 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:36.659
 when I started to comprehend all these 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.909
 wisdom happened very often situations 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.669
 when I just took damage though I think that 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:44.399
 either they don't see me or this form only 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:46.110
 edge of my armored turret and here's how 

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:49.139
 time then I started paying attention to 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:51.119
 places where I was punched as it turned out 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.189
 very often when I think that the enemy sees 

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.089
 only we and the towers shot me even 

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:56.459
 lower armor sheet 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:58.769
 it helped me to perry analyze 

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:59.930
 as the enemy sees me and vitoge not 

00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:02.750
 show fish 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.340
 superfluous now by the way there is a great mod 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.259
 which tints swipe 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.449
 and no penetration of red and green 

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:09.759
 I strongly advise you to put it with him 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.229
 a little easier 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:15.440
 still maybe it will sound a little bit 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:17.449
 stupid helped me a lot fantasies i 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.100
 always try to imagine how to see 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.720
 me an adversary before and anywhere 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.639
 I leave and at the same time 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.160
 how easy it will be for him to hit me 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:27.949
 try to think your move too and 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.889
 the opponent's next move may be this 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:32.710
 will help you on this with me all if 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:34.940

 terrain with a detailed analysis also 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.900
