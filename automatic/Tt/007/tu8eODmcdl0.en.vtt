Johnson<00:02:01.120> drives<00:02:01.660> away<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.260> all<00:02:02.290> happens

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
Johnson drives away it all happens

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.260

behind<00:02:02.950> him<00:02:03.490> yeah<00:02:03.640> but<00:02:03.790> he's<00:02:03.910> getting<00:02:04.180> in

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270

trouble<00:02:04.420> right<00:02:04.630> here<00:02:04.870> and<00:02:04.960> he<00:02:05.020> starts<00:02:05.320> slowing

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
trouble right here and he starts slowing

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.920 
trouble right here and he starts slowing
down<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.800> think<00:02:06.010> Carl<00:02:06.400> Edwards<00:02:06.820> has<00:02:07.480> to<00:02:07.690> slow

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
down I think Carl Edwards has to slow

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.480 
down I think Carl Edwards has to slow
down<00:02:08.110> and<00:02:08.350> then<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.590> tire<00:02:08.830> comes<00:02:09.160> off<00:02:09.280> and

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
down and then the tire comes off and

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.250 
down and then the tire comes off and
