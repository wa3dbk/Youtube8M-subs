your screwdriver in between it like this

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.660 
your screwdriver in between it like this
and<00:01:52.060> just<00:01:52.989> pry<00:01:53.349> it<00:01:53.380> just<00:01:53.709> slightly<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:54.610> it

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
and just pry it just slightly so it

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.210 
and just pry it just slightly so it
comes<00:01:54.849> out<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:55.179> its<00:01:55.300> spot<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:56.649> pretty<00:01:56.830> simple

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
comes out of its spot it's pretty simple

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.510 
comes out of its spot it's pretty simple
but<00:01:58.119> you<00:01:58.539> know<00:01:58.630> if<00:01:58.690> you<00:01:58.840> go<00:01:59.709> too<00:01:59.770> far<00:02:00.220> when

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
but you know if you go too far when

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.830 
but you know if you go too far when
you're<00:02:00.610> prying<00:02:00.910> this<00:02:01.119> thing<00:02:01.300> out<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.599> could

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
you're prying this thing out you could

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.260 
you're prying this thing out you could
break<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.470> just<00:02:02.590> be<00:02:02.770> careful<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.429> that's

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
break it so just be careful and that's

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
break it so just be careful and that's
the<00:02:04.450> first<00:02:04.720> step<00:02:05.160> what<00:02:06.160> you<00:02:06.280> can<00:02:06.399> do<00:02:06.580> now<00:02:06.819> is
