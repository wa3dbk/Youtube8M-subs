didn't have the only difference was it's

it<00:00:53.800> didn't<00:00:54.100> really<00:00:54.220> matter

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
it didn't really matter

the<00:00:55.060> French<00:00:55.360> conceived<00:00:55.899> this<00:00:56.140> as<00:00:56.380> what<00:00:56.890> they

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
the French conceived this as what they

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.670 
the French conceived this as what they
called<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.370> mosquito<00:00:58.060> tank<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.960> idea<00:00:59.320> being<00:00:59.590> to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
called a mosquito tank the idea being to

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.830 
called a mosquito tank the idea being to
have<00:01:00.130> them<00:01:00.340> swarm<00:01:00.760> on<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.120> battlefield<00:01:01.660> and

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
have them swarm on the battlefield and

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.109 
have them swarm on the battlefield and
there<00:01:02.530> were<00:01:02.649> always<00:01:02.829> too<00:01:03.220> many<00:01:03.430> for<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.820> enemy

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
there were always too many for the enemy

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.969 
there were always too many for the enemy
to<00:01:04.269> shoot<00:01:04.509> at<00:01:04.750> so<00:01:04.930> in<00:01:05.049> theory<00:01:05.320> at<00:01:05.590> least<00:01:05.619> you

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
to shoot at so in theory at least you

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.300 
to shoot at so in theory at least you
won<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.729> way<00:01:07.000> they<00:01:07.840> had<00:01:07.990> 22<00:01:08.560> millimeters<00:01:09.159> of

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
won that way they had 22 millimeters of

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.859 
won that way they had 22 millimeters of
frontal<00:01:09.639> armor<00:01:09.759> which<00:01:10.119> is<00:01:10.299> quite<00:01:10.569> good<00:01:10.840> for

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
frontal armor which is quite good for

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.899 
frontal armor which is quite good for
its<00:01:11.200> day<00:01:11.409> but<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:12.159> still<00:01:12.399> meant<00:01:12.639> they<00:01:12.850> were

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
its day but it still meant they were

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.760 
its day but it still meant they were
vulnerable<00:01:13.149> to<00:01:13.539> fuel<00:01:13.840> guns<00:01:14.109> and<00:01:14.319> that<00:01:14.380> kind<00:01:14.649> of

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
vulnerable to fuel guns and that kind of

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.149 
vulnerable to fuel guns and that kind of
thing

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
thing

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.160 
thing
now<00:01:15.639> the<00:01:15.700> sprung<00:01:16.060> suspension<00:01:16.329> is<00:01:16.929> really

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
now the sprung suspension is really

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.910 
now the sprung suspension is really
clever<00:01:17.409> it<00:01:18.389> works<00:01:19.389> first<00:01:20.049> you've<00:01:20.409> got<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.619> large

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
clever it works first you've got a large

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.419 
clever it works first you've got a large
spring<00:01:21.429> here<00:01:22.560> which<00:01:23.560> really<00:01:23.770> is<00:01:24.009> actually<00:01:24.369> a

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
spring here which really is actually a

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.129 
spring here which really is actually a
tented<00:01:24.789> track<00:01:24.999> tensioner<00:01:25.569> holding<00:01:25.899> up<00:01:25.990> this

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:26.139 
tented track tensioner holding up this

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:28.429 
tented track tensioner holding up this
bar<00:01:26.409> here<00:01:26.679> but<00:01:26.829> also<00:01:27.280> there<00:01:27.729> are<00:01:27.880> springs

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
bar here but also there are springs

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.969 
bar here but also there are springs
inside<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.659> main<00:01:31.840> suspension<00:01:32.469> unit<00:01:32.799> here

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
inside the the main suspension unit here

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.590 
inside the the main suspension unit here
the<00:01:33.009> tops<00:01:33.369> of<00:01:33.579> the<00:01:33.670> springs<00:01:33.999> are<00:01:34.209> there<00:01:34.420> you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
the tops of the springs are there you

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.410 
the tops of the springs are there you
can<00:01:34.749> see<00:01:34.990> them<00:01:35.259> and<00:01:35.740> just<00:01:36.219> about<00:01:36.520> but<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:37.209> means

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
can see them and just about but it means

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.090 
can see them and just about but it means
that<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.749> tank<00:01:37.990> is<00:01:38.139> actually<00:01:38.289> sprung<00:01:38.889> when

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
that the tank is actually sprung when

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.410 
that the tank is actually sprung when
it's<00:01:39.219> kind<00:01:39.429> of<00:01:39.520> cross<00:01:39.700> country<00:01:39.909> shall<00:01:40.299> get

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
it's kind of cross country shall get

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.419 
it's kind of cross country shall get
them<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.689> see<00:01:40.899> one<00:01:41.079> of<00:01:41.170> these<00:01:41.259> going<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.219> which

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
them to see one of these going and which

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:43.830 
them to see one of these going and which
I<00:01:42.549> have<00:01:42.670> done<00:01:42.850> in<00:01:42.999> France<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.509> quite<00:01:43.749> an

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
I have done in France is quite an

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.510 
I have done in France is quite an
experience<00:01:44.439> they're<00:01:44.679> quite<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> sight<00:01:45.310> when

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
experience they're quite a sight when

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.760 
experience they're quite a sight when

you grip and the other thing is the
idler<00:02:03.700> at<00:02:03.819> the<00:02:03.939> front<00:02:04.240> is<00:02:04.450> because<00:02:05.319> they

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
idler at the front is because they

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.499 
idler at the front is because they

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
laminated wood it's adjustable so you

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.610 
laminated wood it's adjustable so you
can<00:02:12.849> adjust<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:13.390> tension<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.230> track<00:02:14.409> that

otherwise it's actually quite an

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
interesting design a few of them we use

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.149 
interesting design a few of them we use
