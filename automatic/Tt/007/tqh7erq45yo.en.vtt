00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.010
 Mexican will cover the Arctic mass too 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.570

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.720
 southeast and the peninsula so including the 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.550
 center of the country where we will continue 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.680
 waiting for some rainfall that 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.840
 they can become moderate throughout 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.850
 this area some scattered spots with 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.650
 heavy rain while the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.120
 good for temperatures to be be 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.850
 will be reflected in the presence of 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.709
 this winter storm in the north of 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.480
 pacific littoral but they do open 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.180
 the points where the temperatures 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.170
 it's a little more nice it's 25 27 degrees 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.909

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.280
 region with temperatures that exceed 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.260
 32 degrees to the south of the littoral 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.540
 peaceful we will also wait a half 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.640
 lasting cloudy with rainfall that 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.470
 they can be good because in fact

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.160
 temperatures that go between 31 to 34 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.780
 degrees in some warmer points the 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.730
 Sky was already telling him with some cloudiness

 in Yucatan strong in Campeche and the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.480
 state of quintana roo in very form 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.010
 isolated for the coastal area of ​​the 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.810
 gulf of mexico where the end of 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.910
 week will be significantly affected by 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.880
 the presence of this front and the mass 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.810
 good arctic then we'll wait for 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.230
 torrential rainfall in the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.810

 will be light to moderate in Tabasco 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.360
 and of course it will increase this 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.670
 potential as it happens to the hours 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.980
 and the temperatures falling to be you 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.890
 really low values for the north 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.319

 the center will also mark temperatures 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.519
