them<00:02:55.670> just<00:02:55.879> before<00:02:56.209> we<00:02:56.329> crashed<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:57.260> you'll

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
them just before we crashed and you'll

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.020 
them just before we crashed and you'll
notice<00:02:57.709> it's<00:02:57.950> even<00:02:58.129> slower<00:02:58.340> now<00:02:58.579> it<00:02:58.730> turns<00:02:58.909> out

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
notice it's even slower now it turns out

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.330 
notice it's even slower now it turns out
fraps<00:02:59.299> was<00:02:59.569> slowing<00:02:59.959> me<00:03:00.079> down<00:03:00.110> which<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:01.129> not

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
fraps was slowing me down which is not

fraps was slowing me down which is not
really<00:03:01.519> surprising<00:03:02.379> but<00:03:03.379> look<00:03:03.890> how<00:03:04.010> slow<00:03:04.250> it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
really surprising but look how slow it

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.360 
really surprising but look how slow it

it<00:03:07.549> was<00:03:07.640> moving<00:03:07.849> this<00:03:08.060> slow<00:03:08.299> already<00:03:08.659> I<00:03:08.870> went

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
it was moving this slow already I went

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.289 
it was moving this slow already I went
online<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.980> check<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.579> make<00:03:10.610> sure<00:03:10.849> that<00:03:11.090> this

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
online to check and make sure that this

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.089 
online to check and make sure that this
is<00:03:11.480> not<00:03:11.659> you<00:03:12.170> know<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:13.159> is<00:03:13.280> not<00:03:14.680> but<00:03:15.680> let's<00:03:15.920> see

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
if I can get to you know see some of

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.649 
if I can get to you know see some of
those<00:03:19.549> graphical<00:03:20.120> glitches<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.569> are

those graphical glitches that are

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.390 
those graphical glitches that are
occurring<00:03:21.049> notice<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.920> instant

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
occurring notice the the instant

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.360 
occurring notice the the instant
changing<00:03:22.849> there<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.150> fog<00:03:24.040> these<00:03:25.040> type<00:03:25.340> of

changing there the fog these type of

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.559 
changing there the fog these type of
things<00:03:25.549> are<00:03:25.700> happening<00:03:26.120> with<00:03:26.239> this<00:03:26.329> video

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
things are happening with this video

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.430 
things are happening with this video
card<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.230> again<00:03:27.950> in<00:03:28.190> their<00:03:28.430> allowed

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
card this is again in their allowed

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.550 
card this is again in their allowed
range<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.769> video<00:03:31.010> cards<00:03:32.109> but<00:03:33.109> I<00:03:33.170> guess<00:03:33.409> they

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
range of video cards but I guess they

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.809 
range of video cards but I guess they
assume<00:03:33.829> that<00:03:33.859> you're<00:03:34.069> gonna<00:03:34.190> drop<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.609> all<00:03:34.730> the

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
assume that you're gonna drop it all the

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.430 
assume that you're gonna drop it all the
way<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.120> lowest<00:03:35.299> resolution<00:03:35.629> turn<00:03:36.290> all

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
way to the lowest resolution turn all

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.979 
way to the lowest resolution turn all
the<00:03:36.590> fancy<00:03:36.889> graphics<00:03:37.280> off<00:03:37.420> but<00:03:38.420> at<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.659> point

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
the fancy graphics off but at that point

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.740 
the fancy graphics off but at that point
it's<00:03:39.379> playable<00:03:39.859> it's<00:03:40.250> fast<00:03:40.489> enough<00:03:40.670> but<00:03:41.599> it

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
it's playable it's fast enough but it

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.539 
it's playable it's fast enough but it
gives<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.079> a<00:03:42.109> headache<00:03:42.590> just<00:03:42.859> watching<00:03:43.400> it

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
gives you a headache just watching it

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.440 
gives you a headache just watching it
the<00:03:44.120> graphics<00:03:44.480> are<00:03:44.629> so<00:03:44.659> bad<00:03:46.269> look<00:03:47.269> at<00:03:47.359> the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
the graphics are so bad look at the

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.199 
the graphics are so bad look at the
blood<00:03:47.780> exploder<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:48.739> there<00:03:48.950> she's<00:03:49.849> gonna<00:03:50.000> keep

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
blood exploder in there she's gonna keep

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
the fancy graphics you would see from

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.300 
the fancy graphics you would see from
using<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:59.690> skills<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.049> I'm<00:04:00.230> using<00:04:00.379> I'm<00:04:01.160> not

the game is moving faster than the

you're<00:05:29.340> massing<00:05:29.700> right<00:05:29.880> over<00:05:30.090> them<00:05:30.210> and<00:05:30.330> see

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
you're massing right over them and see

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.830 
you're massing right over them and see
their<00:05:30.720> combat<00:05:31.170> with<00:05:32.330> that's<00:05:33.330> actually<00:05:33.660> going

their combat with that's actually going

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:44.540 
their combat with that's actually going
because<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.410> would<00:05:34.620> not<00:05:34.770> be<00:05:34.980> live<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:43.370> can<00:05:44.370> see

because that would not be live I can see

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.160 
because that would not be live I can see
the<00:05:44.670> dagger<00:05:45.090> sticking<00:05:45.360> out<00:05:45.570> of<00:05:45.690> his<00:05:45.780> head<00:05:45.810> I
