a little bit about the car quickly and
that<00:02:14.239> just<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.659> moment<00:02:14.889> while<00:02:15.889> we're<00:02:16.040> doing

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
that just the moment while we're doing

this 727 with Sonny engine nine inch
it's<00:02:21.200> just<00:02:21.680> set<00:02:21.920> up<00:02:22.010> for<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.219> nice<00:02:22.400> Street<00:02:22.700> of

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
it's just set up for a nice Street of

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.750 
it's just set up for a nice Street of
all<00:02:22.969> thing<00:02:23.859> easier<00:02:24.859> to<00:02:24.920> drive<00:02:25.159> running<00:02:25.609> that

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
all thing easier to drive running that

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.270 
all thing easier to drive running that
788<00:02:26.599> horsepower<00:02:27.139> that's<00:02:27.379> at<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.560> tires<00:02:27.889> here

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
788 horsepower that's at the tires here

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.459 
788 horsepower that's at the tires here
running<00:02:28.639> it<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.659> certainly<00:02:29.930> adds<00:02:30.079> a<00:02:30.319> bit

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:30.469 
running it so it certainly adds a bit

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.050
