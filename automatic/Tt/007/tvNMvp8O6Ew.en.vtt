all<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:00.989> so<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.260> just<00:00:01.500> wanted<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.860> give<00:00:02.190> a

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:02.300 
all right so I just wanted to give a

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.800 
all right so I just wanted to give a
brief<00:00:03.300> overview<00:00:04.040> of<00:00:05.040> how<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.000> yard<00:00:06.299> where<00:00:06.569> iam

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
brief overview of how the yard where iam

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.370 
brief overview of how the yard where iam
controller<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.470> coming<00:00:07.980> along<00:00:09.019> the<00:00:10.019> boards

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
controller is coming along the boards

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.850 
controller is coming along the boards
are<00:00:10.559> sent<00:00:10.769> out<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.550> just<00:00:11.790> my<00:00:12.860> breadboard

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
are sent out this is just my breadboard

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.840 
are sent out this is just my breadboard
and<00:00:14.040> stuff<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:14.730> here<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.330> pH<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.850> orc

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
and stuff so here we have pH and orc

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.370 
and stuff so here we have pH and orc
controller<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:19.260> have<00:00:19.439> an<00:00:19.590> EEPROM<00:00:20.630> we<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> I

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
controller we have an EEPROM we have a I

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.400 
controller we have an EEPROM we have a I
to<00:00:22.980> C<00:00:23.490> port<00:00:23.910> expander<00:00:24.510> which<00:00:24.840> we'll<00:00:25.080> use<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
to C port expander which we'll use to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.460 
to C port expander which we'll use to
control<00:00:26.070> solid-state<00:00:26.820> relays<00:00:27.289> which<00:00:28.289> we're

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
control solid-state relays which we're

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.370 
control solid-state relays which we're
not<00:00:28.590> using<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.699> real-time<00:00:30.240> clock<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
not using we have a real-time clock and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.430 
not using we have a real-time clock and
an<00:00:32.160> LCD<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.390> keypad<00:00:34.050> display<00:00:35.030> now<00:00:36.290> we're<00:00:37.290> just

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
an LCD and keypad display now we're just

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:47.229 
an LCD and keypad display now we're just
going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> zoom<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.690> LCD<00:00:39.690> screen<00:00:39.899> here

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.500 

if<00:00:48.239> it'll<00:00:48.480> focus<00:00:48.930> there<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.770> go

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:01.229 

all<00:00:53.470> right<00:00:55.380> so<00:00:56.380> I<00:00:56.739> want<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.550> focus<00:00:57.760> here<00:01:00.239> will

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
all right so I want to focus here will

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.150 
all right so I want to focus here will
you'll<00:01:01.390> be<00:01:01.510> able<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.809> see<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:02.800> what<00:01:03.010> we've

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
you'll be able to see that so what we've

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.870 
you'll be able to see that so what we've
got<00:01:03.989> basically<00:01:04.989> right<00:01:05.290> now<00:01:05.340> the<00:01:06.340> temperature

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
got basically right now the temperature

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.030 
got basically right now the temperature
sensor<00:01:07.690> isn't<00:01:07.840> hooked<00:01:08.080> up<00:01:08.350> but<00:01:08.530> it'll<00:01:08.710> display

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
sensor isn't hooked up but it'll display

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.670 
sensor isn't hooked up but it'll display
temperature<00:01:09.430> here<00:01:10.150> we<00:01:11.110> have<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.500> real-time

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
temperature here we have the real-time

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.940 
temperature here we have the real-time
clock<00:01:12.160> here<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.210> we<00:01:14.020> have<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.320> current<00:01:14.619> pH

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
clock here and we have the current pH

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.130 
clock here and we have the current pH
reading<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.970> sensor<00:01:16.420> is<00:01:16.540> actually<00:01:16.750> just

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
reading and that sensor is actually just

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.600 
reading and that sensor is actually just
sitting<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.430> cup<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.940> aquarium<00:01:19.509> water<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
sitting in a cup of aquarium water the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.139 
sitting in a cup of aquarium water the
cool<00:01:21.820> part<00:01:22.150> is<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.009> functions<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:25.000> are

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
cool part is all the functions that are

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.310 
cool part is all the functions that are
built<00:01:25.300> in<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:25.990> if<00:01:26.170> we<00:01:26.289> go<00:01:26.440> here<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.070> we<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:28.180> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
built in so if we go here and we have a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.020 
built in so if we go here and we have a
settings<00:01:29.320> and<00:01:31.590> feature<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:33.030> basically

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
settings and feature and basically

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.050 
settings and feature and basically
you've<00:01:34.210> got<00:01:34.380> settings<00:01:35.380> temperature<00:01:36.100> set

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
you've got settings temperature set

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.380 
you've got settings temperature set
right<00:01:37.539> now<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.869> seventy<00:01:38.560> nine<00:01:38.740> point<00:01:39.009> eight

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
right now to seventy nine point eight

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.600 
right now to seventy nine point eight
current<00:01:40.390> time<00:01:40.720> and<00:01:41.530> we<00:01:41.740> press<00:01:42.039> that<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.490> get

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
current time and we press that to get

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.340 
current time and we press that to get
out<00:01:42.759> of<00:01:42.910> it<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:44.640> before<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:46.479> used<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.869> have<00:01:47.080> to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
out of it and before you used to have to

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.350 
out of it and before you used to have to
set<00:01:47.679> everything<00:01:47.800> within<00:01:48.429> the<00:01:48.550> program<00:01:49.030> then

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
set everything within the program then

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.020 
set everything within the program then
you'd<00:01:49.509> have<00:01:49.660> to<00:01:49.899> reprogram<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.800> but<00:01:51.610> with<00:01:51.880> the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
you'd have to reprogram it but with the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.990 
you'd have to reprogram it but with the
EEPROM<00:01:52.479> we<00:01:52.660> can<00:01:52.840> store<00:01:53.170> values<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.490> if<00:01:54.700> we<00:01:54.850> go

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
EEPROM we can store values so if we go

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.620 
EEPROM we can store values so if we go
into<00:01:55.210> configure<00:01:56.050> we<00:01:57.009> have<00:01:57.280> one<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:58.090> set<00:01:58.330> time

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
into configure we have one to set time

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.130 
into configure we have one to set time
two<00:01:59.590> to<00:01:59.800> set<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.190> temperature<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:00.729> want

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
two to set the temperature you want

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.889 
two to set the temperature you want
three<00:02:02.140> four<00:02:02.410> lights<00:02:02.649> on<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.190> off<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.729> four<00:02:04.690> to

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
three four lights on and off and four to

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.800 
three four lights on and off and four to
configure<00:02:05.440> pH<00:02:06.060> now<00:02:07.060> there's<00:02:07.390> going<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.569> be<00:02:07.660> a

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
configure pH now there's going to be a

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.479 
configure pH now there's going to be a
whole<00:02:08.229> bunch<00:02:08.259> more<00:02:08.770> we're<00:02:09.250> going<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.429> have

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
whole bunch more we're going to have

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.589 
whole bunch more we're going to have
moonlight<00:02:10.260> in<00:02:11.310> wave<00:02:12.310> makers<00:02:12.880> things<00:02:13.390> like

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
moonlight in wave makers things like

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.070 
moonlight in wave makers things like
that

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
that

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.540 
that
so<00:02:14.860> one<00:02:15.099> two<00:02:15.250> set<00:02:15.459> time<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.680> it'll<00:02:17.680> say<00:02:17.950> put<00:02:18.400> in

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
so one two set time and it'll say put in

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.030 
so one two set time and it'll say put in
the<00:02:18.700> month<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:20.349> we<00:02:20.530> put<00:02:20.770> in<00:02:20.980> nine<00:02:21.220> twelve<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:23.040> is

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
the month so we put in nine twelve a is

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:34.910 
the month so we put in nine twelve a is
four<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.989> we<00:02:26.140> put<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.590> zero<00:02:27.069> four<00:02:29.640> year<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:33.120> 2009

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
four so we put in zero four year is 2009

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:44.400 
four so we put in zero four year is 2009
our<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:38.040> fourteen<00:02:40.860> minutes<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:43.110> what<00:02:44.110> is

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
our is fourteen minutes is what is

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
our is fourteen minutes is what is
minute<00:02:44.740> here<00:02:46.080> 37<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:49.740> then<00:02:50.740> once<00:02:51.040> you're<00:02:51.250> done

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
minute here 37 and then once you're done

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.190 
minute here 37 and then once you're done
it<00:02:51.490> will<00:02:51.670> say<00:02:51.940> done<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.420> press<00:02:52.630> number<00:02:53.080> to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
it will say done the press number to

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.240 
it will say done the press number to
exit<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.270> can<00:02:55.450> see<00:02:55.660> we've<00:02:55.930> got<00:02:56.220> 237<00:02:57.220> PN<00:02:59.250> so

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
exit and you can see we've got 237 PN so

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.310 
exit and you can see we've got 237 PN so
now<00:03:00.430> if<00:03:00.610> we<00:03:00.700> go<00:03:00.760> back<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.720> set<00:03:02.170> the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
now if we go back in and set the

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.350 
now if we go back in and set the
temperature<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.980> put<00:03:06.550> in<00:03:06.670> four<00:03:06.940> digits

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
temperature so you put in four digits

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.660 
temperature so you put in four digits
the<00:03:07.810> first<00:03:08.080> two<00:03:08.350> are<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.620> degrees<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.580> then

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
the first two are the degrees and then

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.930 
the first two are the degrees and then
the<00:03:09.700> last<00:03:09.970> two<00:03:10.270> is<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:12.750> decimal<00:03:13.750> part<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:15.190> we

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
the last two is the decimal part so we

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.140 
the last two is the decimal part so we
put<00:03:16.180> let's<00:03:16.420> say<00:03:16.540> we<00:03:16.690> want<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:16.990> do<00:03:17.460> 78<00:03:18.460> point

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
put let's say we want to do 78 point

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.720 
put let's say we want to do 78 point
five<00:03:19.630> so<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:21.000> 7850<00:03:22.230> now<00:03:23.230> when<00:03:23.980> we<00:03:24.100> press<00:03:24.340> the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
five so that 7850 now when we press the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.240 
five so that 7850 now when we press the
number<00:03:25.270> sign<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.750> get<00:03:25.870> out<00:03:26.050> it's<00:03:26.890> going<00:03:27.160> to

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
number sign to get out it's going to

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.640 
number sign to get out it's going to
write<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:27.670> value<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.390> EEPROM<00:03:28.840> which<00:03:29.470> is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
write that value to the EEPROM which is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.020 
write that value to the EEPROM which is
also<00:03:29.860> very<00:03:30.070> cool<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:32.610> then<00:03:33.610> we're<00:03:33.820> going<00:03:33.970> to

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
also very cool and then we're going to

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.630 
also very cool and then we're going to
do<00:03:34.240> lights<00:03:34.840> on<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:35.410> off<00:03:35.530> time<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.250> we'll<00:03:36.370> press

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
do lights on and off time so we'll press

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.740 
do lights on and off time so we'll press
three<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:38.350> set<00:03:38.890> lights<00:03:39.160> on<00:03:39.430> in<00:03:39.670> 24<00:03:40.180> hour<00:03:40.300> format

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
three so set lights on in 24 hour format

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.490 
three so set lights on in 24 hour format
so<00:03:41.590> I'd<00:03:41.740> like<00:03:41.950> them<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.160> come<00:03:42.400> on<00:03:42.580> at<00:03:42.760> 8:00<00:03:43.000> p.m.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
so I'd like them to come on at 8:00 p.m.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.780 
so I'd like them to come on at 8:00 p.m.
or<00:03:44.500> 8:00<00:03:44.740> a.m.<00:03:44.950> sorry

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
or 8:00 a.m. sorry

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.350 
or 8:00 a.m. sorry
lights<00:03:46.660> off<00:03:47.020> we'll<00:03:47.710> do<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:47.950> 6:00<00:03:48.700> p.m.<00:03:49.000> so

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
lights off we'll do it 6:00 p.m. so

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.570 
lights off we'll do it 6:00 p.m. so
that's<00:03:50.400> 1800<00:03:51.400> hours<00:03:51.580> and<00:03:52.530> then<00:03:53.530> you<00:03:53.560> can<00:03:53.890> do<00:03:54.040> if

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
that's 1800 hours and then you can do if

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.210 
that's 1800 hours and then you can do if
you<00:03:54.850> have<00:03:54.880> LED<00:03:55.510> lights<00:03:55.750> that<00:03:55.930> support<00:03:56.500> pulse

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
you have LED lights that support pulse

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.390 
you have LED lights that support pulse
with<00:03:57.520> pulse<00:03:58.090> width<00:03:58.390> modulation<00:03:59.140> you<00:04:00.040> can<00:04:00.220> set

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
with pulse width modulation you can set

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.870 
with pulse width modulation you can set
a<00:04:00.430> fade<00:04:00.730> time<00:04:01.030> in<00:04:01.330> hours<00:04:02.070> on<00:04:03.070> my<00:04:03.310> aquarium

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
a fade time in hours on my aquarium

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.480 
a fade time in hours on my aquarium
right<00:04:04.000> now<00:04:04.240> I<00:04:04.270> have<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:04.690> set<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.930> one<00:04:05.260> hour<00:04:05.490> but

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
right now I have it set to one hour but

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.400 
right now I have it set to one hour but
you<00:04:06.610> could<00:04:06.820> have<00:04:07.240> it<00:04:07.390> fade<00:04:07.630> over<00:04:07.990> like<00:04:08.380> a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
you could have it fade over like a

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.590 
you could have it fade over like a
really<00:04:08.800> long<00:04:08.950> period<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.430> time<00:04:09.670> but<00:04:09.970> one<00:04:10.480> hour

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
really long period of time but one hour

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.960 
really long period of time but one hour
seems<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.170> be<00:04:11.260> good<00:04:11.470> some<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.130> them<00:04:12.250> boom<00:04:13.080> and

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
seems to be good some of them boom and

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.340 
seems to be good some of them boom and
it<00:04:15.970> will<00:04:16.120> write<00:04:16.270> all<00:04:16.450> those<00:04:16.630> values<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.230> the

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
it will write all those values to the

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.520 
it will write all those values to the
EEPROM<00:04:17.739> as<00:04:17.920> well<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.900> we're<00:04:20.109> going<00:04:20.230> to<00:04:20.350> do

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
EEPROM as well and so we're going to do

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.210 
EEPROM as well and so we're going to do
the<00:04:21.040> last<00:04:21.280> one<00:04:21.520> which<00:04:21.670> is<00:04:21.850> configure<00:04:22.510> pH<00:04:24.600> so

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
the last one which is configure pH so

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.100 
the last one which is configure pH so
configure<00:04:27.220> pH<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:28.240> Steph<00:04:28.540> to<00:04:28.720> come<00:04:28.840> up<00:04:28.960> with

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
configure pH you Steph to come up with

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.410 
configure pH you Steph to come up with
your<00:04:29.260> own<00:04:29.350> formula<00:04:29.920> and<00:04:30.040> tweak<00:04:30.280> stuff<00:04:30.580> right

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
your own formula and tweak stuff right

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.770 
your own formula and tweak stuff right
now<00:04:32.730> all<00:04:33.730> you<00:04:34.030> have<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.270> do<00:04:34.600> is<00:04:36.210> put<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.330> in<00:04:37.420> a<00:04:37.480> pH

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
now all you have to do is put it in a pH

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.130 
now all you have to do is put it in a pH
10<00:04:38.050> solution<00:04:38.650> change<00:04:39.610> one<00:04:40.030> variable<00:04:40.510> resistor

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
10 solution change one variable resistor

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.189 
10 solution change one variable resistor
to<00:04:41.530> read<00:04:42.010> so<00:04:42.340> this<00:04:42.520> reads<00:04:42.880> 800

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
to read so this reads 800

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.939 
to read so this reads 800
and<00:04:44.289> right<00:04:44.979> now<00:04:45.129> at<00:04:45.279> 679<00:04:45.909> and<00:04:46.360> our<00:04:46.930> pH<00:04:47.349> reading

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
and right now at 679 and our pH reading

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.890 
and right now at 679 and our pH reading
is<00:04:48.069> going<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.400> be<00:04:48.550> screwed<00:04:48.909> up<00:04:49.090> after<00:04:49.810> I'm

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
is going to be screwed up after I'm

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.860 
is going to be screwed up after I'm
finished<00:04:50.580> but<00:04:52.349> we<00:04:53.349> press<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:54.009> number<00:04:54.400> sign

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
finished but we press the number sign

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.080 
finished but we press the number sign
writing<00:04:55.870> those<00:04:56.169> values<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:56.919> now<00:04:57.669> we<00:04:57.729> take<00:04:58.029> a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
writing those values so now we take a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.969 
writing those values so now we take a
break<00:04:58.389> because<00:04:58.810> we<00:04:59.169> have<00:04:59.289> to<00:04:59.469> put<00:04:59.680> it<00:04:59.770> in<00:04:59.889> a

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
break because we have to put it in a

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.330 
break because we have to put it in a
different<00:05:00.430> solution<00:05:01.020> so<00:05:02.020> we<00:05:02.169> put<00:05:02.409> it<00:05:02.499> place<00:05:03.099> in

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
different solution so we put it place in

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.170 
different solution so we put it place in
pH<00:05:03.639> 7<00:05:04.180> press<00:05:04.810> start<00:05:05.590> to<00:05:05.830> start<00:05:06.159> so<00:05:06.969> now<00:05:06.999> we

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
pH 7 press start to start so now we

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.659 
pH 7 press start to start so now we
press<00:05:07.509> star<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.990> start<00:05:08.319> and<00:05:08.590> basically<00:05:09.550> it

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
press star to start and basically it

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.399 
press star to start and basically it
just<00:05:09.729> takes<00:05:10.120> a<00:05:10.300> bunch<00:05:10.449> of<00:05:10.629> it<00:05:10.900> takes<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.259> hundred

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
just takes a bunch of it takes a hundred

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.350 
just takes a bunch of it takes a hundred
readings<00:05:12.009> and<00:05:12.219> then<00:05:12.340> averages<00:05:12.939> them<00:05:13.120> and

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
readings and then averages them and

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.249 
readings and then averages them and
writes<00:05:14.139> that<00:05:14.439> value<00:05:14.919> to<00:05:15.099> the<00:05:15.249> EEPROM<00:05:15.699> and

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
writes that value to the EEPROM and

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.439 
writes that value to the EEPROM and
because<00:05:17.259> we<00:05:17.409> know<00:05:17.560> those<00:05:17.800> 2<00:05:18.159> values<00:05:18.419> we<00:05:19.419> can

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
because we know those 2 values we can

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.149 
because we know those 2 values we can
figure<00:05:19.839> out<00:05:20.199> any<00:05:21.069> single<00:05:21.729> value<00:05:22.259> of<00:05:23.259> pH<00:05:23.889> that

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
figure out any single value of pH that

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.860 
figure out any single value of pH that
we<00:05:24.339> want<00:05:24.580> and<00:05:24.879> so<00:05:25.139> it's<00:05:26.139> finished<00:05:26.589> now<00:05:27.870> we're

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
we want and so it's finished now we're

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.709 
we want and so it's finished now we're
going<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.080> simulate<00:05:29.319> a<00:05:29.560> power<00:05:29.830> loss<00:05:30.719> just

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
going to simulate a power loss just

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.869 
going to simulate a power loss just
unplugging<00:05:32.229> it<00:05:32.589> this<00:05:33.159> happened<00:05:33.639> to<00:05:33.729> me<00:05:33.849> a

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:33.879 
unplugging it this happened to me a

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.170 
unplugging it this happened to me a
little<00:05:34.060> while<00:05:34.389> ago<00:05:34.659> and<00:05:35.490> wreaked<00:05:36.490> havoc<00:05:36.580> on

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
little while ago and wreaked havoc on

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.670 
little while ago and wreaked havoc on
the<00:05:37.360> aquarium<00:05:37.900> because<00:05:38.229> I<00:05:38.259> had<00:05:38.469> the

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
the aquarium because I had the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.550 
the aquarium because I had the
temperature<00:05:39.219> set<00:05:39.460> really<00:05:40.389> high<00:05:40.419> for<00:05:41.050> some<00:05:41.289> in

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
temperature set really high for some in

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.659 
temperature set really high for some in
the<00:05:41.979> program<00:05:42.669> just<00:05:42.999> because<00:05:43.800> but<00:05:44.800> if<00:05:45.310> we<00:05:45.520> go

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
the program just because but if we go

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.529 
the program just because but if we go
back<00:05:46.439> and<00:05:47.699> we'll<00:05:48.699> see<00:05:48.909> time<00:05:49.300> is<00:05:49.509> right<00:05:49.979> pH<00:05:50.979> of

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
back and we'll see time is right pH of

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:58.019 
back and we'll see time is right pH of
is<00:05:52.539> wrong<00:05:54.180> so<00:05:55.800> it's<00:05:56.800> going<00:05:57.279> to<00:05:57.370> be<00:05:57.460> wrong<00:05:57.699> but

00:05:58.019 --> 00:05:58.029 
is wrong so it's going to be wrong but

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:00.540 
is wrong so it's going to be wrong but
if<00:05:58.149> we<00:05:58.270> go<00:05:58.389> to<00:05:58.449> the<00:05:58.629> settings<00:05:59.099> you'll<00:06:00.099> see<00:06:00.189> that

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
if we go to the settings you'll see that

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.519 
if we go to the settings you'll see that
our<00:06:00.669> temperature<00:06:01.300> of<00:06:01.899> 78<00:06:02.800> point<00:06:03.219> 5<00:06:03.520> was<00:06:03.819> saved

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529 
our temperature of 78 point 5 was saved

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.889 
our temperature of 78 point 5 was saved
I<00:06:05.699> can't<00:06:06.699> show<00:06:06.909> you<00:06:06.969> the<00:06:07.180> lights<00:06:07.419> on<00:06:07.659> and<00:06:07.810> off

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:07.899 
I can't show you the lights on and off

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.499 
I can't show you the lights on and off
time<00:06:08.259> but<00:06:08.469> the<00:06:08.589> lights<00:06:08.800> on<00:06:09.039> and<00:06:09.279> off<00:06:09.430> times<00:06:09.819> has

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
time but the lights on and off times has

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.469 
time but the lights on and off times has
also<00:06:10.960> been<00:06:11.439> saved<00:06:11.800> and<00:06:12.250> of<00:06:12.939> course<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.330> real

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
also been saved and of course the real

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.899 
also been saved and of course the real
time<00:06:13.719> clock<00:06:13.899> has<00:06:14.259> its<00:06:14.439> own<00:06:14.649> battery<00:06:15.249> and<00:06:15.669> thing

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
time clock has its own battery and thing

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.159 
time clock has its own battery and thing
so<00:06:16.149> it's<00:06:16.599> done<00:06:17.560> as<00:06:17.710> well<00:06:18.629> now<00:06:19.629> this<00:06:19.870> doesn't

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
so it's done as well now this doesn't

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.829 
so it's done as well now this doesn't
look<00:06:20.409> very<00:06:20.740> pretty<00:06:21.899> but<00:06:23.310> it<00:06:24.310> is<00:06:24.639> allowing<00:06:25.419> for

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:25.839 
look very pretty but it is allowing for

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:30.089 
look very pretty but it is allowing for
a<00:06:25.870> fully<00:06:26.259> automated<00:06:26.860> aquarium<00:06:27.550> and<00:06:29.099> it's

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:30.099 
a fully automated aquarium and it's

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.739 
a fully automated aquarium and it's
actually<00:06:30.520> quite<00:06:30.669> exciting<00:06:31.210> so<00:06:31.330> I<00:06:31.389> hope<00:06:31.599> you

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:31.749 
actually quite exciting so I hope you

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
actively developing it right now the

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.969 
actively developing it right now the
boards<00:06:40.449> are<00:06:40.569> coming<00:06:40.899> in<00:06:41.080> and<00:06:41.289> once<00:06:41.439> the<00:06:41.620> boards

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
boards are coming in and once the boards

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.329 
boards are coming in and once the boards
are<00:06:42.159> in<00:06:42.189> we<00:06:43.120> can<00:06:43.330> do<00:06:43.449> a<00:06:43.479> lot<00:06:44.080> more<00:06:44.110> stuff<00:06:44.469> so<00:06:45.129> I

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:45.339 
are in we can do a lot more stuff so I

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.650 
are in we can do a lot more stuff so I
hope

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 
hope

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.230
