and<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.600> some<00:00:55.230> bows<00:00:55.559> produce<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.219> brighter

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and also some bows produce a brighter

and also some bows produce a brighter
sound<00:00:56.820> others<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> deeper<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:00.420> find<00:01:00.750> out

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
sound others a deeper one so find out

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
sound others a deeper one so find out
which<00:01:01.859> bow<00:01:02.250> works<00:01:02.879> best<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.960> cello<00:01:07.700> if

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
which bow works best of this cello if

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.230 
which bow works best of this cello if
you<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.150> take<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.869> cello<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.380> halt<00:01:11.060> play<00:01:12.060> it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you can take the cello to a halt play it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to play it to you this way you're going

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 
to play it to you this way you're going
to<00:01:18.119> learn<00:01:18.330> much<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.500> about<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to learn much more about the

possibilities of the cello now if you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.190 
possibilities of the cello now if you
can<00:01:22.680> take<00:01:22.890> two<00:01:23.310> Chile's<00:01:23.729> with<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.200> you're

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
can take two Chile's with you you're

can take two Chile's with you you're
going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.500> learn<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.860> lot<00:01:26.100> by<00:01:26.310> comparing<00:01:26.850> them

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
going to learn a lot by comparing them

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.600 
going to learn a lot by comparing them
in<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> whole<00:01:30.890> channels<00:01:31.890> which<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> loud

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
for example you might find that you're
