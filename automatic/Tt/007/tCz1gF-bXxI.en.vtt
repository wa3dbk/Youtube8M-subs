00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.790
 Euro 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.640
 a concept 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.809
 over 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.809
 lost 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.159
 The End 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.250
 how many fishing ports are racing 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.710
 It now feels like the sixth for them 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.600
 Do you like the weather and you like it very much 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.850
 the framework conditions is cash registers 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.079
 certainly a great feeling for her yes 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.579
 that's not good that's why we do 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.829
 that he no because the audience so by 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.939
 there are many spectators there 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.950
 you do not have that on any other 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:00.159
 race track and that's why 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.600
 What are the race conditions 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.310
 I have to say very well now, often 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.020
 of course, that was not the case now 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.789
 so beautiful i am not son euro 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.500
 unfortunately, how many happened 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.709
 fishing port race is it now for 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.150
 I was only once this year 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.790
 on the sensible race training and 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.040
 That was it the third time now 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.160
 at the fishing port racing the last one 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.810
 times the last start in 2009 I believe and 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.260
 before that like a few years ago 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.849
 2003 was premiere and 2009 was 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.380
 because the sentences event where I am 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.750
 I had actually participated in it 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.239
 thought it should have been in 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.840
 But my runway somehow 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.120
 come back 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.430
 how do you like them is great 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.780
 there is nothing unique is one 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.380
 unique event I still 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:47.739
 nothing comparable driven spectators 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:52.209
 everything in the weather today may live 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.950
 no wonder or not 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.109
 still fun 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.880
 unbelievable what a feeling it is 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.880
 in with the crowds of spectators 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.799
 You can also feel the proximity wehrleute you 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.480
 do you not only see them but you 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.840
 sometimes trends always a bit like that 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.870
 another apartment 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.440
 overtaking maneuvers or something and the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.569
 people looking for have that yes you have 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.550
 otherwise dakar to drive where you want you there 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.590
 where in hockenheim or killing or something 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.540
 any trainings or maybe 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.560
 small events are you driving 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.590
 nothing comparable 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.590
 certainly not on the level at all
