00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
to get rid of these spokes first so

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.220 
to get rid of these spokes first so
let's<00:02:37.290> get<00:02:37.410> rid<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.989> then<00:02:40.140> we'll

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
let's get rid of that and then we'll

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.650 
let's get rid of that and then we'll
look<00:02:40.379> it<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.859> getting<00:02:41.069> them<00:02:41.220> cleaned<00:02:41.489> up<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
look it so getting them cleaned up and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.240 
look it so getting them cleaned up and
then<00:02:43.139> up<00:02:43.440> these<00:02:43.920> rooms<00:02:44.280> rebuilt<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:46.130> let's<00:02:47.130> get

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
then up these rooms rebuilt so let's get

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:58.770 
then up these rooms rebuilt so let's get
these<00:02:47.370> whip

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.630 

just<00:02:59.780> simple<00:03:00.110> pair<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.410> pliers<00:03:00.650> just<00:03:01.370> going

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
just simple pair of pliers just going

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.300 
just simple pair of pliers just going
around<00:03:01.730> sniffing<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.420> actual<00:03:03.070> spoke<00:03:04.070> some

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
around sniffing the actual spoke some

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.060 
around sniffing the actual spoke some
cells<00:03:04.580> and<00:03:04.970> then<00:03:05.720> we<00:03:05.990> can<00:03:06.140> actually<00:03:06.470> pull<00:03:06.950> them

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
cells and then we can actually pull them

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.450 
cells and then we can actually pull them
out<00:03:07.220> of<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:08.120> hole<00:03:08.770> and<00:03:09.770> also<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.220> room<00:03:10.370> you

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
out of the hole and also the room you

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.980 
out of the hole and also the room you
have<00:03:10.490> to<00:03:10.610> know<00:03:10.850> it's<00:03:11.030> tough<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.480> take<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.780> air

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
have to know it's tough to take the air

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:36.479 
have to know it's tough to take the air
rhythm<00:03:12.320> tape<00:03:12.500> off<00:03:12.710> as<00:03:12.890> well

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.759 

says<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.640> rim<00:03:37.849> and<00:03:38.690> they<00:03:38.780> take<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.319> tape<00:03:39.530> off

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
says the rim and they take the tape off

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.990 
says the rim and they take the tape off
now<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.400> then<00:03:43.519> also<00:03:45.849> let's<00:03:46.849> look

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
now and that and then also let's look

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.039 
now and that and then also let's look
now<00:03:47.150> at<00:03:47.180> least<00:03:47.360> should<00:03:47.599> just<00:03:47.860> pop<00:03:48.860> out<00:03:52.780> I'd<00:03:53.780> say

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
now at least should just pop out I'd say

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.420 
now at least should just pop out I'd say
I<00:03:54.079> mean<00:03:54.379> without<00:03:54.530> actually<00:03:54.950> doing<00:03:55.040> this<00:03:55.250> there

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
I mean without actually doing this there

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.559 
I mean without actually doing this there
have<00:03:55.519> been<00:03:55.579> no<00:03:55.790> way<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:56.060> actually<00:03:56.329> giving<00:03:56.480> this

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
have been no way of actually giving this

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.800 
have been no way of actually giving this
a<00:03:56.629> proper<00:03:56.930> clean<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.250> and<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.060> say<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.480> spokes

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
a proper clean so and I say the spokes

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.069 
a proper clean so and I say the spokes
themselves<00:04:00.409> really<00:04:00.680> bitted<00:04:01.159> so<00:04:01.840> just<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:02.930> give

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
themselves really bitted so just to give

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.509 
themselves really bitted so just to give
it<00:04:03.170> that<00:04:03.489> new<00:04:04.489> feel<00:04:04.790> again<00:04:06.099> it's<00:04:07.099> definitely

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
it that new feel again it's definitely

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.610 
it that new feel again it's definitely
worth<00:04:07.700> getting<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.150> done

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.560 

I<00:04:14.650> think<00:04:15.310> at<00:04:15.430> this<00:04:15.550> point<00:04:15.640> you<00:04:15.970> really<00:04:16.000> really

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
I think at this point you really really

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.050 
I think at this point you really really
start<00:04:16.780> thinking<00:04:17.139> what<00:04:17.260> have<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.560> done<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.940> got

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
start thinking what have I done just got

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.330 
start thinking what have I done just got
this<00:04:19.180> by<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:19.720> there<00:04:20.230> to<00:04:20.769> be<00:04:20.859> honest<00:04:21.100> with<00:04:21.190> you

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
this by and there to be honest with you

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.920 
this by and there to be honest with you
most<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:22.030> in<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.240> bucket<00:04:22.540> below<00:04:22.780> you

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
most of it is in the bucket below you

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.420 
most of it is in the bucket below you
bottom<00:04:23.710> here<00:04:25.350> but<00:04:26.350> I'm<00:04:26.860> sure<00:04:26.919> it'll<00:04:27.190> be<00:04:27.280> worth

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
bottom here but I'm sure it'll be worth

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.840 
bottom here but I'm sure it'll be worth
it

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:05:00.070 

lots<00:04:30.850> of<00:04:30.970> cleaning<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.840> be<00:04:31.990> done

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.180 

okay<00:05:00.979> close<00:05:01.580> the<00:05:01.610> hub<00:05:01.849> itself<00:05:03.009> and<00:05:04.009> if<00:05:04.099> you

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
okay close the hub itself and if you

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.260 
okay close the hub itself and if you
know<00:05:04.340> it's<00:05:04.520> just<00:05:04.669> right<00:05:04.789> it's<00:05:04.879> actually<00:05:05.120> got<00:05:05.240> a

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
know it's just right it's actually got a

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.110 
know it's just right it's actually got a
little<00:05:05.509> clip<00:05:05.690> on<00:05:05.870> it<00:05:06.050> which<00:05:06.440> is<00:05:07.060> pretty<00:05:08.060> much

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
little clip on it which is pretty much

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.180 
little clip on it which is pretty much
use<00:05:08.419> for<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.720> actual<00:05:08.840> lube<00:05:09.259> to<00:05:09.620> go<00:05:09.740> inside

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
use for the actual lube to go inside

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.040 
use for the actual lube to go inside
it's<00:05:11.000> a<00:05:11.030> nice<00:05:11.210> little<00:05:11.389> touch

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
then again in fact most of these spokes

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.899 
then again in fact most of these spokes
just<00:05:48.440> fall<00:05:48.620> out<00:05:51.099> there<00:05:52.099> you<00:05:52.159> go<00:05:52.250> cool<00:05:52.639> there's

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
just fall out there you go cool there's

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:55.300 
just fall out there you go cool there's
your<00:05:53.030> rim<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:54.560> you<00:05:54.590> can<00:05:54.710> actually<00:05:54.830> get<00:05:55.099> in<00:05:55.219> and

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
your rim and you can actually get in and

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.149 
your rim and you can actually get in and
give<00:05:55.460> that<00:05:55.580> a<00:05:55.610> proper<00:05:55.940> clean<00:05:56.150> now<00:05:56.360> so<00:05:57.159> those

are cleaning to be done and yeah that's
it<00:06:01.759> there's<00:06:02.180> a<00:06:02.300> bike<00:06:02.449> completely<00:06:02.690> stripped

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
it there's a bike completely stripped

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:05.499
