most confusing aspect of the passer
rating<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.440> probably<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> scale

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
rating is probably that it's on a scale

rating is probably that it's on a scale
from<00:00:36.149> 0<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.680> 150<00:00:37.760> 8.3<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:39.480> maybe<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:39.840> can

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
from 0 to 150 8.3 but maybe we can

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.720 
from 0 to 150 8.3 but maybe we can
reduce<00:00:40.379> some<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.920> confusion<00:00:41.399> by

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
reduce some of that confusion by

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.250 
reduce some of that confusion by
breaking<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.270> down<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.450> bit<00:00:42.600> further<00:00:42.960> or

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
just the pass is completed and this

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.629 
just the pass is completed and this

this number we subtract three to get

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.219 
this number we subtract three to get
four<00:03:55.979> point<00:03:56.280> six<00:03:56.609> four<00:03:56.760> four<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.209> then<00:03:57.900> divide

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.229 
four point six four four and then divide

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:01.159 
four point six four four and then divide
that<00:03:58.500> number<00:03:58.799> by<00:03:59.190> four<00:03:59.819> which<00:04:00.599> gives<00:04:00.629> us<00:04:00.930> one

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
that number by four which gives us one

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.300 
that number by four which gives us one
point<00:04:01.530> one<00:04:01.919> six<00:04:02.220> one<00:04:03.379> next<00:04:04.379> is<00:04:04.500> touchdowns<00:04:05.010> per

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
point one six one next is touchdowns per

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.599 
point one six one next is touchdowns per
attempt<00:04:05.760> so<00:04:06.209> two<00:04:06.810> divided<00:04:07.229> by<00:04:07.379> 45<00:04:07.979> tells<00:04:08.459> us

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
attempt so two divided by 45 tells us

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.460 
attempt so two divided by 45 tells us
that<00:04:08.790> nearly<00:04:09.299> five<00:04:09.540> percent<00:04:09.569> of<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.079> passes

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
that nearly five percent of the passes

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.309 
that nearly five percent of the passes
ended<00:04:11.310> up<00:04:11.430> in<00:04:11.669> the<00:04:11.790> end<00:04:12.060> zone<00:04:12.180> we<00:04:13.109> then

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
ended up in the end zone we then

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.899 
ended up in the end zone we then
multiply<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.829> number<00:04:14.400> which<00:04:14.790> is

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
multiply that number which is

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.629 
multiply that number which is
technically<00:04:15.239> point<00:04:15.629> zero<00:04:15.900> four<00:04:16.199> four<00:04:16.409> by<00:04:17.159> 20

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
technically point zero four four by 20

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.250 
technically point zero four four by 20
which<00:04:18.389> gives<00:04:18.419> us<00:04:18.780> point<00:04:19.139> eight<00:04:19.409> eight<00:04:21.260> finally

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
which gives us point eight eight finally

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.080 
which gives us point eight eight finally
we<00:04:22.500> take<00:04:22.680> our<00:04:22.830> interceptions<00:04:23.580> which<00:04:23.820> Roger

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
we take our interceptions which Roger

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.000 
we take our interceptions which Roger
threw<00:04:24.510> none<00:04:24.719> of<00:04:24.900> on<00:04:25.080> this<00:04:25.229> afternoon<00:04:25.620> divide

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
threw none of on this afternoon divide

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.590 
threw none of on this afternoon divide
that<00:04:26.190> by<00:04:26.340> 45

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
that by 45

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.360 
that by 45
so<00:04:27.780> we<00:04:27.900> get<00:04:28.080> zero<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.710> then<00:04:28.830> we<00:04:28.950> multiply<00:04:29.130> that

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
so we get zero and then we multiply that

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.480 
so we get zero and then we multiply that
by<00:04:29.550> 25<00:04:30.270> which<00:04:31.110> once<00:04:31.380> again<00:04:31.620> gives<00:04:31.830> us<00:04:31.950> zero

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
by 25 which once again gives us zero

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.880 
by 25 which once again gives us zero
but<00:04:33.060> since<00:04:33.270> zero<00:04:33.540> interceptions<00:04:34.050> is<00:04:34.290> good<00:04:34.560> we

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
but since zero interceptions is good we

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.370 
but since zero interceptions is good we
take<00:04:35.100> this<00:04:35.460> sum<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.150> we<00:04:36.660> subtract<00:04:37.170> it<00:04:37.320> from

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
take this sum and we subtract it from

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.280 
take this sum and we subtract it from
the<00:04:38.280> maximum<00:04:38.790> score<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:39.300> two<00:04:39.600> point<00:04:39.960> three

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
the maximum score of two point three

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.340 
the maximum score of two point three
seven<00:04:40.560> five<00:04:40.860> which<00:04:41.340> leaves<00:04:41.640> us<00:04:41.820> with<00:04:42.060> that<00:04:42.900> two

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
seven five which leaves us with that two

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.430 
seven five which leaves us with that two
point<00:04:43.620> three<00:04:43.830> seven<00:04:44.040> five<00:04:45.260> it's<00:04:46.260> worth

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
point three seven five it's worth

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.410 
point three seven five it's worth
repeating<00:04:46.650> here<00:04:47.100> that<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.370> maximum<00:04:47.580> total<00:04:48.330> of

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
repeating here that the maximum total of

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.530 
repeating here that the maximum total of
any<00:04:48.660> one<00:04:48.930> of<00:04:48.960> these<00:04:49.170> numbers<00:04:49.430> can<00:04:50.430> be<00:04:50.670> is<00:04:50.910> two

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
any one of these numbers can be is two

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.690 
any one of these numbers can be is two
point<00:04:51.840> three<00:04:51.990> seven<00:04:52.380> five<00:04:52.560> even<00:04:53.490> if<00:04:53.610> a

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
point three seven five even if a

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.950 
point three seven five even if a
quarterback<00:04:54.150> were<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.390> complete<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.690> hundred

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
quarterback were to complete a hundred

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.990 
quarterback were to complete a hundred
percent<00:04:55.320> of<00:04:55.560> his<00:04:55.650> passes<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:56.880> would

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
percent of his passes and that would

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.610 
percent of his passes and that would
mean<00:04:57.150> our<00:04:57.180> value<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:57.900> category<00:04:58.320> would

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
mean our value in that category would

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.950 
mean our value in that category would
come<00:04:58.800> out<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:58.950> be<00:04:59.070> three<00:04:59.430> point<00:04:59.460> five<00:04:59.970> when<00:05:00.840> we

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
come out to be three point five when we

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.180 
come out to be three point five when we
run<00:05:01.230> through<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.560> next<00:05:01.800> part<00:05:02.010> of<00:05:02.070> our

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
run through the next part of our

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.580 
run through the next part of our
calculation<00:05:02.820> we<00:05:03.000> would<00:05:03.570> only<00:05:03.780> give<00:05:04.230> him<00:05:04.380> the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
calculation we would only give him the

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.470 
calculation we would only give him the
maximum<00:05:05.130> value<00:05:05.430> of<00:05:05.580> two<00:05:05.760> point<00:05:06.030> three<00:05:06.270> seven

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
maximum value of two point three seven

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.260 
maximum value of two point three seven
five<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:07.080> that<00:05:07.200> category<00:05:07.800> we<00:05:08.610> would<00:05:08.790> not<00:05:08.970> give

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
five in that category we would not give

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.750 
five in that category we would not give
three<00:05:09.720> point<00:05:09.960> five<00:05:10.170> and<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.340> so<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.670> we

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
three point five and this is so that we

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.550 
three point five and this is so that we
don't<00:05:11.940> give<00:05:12.090> any<00:05:12.240> one<00:05:12.510> category<00:05:12.810> too<00:05:13.350> much

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
don't give any one category too much

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.010 
don't give any one category too much
weight<00:05:13.860> over<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.340> others<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:15.570> same<00:05:15.780> thing

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
weight over the others the same thing

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.110 
weight over the others the same thing
applies<00:05:16.320> with<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.650> minimum<00:05:17.100> which<00:05:17.580> is<00:05:17.730> zero

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
applies with the minimum which is zero

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.450 
applies with the minimum which is zero
even<00:05:18.690> if<00:05:18.780> we<00:05:18.900> get<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.080> negative<00:05:19.290> figure<00:05:19.710> we

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
even if we get a negative figure we

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.310 
even if we get a negative figure we
would<00:05:20.610> give<00:05:20.760> him<00:05:20.790> a<00:05:21.000> total<00:05:21.030> of<00:05:21.450> zero<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:22.110> that

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
would give him a total of zero in that

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.040 
would give him a total of zero in that
category<00:05:22.680> but<00:05:23.210> let's<00:05:24.210> get<00:05:24.330> back<00:05:24.390> to<00:05:24.630> Rogers

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
category but let's get back to Rogers

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.260 
category but let's get back to Rogers
our<00:05:25.800> next<00:05:26.130> step<00:05:26.280> is<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.550> add<00:05:26.700> these<00:05:27.000> four

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
our next step is to add these four

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.540 
our next step is to add these four
numbers<00:05:27.660> up<00:05:27.840> so<00:05:28.080> two<00:05:28.500> point<00:05:28.710> zero<00:05:28.770> five<00:05:29.280> five

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
numbers up so two point zero five five

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.270 
numbers up so two point zero five five
plus<00:05:30.060> one<00:05:30.150> point<00:05:30.600> one<00:05:30.780> six<00:05:31.020> one<00:05:31.290> plus<00:05:31.980> point

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
plus one point one six one plus point

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.340 
plus one point one six one plus point
eight<00:05:32.460> eight<00:05:32.490> plus<00:05:33.360> two<00:05:33.510> point<00:05:33.840> three<00:05:34.170> seven

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
eight eight plus two point three seven

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.040 
eight eight plus two point three seven
five<00:05:34.650> that<00:05:35.400> gives<00:05:35.670> us<00:05:35.820> six<00:05:36.120> point<00:05:36.450> four<00:05:36.750> seven

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
five that gives us six point four seven

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.760 
five that gives us six point four seven
one<00:05:37.350> we<00:05:38.250> then<00:05:38.430> divide<00:05:38.730> this<00:05:39.000> number<00:05:39.060> by<00:05:39.360> six<00:05:39.870> to

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
one we then divide this number by six to

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.670 
one we then divide this number by six to
get<00:05:41.010> one<00:05:41.550> point<00:05:41.760> zero<00:05:42.150> seven<00:05:42.570> eight<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:43.050> then

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
get one point zero seven eight and then

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.970 
get one point zero seven eight and then
finally<00:05:44.250> we<00:05:44.640> multiply<00:05:44.880> that<00:05:45.390> by<00:05:45.450> 100<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:46.830> get

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
finally we multiply that by 100 to get
