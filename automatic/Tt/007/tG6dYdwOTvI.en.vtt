00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
to fix the lace tip on one of them

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.630 
to fix the lace tip on one of them
because<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:27.449> missing<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.289> piece<00:00:28.640> it's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
because it's missing that piece it's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.279 
because it's missing that piece it's
actually<00:00:29.939> my<00:00:30.029> first<00:00:30.210> time<00:00:30.359> trying<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.050> bare

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
actually my first time trying it so bare

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.569 
actually my first time trying it so bare
with<00:00:31.320> me<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.759> trick<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.270> found<00:00:33.660> is

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
with me but the trick that I found is

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.459 
with me but the trick that I found is
instead<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.700> using<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.059> tape<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.690> glue<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
instead of using the tape and glue and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.190 
instead of using the tape and glue and
wrap<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.860> around<00:00:37.920> all<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.460> feel<00:00:38.899> get<00:00:39.899> some

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
wrap it around all that feel get some

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.160 
wrap it around all that feel get some
clear<00:00:40.710> heat<00:00:41.309> shrink<00:00:41.700> tube<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.930> find

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
clear heat shrink tube that you can find

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.830 
clear heat shrink tube that you can find
at<00:00:43.290> RadioShack<00:00:44.210> what<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.300> want<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> do

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
at RadioShack what you want to do

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.160 
at RadioShack what you want to do
ideally<00:00:46.289> slip<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:48.719> tube<00:00:48.960> right

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
ideally slip it on to the tube right

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
ideally slip it on to the tube right
here<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:50.309> use<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> lighter<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.090> run<00:00:51.239> it

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
here and then use a lighter and run it

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.910 
here and then use a lighter and run it
through<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.110> I'm<00:00:52.199> going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.500> first

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
through but what I'm going to do first

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.630 
through but what I'm going to do first
is<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:54.239> am<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> cut<00:00:55.890> off<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.219> section

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
is I am going to cut off this section

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.189 
is I am going to cut off this section
because<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.000> looks<00:00:57.180> kind<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.449> nasty<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.930> gross

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
because it looks kind of nasty and gross

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.279 
because it looks kind of nasty and gross
and<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.739> think<00:00:59.010> once<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.699> shrunk<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:01.140> not

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and I think once it's a shrunk it's not

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.470 
and I think once it's a shrunk it's not
going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:01.590> too<00:01:01.649> good<00:01:02.010> either<00:01:02.180> so<00:01:03.180> I'm

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
going to look too good either so I'm

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.500 
going to look too good either so I'm
going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.719> snip<00:01:04.650> off<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> small<00:01:05.729> section<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.330> it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
going to snip off a small section of it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.149 
going to snip off a small section of it
that<00:01:06.810> way<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:06.990> gives<00:01:07.140> me<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> little<00:01:07.590> bit<00:01:07.799> enough

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that way it gives me a little bit enough

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.429 
that way it gives me a little bit enough
room<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:09.420> actually<00:01:09.710> put<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.860> through<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
room to actually put that through the

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.039 
room to actually put that through the
tube<00:01:13.439> because<00:01:14.240> if<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.390> can't<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.869> through

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
tube because if I can't get it through

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.830 
tube because if I can't get it through
tube<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:16.890> hard<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.689> want

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
tube it's going to be hard and you want

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.670 
tube it's going to be hard and you want
to<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> through<00:01:19.409> enough<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:21.680> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
to get it through enough just for the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.410 
to get it through enough just for the
same<00:01:22.979> length<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.820> need

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
same length of what you need

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.149 
same length of what you need
so<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> bust<00:01:24.990> measurement<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.009> other

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so the bust measurement is the other

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.300 
so the bust measurement is the other
shoelaces<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:28.130> we're<00:01:29.130> looking<00:01:29.400> at<00:01:29.549> about

this is the pack I got right here they

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.410 
this is the pack I got right here they
do<00:02:55.170> have<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> whole<00:02:56.040> set<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.430> clear<00:02:56.910> ones<00:02:57.150> but

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
do have a whole set of clear ones but

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.060 
do have a whole set of clear ones but
they<00:02:57.540> only<00:02:57.660> sell<00:02:57.930> those<00:02:58.110> online<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.560> then<00:02:58.950> I

they only sell those online and then I

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.650 
they only sell those online and then I
think<00:02:59.310> shipping<00:02:59.700> cost<00:02:59.910> more<00:03:00.150> than<00:03:00.329> actual

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
think shipping cost more than actual

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.560 
think shipping cost more than actual
