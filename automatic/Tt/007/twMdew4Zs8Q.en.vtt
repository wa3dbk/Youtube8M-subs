00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.080
 Let's hit 9 b 8,850. 

00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:15.503
 They should be a pleasant little calculation we do. 

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:20.330
 So as usual let's rewrite this, so I'll write 8,085. 

00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:24.435
 I will type 9 below it and write the multiplication code. 

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:29.533
 Now we are ready for the calculation. So first, we can hit 5B 9. 

00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:32.662
 We know that 5 hit 9 equals 45. 

00:00:33.034 --> 00:00:37.336
 We can write 5 in the single digits and we will carry 4 to the double digits. 

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.637
 So if 9 hit 5 is 45. 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.895
 Now we are ready to move to 8 hit 9. 

00:00:45.157 --> 00:00:49.509
 We will calculate 8 multiply 9 and then we add 4 that we have carried. 

00:00:49.936 --> 00:00:56.168
 Then 8 hit 9 equals 72, plus 4 for output 76. 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.921
 So we will write 6 here in the double digits and carry the 7. 

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:06.643
 Now, we are ready to account (and I am looking for a suitable color) 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:11.995
 9 hit 0 .. 9 hit 0 in the hundreds plus .. 

00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:14.919
 (This is 7 in the hundreds, so actually 700) 

00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:19.084
 Or if we want to work with arithmetic, they 9 multiply 0 + 7. 

00:01:19.138 --> 00:01:24.065
 Well 9 hit 0 is 0, plus 7 is output 7. 

00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:27.996
 And finally, finally, we have .. 

00:01:28.203 --> 00:01:30.577
 (And for the other time I'm looking for a suitable color) 

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:35.634
 8 hit 9, 8 hit 9, this is the last thing we must calculate. 

00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:42.638
 We already know that 8 hit 9 is 72 and write the 72 here below. 

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:43.698
 We are done! 

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:50.038
 8,085 hits 9 is 72,765. 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:53.975
 One more example is to make sure this is clear in your brain. 

00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:57.242
 Or at least the calculation, and I also want you to wonder why this process works. 

00:01:57.947 --> 00:02:09.502
 So let 's try .. Let' s try to hit 7B by 5,396. 

00:02:09.612 --> 00:02:11.909
 I encourage you to turn off the video yourself. 

00:02:12.742 --> 00:02:20.996
 Well 5,000 ... (will be rewritten) 7 hit 5,396 - First we will think ... 

00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:25.912
 First we will think of a 6 hit 7 hit; we know it is 42. 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.331
 We put 2 in the single digits, and we will hold the number 4. 

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.910
 And then we need to pay attention to 9 hit 7. 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.178
 But then it must be calculated and then add 4. 

00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:42.569
 7 hit 9 is 63 plus 4 is 67. 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.255
 So put 7 down here and carry 6. 

00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:55.814
 Then we had to worry about 3 hit 7 plus 6 and by this we had finished downloading it. 

00:02:56.074 --> 00:03:00.838
 7 hit 3 equals 21 plus 6 equals 27. 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.703
 So, we will write 7 in place of hundreds and carry 2. 

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:13.022
 Finally, we have 5 hit 7, output 35 but we must add 2. 

00:03:13.273 --> 00:03:16.272
 35 Plus 2 equals 37. 

00:03:16.585 --> 00:03:22.522
 So 7 hit 5,396 equals 37,772.
