00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.500
 or what company that here my cable my cable 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.180
 of ground that our cable d 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.790
 the cable that will turn us on and off 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.350
 the leds I'm going to make the shot so that 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.710
 You see how I did it in my case I had to 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.150
 use the connectors that I mentioned 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.060
 d 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.650
 there it is in fact I put first the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.390
 yellow because it was very big because there 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.430
 that put the other him 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.840
 the blue that was the one who will give the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.690
 signal and now I'll show you 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.880
 once again 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.010
 they remove our cable 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.010
 and how do I repeat the test lamp 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.500
 our cord 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.580
 and as you see there is on 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.580
 we close door 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.940
 we close doors 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.940
 I will not turn off the light that is here 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.940
 in 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.030
 and we open doors 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.329
 now with the LEDs here are the LEDs 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.070
 I'm not going to put it here so that 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.560
 you see them already having this 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.710
 let's put here professionally nothing 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.710
 plus 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.970
 we send the positive side to our 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.920
 side of earth and there they are 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.810
 it's up to you where you want them 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.700
 I'm going to put one on that side 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.700
 one on that side and another one here 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.340
 and the color reads from the position 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.229
 where you want to put them along 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.990
 of the cable you can throw us back 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.990
 go where you want 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.380
 and in this case, I created the advantage 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.479
 to use leds that are not very very leds 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.330
 large ones are very very heavy as there is no 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.580
 need can grab the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.450
 sign as you saw in this case there 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.450
 let's close the door 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.870
 and the led are going to pay 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.100
 we open the door and turn on 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.360
 in my case I 'm going to look for a cable here 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.890
 down here as I have the box 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.270
 fuses I'll look for a cable 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.550
 current and from there I'm going to 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.610
 hang up 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.950
 but I repeat again if you are one of those who 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.860
 like doing things right as they are 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.960
 or you're going to put big suns 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.110
 large or bazan to light everything 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.980
 inside the car you want to use lamps 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.080
 I'm going to put the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.630
 shortcut for you to watch the video 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.990
 what am I going to do about how to make a 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.910
 circuit with a new fuse and a relay 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.260
 apart to not be to hang 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.790
 just grab the signal as 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.349
 reference 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.610
 Well, this video reaches here and 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.620
 well I'll show you how was the 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.620
 final because it's going to be everything 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.100
 or before I forgot but 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.650
 if in your case there are no cables here 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.720
 down then you can also enlarge them 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.220
 from above not bad it hides if you already 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.230
 the strips below all you want 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.720
 put is also another possibility in 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.150
 this case I handle it here in 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.640
 because it is more difficult to work here 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.380
 inside but as you see it will not be anything 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.720
 hard to hide the cables around here 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.720
 they install my led lights ready 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.489
 because it is no longer in yours at the end of 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.010
 to grab or hold on to a cable 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.440
 constant current 15 to see if it looks 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.129
 there I am hiding the cables for 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.129
 here inside 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.280
 I do not know because I still do not know 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.600
 installed 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.220
 but now 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.090
 to see more or less how it's done 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.090
 how it looks like 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.879
 there are nothing more than 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.440
 to accommodate them well to hide 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.130
 totally nor in the cables called 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.130
 we can put here 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.660
 previously they had no lights in this 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.660
 case they install them 2 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.509
 and we close the door 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.420
 d 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.420
 ah 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.670
 because up to here it 's all I hope you've 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.470
 served the video 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.060
 do not forget to subscribe because I have 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.560
 I will continue uploading more videos 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.560
 pending because there are going to be more videos 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.629
 although I know that I always say this is what 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.190
 last of the last but now yes this 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.320
 it's the last thing I want the most they already wanted to 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.940
 final how was it 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.200
 coming to the end of work and 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.849
 they were following the whole process and 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.809
 I want you to see the end simply 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.809
 and there it is 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.340
 That's how it was finally as 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.340
 it is not on the trails 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.900
 thank you with di well you do not notice 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.780
 Now for good soon
