00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
looking for is a breeding time of 10

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.510 
looking for is a breeding time of 10
hours<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.239> 30<00:02:09.660> minutes<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:10.679> 11<00:02:11.220> jump

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
hours and 30 minutes so that's 11 jump

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.490 
hours and 30 minutes so that's 11 jump
to<00:02:11.670> fast<00:02:11.879> forward<00:02:12.209> essentially<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.349> going

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
to fast forward essentially it's going

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.940 
to fast forward essentially it's going
to<00:02:13.560> be<00:02:13.620> like

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
ours 2959 so that's pretty much it um

I guess those things above its head is
his<00:03:27.870> horn<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:28.530> his<00:03:28.650> nose<00:03:28.889> and<00:03:29.160> his<00:03:29.280> eyes<00:03:29.609> is

his horn but his nose and his eyes is
like<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.180> same<00:03:30.389> size<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.709> that's<00:03:32.639> pretty

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
like the same size so that's pretty

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.110 
like the same size so that's pretty
funny<00:03:33.299> um<00:03:34.069> let's<00:03:35.069> dive<00:03:35.280> out<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.609> here<00:03:35.760> let's

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
funny um let's dive out of here let's

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.030 
funny um let's dive out of here let's
evolve<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.690> bit<00:03:36.840> more<00:03:37.109> so<00:03:37.350> we<00:03:37.380> can<00:03:37.530> get<00:03:37.980> a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
evolve it a bit more so we can get a

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.080 
evolve it a bit more so we can get a
better<00:03:38.280> picture<00:03:38.639> of<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:40.340> alright<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:41.670> there<00:03:41.970> it

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
better picture of it alright so there it
