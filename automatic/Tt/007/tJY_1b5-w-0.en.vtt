00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.320
 if you build more 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.750
 delayed heat and you are very, very 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.770
 I recommend to find then hiring quite a 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.680

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.240
 if you heroism will heat the oil here 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:37.020
 exactly the same to find the atmosphere ready for us 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:44.670
 prepared saucepan what i do i 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:46.860
 take oil on the floor of a glass of rice for groups 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.430
 about a teaspoon 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.170
 ghee from the service arrow 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.060
 it can be done perfectly 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.500
 successfully in the pan if you have 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.450
 small pan small 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.420
 saucepan 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.430
 so how do i do it when i'm a saucepan 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.530
 put warm it put it on 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.040
 maximum so that it warms up faster 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:26.460
 now I switched to medium fire and 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:29.960
 I pour out the oil can decided to oil 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.960
 he was evenly distributed 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.760
 not bothered to stir over low heat 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.600
 with medium listen night light when 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.700
 he say before roasted he becomes 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.070
 such a rich white color tours for 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.890
 it smells nice if higher than spaghetti 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.730
 nice overdone what we do 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:21.820
 now you can add water that is 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.820
 I was half a cup of eggs add 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:34.759
 understand from watch out for quality 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.449
 understand correctly so now however 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:41.630
 because the smallest are because 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.729
 that the water immediately began to boil ie what 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.740
 reduce from and drive think about up 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.780
 the strongest fire when evenly 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.720
 squeeze the water water boils immediately 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.710
 after that you can immediately cover 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:05:01.810
 and leave the beginning of the island for 10 minutes 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:01.810
 Pro Henschel machine opened this example 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.449
 was 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.520
 so after ten minutes I have it 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.680
 It turned out such Italians will go to 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.790
 breeder if you like risk 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:27.090
 completely yourself yourself so completely difficult 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:30.180
 because watched turn off close 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.550
 new lid and leave another 10 minutes 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.940
 so that he himself would ask constantly though 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:39.450
 will be all the more soft ocean on the finished 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.010
 porridge I try not to salt them why 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.800
 that I usually their raw and horseradish 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.780
 because and if you add salt to 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.550
 cooking time to 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.900
 it was as salty as you want 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.670
 add up much more 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.520
 and if you add it 40 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:57.630
 directly west eat 3 will 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.830
 need less need and so this porridge 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.960
 wonderful breakfast 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.320
 if you can spend so much in the morning 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.990
 time to cook it too 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.520
