00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hi guys sorry if there's a bit of a hiss

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.700 
hi guys sorry if there's a bit of a hiss
in<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.909> background<00:00:03.419> I'm<00:00:03.810> sitting<00:00:04.290> next<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.560> my

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
in the background I'm sitting next to my

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.419 
in the background I'm sitting next to my
computer<00:00:05.480> while<00:00:06.480> it's<00:00:06.690> uploading<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.740> pizza

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
computer while it's uploading the pizza

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.860 
computer while it's uploading the pizza
tray<00:00:08.670> hovercraft<00:00:09.360> video<00:00:10.610> and<00:00:11.660> thinking<00:00:12.660> about

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
tray hovercraft video and thinking about

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.480 
tray hovercraft video and thinking about
the<00:00:13.019> next<00:00:13.200> project<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.799> do<00:00:13.920> with<00:00:14.070> one<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.250> these

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the next project to do with one of these

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.599 
the next project to do with one of these
hair<00:00:15.150> dryer<00:00:15.480> fans<00:00:16.220> and<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.279> thought<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.520> might

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
hair dryer fans and I thought I might

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.179 
hair dryer fans and I thought I might
just<00:00:18.029> convert<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.990> rubber<00:00:19.410> band<00:00:19.619> powered

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
just convert this rubber band powered

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.960 
just convert this rubber band powered
car<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:22.460> ducted<00:00:23.460> fan<00:00:24.140> car<00:00:25.580> you're<00:00:26.580> fairly

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
car to a ducted fan car you're fairly

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.820 
car to a ducted fan car you're fairly
easy<00:00:27.150> conversion<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.109> thought<00:00:28.289> I'd<00:00:28.529> better

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
easy conversion but I thought I'd better

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.580 
easy conversion but I thought I'd better
just<00:00:29.039> go<00:00:29.279> through<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.630> components<00:00:31.349> first

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
just go through the components first

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.740 
just go through the components first
because<00:00:32.369> what<00:00:32.579> I'm<00:00:32.669> gonna<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.180> go<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.600> give

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
because what I'm gonna do is go and give

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.229 
because what I'm gonna do is go and give
it<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.309> coat<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.340> paint<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.850> make<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.120> look

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
it a coat of paint to make it look

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:47.139 
it a coat of paint to make it look
pretty<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.570> at<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> moment<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.320> we've<00:00:40.500> got

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.330 

it's<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.420> those<00:00:48.539> cardboard<00:00:49.289> tubes<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
it's one of those cardboard tubes that

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.209 
it's one of those cardboard tubes that
you<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:52.309> crisps<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:54.559> it's<00:00:55.559> already<00:00:55.920> got<00:00:56.070> quite

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you get crisps in it's already got quite

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.389 
you get crisps in it's already got quite
a<00:00:56.340> few<00:00:56.550> holes<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.539> we<00:00:57.809> had<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
a few holes in it because we had a

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.540 
a few holes in it because we had a
couple<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.520> axles<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.300> through<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:01.550> my

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
couple of axles going through it my

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.679 
couple of axles going through it my
usual<00:01:03.619> CD<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:05.189> bottle<00:01:05.670> caps<00:01:05.939> hot<00:01:06.210> glued<00:01:06.540> on

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
usual CD with bottle caps hot glued on

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:15.830 
usual CD with bottle caps hot glued on
either<00:01:06.930> side<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:09.409> BBQ<00:01:10.409> cane<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.400> axle<00:01:14.840> at

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
either side and BBQ cane for the axle at

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.460 
either side and BBQ cane for the axle at
the<00:01:15.960> front<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.470> car<00:01:16.799> we've<00:01:17.490> got<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:18.470> ball

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the front of this car we've got a ball

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.700 
the front of this car we've got a ball
pen<00:01:19.770> tube<00:01:20.220> which<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> tube<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> axle

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
pen tube which is the tube that the axle

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.350 
pen tube which is the tube that the axle
goes<00:01:22.950> through<00:01:27.110> so<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.350> runs<00:01:28.560> nice<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.360> low

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
goes through so it runs nice and low

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.740 
goes through so it runs nice and low
friction<00:01:32.060> I'll<00:01:33.060> put<00:01:33.329> another<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.900> them

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
friction I'll put another one of them

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.749 
friction I'll put another one of them
through<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> back<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.470> we<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.710> tubes<00:01:38.520> either

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
through the back so we got tubes either

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:47.770 
through the back so we got tubes either
end<00:01:40.340> and<00:01:43.759> this<00:01:44.759> fella<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.750> fan<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.649> nice<00:01:47.009> fit

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
end and this fella the fan is a nice fit

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.090 
end and this fella the fan is a nice fit
right<00:01:48.780> inside<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:52.009> I'll<00:01:53.009> mount<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.490> inside

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
right inside so I'll mount that inside

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.280 
right inside so I'll mount that inside
bring<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> wires<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> batteries

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
bring the wires for the batteries

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.200 
bring the wires for the batteries
outside<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.280> make<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> batteries<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
outside and make the batteries on the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.249 
outside and make the batteries on the
outside<00:02:00.719> somewhere<00:02:02.750> mister<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.930> I'll<00:02:03.990> give<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
outside somewhere mister so I'll give it

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.050 
outside somewhere mister so I'll give it
a<00:02:04.320> coat<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.680> paint<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.280> looks<00:02:05.490> pretty

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.220 

that's<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> paint<00:02:09.420> job<00:02:09.720> nearly<00:02:10.020> finished

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
that's the paint job nearly finished

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.860 
that's the paint job nearly finished
just<00:02:12.230> need<00:02:12.379> to<00:02:12.500> put<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.480> cockpit<00:02:14.480> or<00:02:14.599> if<00:02:14.780> you

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
just need to put the cockpit or if you

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.309 
just need to put the cockpit or if you
call<00:02:15.079> it<00:02:15.879> where<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.030> driver<00:02:17.269> sits<00:02:17.629> up<00:02:18.049> here

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
call it where the driver sits up here

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.520 
call it where the driver sits up here
somewhere

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
somewhere

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.690 
somewhere
I'll<00:02:21.530> be<00:02:21.650> done<00:02:22.299> so<00:02:23.299> what<00:02:23.420> I'll<00:02:23.510> do<00:02:23.689> now<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:24.700> fit

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
I'll be done so what I'll do now is fit

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.740 
I'll be done so what I'll do now is fit
the<00:02:25.849> motor<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.640> think<00:02:28.909> I<00:02:29.030> may<00:02:29.209> actually<00:02:29.239> put

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
the motor and I think I may actually put

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.140 
the motor and I think I may actually put
the<00:02:29.870> battery<00:02:30.349> just<00:02:31.340> down<00:02:31.519> in<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.730> back<00:02:31.879> here

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
the battery just down in the back here

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.869 
the battery just down in the back here
so<00:02:32.359> it's<00:02:32.480> easy<00:02:32.659> to<00:02:32.930> switch<00:02:33.049> on<00:02:33.349> and<00:02:33.530> off<00:02:33.879> I'm

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
so it's easy to switch on and off I'm

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.530 
so it's easy to switch on and off I'm
shifting<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.480> front<00:02:35.720> wheels<00:02:36.159> back<00:02:37.159> a<00:02:37.189> bit<00:02:37.540> so

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
shifting the front wheels back a bit so

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.149 
shifting the front wheels back a bit so
that<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.750> can<00:02:38.900> just<00:02:38.930> put<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.379> motor<00:02:39.560> straight

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
that I can just put the motor straight

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.899 
that I can just put the motor straight
in<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.519> front<00:02:40.760> they're<00:02:42.549> soldered<00:02:43.549> some<00:02:43.730> nice

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
in the front they're soldered some nice

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.670 
in the front they're soldered some nice
long<00:02:44.180> wires<00:02:44.540> onto<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.139> back<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.470> motor

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
long wires onto the back of the motor

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.119 
long wires onto the back of the motor
and<00:02:48.700> onto<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:49.879> connector<00:02:50.450> onto<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.170> battery

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
and onto the connector onto the battery

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.699 
and onto the connector onto the battery
and<00:02:52.760> I've<00:02:52.909> put<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.120> micro<00:02:53.599> switch<00:02:53.870> there<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.620> I
