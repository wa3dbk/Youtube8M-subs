what I playing right now was a shut eye
on<00:00:37.309> but<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.340> heard<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:39.239> one's<00:00:39.480> supposed<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.809> be

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
on but I heard this one's supposed to be

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.790 
on but I heard this one's supposed to be
better<00:00:41.070> with<00:00:41.370> concussions<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.649> you<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:43.770> I

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
better with concussions so you know I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.080 
better with concussions so you know I
had<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.219> get<00:00:44.399> down

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.160 

see

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:06.630 

all<00:00:57.739> right<00:01:00.220> it<00:01:01.220> looks<00:01:01.430> pretty<00:01:01.489> good<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:02.000> think

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.910 

so<00:01:07.640> looks<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:08.000> lot<00:01:08.180> like<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.479> repo<00:01:08.690> speed<00:01:11.920> you

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
so looks a lot like the repo speed you

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.320 
so looks a lot like the repo speed you
know<00:01:13.100> what<00:01:13.310> they<00:01:13.520> did<00:01:13.670> not<00:01:13.850> give<00:01:14.119> me<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.270> right

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
know what they did not give me the right

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.150 
know what they did not give me the right
facemask<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.259> was<00:01:15.380> supposed<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.619> be<00:01:15.800> a<00:01:15.830> blue

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
facemask it was supposed to be a blue

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.800 
facemask it was supposed to be a blue
facemask<00:01:17.170> getting<00:01:18.170> black<00:01:18.410> but<00:01:18.710> um<00:01:18.860> I<00:01:19.690> have<00:01:20.690> to

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
facemask getting black but um I have to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.120 
facemask getting black but um I have to
work<00:01:20.990> with<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:23.470> let's<00:01:24.470> see<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:24.890> main

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
work with that let's see so a main

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.010 
work with that let's see so a main
difference<00:01:25.550> I'm<00:01:26.300> sure<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.869> probably

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
difference I'm sure you probably

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.820 
difference I'm sure you probably
researched<00:01:27.500> this<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.009> uh<00:01:29.410> you<00:01:30.410> know<00:01:30.530> it's<00:01:30.710> got

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
researched this but uh you know it's got

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.740 
researched this but uh you know it's got
the<00:01:30.860> two<00:01:31.100> points<00:01:31.520> here<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.360> two<00:01:32.539> quick

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
the two points here the two quick

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.570 
the two points here the two quick
release<00:01:33.050> points<00:01:33.490> instead<00:01:34.490> at<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.670> top<00:01:36.580> it's

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
release points instead at the top it's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.490 
release points instead at the top it's
got<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.850> new<00:01:37.970> like<00:01:38.180> frontal<00:01:38.600> skeletal<00:01:39.080> system

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
got the new like frontal skeletal system

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.389 
got the new like frontal skeletal system
they<00:01:39.590> talk<00:01:39.770> about<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:41.920> have<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.009> see<00:01:43.160> how<00:01:43.340> that

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
they talk about I have to see how that

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.370 
they talk about I have to see how that
works<00:01:43.700> out

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
works out

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.529 
works out
new<00:01:45.950> padding<00:01:46.429> so<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.850> pattern<00:01:47.149> looks<00:01:47.270> pretty

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
new padding so the pattern looks pretty

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:54.760 
new padding so the pattern looks pretty
good<00:01:48.280> from<00:01:49.280> aesthetic<00:01:49.850> standpoint<00:01:53.619> let's<00:01:54.619> be

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
good from aesthetic standpoint let's be

good from aesthetic standpoint let's be
good<00:01:54.979> visibility<00:01:57.039> style<00:01:58.039> design<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.490> pretty

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
good visibility style design is pretty

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.340 
good visibility style design is pretty
good<00:02:01.630> but<00:02:02.630> yeah<00:02:02.750> if<00:02:02.840> you're<00:02:02.960> interested<00:02:03.079> again

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
take a look at the inside summation

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:33.220 
take a look at the inside summation
don't<00:02:24.080> really<00:02:24.260> get<00:02:24.350> see<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> lot

I'm kind of digging the red but to see
how<00:02:35.210> comfortable<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:36.010> how<00:02:37.010> hot<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.430> gets

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
how comfortable this how hot it gets

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.410 
how comfortable this how hot it gets
nice<00:02:38.209> use<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.660> for<00:02:38.780> play<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.810> uh<00:02:43.090> what<00:02:44.090> I'll<00:02:44.180> do

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
actually later I thought if using it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.720 
actually later I thought if using it
nothing<00:02:51.050> here<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.320> go<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.090> ion<00:02:54.730> supposed

actually good never experience any

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.720 
actually good never experience any
problems<00:02:59.150> with<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.680> but<00:03:00.680> uh<00:03:00.709> since<00:03:01.340> this<00:03:01.489> was

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
problems with it but uh since this was

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.850 
problems with it but uh since this was
supposed<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.060> better<00:03:02.350> for<00:03:03.350> that<00:03:03.410> going<00:03:03.770> I

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
supposed to be better for that going I

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.310 
supposed to be better for that going I
test<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.190> out
