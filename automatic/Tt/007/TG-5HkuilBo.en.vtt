 we're back 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:32.800
 today my new aquarium just arrived 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.360
 I had commented with you an aquarium 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.360
 of 420 liters 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.790
 so come on 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.670
 in relation to the aquarium 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.800
 it has already been delivered and with glasses of 10 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:53.379
 mm glue with black silicone one 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.480
 little prettier more presentable 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.980
 he has a central boot like you 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:06.629
 can observe both the uptake and the 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.629
 return of water is done in the same boot 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.050
 You can see that it's difficult for you. 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.800
 The biggest there is one is a front of a 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.590
 the water is drawn to 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.630
 samp and return is done by that 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.990
 half inch channel 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.030
 The deal has already been handed to me painted. 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.619
 puzzled painted and with a background of 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.590
 boot also painted black né 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:40.079
 you can watch and it was delivered with 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.840
 this return water pipe is 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.479
 stopping here upon t 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.920
 It was me who put it then 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.219
 I put a t 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.229
 he stands, the agreement came to a halt 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:58.270
 above and below how you can 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.930
 Watch and lock it up it's stuck 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.420
 huh 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.009
 I was stuck put on t and 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.869
 continue with the half-inch card 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:11.110
 from the right side and also to the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.140
 left at the end of the corner right 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.370
 There is also the latch stuck 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.050
 so we just manage to paste and 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.860
 No problem 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.420
 the half-inch barrel that I have just 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.420
 making furious 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:37.000
 beneath beneath the latch can made 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.000
 observe 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.650
 then know this is the aquarium and this 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.440
 is the mobile aquarium plus a mobile 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.360
 asking the color tobacco there to combine with 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:03:01.530
 the instant van with which I already had 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:03.210
 a slightly smaller rope is and the cover and 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.600
 I'll put on a light after that. 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.930
 there is a led, right? 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:14.490
 inside cover and the inside 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.640
 mobile phone is coated as car is due 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:21.030
 to the humidity involved in the 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.310
 here below we have the samp that I am 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.170
 then finishing the hydraulic system 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.010
 his 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:33.090
 I put then come the saints know of a 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.980
 just over 80 liters there is the 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:42.660
 bomb that I had commented with 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:44.940
 I went up a left room for 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.280
 put in front of or behind the saint 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:53.310
 so I had to put my son 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:57.590
 in a filter see suspended then there is the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.239
 filter see what I showed earlier 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.989
 is suspended 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:10.470
 is now only missing 11 t 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:17.100
 for me to put down, right? 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:19.859
 and here I end my call then 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.550
 This piece was missing and tomorrow 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.690
 completes hydraulic installation of the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.750
 aquarium né 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:33.540
 from there we'll ride to and put 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.440
 then everything else I have not decided exactly 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.680
 what are the items that will compose the 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.690
 internally my aquarium 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.000
 I do not know if I'm going to plant as many 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.300
 plants what are the plants 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.150
 Finally, during this week and we will 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.380
 decide and show it to you 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:05:00.550
 the mobile would originally come with three 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:04.030
 doors the way it came alone is the 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.920
 samp compartment it was inter this 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.740
 in the property 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.200
 I already asked him to change if 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.390
 make a change put a 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.650
 lateral 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:23.800
 isolating a third part so that I 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:30.340
 can not wait until the material is 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:33.040
 food or the accessories there coal at last 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.190
 all I needed to not get the 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.100
 moisture allied compartment that 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:43.240
 samp be positioned 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:48.550
 all right so people this aquarium 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:54.100
 with mobile samp and lid 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.450
 this set I ended up paying 2 thousand 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.510
 real 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.190
 Okay, so I would like to have 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.340
 watched the video like the one I 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.960
 I'm doing it right now for you, that's right. 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.840
 because at least serve as comparative 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:13.390
 Then for those who want to build an aquarium. 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:15.640
 slightly larger right and know you are 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:19.120
 spending very little, right? 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:27.880
 I started my market research 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:33.790
 free and I have been refining refining looking 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:37.390
 the Chinese American websites seeing 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:41.789
 video out of friends there on youtube 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:46.060
 also yes 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:48.639
 did not think it was expensive's already seen people 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.030
 paying there 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:54.370
 incredible 34 times more than 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.910
 I paid or there are people who are 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:01.319
 paying 6 thousand reais to build one 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:04.660
 set to be out here still and media 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:06.759

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.300
 I'll leave you with the contact there at the store. 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:22.240
 I made the contact and got lots of 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:26.259
 experience in aquarium assembly 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.870
 her name is ossian glass is a store 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:31.419

 São Paulo State of São Paulo 

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:37.090
 I'm from the capital but from São Bernardo 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:38.919
