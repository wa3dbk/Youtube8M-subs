00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
available to you and the actual steps

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.090 
available to you and the actual steps
are<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> take<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.170> get<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.530> from<00:01:25.710> here

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
are going to take to get it from here

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.920 
are going to take to get it from here
into<00:01:26.640> mad<00:01:27.299> because<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> little

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
into mad because it is a little

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.810 
into mad because it is a little
confusing<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:29.159> we're<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> go<00:01:29.490> ahead<00:01:29.579> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
confusing so we're going to go ahead and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.940 
confusing so we're going to go ahead and
give<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> Clark<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.840> post<00:01:31.200> corner<00:01:31.470> route<00:01:31.710> we're

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
give a Clark a post corner route we're

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.050 
give a Clark a post corner route we're
going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> slide<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.520> here<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.850> we're<00:01:32.970> going

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
going to slide in here and we're going

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.609 
going to slide in here and we're going
to<00:01:33.119> take<00:01:33.210> our<00:01:33.329> two<00:01:33.540> outside<00:01:33.960> receivers<00:01:34.500> so

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
to take our two outside receivers so

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.980 
to take our two outside receivers so
we're<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.920> put<00:01:35.070> them<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.720> medium<00:01:36.720> curl

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
we're going to put them on medium curl

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.440 
we're going to put them on medium curl
routes<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.880> normally<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.240> run<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
routes so normally we like to run the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.940 
routes so normally we like to run the
corner<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:39.990> curl<00:01:40.290> route<00:01:40.470> underneath

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
corner with the curl route underneath

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.319 
corner with the curl route underneath
but<00:01:41.250> we're<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> post<00:01:42.030> corner

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
but we're going to be the post corner

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.719 
but we're going to be the post corner
just<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.369> software<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
just because of the software and what it

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.280 
just because of the software and what it
allows<00:01:44.820> us<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.720> ahead<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.990> set<00:01:46.140> him

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
allows us to do so go ahead and set him

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.600 
allows us to do so go ahead and set him
up<00:01:46.640> we're<00:01:47.640> gonna<00:01:47.729> give<00:01:47.909> him<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> corolla<00:01:49.049> route

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
up we're gonna give him a corolla route

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.340 
up we're gonna give him a corolla route
so<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:50.820> our<00:01:50.939> two<00:01:51.090> curls<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:52.079> our<00:01:52.200> to

five-step drop you can give them out a

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.249 
five-step drop you can give them out a
roll<00:01:59.969> out<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.420> lot<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.659> different<00:02:00.899> options

can hit the X button to continue and

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.229 
can hit the X button to continue and
test<00:02:11.080> your<00:02:11.230> play<00:02:11.440> out<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.879> we're<00:02:12.970> going<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.180> go

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
test your play out so we're going to go

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.699 
test your play out so we're going to go
here<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.510> test<00:02:13.870> our<00:02:14.019> play<00:02:14.200> out<00:02:14.349> we'll<00:02:14.530> throw

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
here and test our play out we'll throw

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.410 
here and test our play out we'll throw
it<00:02:14.830> up<00:02:14.920> against<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.400> cover<00:02:15.700> two<00:02:15.940> zone<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:18.420> there

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
it up against a cover two zone and there

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.940 
it up against a cover two zone and there
goes<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.720> motion<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.319> here<00:02:20.470> comes<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.769> play

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
goes the motion and here comes the play

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.680 
goes the motion and here comes the play
so<00:02:21.400> he's<00:02:21.519> going<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.730> find<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:21.940> receiver<00:02:22.360> open

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
so he's going to find a receiver open

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.410 
so he's going to find a receiver open
inside<00:02:22.989> makes<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.530> throw<00:02:24.239> complete<00:02:25.239> and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
inside makes the throw complete and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.120 
inside makes the throw complete and
we'll<00:02:25.540> let<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.720> run<00:02:25.930> again<00:02:26.200> one<00:02:26.349> more<00:02:26.500> time<00:02:26.560> so

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
we'll let it run again one more time so

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.880 
we'll let it run again one more time so
to<00:02:27.190> see<00:02:27.519> it<00:02:28.140> obviously<00:02:29.140> he<00:02:29.319> seems<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.739> think

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
to see it obviously he seems to think

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.610 
to see it obviously he seems to think
this<00:02:30.519> is<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.819> best<00:02:30.970> read<00:02:31.299> in<00:02:31.629> this<00:02:32.470> particular

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
this is the best read in this particular

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.370 
this is the best read in this particular
instance<00:02:33.010> here's<00:02:33.879> going<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.060> take<00:02:34.209> that

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
instance here's going to take that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.640 
instance here's going to take that
five-step<00:02:35.380> drop<00:02:35.670> that's<00:02:36.670> feet<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.650> then

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
five-step drop that's feet and then

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.309 
five-step drop that's feet and then
there's<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.890> pass<00:02:39.099> completion<00:02:40.079> okay<00:02:41.079> once

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
there's a pass completion okay once

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.690 
there's a pass completion okay once
we're<00:02:41.500> done<00:02:41.590> testing<00:02:42.099> it<00:02:42.220> we<00:02:42.400> can<00:02:42.549> go<00:02:42.610> ahead

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
we're done testing it we can go ahead

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.420 
we're done testing it we can go ahead
and<00:02:42.819> go<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.000> keep<00:02:43.329> play<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.860> we<00:02:44.920> keep<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.250> play

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
and go to keep play so we keep the play

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.680 
and go to keep play so we keep the play
you<00:02:45.489> can<00:02:45.760> give<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.030> name<00:02:46.209> we're<00:02:46.450> just<00:02:46.569> going

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
you can give it a name we're just going

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.030 
you can give it a name we're just going
to<00:02:46.720> leave<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:46.900> it's<00:02:47.110> created<00:02:47.590> play<00:02:47.799> right<00:02:48.010> now

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
to leave it it's created play right now

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.690 
to leave it it's created play right now
just<00:02:48.400> for<00:02:48.700> sake<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.569> speeding<00:02:49.959> things<00:02:50.170> up<00:02:50.700> you
