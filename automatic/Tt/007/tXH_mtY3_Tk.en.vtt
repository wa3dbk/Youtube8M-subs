look<00:03:03.010> for<00:03:03.220> these<00:03:03.310> features<00:03:03.549> so<00:03:04.269> let's<00:03:04.480> talk

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
look for these features so let's talk

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.590 
look for these features so let's talk
about<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> etiology<00:03:05.230> fast

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
about the etiology fast

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.430 
about the etiology fast
what<00:03:07.600> other<00:03:07.720> causes<00:03:09.030> okay<00:03:10.049> remember<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.320> most

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
what other causes okay remember the most

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.750 
what other causes okay remember the most
important<00:03:11.950> thing<00:03:12.010> what<00:03:12.340> do<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.519> have<00:03:12.640> to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
important thing what do you have to

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.930 
important thing what do you have to
remember<00:03:12.940> is<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.239> premature<00:03:13.959> activation<00:03:14.560> of

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
remember is a premature activation of

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.550 
remember is a premature activation of
hypothalamic<00:03:15.940> pituitary<00:03:16.180> gonadal<00:03:16.810> excess

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
hypothalamic pituitary gonadal excess

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.160 
hypothalamic pituitary gonadal excess
capital<00:03:18.280> amo<00:03:18.790> pediatr<00:03:19.780> e<00:03:19.890> venereal<00:03:20.890> access

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
capital amo pediatr e venereal access

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.400 
capital amo pediatr e venereal access
okay<00:03:23.430> right<00:03:24.430> it's<00:03:25.239> premature<00:03:25.720> activation<00:03:26.350> of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
okay right it's premature activation of

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.009 
okay right it's premature activation of
this<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:27.310> there<00:03:27.940> are<00:03:27.970> two<00:03:28.180> things<00:03:28.209> over<00:03:28.630> here

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
this so there are two things over here

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.580 
this so there are two things over here
one<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:29.700> gonadotropin<00:03:32.549> gonadotropin

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
one is gonadotropin gonadotropin

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.880 
one is gonadotropin gonadotropin
dependent

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.840 

okay<00:03:38.570> dependent<00:03:39.680> and<00:03:40.680> one<00:03:40.950> is<00:03:41.100> gonadotropin

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
okay dependent and one is gonadotropin

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.010 
okay dependent and one is gonadotropin
independent<00:03:42.600> G<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:42.870> cannot<00:03:43.290> open<00:03:43.760> independent

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
independent G I cannot open independent

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.090 
independent G I cannot open independent
gonadotropin<00:03:46.020> dependent<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.620> increased

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
gonadotropin dependent this increased

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.980 
gonadotropin dependent this increased
FSH<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.700> LH<00:03:47.820> they<00:03:48.420> are<00:03:48.510> going<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.840> stimulate

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
FSH and LH they are going to stimulate

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.130 
FSH and LH they are going to stimulate
this<00:03:49.260> is<00:03:49.380> what<00:03:49.590> he<00:03:49.650> called<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:50.870> second<00:03:51.870> sexual

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
this is what he called a second sexual

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.760 
this is what he called a second sexual
characters<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:53.040> increased<00:03:53.610> raised<00:03:54.080> FSH<00:03:55.080> LH

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.110 

okay<00:03:58.770> whereas<00:03:59.400> in<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.580> gonadotropin

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
okay whereas in a gonadotropin

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.120 
okay whereas in a gonadotropin
independent<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.870> exit<00:04:01.200> sex<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.560> rise<00:04:01.740> so

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
independent is the exit sex to rise so

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.020 
independent is the exit sex to rise so
low<00:04:03.800> FSH<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.570> latch<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:07.260> if<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.500> don't<00:04:07.650> know

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
low FSH and latch so if I don't know

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.699 
low FSH and latch so if I don't know
whether<00:04:09.030> he<00:04:09.209> has<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.360> previous<00:04:09.750> Prakash's

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
whether he has a previous Prakash's

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.680 
whether he has a previous Prakash's
privity<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.370> whatever<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.270> a<00:04:12.330> gonna<00:04:12.510> drop

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
privity and whatever it's a gonna drop

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.420 
privity and whatever it's a gonna drop
in<00:04:12.840> dependent<00:04:13.260> or<00:04:13.350> independent<00:04:13.590> what<00:04:14.340> you

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
in dependent or independent what you

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.880 
in dependent or independent what you
need<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.640> look<00:04:14.760> for<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:15.390> need<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.660> look<00:04:15.780> for

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
need to look for you need to look for

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.330 
need to look for you need to look for
FSH<00:04:16.890> levels<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.400> FSH<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.390> LH<00:04:18.660> hormones<00:04:19.230> got<00:04:20.040> it

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
FSH levels of FSH and LH hormones got it

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.340 
FSH levels of FSH and LH hormones got it
excellent<00:04:21.120> now<00:04:21.690> let's<00:04:21.900> talk<00:04:22.079> about<00:04:22.140> the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
excellent now let's talk about the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.050 
excellent now let's talk about the
causes<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:23.010> males<00:04:24.770> in<00:04:25.770> males<00:04:26.220> it's<00:04:26.970> a

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
causes in males in males it's a

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.060 
causes in males in males it's a
biological<00:04:27.270> because<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.320> force<00:04:28.560> initial

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
biological because of the force initial

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.040 
biological because of the force initial
thing<00:04:29.280> has<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.240> second<00:04:30.720> or<00:04:30.780> sexual

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
thing has a second or sexual

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.270 
thing has a second or sexual
characteristic<00:04:31.560> in<00:04:31.680> email<00:04:31.890> is<00:04:32.130> the

characteristic in email is the
testicular<00:04:32.640> enlargement<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.810> we'll<00:04:33.960> think<00:04:34.169> of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
testicular enlargement so we'll think of

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.710 
testicular enlargement so we'll think of
bilateral<00:04:34.620> testicular<00:04:35.190> enlargement<00:04:35.430> like<00:04:35.970> we

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
bilateral testicular enlargement like we

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.560 
bilateral testicular enlargement like we
have<00:04:37.050> gonna<00:04:37.260> drop<00:04:37.530> in<00:04:37.650> from<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.950> brain<00:04:38.160> tumor

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.610 

Genaro<00:04:42.570> drooping<00:04:43.440> from<00:04:43.830> brain<00:04:44.160> tumor

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
Genaro drooping from brain tumor

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:54.260 
Genaro drooping from brain tumor
from<00:04:46.620> brain<00:04:46.830> like<00:04:48.050> we<00:04:49.050> have<00:04:49.430> glioma<00:04:53.030> then<00:04:54.030> we

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
from brain like we have glioma then we

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.409 
from brain like we have glioma then we
have<00:04:54.570> panel<00:04:55.200> oma<00:04:57.950> okay<00:04:58.950> then<00:04:59.130> we<00:04:59.310> have<00:04:59.419> Hamato

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
have panel oma okay then we have Hamato

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.670 
have panel oma okay then we have Hamato

okay right excellent and this can be a

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.860 
okay right excellent and this can be a
head<00:05:13.860> injury<00:05:14.100> also<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.790> didn't<00:05:15.210> do<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.780> he's

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
head injury also I didn't do and he's

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.290 
head injury also I didn't do and he's
too<00:05:16.080> rough<00:05:16.170> for<00:05:16.200> any<00:05:16.440> trauma<00:05:17.100> this<00:05:17.970> can<00:05:18.180> be

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
too rough for any trauma this can be

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
too rough for any trauma this can be
asked<00:05:18.510> in<00:05:18.570> USMLE<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.290> am<00:05:20.100> a<00:05:20.220> cpc-h<00:05:20.670> examination
