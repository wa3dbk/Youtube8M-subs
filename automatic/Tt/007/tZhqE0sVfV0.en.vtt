00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
excited in fact we're going to try doing

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.060 
excited in fact we're going to try doing
some<00:03:18.780> youtube<00:03:19.019> videos<00:03:19.200> over<00:03:19.560> out<00:03:19.680> there<00:03:19.860> it's

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
some youtube videos over out there it's

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.520 
some youtube videos over out there it's
gonna<00:03:20.130> be<00:03:20.250> great<00:03:21.170> so<00:03:22.170> it's<00:03:22.320> really<00:03:22.410> a

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
gonna be great so it's really a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.180 
gonna be great so it's really a
community<00:03:22.799> then<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.549> becomes<00:03:24.360> such<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.190> joint

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
community then it becomes such a joint

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.979 
community then it becomes such a joint
effort<00:03:26.430> it's<00:03:26.910> what<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.090> put<00:03:27.180> into<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.780> think

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
effort it's what you put into it I think

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.380 
effort it's what you put into it I think
that<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.739> get<00:03:28.860> out<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.880> that's<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
that you get out of it and so that's the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.550 
that you get out of it and so that's the
other<00:03:30.540> thing<00:03:30.660> I've<00:03:30.840> got<00:03:30.989> into<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.350> it's<00:03:31.470> gonna

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
other thing I've got into it it's gonna

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.310 
other thing I've got into it it's gonna
be<00:03:31.650> great<00:03:31.829> how<00:03:32.790> do<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.940> think<00:03:33.329> the<00:03:34.110> experience

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
be great how do you think the experience

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.949 
be great how do you think the experience
working<00:03:34.950> with<00:03:35.730> people<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.510> see<00:03:36.690> like<00:03:36.810> you

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
working with people you see like you

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.050 
working with people you see like you
came<00:03:37.170> into<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.070> whole<00:03:38.250> YouTube<00:03:38.670> thing<00:03:38.700> is

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
came into it the whole YouTube thing is

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.509 
came into it the whole YouTube thing is
very<00:03:39.329> individual<00:03:40.109> and<00:03:40.470> as<00:03:41.130> you<00:03:41.280> were<00:03:41.340> saying

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
very individual and as you were saying

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.039 
very individual and as you were saying
the<00:03:41.670> orchestra<00:03:42.060> thing<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.390> is<00:03:42.660> more<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:42.989> a

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
the orchestra thing is is more of a

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.300 
the orchestra thing is is more of a
community<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.590> you're<00:03:43.709> already<00:03:43.829> starting<00:03:44.100> to

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
community and you're already starting to

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.830 
community and you're already starting to
perform<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.700> community<00:03:45.090> how<00:03:45.540> do<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:45.660> think

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
perform that community how do you think

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.390 
perform that community how do you think
the<00:03:45.900> dynamics<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> project<00:03:46.920> will<00:03:47.070> change

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
the dynamics of the project will change

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.330 
the dynamics of the project will change
when<00:03:47.730> you're<00:03:47.880> actually<00:03:48.060> there<00:03:48.630> on<00:03:49.530> stage<00:03:49.829> wide

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
when you're actually there on stage wide

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.620 
when you're actually there on stage wide
I<00:03:50.790> think<00:03:51.120> it's<00:03:51.239> going<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.420> make<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.570> huge

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
I think it's going to make a huge

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.420 
I think it's going to make a huge
difference<00:03:52.170> i<00:03:52.410> think<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.920> chemistry

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
difference i think that the chemistry

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.800 
difference i think that the chemistry
it's<00:03:53.820> going<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.090> one<00:03:54.209> of<00:03:54.299> those<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.600> can't

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
it's going to be one of those you can't

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.270 
it's going to be one of those you can't
work<00:03:55.079> on<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.350> chemistry<00:03:55.620> too<00:03:55.859> much<00:03:56.010> in<00:03:56.130> person

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
work on the chemistry too much in person

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.830 
work on the chemistry too much in person
till<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.730> get<00:03:56.850> there<00:03:57.090> but<00:03:57.510> it's<00:03:57.600> going<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.750> be

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
till you get there but it's going to be

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.300 
till you get there but it's going to be
something<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.109> you've<00:03:58.290> all<00:03:58.380> worked<00:03:58.560> up<00:03:58.799> you

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
something that you've all worked up you

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.430 
something that you've all worked up you
know<00:03:59.340> virtually<00:03:59.609> so<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.180> legitimize<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.230> fact

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
know virtually so it legitimize the fact

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.729 
know virtually so it legitimize the fact
that<00:04:01.530> virtual<00:04:02.310> relationships<00:04:03.090> are<00:04:03.299> real<00:04:03.930> just

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
that virtual relationships are real just

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.259 
that virtual relationships are real just
as<00:04:04.920> real<00:04:05.040> as<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.250> could<00:04:05.459> be<00:04:05.579> in<00:04:05.670> person<00:04:05.820> that<00:04:06.120> it

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
as real as it could be in person that it

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.080 
as real as it could be in person that it
legitimizes<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:07.079> I<00:04:07.109> think<00:04:07.850> yeah<00:04:08.850> that's<00:04:09.030> a

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
legitimizes that I think yeah that's a

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.080 
legitimizes that I think yeah that's a
great<00:04:09.209> point<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.660> one<00:04:09.989> final<00:04:10.290> question<00:04:10.380> is

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
great point and one final question is

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.030 
great point and one final question is
what<00:04:12.090> do<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.209> do<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.170> look<00:04:13.320> forward<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.829> most

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
what do you do you look forward to most

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.710 
what do you do you look forward to most
about<00:04:14.220> Carnegie<00:04:14.700> Hall<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.030> mean<00:04:15.329> you<00:04:15.540> don't

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
about Carnegie Hall I mean you don't

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.140 
about Carnegie Hall I mean you don't
perform<00:04:16.200> in<00:04:16.560> Carnegie<00:04:16.919> Hall<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.370> time<00:04:17.549> so

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
perform in Carnegie Hall the time so

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.180 
perform in Carnegie Hall the time so
it's<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:19.260> would<00:04:19.560> think<00:04:19.680> of<00:04:19.799> each<00:04:19.950> sign<00:04:20.159> I

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
it's I would think of each sign I

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.680 
it's I would think of each sign I
remember<00:04:20.549> my<00:04:20.669> first<00:04:20.880> time<00:04:21.090> at<00:04:21.269> Carnegie<00:04:21.659> Hall

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
remember my first time at Carnegie Hall

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.320 
remember my first time at Carnegie Hall
i<00:04:22.229> was<00:04:22.620> playing<00:04:23.159> in<00:04:23.340> an<00:04:23.460> orchestra

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
i was playing in an orchestra

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.300 
i was playing in an orchestra
split<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.689> cards<00:04:24.900> orchestra<00:04:25.379> and<00:04:25.710> we<00:04:26.159> had<00:04:26.250> a

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
split the cards orchestra and we had a

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.980 
split the cards orchestra and we had a
rehearsal<00:04:26.430> break<00:04:26.909> so<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.240> took<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.509> break<00:04:27.960> to

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990
