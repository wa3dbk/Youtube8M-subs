00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
haven't tried it up and from our

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.520 
haven't tried it up and from our
experience<00:05:55.060> with<00:05:55.180> the<00:05:56.400> Jada<00:05:57.400> hyper<00:05:57.700> chargers

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
experience with the Jada hyper chargers

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.370 
experience with the Jada hyper chargers

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
they weren't really fast the battery

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.020 
they weren't really fast the battery
didn't<00:06:03.660> give<00:06:04.660> enough<00:06:04.960> Powell<00:06:05.260> to<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:06.030> motors

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
didn't give enough Powell to the motors

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.290 
didn't give enough Powell to the motors
so<00:06:07.620> I'm<00:06:08.620> thinking<00:06:09.520> about<00:06:09.640> skipping<00:06:10.000> on

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300
