hey<00:00:12.750> guys<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.230> got<00:00:13.260> a<00:00:13.440> 2005<00:00:14.430> Lincoln<00:00:14.850> Navigator

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
hey guys I got a 2005 Lincoln Navigator

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.060 
hey guys I got a 2005 Lincoln Navigator
here<00:00:15.510> today<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.380> has<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> problem<00:00:16.830> with<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
here today that has a problem with the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.100 
here today that has a problem with the
air<00:00:17.220> ride<00:00:17.490> suspension<00:00:17.640> both<00:00:18.360> the<00:00:18.510> front<00:00:18.869> and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
air ride suspension both the front and

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.450 
air ride suspension both the front and
the<00:00:19.230> rear<00:00:19.260> are<00:00:19.590> down<00:00:19.830> all<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> way<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the rear are down all the way to the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.970 
the rear are down all the way to the
ground<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.990> actually<00:00:22.320> at<00:00:22.410> another<00:00:22.680> shop

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
ground and it's actually at another shop

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.830 
ground and it's actually at another shop
and<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:23.369> couldn't<00:00:23.610> diagnose<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.360> so<00:00:24.750> they

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
and they couldn't diagnose it so they

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.450 
and they couldn't diagnose it so they
brought<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.110> down<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.410> us<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.220> they<00:00:26.340> were

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
brought it down to us and what they were

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.480 
brought it down to us and what they were
concentrating<00:00:27.119> down<00:00:27.270> there<00:00:27.619> was<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.010> fact

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
concentrating down there was the fact

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.099 
concentrating down there was the fact
the<00:00:29.609> air<00:00:29.760> compressor<00:00:30.270> was<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.600> turning<00:00:30.990> on

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
the air compressor was not turning on

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.410 
the air compressor was not turning on
they<00:00:31.289> were<00:00:31.380> trying<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.680> figure<00:00:31.949> out<00:00:31.980> why<00:00:32.420> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
they were trying to figure out why the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.060 
they were trying to figure out why the
module<00:00:33.900> was<00:00:34.050> not<00:00:34.230> turning<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.739> air<00:00:34.949> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
module was not turning on the air to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.740 
module was not turning on the air to
ride<00:00:35.220> compressor<00:00:35.760> when<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.570> whole

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
ride compressor when this the whole

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.750 
ride compressor when this the whole
truck<00:00:37.019> was<00:00:37.170> down<00:00:37.410> now<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.519> thing<00:00:38.640> they

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
truck was down now the one thing they

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.490 
truck was down now the one thing they
forgot<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.120> check<00:00:39.449> was<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> height<00:00:40.019> sensors

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
forgot to check was the height sensors

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.710 
forgot to check was the height sensors
the<00:00:40.710> height<00:00:40.830> sensors<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.340> these<00:00:41.550> go<00:00:42.210> bad<00:00:42.449> all

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
the height sensors on these go bad all

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.049 
the height sensors on these go bad all
the<00:00:42.780> time<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.160> linkages<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.880> them

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the time and the linkages on them

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.670 
the time and the linkages on them
actually<00:00:45.420> pop<00:00:45.660> off<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.170> time<00:00:46.350> whereas

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
actually pop off all the time whereas

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.160 
actually pop off all the time whereas
the<00:00:46.800> older<00:00:47.510> expeditions<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.660> navigators

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the older expeditions and navigators

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.080 
the older expeditions and navigators
they<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.320> air<00:00:49.530> ride<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.340> linkages<00:00:50.820> don't

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
they have air ride the linkages don't

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.940 
they have air ride the linkages don't
fall<00:00:51.360> off<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> sensors<00:00:52.320> generally<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.920> not

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
fall off in the sensors generally do not

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.030 
fall off in the sensors generally do not
fail<00:00:53.430> also<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.540> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> newer<00:00:54.960> ones<00:00:55.230> they<00:00:55.890> got

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
fail also but on the newer ones they got

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.979 
fail also but on the newer ones they got
smaller<00:00:56.430> different<00:00:56.940> design<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.570> they

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
smaller different design and they

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.690 
smaller different design and they
actually<00:00:58.320> failed<00:00:58.649> quite<00:00:59.010> often<00:00:59.250> I'm<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
actually failed quite often I'm going to

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.979 
actually failed quite often I'm going to
show<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> few<00:01:00.180> things<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.660> check

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
show you a few things you can check

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.850 
show you a few things you can check
without<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> scan<00:01:02.039> tool<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.860> what

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
without a scan tool so you can see what

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.560 
without a scan tool so you can see what
is<00:01:05.039> actually<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.550> on<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.000> your<00:01:06.119> truck<00:01:06.390> if

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
is actually going on with your truck if

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.029 
is actually going on with your truck if
it's<00:01:06.690> slammed<00:01:07.080> down<00:01:07.289> on<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.590> ground<00:01:07.830> like

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
it's slammed down on the ground like

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.060 
it's slammed down on the ground like
that<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:09.210> best<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.630> get<00:01:09.780> DTC's<00:01:10.410> now<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.890> one

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that it's best to get DTC's now this one

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770 
that it's best to get DTC's now this one
does<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.310> codes<00:01:11.910> for<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.300> right<00:01:12.479> front

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
does have codes for the right front

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.499 
does have codes for the right front
sensor<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.410> went<00:01:14.160> into<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.640> looked<00:01:15.330> at<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
sensor I went into there looked at the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
sensor I went into there looked at the
sensor<00:01:16.020> voltage<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.770> was<00:01:16.890> absolute<00:01:17.460> zero

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
sensor voltage and it was absolute zero

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.810 
sensor voltage and it was absolute zero
and<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.510> that<00:01:18.720> point<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> module<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.590> going

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
and at that point the module is going

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
and at that point the module is going
I'm<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:22.049> not<00:01:22.260> raising<00:01:22.439> or

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
I'm not you know I'm not raising or

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
I'm not you know I'm not raising or
lowering<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.280> vehicle<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:23.700> stops<00:01:24.210> dead

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
lowering the vehicle it just stops dead

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
lowering the vehicle it just stops dead
and<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:25.560> why<00:01:25.799> nothing's<00:01:26.100> coming<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.460> okay

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and that's why nothing's coming on okay

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.520 
and that's why nothing's coming on okay
so<00:01:27.119> over<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.659> wheel<00:01:27.840> well<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.380> can

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
so over here in the wheel well you can

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
so over here in the wheel well you can
see<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> height<00:01:29.220> sensors<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
see the height sensors right here and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600 
see the height sensors right here and
it's<00:01:31.020> got<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> little<00:01:31.350> bit<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.650> linkage<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.220> here

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
it's got a little bit of linkage on here

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's got a little bit of linkage on here
and<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.330> old-style<00:01:33.630> linkage<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and this is the old-style linkage it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.080 
and this is the old-style linkage it
likes<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> pop<00:01:34.770> off<00:01:35.009> over<00:01:35.280> rough<00:01:35.520> bumps<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
likes to pop off over rough bumps and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
likes to pop off over rough bumps and
all<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:37.080> these<00:01:37.259> are<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> little

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
all that and then these are the little

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
all that and then these are the little
sensors<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.060> fail<00:01:39.330> all<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.600> time

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
sensors that like to fail all the time

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
sensors that like to fail all the time
and<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.710> corroded<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.340> bound<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and they get corroded and bound up and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.420 
and they get corroded and bound up and
unfortunately<00:01:42.810> they're<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:44.100> expensive

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
unfortunately they're really expensive

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.620 
unfortunately they're really expensive
about<00:01:44.880> 300<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.659> 400<00:01:46.170> dollars<00:01:46.259> each<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:51.540> what

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
about 300 to 400 dollars each so what

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.210 
about 300 to 400 dollars each so what
you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.380> pop<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.799> pop<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
you can do is just pop up pop the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.940 
you can do is just pop up pop the
linkage<00:01:53.549> off<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.090> pry<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:57.950> tab

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
linkage off it just pry up on the tab

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.730 
linkage off it just pry up on the tab
right<00:01:59.220> here<00:01:59.250> this<00:02:00.090> metal<00:02:00.479> tab<00:02:00.689> right<00:02:00.899> here<00:02:00.930> pop

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
right here this metal tab right here pop

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.590 
right here this metal tab right here pop
it<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.280> then<00:02:02.670> while<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:02.909> still<00:02:03.210> mounted

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
it up and then while it's still mounted

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.569 
it up and then while it's still mounted
of<00:02:03.750> course<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.079> one's<00:02:04.290> already<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.549> you

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
of course this one's already what you

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.410 
of course this one's already what you
can<00:02:05.880> do<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.299> move<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.049> down<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:08.420> you'll

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
can do is move it up and down and you'll

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
can do is move it up and down and you'll
feel<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:11.000> right<00:02:12.000> there<00:02:12.239> starts<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.690> bind<00:02:12.930> it's

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
feel it right there starts to bind it's

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.030 
feel it right there starts to bind it's
free<00:02:14.150> bind

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
free bind

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.630 
free bind
now<00:02:18.040> compared<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> new<00:02:19.180> sensor<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:21.250> can<00:02:21.430> see

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
now compared to a new sensor you can see

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.770 
now compared to a new sensor you can see
it<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:21.790> fell<00:02:22.239> I<00:02:25.560> mean<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:28.209> should<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:28.510> full

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
it just fell I mean it should have full

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.390 
it just fell I mean it should have full
free<00:02:29.140> range<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.190> if<00:02:30.250> you're

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
free range like that so if you're

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.130 
free range like that so if you're
starting<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.790> get<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:30.970> binding<00:02:31.480> sensor<00:02:31.959> like

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
starting to get a binding sensor like

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.530 
starting to get a binding sensor like
this<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:33.160> can<00:02:33.340> almost<00:02:33.459> guarantee<00:02:33.879> that's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
this you can almost guarantee that's

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.000 
this you can almost guarantee that's
going<00:02:34.900> out<00:02:35.019> now<00:02:35.260> it's<00:02:35.379> best<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.620> have<00:02:35.769> code

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
going out now it's best to have code

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.820 
going out now it's best to have code
like<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.370> said<00:02:36.640> but<00:02:37.299> they<00:02:38.049> do<00:02:38.110> start<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.560> bind

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
like I said but they do start to bind

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.350 
like I said but they do start to bind
like<00:02:39.069> this<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:41.160> then<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.250> internals<00:02:42.790> go<00:02:43.030> and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
like this and then the internals go and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.600 
like this and then the internals go and
then<00:02:43.780> they<00:02:43.870> stop<00:02:44.200> reading<00:02:44.560> voltage<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.580> that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
then they stop reading voltage so that

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.880 
then they stop reading voltage so that
air<00:02:46.060> suspension<00:02:46.480> module<00:02:46.989> never<00:02:47.290> knows<00:02:47.560> where

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
air suspension module never knows where

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.160 
air suspension module never knows where
the<00:02:48.489> height<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.450> doesn't<00:02:49.630> want<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.959> raise

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
the height is so doesn't want to raise

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.190 
the height is so doesn't want to raise
or<00:02:50.530> lower<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.920> until<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.819> knows<00:02:52.000> right<00:02:52.959> here<00:02:53.110> on

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
or lower it until it knows right here on

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.569 
or lower it until it knows right here on
the<00:02:53.290> scan<00:02:53.560> tool<00:02:53.799> you<00:02:53.980> can<00:02:54.130> see<00:02:54.400> the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
the scan tool you can see the

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.150 
the scan tool you can see the
right-front<00:02:55.030> height<00:02:55.329> sensor<00:02:55.690> voltage<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.470> at

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
right-front height sensor voltage is at

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.940 
right-front height sensor voltage is at
zero<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.880> it's<00:02:58.630> disconnected<00:02:59.140> right<00:02:59.530> now<00:02:59.680> but

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
zero and it's disconnected right now but

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.410 
zero and it's disconnected right now but
when<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.190> old<00:03:00.400> sensor<00:03:00.790> was<00:03:00.910> on<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.239> bad

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
when the old sensor was on the bad

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.780 
when the old sensor was on the bad
sensor<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.200> was<00:03:02.650> reading<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:02.950> same<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.549> then

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
sensor it was reading the same and then

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.550 
sensor it was reading the same and then
once<00:03:03.970> it's<00:03:04.150> connected<00:03:04.450> we've<00:03:04.810> got<00:03:04.930> point<00:03:05.290> four

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
once it's connected we've got point four

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.660 
once it's connected we've got point four
nine<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.640> goes<00:03:06.819> all<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.120> way<00:03:07.360> up<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:08.670> three

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
nine and it goes all the way up to three

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.839 
nine and it goes all the way up to three
simply<00:03:10.269> up<00:03:10.540> for<00:03:10.840> something<00:03:11.370> four<00:03:12.370> point<00:03:12.670> five

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
simply up for something four point five

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.619 
simply up for something four point five
one<00:03:13.150> volts<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:15.209> that's<00:03:16.209> what<00:03:16.390> it's<00:03:16.480> looking

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
one volts and that's what it's looking

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.809 
one volts and that's what it's looking
at<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.110> make<00:03:17.260> sure<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.370> system<00:03:18.760> is

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
at to make sure that the system is

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.640 
at to make sure that the system is
actually<00:03:18.970> raising<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.629> lowering<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.530> it

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
actually raising a lowering so it

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.199 
actually raising a lowering so it
doesn't<00:03:20.889> have<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.160> correct<00:03:21.400> information<00:03:21.790> and

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
doesn't have the correct information and

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.940 
doesn't have the correct information and
will<00:03:22.359> shut<00:03:22.600> down<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.230> here's<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.799> old

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
will shut down and here's the old

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.590 
will shut down and here's the old
linkage<00:03:24.370> style<00:03:24.700> it's<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:24.970> one<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.329> causes

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
linkage style it's the one that causes

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.960 
linkage style it's the one that causes
them<00:03:26.079> to<00:03:26.109> pop<00:03:26.380> off<00:03:26.620> all<00:03:26.889> time<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.760> not<00:03:27.910> very

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
them to pop off all time it's not very

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.629 
them to pop off all time it's not very
good<00:03:28.420> design<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.440> new<00:03:29.470> design<00:03:29.980> on<00:03:30.010> here<00:03:30.489> is

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
good design and a new design on here is

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.610 
good design and a new design on here is
actually<00:03:31.389> like<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.810> lift<00:03:32.079> struts<00:03:32.380> for<00:03:32.530> your

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
actually like the lift struts for your

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.620 
actually like the lift struts for your
hood<00:03:32.799> or<00:03:32.950> whatever<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.609> it's<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.150> very<00:03:34.389> good

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
hood or whatever and it's a very good

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.400 
hood or whatever and it's a very good
design<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.230> these<00:03:36.040> ones<00:03:36.280> do<00:03:36.489> not<00:03:36.670> pop<00:03:36.910> off<00:03:37.410> and

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
design and these ones do not pop off and

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.839 
design and these ones do not pop off and
these<00:03:38.500> height<00:03:38.709> sensors<00:03:39.099> are<00:03:39.220> very<00:03:39.250> easier

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
these height sensors are very easier

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.629 
these height sensors are very easier
place<00:03:40.299> all<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.049> got<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.349> do<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.560> take<00:03:41.769> off<00:03:41.950> two<00:03:42.160> 13

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
place all I got to do is take off two 13

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.759 
place all I got to do is take off two 13
millimeter<00:03:43.060> nuts<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:44.019> unplug<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.410> connector

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769

involved<00:03:50.260> with<00:03:50.739> changing<00:03:51.370> these<00:03:51.489> out<00:03:51.730> so<00:03:52.030> it's

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
involved with changing these out so it's

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.110 
involved with changing these out so it's
a<00:03:52.630> very<00:03:52.870> expensive<00:03:53.079> part<00:03:53.650> but<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.639> common

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
a very expensive part but it is a common

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.599 
a very expensive part but it is a common
failure<00:03:55.419> so<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.470> main<00:03:56.650> point<00:03:56.980> I<00:03:57.160> just<00:03:57.190> want<00:03:57.549> to

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
failure so the main point I just want to

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.640 
failure so the main point I just want to
get<00:03:57.700> across<00:03:57.940> is<00:03:58.419> that<00:03:58.450> just<00:03:59.200> because<00:03:59.319> the

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
get across is that just because the

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.229 
get across is that just because the
truck<00:03:59.889> is<00:04:00.040> down<00:04:00.250> all<00:04:00.639> the<00:04:00.760> way<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.880> ground

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
truck is down all the way the ground

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.030 
truck is down all the way the ground
doesn't<00:04:01.900> mean<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.530> air<00:04:02.680> suspension

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
doesn't mean that the air suspension

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.099 
doesn't mean that the air suspension
module<00:04:03.609> is<00:04:03.760> actually<00:04:04.120> going<00:04:04.269> to<00:04:04.450> turn<00:04:04.660> on<00:04:04.900> the

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
would dictate it's that far down it

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.479 
would dictate it's that far down it
should<00:04:09.880> raise<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:10.389> but<00:04:10.870> once<00:04:11.169> it<00:04:11.349> sees<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.739> bad

sensor it will automatically just go on

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.729 
sensor it will automatically just go on

like a suspended state and not do

anything with any of that sensors or the

anything with any of that sensors or the

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
air spring solenoids so you may be

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.029 
air spring solenoids so you may be
testing<00:04:22.120> for<00:04:22.270> those<00:04:22.450> also<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.380> you're<00:04:23.919> not

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
testing for those also and you're not

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.589 
testing for those also and you're not
getting<00:04:24.220> nothing<00:04:24.700> well<00:04:24.880> it's<00:04:25.030> not<00:04:25.240> turning

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.860 
getting nothing well it's not turning
them<00:04:25.659> on<00:04:25.840> because<00:04:26.020> it's<00:04:26.229> not<00:04:26.260> turn

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870

them on because it's not turn
presser<00:04:27.199> on<00:04:27.229> because<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:28.190> doesn't<00:04:28.520> know<00:04:28.699> the

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
presser on because it doesn't know the

actual height of the air suspension and

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.000 
actual height of the air suspension and
these<00:04:32.330> can<00:04:32.510> be<00:04:32.630> confusing<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.260> diagnose<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:33.919> if

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
these can be confusing to diagnose so if

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.070 
these can be confusing to diagnose so if
like<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:34.280> said<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.550> best<00:04:34.729> thing<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:34.970> do<00:04:35.210> is<00:04:35.479> that

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
like I said the best thing to do is that

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.689 
like I said the best thing to do is that
if<00:04:36.139> it<00:04:36.260> has<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.470> problem<00:04:36.919> where<00:04:37.160> it<00:04:37.250> says<00:04:37.430> ear

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
if it has a problem where it says ear

it's definitely have a DTC and you can

it's definitely have a DTC and you can
go<00:04:41.930> from<00:04:42.110> there<00:04:42.350> you<00:04:43.340> may<00:04:43.490> get<00:04:43.669> generic<00:04:44.120> ones

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
go from there you may get generic ones

often<00:05:23.680> but<00:05:24.680> like<00:05:24.889> I<00:05:24.979> said<00:05:25.039> those<00:05:25.340> height

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
in 2003 and late production they went to

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.969 
in 2003 and late production they went to

that they had that solid-state relay
they<00:05:39.349> have<00:05:39.440> failed<00:05:39.680> all<00:05:39.950> the<00:05:40.070> time<00:05:40.280> so<00:05:40.820> from

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
they have failed all the time so from

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.779 
they have failed all the time so from
2003<00:05:41.840> late<00:05:42.080> production<00:05:42.530> on<00:05:42.710> we<00:05:43.310> haven't<00:05:43.460> seen

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
2003 late production on we haven't seen

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
no problems with that relay also just
