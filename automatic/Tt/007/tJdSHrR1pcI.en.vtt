00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
think of a name for it I was gonna

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.179 
think of a name for it I was gonna
combine<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.869> couple<00:00:28.050> letters<00:00:28.439> from<00:00:28.740> each<00:00:28.949> of

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
combine a couple letters from each of

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.209 
combine a couple letters from each of
the<00:00:29.429> troops<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.539> gowiwi<00:00:30.929> or<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.980> Barch

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
the troops like the gowiwi or the Barch

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.830 
the troops like the gowiwi or the Barch
or<00:00:32.430> something<00:00:32.759> like<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.270> instead<00:00:33.420> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
or something like that but instead I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.810 
or something like that but instead I
decided<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.950> call<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> barf<00:00:35.730> bag

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
decided just to call it the barf bag

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.299 
decided just to call it the barf bag
just<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.079> bad<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.160> should

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
just because it's that bad and it should

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
just because it's that bad and it should
probably<00:00:38.460> never<00:00:38.790> be<00:00:39.030> used<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.840> let's<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.260> ahead

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
probably never be used so let's go ahead

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.020 
probably never be used so let's go ahead
and<00:00:40.440> see<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.860> attack<00:00:41.100> some<00:00:41.340> bases<00:00:41.790> I'm

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and see if we can attack some bases I'm

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.310 
and see if we can attack some bases I'm
probably<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.480> gonna<00:00:42.719> throw<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.989> bunch<00:00:43.140> of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
probably just gonna throw a bunch of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.170 
probably just gonna throw a bunch of
stuff<00:00:43.440> down<00:00:43.739> at<00:00:43.890> once<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.250> see<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.059> use

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
stuff down at once and see if I can use

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.639 
stuff down at once and see if I can use
my<00:00:45.210> rage<00:00:45.539> spells<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.960> get<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> center<00:00:46.590> of

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
be an all-out assault to the center so I

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
did drop my healers just to help out a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.750 
did drop my healers just to help out a
little<00:03:17.400> bit

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
little bit

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.479 
little bit
drop<00:03:18.150> my<00:03:18.269> heroes<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:18.840> both<00:03:19.079> sides<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.859> let's

drop my heroes on both sides and let's

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.640 
drop my heroes on both sides and let's
see<00:03:20.669> how<00:03:20.819> we're<00:03:21.060> doing<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.569> left<00:03:22.319> side<00:03:22.440> is

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
see how we're doing so left side is

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.369 
see how we're doing so left side is
going<00:03:22.949> pretty<00:03:23.190> well<00:03:23.370> right<00:03:23.609> side<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.569> guess

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
going pretty well right side I guess

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.580 
going pretty well right side I guess
it's<00:03:25.680> going<00:03:25.949> okay<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:27.239> didn't<00:03:28.199> bring<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.440> most

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
it's going okay I didn't bring the most

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.809 
it's going okay I didn't bring the most
powerful<00:03:29.010> troops<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.400> I'm<00:03:29.519> really<00:03:29.730> just

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
powerful troops so I'm really just

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.580 
powerful troops so I'm really just
focusing<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.510> my<00:03:30.659> pekus<00:03:31.049> to<00:03:31.169> bring<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.440> home

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
focusing on my pekus to bring it home

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.379 
focusing on my pekus to bring it home
the<00:03:32.099> Valkyries<00:03:32.489> might<00:03:32.699> do<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:32.849> little<00:03:33.060> bit<00:03:33.269> of

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
the Valkyries might do a little bit of

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.390 
the Valkyries might do a little bit of
damage<00:03:33.569> my<00:03:34.079> barbarians<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.919> archers<00:03:35.010> are

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
damage my barbarians and archers are

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.220 
damage my barbarians and archers are
definitely<00:03:35.790> long<00:03:35.970> gone<00:03:36.180> by<00:03:36.359> now<00:03:36.389> so<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.019> just

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
definitely long gone by now so I just

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.509 
definitely long gone by now so I just
have<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.409> make<00:03:37.620> sure<00:03:37.769> those<00:03:37.949> guys<00:03:38.099> make<00:03:38.370> their

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
way to the center and pretty much preyed

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.229 
way to the center and pretty much preyed
on<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.099> Pekka<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.669> hope<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:41.970> those<00:03:42.060> guys

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
good bonus I guess with a little bit of

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.369 
good bonus I guess with a little bit of
dark<00:04:02.669> elixir<00:04:02.849> thrown<00:04:03.209> in<00:04:03.329> there<00:04:03.479> so<00:04:03.989> this

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
dark elixir thrown in there so this

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.110 
dark elixir thrown in there so this
strategy<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.859> actually<00:04:05.310> working<00:04:05.519> out<00:04:05.790> pretty

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
strategy is actually working out pretty

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.030 
strategy is actually working out pretty
well<00:04:06.239> even<00:04:06.959> though<00:04:07.079> it<00:04:07.349> pretty<00:04:07.590> much<00:04:07.769> has<00:04:08.010> the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
well even though it pretty much has the

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.330 
well even though it pretty much has the
worst<00:04:08.760> combination<00:04:09.479> of<00:04:09.659> troops<00:04:10.340> besides

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
worst combination of troops besides

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.189

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
can see the wall sort of going down and

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.809 
can see the wall sort of going down and
as<00:05:28.470> you<00:05:28.590> guys<00:05:28.680> know<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.979> Valkyries<00:05:29.400> swing<00:05:29.669> in
