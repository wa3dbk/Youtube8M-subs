cooperation between Iran and North Korea

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.040 
cooperation between Iran and North Korea
do<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:24.890> think<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.250> Iran<00:03:25.520> North<00:03:26.510> Korea<00:03:26.630> with

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
do you think that Iran North Korea with

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.600 
do you think that Iran North Korea with
its<00:03:27.200> nuclear<00:03:27.560> weapon<00:03:27.950> is<00:03:28.070> a<00:03:28.100> threat<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.459> the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
its nuclear weapon is a threat to the

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
United States yet no but they sell

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.390

argue let me ask you a question well
should<00:04:10.250> question<00:04:10.670> okay<00:04:10.880> so<00:04:11.390> because<00:04:12.140> some

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
should question okay so because some

country has a yellow cake uranium we're

country has a yellow cake uranium we're
it's<00:04:15.800> were<00:04:16.190> justified<00:04:16.700> in<00:04:16.730> attacking

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
it's were justified in attacking

it's were justified in attacking
it<00:04:17.570> depends<00:04:18.050> on<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:19.150> circumstances<00:04:20.150> France

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
it depends on the circumstances France

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.290 
it depends on the circumstances France
has<00:04:20.810> all<00:04:21.290> kinds<00:04:21.770> of<00:04:21.860> nuclear<00:04:22.280> material<00:04:22.460> but<00:04:23.150> we

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
has all kinds of nuclear material but we

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.120 
has all kinds of nuclear material but we
don't<00:04:23.480> think<00:04:23.720> France<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.140> about<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.560> attack<00:04:24.860> us

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
don't think France is about to attack us

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.850 
don't think France is about to attack us
they<00:04:25.310> have<00:04:25.760> breeder<00:04:26.120> reactors<00:04:26.720> they<00:04:27.200> do<00:04:27.680> their

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
they have breeder reactors they do their

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.620 
they have breeder reactors they do their
own<00:04:27.890> reprocessing<00:04:28.640> do<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:28.880> think<00:04:29.150> France<00:04:29.420> as<00:04:29.600> a

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
own reprocessing do I think France as a

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.270 
own reprocessing do I think France as a
threat<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:30.290> you're<00:04:30.440> trying<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.890> frame<00:04:31.100> the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
threat so you're trying to frame the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.130 
threat so you're trying to frame the
question<00:04:31.400> is<00:04:31.760> if<00:04:32.120> somebody<00:04:32.450> has<00:04:32.720> nuclear

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
question is if somebody has nuclear

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.170 
question is if somebody has nuclear
materials<00:04:33.800> are<00:04:34.130> they<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.370> threat<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.880> don't

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
materials are they a threat I don't

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.730 
materials are they a threat I don't
think<00:04:35.240> France<00:04:35.750> is<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:35.990> threat<00:04:36.320> before<00:04:36.500> the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
think France is a threat before the

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.280 
think France is a threat before the
record<00:04:37.100> but<00:04:37.370> nobody<00:04:38.000> is<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.510> threat<00:04:38.930> with<00:04:39.140> the

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
record but nobody is a threat with the

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.560 
record but nobody is a threat with the
yellowcake<00:04:39.710> uranium<00:04:40.070> at<00:04:40.610> that<00:04:40.880> moment<00:04:41.120> maybe

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
yellowcake uranium at that moment maybe

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.720 
yellowcake uranium at that moment maybe
in<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.960> future<00:04:42.170> it's<00:04:42.590> possible<00:04:43.190> what<00:04:43.610> they

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
in the future it's possible what they

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.520 
in the future it's possible what they
have<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.030> make<00:04:44.210> nuclear<00:04:44.570> weapons<00:04:44.810> right<00:04:45.350> when

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
have to make nuclear weapons right when

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.950 
have to make nuclear weapons right when
