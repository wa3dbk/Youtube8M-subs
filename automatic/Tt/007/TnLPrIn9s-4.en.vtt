00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.400
 a twitter dish there is a series that is a 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.519
 entry series within the order 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.540
 symbols is a dish that was made in 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.730
 brass 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.210
 but it's a very surprising dish 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.060
 because he received today a few 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 modifications some improvements than in 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.439
 relation to the gradual machining 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.619
 extension between cupola and dish border and 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.120
 which produces a sound balance 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.079
 awesome the hammer lament the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.660
 dish that also creates a single 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.200
 that even being an entrance dish he 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.500
 surprisingly very positively. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 There's nothing better than going to the playground. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.510
 touch the plate to show that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.670
 really you may be surprised of 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.480
 a positive shape with this dish 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.870
 twitter 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.870
