this<00:01:22.350> video<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.619> taken<00:01:22.710> down<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.820> way

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
this video was taken down but in a way

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.399 
this video was taken down but in a way
it's<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.869> guys<00:01:24.960> remember<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it's just like if you guys remember the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.249 
it's just like if you guys remember the
flamethrowers<00:01:25.950> from<00:01:26.460> world<00:01:26.880> at<00:01:27.030> war<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:28.229> even

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
flamethrowers from world at war or even

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.539 
flamethrowers from world at war or even
black<00:01:28.619> ops<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.100> had<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> flamethrower

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
black ops one had a flamethrower

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.069 
black ops one had a flamethrower
attachment<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> wasn't<00:01:30.689> very<00:01:30.780> effective

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
attachment but it wasn't very effective

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.190 
attachment but it wasn't very effective
it's<00:01:31.680> kind<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.430> idea<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it's kind of like that idea but it's a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.020 
it's kind of like that idea but it's a
lot<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.439> powerful<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.579> guy<00:01:35.790> was

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
lot more powerful like this guy was

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.060 
lot more powerful like this guy was
running<00:01:36.570> around<00:01:36.659> corners<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.409> torching

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
running around corners and just torching

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.100 
running around corners and just torching
people<00:01:38.400> he<00:01:38.579> was<00:01:38.700> jumping<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.180> dom<00:01:39.479> flags<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
people he was jumping on dom flags and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.719 
people he was jumping on dom flags and
spraying<00:01:40.409> like<00:01:40.650> three<00:01:40.950> guys<00:01:41.130> down<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
spraying like three guys down but it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.910 
spraying like three guys down but it
seems<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> very<00:01:42.600> very<00:01:42.930> powerful<00:01:43.170> no

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
seems like it's a very very powerful no

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
seems like it's a very very powerful no
specialist<00:01:44.549> weapon<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.060> takes<00:01:45.450> people

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
specialist weapon and it takes people

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.190 
specialist weapon and it takes people
out<00:01:45.780> quickly

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
out quickly

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.170 
out quickly
obviously<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> range<00:01:47.040> isn't<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> great

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
obviously the range isn't all that great

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.120 
obviously the range isn't all that great
it's<00:01:48.509> more<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.990> shotgun<00:01:49.470> range<00:01:49.829> type

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's more of like a shotgun range type

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
it's more of like a shotgun range type
weapon<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.329> absolutely

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
weapon but it just it absolutely

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.289 
weapon but it just it absolutely
demolishes<00:01:52.619> people<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:54.030> cool<00:01:54.270> because

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
demolishes people and it's cool because

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.840 
demolishes people and it's cool because
there's<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.780> there's<00:01:55.110> flames<00:01:55.409> everywhere

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
there's just there's flames everywhere

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
there's just there's flames everywhere
like<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.030> really<00:01:57.270> badass<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.990> that's<00:01:58.560> pretty

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
like it's really badass so that's pretty

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.560 
like it's really badass so that's pretty
sweet<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> other<00:02:00.000> side<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> things

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
sweet now on the other side of things

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.510 
sweet now on the other side of things
pretty<00:02:00.960> special<00:02:01.290> stability<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:02.159> called<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
pretty special stability it's called a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.969 
pretty special stability it's called a
heat<00:02:02.729> wave<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.689> creates<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.229> sphere<00:02:04.740> of

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
heat wave and this creates a sphere of

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.940 
heat wave and this creates a sphere of
heat<00:02:05.280> radiation<00:02:05.549> around<00:02:06.509> your<00:02:06.719> body<00:02:06.950> stunning

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
heat radiation around your body stunning

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.559 
heat radiation around your body stunning
and<00:02:08.129> burn

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
and burn

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.170 
and burn
enemies<00:02:09.019> within<00:02:09.530> range<00:02:10.159> so<00:02:10.610> when<00:02:10.969> I<00:02:11.000> heard

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
enemies within range so when I heard

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.429 
enemies within range so when I heard
this<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.659> didn't<00:02:11.870> get<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.019> see<00:02:12.140> any<00:02:12.260> gameplay

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
this I didn't get to see any gameplay

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.660 
this I didn't get to see any gameplay
this<00:02:12.769> but<00:02:12.920> what<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.069> heard<00:02:13.189> this<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.489> thought

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
this but what I heard this I thought

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.699 
this but what I heard this I thought
that<00:02:13.879> sounds<00:02:14.180> kind<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.480> like<00:02:14.629> almost<00:02:15.230> like<00:02:15.530> a

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
that sounds kind of like almost like a

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.589 
that sounds kind of like almost like a
thermite<00:02:16.280> grenade<00:02:16.310> mixed<00:02:17.209> with<00:02:17.359> like<00:02:17.569> a

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
thermite grenade mixed with like a

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.660 
thermite grenade mixed with like a
trophy<00:02:18.560> system<00:02:18.980> or<00:02:19.310> something<00:02:19.489> like<00:02:19.609> that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
trophy system or something like that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.000 
trophy system or something like that
like<00:02:19.879> it's<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.239> small<00:02:20.629> area<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.200> effect<00:02:21.829> I<00:02:21.980> don't

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
like it's a small area of effect I don't

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.589 
like it's a small area of effect I don't
know<00:02:22.189> how<00:02:22.250> big<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.549> is<00:02:22.670> hopefully<00:02:23.269> it's<00:02:23.450> no

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
know how big it is hopefully it's no

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.539 
know how big it is hopefully it's no
decent-sized<00:02:24.170> but<00:02:24.620> it's<00:02:24.739> an<00:02:24.829> area<00:02:25.099> of<00:02:25.250> effect

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
decent-sized but it's an area of effect

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.039 
decent-sized but it's an area of effect
around<00:02:25.819> your<00:02:26.030> body<00:02:26.209> kind<00:02:26.540> of<00:02:26.599> like<00:02:26.689> a<00:02:26.720> trophy

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
around your body kind of like a trophy

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.020 
around your body kind of like a trophy
system<00:02:27.500> would<00:02:27.650> do<00:02:27.799> but<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.400> like<00:02:28.549> everything

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
system would do but it's like everything

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.339 
system would do but it's like everything
that<00:02:29.180> comes<00:02:29.359> into<00:02:29.629> that<00:02:29.780> area

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
that comes into that area

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.679 
that comes into that area
it's<00:02:31.069> thermite<00:02:31.579> it<00:02:31.730> like<00:02:31.939> it<00:02:32.239> kind<00:02:32.569> of<00:02:32.599> you

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
it's thermite it like it kind of you

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.479 
it's thermite it like it kind of you
know<00:02:32.810> slows<00:02:33.109> you<00:02:33.260> down<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.890> kind<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.099> stuns<00:02:34.370> you

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
know slows you down it kind of stuns you

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.740 
know slows you down it kind of stuns you
a<00:02:34.519> little<00:02:34.760> bit<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.060> then<00:02:35.209> if<00:02:35.329> you<00:02:35.420> stay<00:02:35.599> in<00:02:35.689> it

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
a little bit and then if you stay in it

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.240 
a little bit and then if you stay in it
too<00:02:35.930> long<00:02:36.109> it's<00:02:36.319> gonna<00:02:36.470> kill<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.799> so<00:02:36.950> I'm<00:02:37.069> not

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
too long it's gonna kill you so I'm not

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.860 
too long it's gonna kill you so I'm not
sure<00:02:37.430> how<00:02:37.609> useful<00:02:37.849> that<00:02:38.030> one's<00:02:38.389> gonna<00:02:38.540> be<00:02:38.719> it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
sure how useful that one's gonna be it

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.690 
sure how useful that one's gonna be it
sounds<00:02:39.139> like<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.319> could<00:02:39.469> be<00:02:39.500> pretty<00:02:39.859> cool<00:02:40.069> but

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
sounds like it could be pretty cool but

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.550 
sounds like it could be pretty cool but
it<00:02:41.359> also<00:02:41.540> sounds<00:02:41.930> like<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.109> could<00:02:42.290> be<00:02:42.319> very

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
it also sounds like it could be very

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.890 
it also sounds like it could be very
weak<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.159> the<00:02:43.430> area<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.909> effect<00:02:44.150> isn't<00:02:44.599> very

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
weak if the area of effect isn't very

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.940 
weak if the area of effect isn't very
big<00:02:45.109> so<00:02:45.260> what's<00:02:45.409> the<00:02:45.500> wait<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.709> see<00:02:45.859> what

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
big so what's the wait and see what

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.399 
big so what's the wait and see what
happens<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:46.700> either<00:02:47.269> way<00:02:47.599> I<00:02:47.629> mean<00:02:47.900> we<00:02:48.049> have<00:02:48.230> a
