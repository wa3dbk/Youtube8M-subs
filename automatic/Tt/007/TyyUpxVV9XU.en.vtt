00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
in previous Call of Duty's you could be

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.890 
in previous Call of Duty's you could be
in<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.710> middle<00:01:44.980> of<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.280> smoke<00:01:45.970> cloud<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.540> you

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
in the middle of a smoke cloud and you

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.360 
in the middle of a smoke cloud and you
can<00:01:47.050> still<00:01:47.230> see<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.440> red<00:01:47.620> dots<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.160> map

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
can still see the red dots and the map

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.250 
can still see the red dots and the map
and<00:01:48.550> things<00:01:48.730> like<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:48.910> and<00:01:49.180> now<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:49.840> is<00:01:49.990> a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
and things like that and now this is a

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.730 
and things like that and now this is a
way<00:01:50.620> more<00:01:51.600> futuristic<00:01:52.600> feel<00:01:53.050> to<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.350> game<00:01:53.530> to

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
way more futuristic feel to the game to

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.280 
way more futuristic feel to the game to
smoke<00:01:54.040> grenades<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.490> it's<00:01:54.640> actually<00:01:54.820> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
smoke grenades and it's actually a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.320 
smoke grenades and it's actually a
complete<00:01:56.290> way<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.860> changing<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.910> use<00:01:58.300> of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
complete way of changing the use of

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.390 
complete way of changing the use of
smoke<00:01:59.110> grenades<00:01:59.470> like<00:01:59.650> you<00:01:59.740> can<00:01:59.890> now<00:02:00.040> actually

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
smoke grenades like you can now actually

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.400 
smoke grenades like you can now actually
use<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.730> smoke<00:02:01.000> grenade<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.510> he<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.140> towards

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
use a smoke grenade and he is it towards

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.840 
use a smoke grenade and he is it towards
your<00:02:02.500> advantage<00:02:02.950> like<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.220> actually<00:02:03.430> flank

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
your advantage like you actually flank

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.580 
your advantage like you actually flank
an<00:02:03.940> enemy<00:02:04.180> with<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.360> smoke<00:02:04.630> grenade<00:02:04.660> before<00:02:05.500> you

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
an enemy with a smoke grenade before you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.690 
an enemy with a smoke grenade before you
can<00:02:05.710> really<00:02:05.860> flank<00:02:06.190> him<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.430> could<00:02:06.670> but

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
can really flank him you could but

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.130 
can really flank him you could but
sometimes<00:02:07.210> if<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.450> player<00:02:07.630> was<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.810> little<00:02:08.050> bit

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
sometimes if the player was a little bit

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.839 
sometimes if the player was a little bit
too<00:02:08.259> smart<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:09.039> know<00:02:09.129> where<00:02:09.250> was<00:02:09.399> just<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.729> good

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
too smart you know where was just a good

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:10.979 
too smart you know where was just a good
player<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.239> general<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.629> really<00:02:10.780> couldn't

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
player and general you really couldn't

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.330 
player and general you really couldn't
flank<00:02:11.230> them<00:02:11.379> because<00:02:11.710> you<00:02:11.860> could<00:02:11.980> either<00:02:12.100> here

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
flank them because you could either here

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.309 
flank them because you could either here
you<00:02:12.550> or

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
you or

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.649 
you or
just<00:02:13.650> see<00:02:13.859> on<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.129> mini-map<00:02:14.340> or<00:02:14.670> whatnot<00:02:14.849> but

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
just see on the mini-map or whatnot but

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.390 
just see on the mini-map or whatnot but
now<00:02:15.930> if<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> smoke<00:02:17.069> grenade<00:02:17.099> or

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
now if this is a smoke grenade or

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.649 
now if this is a smoke grenade or
perhaps<00:02:17.639> you<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.209> if<00:02:18.269> it's<00:02:18.359> a<00:02:18.420> different

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
perhaps you know if it's a different

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:19.819 
perhaps you know if it's a different
topic<00:02:18.810> red<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.109> still<00:02:19.260> fine<00:02:19.409> but<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.650> it's<00:02:19.769> a

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
topic red is still fine but if it's a

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.229 
topic red is still fine but if it's a
smoke<00:02:20.069> grenade<00:02:20.099> which<00:02:20.370> I'm<00:02:20.519> thinking<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.209> is

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
smoke grenade which I'm thinking it is

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.660 
smoke grenade which I'm thinking it is
it<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.049> going<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.409> be<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.560> very<00:02:22.680> very<00:02:23.370> good

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
it is going to be a very very good

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.399 
it is going to be a very very good
add-on<00:02:24.180> into<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.689> game<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.049> actually

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
add-on into the game of actually

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.780 
add-on into the game of actually
blurring<00:02:25.680> out<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.099> mini-map<00:02:26.400> because<00:02:26.670> it

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
blurring out the mini-map because it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.819 
blurring out the mini-map because it
makes<00:02:26.969> sense<00:02:27.269> guys<00:02:27.569> it's<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.079> now<00:02:28.680> you're

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
makes sense guys it's like now you're

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.229 
makes sense guys it's like now you're
blowing<00:02:29.189> out<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.340> vision<00:02:29.819> but<00:02:29.939> you<00:02:30.060> don't

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
blowing out the vision but you don't

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.879 
blowing out the vision but you don't
blur<00:02:30.420> at<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.659> mini-map<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.590> that

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
blur at the mini-map it just that

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.170 
blur at the mini-map it just that
doesn't<00:02:32.250> make<00:02:32.340> sense<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.969> right<00:02:33.120> here

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
doesn't make sense but this right here

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.819 
doesn't make sense but this right here
it's<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:34.170> know<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.560> little<00:02:34.680> details

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
it's you know it's the little details

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.619 
it's you know it's the little details
that<00:02:35.280> are<00:02:35.430> being<00:02:35.609> put<00:02:35.790> into<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.209> game<00:02:36.420> that

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
that are being put into this game that

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.300 
that are being put into this game that
are<00:02:36.719> making<00:02:36.870> me<00:02:37.109> even<00:02:37.260> more<00:02:37.379> hype<00:02:37.709> about<00:02:37.859> it<00:02:38.159> I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
are making me even more hype about it I

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.800 
are making me even more hype about it I
definitely<00:02:38.579> think<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.359> game<00:02:39.569> is<00:02:39.599> going

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
definitely think that this game is going

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.659 
definitely think that this game is going
to<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:39.989> really<00:02:40.200> good<00:02:40.319> let<00:02:41.280> me<00:02:41.340> know<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:41.639> the

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:41.669 
to be really good let me know in the
