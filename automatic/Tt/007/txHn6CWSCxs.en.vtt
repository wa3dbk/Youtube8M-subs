 Lima alliance visited with the ball 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.000
 smart criterion about has broken 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.020
 going back to the circle and especially 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.970
 appears story profile changed here a 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.680
 left-handed and make the difference is 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.140
 just what I wanted to avoid 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.610
 goal of team that concrete anderson 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.950
 because they handle derek if you want 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.930
 wants ex patient verticalizes ball 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.270
 served exo floor bars as it should be 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.890
 to simplify the extension of the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.320
 Andy's move that's driving diagonally and 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.370
 took a shot from another match 1 to 0 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.370
 deserved for aliens 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.790
 is the corner shot to advance 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.990
 will not seek alliance lima centers 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.990
 careful they did not take out 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.979
 this takes out well the cat rodrigo 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.320
 Club Alliance wins San Martin 2 to 0 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.130
 well actually he rodrigo when is 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.130
 a player that is characterized 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.520
 ah 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.380
 in these balls divided up and wins 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.030
 with a huge facility and after 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.670
 a lot of time a favor that jumps like 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.459
 the jumper in Cuba but the fact 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.590
 highlighting is the passivity of the defense 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:22.450
 of san martín is a passivity that already 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.130
 I'm not surprised because we see it as a match 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.300
 to match and that's why in the situation 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.300
 where are the unforgivables 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.600
 but here at the university san martín 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.540
 of porres cutie 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.040
 we thank the people who follow the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.550
 who just got hooked and all the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.550
 that follow us 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.370
 San Martin 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.370
 what things do not 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.730
 also to save time 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.909
 leave to arrive now san martín 2 a 1 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.700
 you see when we had not mentioned 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.290
 that san martín did not have where 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.180
 a move where alliance has for 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.370
 specify there is a split of exxon 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.829
 ends bad play is checked out the 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.109
 midfield and that's exactly where 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.489
 shame alliance martín finds the 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.230
 space to generate this play that 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.230
 concludes in returning when he 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.190
 that is san martín 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.950
 Start off Córdoba Córdoba 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.370
 defends alliance with rodrigo cuba 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.370
 insists guti fight alliance connection the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.930
 Take out Cuba The complement came estrada 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.930
 let loose never the middle hit her 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.620
 San Martin 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.620
 the light was made for the audience 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.650
 A) Yes 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.410
 and it will be the unexpected a 2 2 draw 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.450
 we are mentioning that by how 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.210
 it was developing alliance was more 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.100
 close to 0 that san martín the first without 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.500
 But that force that he has put more 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.790
 no football has allowed him to tie the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.710
 good match is what Julius Caesar says 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.030
 alliance for what was being given had 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.940
 the possibility of being closer to 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.160
 third that san martín of the first but 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.250
 I told them then the first goal of the san 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.750
 martín if you do not calm down the people of 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.230
 alliance in the back to have 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.230
 problem 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.220
 of hand and advances to the university san 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.490
 martín already had the balls so that 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.490
 the rest 

00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:15.790
 san martín is the lionfish of huánuco 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:19.840
 san martín 3 álex saliva 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.880
 good here we have to realize what 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.190
 what is the mood of a team 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.620
 a team that was dead a team 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.800
 that even we said is more 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.580
 close alliance one bowl only one goal 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.580
 change absolutely everything and eye alliance 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.040
 It is not the first time that happens because 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.810
 go through these types of situations against 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.420
 trade union if I'm not wrong I was going 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.310
 gaining quietly two men less 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.540
 trade union and flip the match 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.700
 at this time are November 11 logically 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.110
 the two but it's as if alliance has been 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.150
 become the first san martin 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.560
 time and san martín has become 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.320
 of the alliance of the first time and what 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.490
 we said Juan Carlos one thing is 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.490
 get over it with football and something else
