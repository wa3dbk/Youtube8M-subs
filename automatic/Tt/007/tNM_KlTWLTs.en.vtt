00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.899
 Diego 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.769
 how many characters exist in the current landscape of video games 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.469
 that are as incombustible as the mascot logo of nintendo 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.929
 apparently only Mario is able to appear in multiple games a year 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.500
 without appearing repetitive 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.830
 this time the plumber embarks on an adventure with a very retro flavor 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.090
 who got the title of the game Miguel Super Mario Bros. Wiii already speaks for 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.809
 If only 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.829
 we find one of the totally classic ways 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.940
 a genre quite forgotten in this generation where our character will go 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.850
 from the left side of the screen to the goal to the right 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 Overcoming countless obstacles and enemies 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 the story of this game is very simple the princess said it's back to being 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.700
 kidnapped during her birthday 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.129
 but with a special fact 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.670
 since they are the seven sons of gousse 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.860
 those who kidnap the princess at that time is when older is very small 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.329
 stout are sent to the search of the princess for the new worlds of the game 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.360
 as already said before neither a super mario bros wii is a platforms in two 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.360
 dimensions in which you have to move laterally but with important 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.990
 interesting additions 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.850
 to get started 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.570
 You can play with up to four people simultaneously in the same 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.780
 game by making a game more competitive or more cooperative according to 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.370
 the intentions of each player in the blocks where there are objects 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.390
 the same number of these will appear as of players present as well 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.610
 we will have a camera that although I did not change the angle 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.430
 when the characters distance themselves from each other if one of the companions 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.700
 is defeated will reappear screen locked in a bubble and we will 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.740
 touch it to come out of it 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.549
 in the levels they become complex as you progress in the game being 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.500
 the most fun and challenging 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.820
 those in which there is no soil and we are almost surrounded by emptiness have been 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.359
 Built-in original turntables 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.499
 in most of these to take us down different paths or to 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.730
 make things more difficult to the plumbers the enemies are placed 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:24.719
 in a very strategic way and they will give us more of a dislike but they are the 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.159
 adjusted data and the great actions that the 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.109
 more difficult things therefore we do not accept more to our militancy the 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.549
 rivals although we will find many more different enemies because 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.369
 in previous installments 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:42.159
 we can not forget about the objects that helped mario has overcome the 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.399
 levels we will have objects as classic as mushrooms 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:49.579
 the flower of fire or the star but we will also have new objects 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.489
 like the ice flower with which we can freeze our enemies and 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.029
 throw them against others the ico suit 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.639
 but with which we can push up and plan for about 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.650
 moments for the penguin costume 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.410
 with which we can also freeze the enemies but also walk through the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.710
 sky without sliding the colorful gods come back this game and can eat at 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.310
 enemies but also hammers and fireballs may be returned to 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.939
 his attackers 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.099
 players can also make a very high number of actions as 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.610
 catch objects ice blocks barrels or enemies and throw them up by 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.770
 stairs turn on themselves 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.740
 bounce on walls open doors play culetazos and much more all of them 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.560
 they are necessary to get from one piece to the end of the levels 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.090
 The movement detection of the mou is also present in the title of 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.989
 subtle form but with interesting results since with the inclination 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.749
 of the command we could tilt special platforms swing 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:51.279
 bove platforms light reflectors and turn mario to spin around with 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:54.279
 the oki helicopter suit screws platforms 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:58.649
 the difficulty compared to recent delivery is quite greater than 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:02.179
 expected especially at the time of playing several at once since in many 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:06.719
 occasions there is not room for everyone and it requires a lot of coordination jumping 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:08.090
 from platform to platform 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.660
 if we die seven consecutive times by making a level a green block 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.109
 will appear next to us when hitting it will activate the supervía a system of 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.900
 helps that allows us to see how luigi controlled by the console goes 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.529
 slowly complicating level 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:26.299
 hit the blocks with objects and standing at the safest points 

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:30.539
 at every moment we can stop the substitution when we want but we can 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.419
 let them complete the whole 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.750
 including defeating final bosses upon completion of the level with his peculiar we 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:41.020
 will ask if we want to take the level with zeal for ourselves if 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.009
 we take it out the level will be pending to be finished but we can 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.229
 go to the next level and go the rest of the map 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.300
 the supervía do not seem very useful since it is very probable gijón 7 attempts the 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.180
 players already know the complicated points of the level 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.250
 and can complete it without problems 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.160
 also if we find the star brunettes hidden in the tunnels 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.560
 we can buy with them very advanced tracks to show us the output is 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.620
 delayed and some levels or how to catch certain star coins without 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.740
 danger 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.400
 the only bad thing about the title is the lack of an online multiplayer mode 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.900
 if I had expanded the game even more 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.340
 and would have resulted in much more fun and frenetic games style 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.260
 game graphic is made up of three-dimensional characters in environments 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.900
 Two-dimensional with lots of detail and full of colo 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.200
 and in many occasions remembering his predecessor and the super mario bros 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.420
 of bs but also other older ones like super mario bros 3 in super mario 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.260
 world the modeling of q palin in three dimensions is very good and it is appreciated 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.830
 that they have thought after more than ten years 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.720
 without much prominence in a new game of mario in the section of sound 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.360
 we find ourselves with more nostalgia since most of the songs are 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.230
 renewed and better orchestrated versions than those that appeared in June 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.340
 mario bros de nintendo ds attached some composition also renewed 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.230
 music the super mario bros 3 for enemies and bosses 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:10.569
 please 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:11.999
 as you can appreciate 

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:16.659
 ni or super mario bros wii has not been an easy excuse to make a new 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.139
 game of mario el prodi 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.180
 this final is outstanding that has been able to unite 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.360
 interesting news in the gameplay with everything that made memorable deliveries 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.530
 mythical as Super Mario Bros 3 and all that without the overall appearance 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.539
 desentone nothing is also appreciated the return of the sons of consellers as 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:35.699
 final enemies 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:37.210
 and the important rise 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.909
 difficulty that the game has 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:40.710
 nor the super mario bros wii 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.240
 if you can enjoy both if you are a new player or if you are one more 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.410
 experienced 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.639
 and I sing if you do not play individually or with more people in the same game 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.859
 will not disappoint
