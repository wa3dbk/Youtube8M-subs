okay<00:00:01.319> now<00:00:01.500> we're<00:00:01.589> gonna<00:00:01.680> start<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.070> actually

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
okay now we're gonna start to actually

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.610 
okay now we're gonna start to actually
make<00:00:02.460> something<00:00:03.170> the<00:00:04.170> first<00:00:04.350> thing<00:00:04.440> I'm<00:00:04.500> gonna

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
make something the first thing I'm gonna

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.579 
make something the first thing I'm gonna
make<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.759> room<00:00:06.750> itself<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.319> then<00:00:07.410> want<00:00:07.560> to

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
make is the room itself and then want to

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.250 
make is the room itself and then want to
start<00:00:07.799> putting<00:00:08.040> things<00:00:08.189> inside<00:00:08.340> it<00:00:09.110> now<00:00:10.110> there

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
start putting things inside it now there

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.600 
start putting things inside it now there
are<00:00:10.349> multiple<00:00:10.500> ways<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:10.980> doing<00:00:11.099> everything<00:00:11.400> in

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
are multiple ways of doing everything in

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.860 
are multiple ways of doing everything in
Maya<00:00:11.790> I'm<00:00:12.059> gonna<00:00:12.300> show<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.570> lots<00:00:12.750> of

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
Maya I'm gonna show you lots of

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.509 
Maya I'm gonna show you lots of
different<00:00:13.110> ways<00:00:13.200> as<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.590> go<00:00:13.740> through<00:00:14.009> so<00:00:14.309> I

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
different ways as I go through so I

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.519 
different ways as I go through so I
might<00:00:15.299> not<00:00:15.570> necessarily<00:00:15.750> start<00:00:16.260> off<00:00:16.320> doing

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
might not necessarily start off doing

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.260 
might not necessarily start off doing
things<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.980> best<00:00:17.190> or<00:00:17.369> fastest<00:00:17.789> way<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.150> we'll

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
things the best or fastest way but we'll

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.830 
things the best or fastest way but we'll
build<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.930> as<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.010> go<00:00:20.039> through<00:00:20.689> so<00:00:21.689> we

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
build up to that as we go through so we

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.970 
build up to that as we go through so we
need<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> create<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:23.359> cube<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.510> polygon<00:00:24.900> cube<00:00:25.109> so

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
need to create a cube a polygon cube so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.500 
need to create a cube a polygon cube so
the<00:00:26.310> way<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.430> want<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.090> first<00:00:27.359> of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the way I want you to do that first of

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.050 
the way I want you to do that first of
all<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.869> click<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.199> create<00:00:28.500> then<00:00:29.000> make<00:00:30.000> your

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
all is to click on create then make your

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.269 
all is to click on create then make your
way<00:00:30.119> down<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> polygon<00:00:30.750> primatives<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.500> go<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
way down to polygon primatives and go to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.380 
way down to polygon primatives and go to
cube<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.790> reason<00:00:33.000> we're<00:00:33.090> doing<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.270> this

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
cube now the reason we're doing it this

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.700 
cube now the reason we're doing it this
way<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.570> because<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> setting<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.500> need

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
way is because of the setting you need

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.990 
way is because of the setting you need
to<00:00:34.829> change<00:00:35.100> if<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.280> want<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> textures<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to change if you want the textures to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000 
to change if you want the textures to
work<00:00:36.120> later<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.530> click<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> little

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
work later so just click on the little

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.060 
work later so just click on the little
box<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> right<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.940> cube<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.950> is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
box to the right of cube and this is

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
box to the right of cube and this is
quite<00:00:41.280> important<00:00:41.850> make<00:00:42.570> sure<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:43.020> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
quite important make sure that you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.290 
quite important make sure that you
deselect<00:00:43.590> normalize<00:00:44.340> otherwise<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.090> will<00:00:45.149> go

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
deselect normalize otherwise it will go

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.360 
deselect normalize otherwise it will go
mental<00:00:45.750> later<00:00:46.020> that's<00:00:46.860> something<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.250> don't

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
mental later that's something we don't

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.290 
mental later that's something we don't
want<00:00:47.690> okay<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.200> close<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:50.300> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
want okay and then we can close that and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.810 
want okay and then we can close that and
then<00:00:51.420> we're<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> go<00:00:51.780> create<00:00:52.820> polygon

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
then we're going to go create polygon

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.850 
then we're going to go create polygon
primitives<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.510> click<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.809> cube<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.320> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
primitives and just click on cube now it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.279 
primitives and just click on cube now it
says<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.129> drag<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.539> base<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> grid<00:00:58.140> then

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
says here drag the base on the grid then

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.660 
says here drag the base on the grid then
pull<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.680> hat<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.520> if<00:00:59.640> you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
pull up for hat you can do that if you

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.599 
pull up for hat you can do that if you
want<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.590> size<00:01:01.590> specific<00:01:02.250> first<00:01:02.430> time

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
want to get the size specific first time

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.860 
want to get the size specific first time
around<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> make<00:01:03.359> sure<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.690> we're<00:01:03.809> all

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
around but to make sure that we're all

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.890 
around but to make sure that we're all
working<00:01:04.100> with<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.400> same<00:01:05.610> scale<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.720> you

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
working with the same scale I want you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.570 
working with the same scale I want you
just<00:01:06.930> click<00:01:07.320> once<00:01:07.619> at<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> origin<00:01:08.310> which<00:01:08.460> is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
just click once at the origin which is

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.120 
just click once at the origin which is
where<00:01:08.729> these<00:01:08.880> two<00:01:09.090> lines<00:01:09.420> cross<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.920> then

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
where these two lines cross because then

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.820 
where these two lines cross because then
each<00:01:12.090> direction<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> cube<00:01:12.990> will<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.229> one

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
each direction of the cube will be one

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.830 
each direction of the cube will be one
in<00:01:14.070> scale<00:01:14.400> whereas<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.509> make<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
in scale whereas if you make it a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.300 
in scale whereas if you make it a
different<00:01:16.200> shape<00:01:16.409> it'll<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.009> scale<00:01:17.189> as

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
different shape it'll be one in scale as

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.039 
different shape it'll be one in scale as
well<00:01:17.430> but<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> won't<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> right<00:01:18.330> shape<00:01:18.630> so

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
well but it won't be the right shape so

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.390 
well but it won't be the right shape so
we're<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> click<00:01:19.740> once<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.189> your

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
we're just going to click once with your

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.520 
we're just going to click once with your
left<00:01:20.520> mouse<00:01:20.580> button<00:01:20.810> at<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.990> origin<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
left mouse button at the origin and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.820 
left mouse button at the origin and
there<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.070> go<00:01:23.220> you've<00:01:23.880> got<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.420> cube<00:01:25.080> whose

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
there you go you've got a cube whose

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.390 
there you go you've got a cube whose
size<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:27.090> scale<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.500> that's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
size in scale is one one and one that's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.789 
size in scale is one one and one that's
something<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.030> work<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.619> now<00:01:31.619> at<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
something we can work with now at the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.969 
something we can work with now at the
moment<00:01:32.420> it's<00:01:33.420> not<00:01:33.509> dead<00:01:33.900> center<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.590> had<00:01:34.799> my

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
moment it's not dead center I had my

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.399 
moment it's not dead center I had my
best<00:01:35.460> girl<00:01:36.150> putting<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> middle<00:01:36.840> but<00:01:37.380> I

missed and the reason I can tell that is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
missed and the reason I can tell that is
in<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:39.360> translate<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.380> means<00:01:40.590> moving

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
in these translate which means moving

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.950

Maya in their values I can see that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.950 
Maya in their values I can see that
they're<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.290> all<00:01:43.500> exactly<00:01:43.530> zero<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.780> make
