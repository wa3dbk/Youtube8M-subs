00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.830
 hello to all that there otherwise 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.420
 I hope you have good but in all 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.920
 case it's going very well we end up 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.780
 today on gta san to go 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.150
 make the first all-terrain race in 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.740
 truck so you see which one I'm going 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.060
 do I put you the map on purpose to 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.009
 you know who knows because 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.180
 there are several off-road races in 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.289
 truck 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.000
 but before that, we'll have to prepare 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.529
 since there you see that we are on a motorcycle 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.060
 so we 're not ready for that and for 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.880
 an off-road race truck ben i 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.939
 will show you the car or lifted that 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.150
 I recommend it is this one it is 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.460
 the bf injection so eh bah I'm going all 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.430
 just buy it like that we'll have it 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.739
 and we will be able to do the quiet race 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.820
 so that's it it's done once 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.860
 we bought it obviously not going 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.559
 to be able to go immediately to the 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.119
 race we are already going to have to prepare our 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.500
 car is healthy to put all 

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.850
 chances on our side and having 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.879
 really something more 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.190
 performance and more cool then we go all 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.170
 to listen as much as possible 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.540
 enough money like that so we 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.820
 will boost everything we'll even put him a 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.189
 bullet protection of tires by 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.320
 balls it does not really serve a big 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.120
 thing to be honest but hey we're going 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.260
 do it anyway 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.130
 so that's the only thing on which 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.590
 I'll do a little bit of attention 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.420
 well when it's pink it's not so bad 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.880
 this car but I'm still doing the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.040
 put in mode I have not I'm going to 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.410
 put in kind of fashion sun mode 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.950
 was and suddenly I'm going to put some 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.470
 colors 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.340
 I do not flash colors of orange 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.810
 and yellow 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.760
 I find it pretty cool there to ride 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.980
 on the beach I will see me well so 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.860
 here is the umih its colors there we continue 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.490
 from cost to well has improved all the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.210
 points of the car the horn does not serve 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.520
 not much 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.070
 but otherwise we will put everything else on 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.479
 will also put the smoke of tires that 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.979
 will change it's going to be pretty cool to have 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.770
 yellow smoke for cars 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.600
 yellow and orange and so now 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.479
 that our car is ready we are going 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.450
 can actually get into the game 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.920
 and to make them race together and 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.540
 magic of live we find ourselves 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.970
 directly on the race 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.080
 it's really well done and suddenly we 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.250
 start the race 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.350
 so here I tell you right away what 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.270
 that I advise you to do 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.410
 see that it starts badly enough for me 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.810
 what I you 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.300
 advise to do is not to go 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.760
 too fast because because you 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.950
 brake badly on this kind of track 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.600
 and when you make an exit from 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.380
 road on this kind of track and well you 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.970
 will be well in galley after 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.840
 so I just advise you do not 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.700
 take too much speed 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.620
 knowing that you can take 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.570
 a lot of speed with this car 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.100
 there quickly enough especially 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.480
 after taking him to los santos 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.160
 custom may but is low once 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.840
 you're going to be here in there you go 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.640
 have a hard time once you 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.260
 will have a lot of speed to slow down 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.640
 especially on this kind of track 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.980
 especially when the bend is very close 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.450
 and especially when you really need to 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.220
 slow down a lot a lot a lot 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.140
 because sometimes you have to slow down 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.100
 a lot and it's not necessarily 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.360
 So listen so obvious is what is 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.080
 all there is to say about there 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.580
 above 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.940
 after that you see that the race is 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.050
 did more or less well there we spent the 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.220
 door we were lucky that we are 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.460
 told because we were a little bit 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.590
 far 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.000
 sometimes he does not necessarily tell you 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.960
 that you do that and suddenly you are 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.610
 a little bit of a hassle 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.470
 and then finally and well listen and we 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.810
 finish the race very well we are 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.000
 first so that's also a lot of 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.260
 all we won gold is normally we 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.660
 has made money so that's enough 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.550
 cool too 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.170
 we finished this race there 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.100
 I will tell you I can that you 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.150
 advise to listen to go in 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.500
