hooping<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:14.179> you<00:00:15.179> need<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.450> make<00:00:15.570> sure

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
hooping is that you need to make sure

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.390 
hooping is that you need to make sure
that<00:00:15.900> there's<00:00:16.109> like<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> small<00:00:16.619> enough<00:00:17.070> space

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
that there's like a small enough space

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.630 
that there's like a small enough space
for<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.330> hoop<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.859> go<00:00:19.859> around<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.490> know

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
for the hoop to go around so you know

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.410 
for the hoop to go around so you know
when<00:00:20.850> you're<00:00:22.670> you<00:00:23.670> know<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:23.910> example<00:00:24.000> when

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
when you're you know for example when

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.570 
when you're you know for example when
you're<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.660> body<00:00:24.900> whooping<00:00:25.350> whooping<00:00:26.099> around

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you're on body whooping whooping around

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.169 
you're on body whooping whooping around
your<00:00:26.789> shoulders<00:00:27.740> is<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> lot<00:00:29.340> different<00:00:29.550> hoop

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
your shoulders is a lot different hoop

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.049 
your shoulders is a lot different hoop
goes<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.539> bit<00:00:30.720> slower<00:00:31.520> than<00:00:32.520> when<00:00:32.969> you

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
goes a little bit slower than when you

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.299 
goes a little bit slower than when you
hoop<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.480> your<00:00:33.630> knees<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.160> I'm

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
hoop on your knees and it's like I'm

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.830 
hoop on your knees and it's like I'm
going<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.520> smaller<00:00:35.790> diameter<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.510> hoop<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
going a smaller diameter for the hoop to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.229 
going a smaller diameter for the hoop to
go<00:00:36.960> around<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.620> goes<00:00:37.770> faster<00:00:38.250> um<00:00:39.800> so<00:00:41.000> when<00:00:42.000> your

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
go around it goes faster um so when your

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.340 
go around it goes faster um so when your
butt<00:00:42.780> whooping

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
butt whooping

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.680 
butt whooping
so<00:00:44.309> you're<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.789> bent<00:00:45.059> over<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.450> this

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so you're like bent over like this

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.110 
so you're like bent over like this
there's<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.320> huge<00:00:46.739> space<00:00:47.190> between<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.820> knees

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
there's a huge space between your knees

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.319 
there's a huge space between your knees
and<00:00:48.510> your<00:00:49.110> torso<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> hoop<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.149> just

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and your torso and so the hoop is just

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.299 
and your torso and so the hoop is just
going<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.230> much<00:00:52.649> room<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> move

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
going to not have that much room to move

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.040 
going to not have that much room to move
so<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.910> want<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> kind<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.300> make<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.780> space

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
so you want to kind of make that space

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.750 
so you want to kind of make that space
smaller<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:55.980> easier<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> hoop<00:00:56.730> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
smaller so it's easier for the hoop to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.790 
smaller so it's easier for the hoop to
go<00:00:56.940> around<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.989> trick<00:00:59.809> trick<00:01:00.809> number<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.260> is

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
go around so trick trick number one is

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.100 
go around so trick trick number one is
to<00:01:02.190> bend<00:01:02.579> over<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> your<00:01:03.539> stomach<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
to bend over so that your stomach is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.580 
to bend over so that your stomach is
kind<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.470> touching<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:06.110> top<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.260> your<00:01:07.380> thighs

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
kind of touching your top to your thighs

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.800 
kind of touching your top to your thighs
here<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.549> your<00:01:08.700> I'm<00:01:09.000> kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> creating<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
here and your I'm kind of creating a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.249 
here and your I'm kind of creating a
shelf<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.590> bag<00:01:10.880> hold<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:13.250> then<00:01:15.259> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
shelf with my bag hold it and then the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.580 
shelf with my bag hold it and then the
second<00:01:16.680> tip<00:01:16.860> would<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.810> some<00:01:18.810> people<00:01:19.110> do

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
second tip would be to some people do

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.020 
second tip would be to some people do
this<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> some<00:01:20.100> people<00:01:20.130> don't<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.820> had<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
this and some people don't but I had a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.770 
this and some people don't but I had a
lot<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.270> luck<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:23.270> charged<00:01:24.270> similar<00:01:24.630> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
lot of luck when I charged similar to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
lot of luck when I charged similar to
when<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:25.020> knee<00:01:25.170> who<00:01:25.380> think<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.100> push

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
when your knee who think you know push

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.450 
when your knee who think you know push
your<00:01:26.670> leg<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> pusher<00:01:28.049> hip

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
your leg to have like a pusher hip

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.890 
your leg to have like a pusher hip
project<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:31.100> when<00:01:32.100> I'm<00:01:32.329> starting<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.570> off<00:01:33.689> I

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
project so when I'm starting it off I

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.249 
project so when I'm starting it off I
start<00:01:34.200> low<00:01:34.530> sales<00:01:34.829> bend<00:01:35.700> over<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
start low sales bend over I have the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.520 
start low sales bend over I have the
hoop<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.680> my<00:01:37.860> lower<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.610> I've<00:01:39.540> lifted<00:01:40.079> my

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
hoop on my lower back and I've lifted my

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.350 
hoop on my lower back and I've lifted my
right<00:01:40.799> leg<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.740> I'm<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:44.610> are<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.270> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
right leg so what I'm going are kind of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.830 
right leg so what I'm going are kind of
tend<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.810> use<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:47.460> hip<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.540> push<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
tend to use that hip to kind of push a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.719 
tend to use that hip to kind of push a
little<00:01:49.170> bit<00:01:49.350> more<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.979> some<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.460> might

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
little bit more so some of you might

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.530 
little bit more so some of you might
just<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.840> better<00:01:52.049> off<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.820> some<00:01:54.420> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
just be better off like this but some of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.950 
just be better off like this but some of
you<00:01:54.659> might<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.380> one<00:01:56.009> side<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.549> well<00:01:56.960> um

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
you might like the one side as well um

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.350 
you might like the one side as well um
okay<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:58.920> number<00:01:59.310> three<00:02:00.060> would<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:02.240> when<00:02:03.240> you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
okay so number three would be when you

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.880 
okay so number three would be when you
start<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:05.250> hoop<00:02:05.520> um<00:02:05.930> I'm<00:02:06.930> kind<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.649> just

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
start the hoop um I'm kind of it's just

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.600 
start the hoop um I'm kind of it's just
it's<00:02:08.310> Fermi's<00:02:08.910> really<00:02:09.209> similar<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.629> vertical

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
it's Fermi's really similar to vertical

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.960 
it's Fermi's really similar to vertical
um<00:02:11.610> shoulder<00:02:12.090> hooping<00:02:12.390> where<00:02:12.750> your

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
um shoulder hooping where your

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.120 
um shoulder hooping where your
kind<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.420> bouncing<00:02:14.050> like<00:02:14.200> this<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:14.950> I'm<00:02:15.040> going

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
kind of bouncing like this so I'm going

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.620 
kind of bouncing like this so I'm going
to<00:02:15.250> be<00:02:15.310> bouncing<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:21.180> trying<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.270> keep<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
to be bouncing and trying to keep the

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.780 
to be bouncing and trying to keep the
hoop<00:02:22.840> from<00:02:23.140> either<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.860> think<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.310> most<00:02:24.490> common

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
hoop from either I think the most common

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.030 
hoop from either I think the most common
problem<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.780> will<00:02:26.440> either<00:02:26.590> come<00:02:26.830> up

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
problem is that it will either come up

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.480 
problem is that it will either come up
too<00:02:27.400> far<00:02:27.910> when<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.810> start<00:02:29.410> moving<00:02:29.650> further

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
too far when you start moving further

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.240 
too far when you start moving further
away<00:02:30.700> from<00:02:30.850> your<00:02:31.150> leg<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:32.080> hoop<00:02:32.320> it's<00:02:33.070> like

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
away from your leg the hoop it's like

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.400 
away from your leg the hoop it's like
this<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:33.760> then<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:33.970> shoots<00:02:34.270> off<00:02:34.480> because<00:02:34.840> you

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
this and then it shoots off because you

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.950 
this and then it shoots off because you
can't<00:02:35.620> keep<00:02:35.770> going<00:02:36.100> around<00:02:36.190> or<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.420> just

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
can't keep going around or it just

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.690 
can't keep going around or it just
worked<00:02:38.200> its<00:02:38.380> way<00:02:38.530> off<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.040> just<00:02:39.130> like<00:02:39.310> slides

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
worked its way off and just like slides

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.480 
worked its way off and just like slides
off<00:02:39.940> here<00:02:40.180> but<00:02:40.390> so<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:42.010> kind<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.310> get

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
off here but so you have to kind of get

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.750 
off here but so you have to kind of get
that<00:02:43.050> sweet<00:02:44.050> spot<00:02:44.440> between<00:02:45.070> where<00:02:45.580> there's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
that sweet spot between where there's

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.850 
that sweet spot between where there's
too<00:02:46.090> much<00:02:46.270> distance<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:47.080> then<00:02:47.230> towards<00:02:47.709> like

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
too much distance and then towards like

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.770 
too much distance and then towards like
flowing<00:02:48.160> off<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.490> you<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.420> see<00:02:52.630> that

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
flowing off of you and so you see that

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.600 
flowing off of you and so you see that
I'm<00:02:52.990> not<00:02:53.020> only<00:02:55.380> just<00:02:56.380> I'm<00:02:56.590> not<00:02:56.620> just<00:02:57.070> moving<00:02:57.310> my

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
I'm not only just I'm not just moving my

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.340 
I'm not only just I'm not just moving my
butt<00:02:57.880> I'm<00:02:58.060> moving<00:02:58.390> her<00:02:58.540> like<00:02:58.720> my<00:02:58.840> whole<00:02:59.080> body

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
butt I'm moving her like my whole body

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.620 
butt I'm moving her like my whole body
I'm<00:02:59.530> bouncing<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:01.030> other<00:03:01.150> thing<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.420> keep<00:03:01.510> in

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
I'm bouncing the other thing to keep in

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.080 
I'm bouncing the other thing to keep in
mind<00:03:01.690> too<00:03:02.050> is<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.260> size<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.620> your<00:03:02.680> hoop

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
mind too is the size of your hoop

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.070 
mind too is the size of your hoop
because<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.330> don't<00:03:04.510> want<00:03:04.630> it<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.810> hit<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
because you don't want it to hit the

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.710 
because you don't want it to hit the
ground<00:03:05.380> when<00:03:05.740> you're<00:03:05.890> bent<00:03:06.070> over<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:07.480> is

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
ground when you're bent over this is

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.250 
ground when you're bent over this is
like<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> 30<00:03:08.860> inch<00:03:09.100> hoop<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.490> I'm<00:03:09.610> using<00:03:10.260> if

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
like a 30 inch hoop that I'm using if

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.570 
like a 30 inch hoop that I'm using if
you're<00:03:11.380> taller<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:12.010> can<00:03:12.160> get<00:03:12.250> away<00:03:12.370> with

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
you're taller you can get away with

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.490 
you're taller you can get away with
using<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.970> bigger<00:03:13.300> hoop<00:03:13.570> which<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.260> lot

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
using a bigger hoop which is a lot

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.030 
using a bigger hoop which is a lot
easier<00:03:14.530> in<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.160> long<00:03:15.310> run<00:03:16.470> but<00:03:17.470> until<00:03:17.800> then

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
easier in the long run but until then

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.070 
easier in the long run but until then
you<00:03:18.250> can<00:03:18.370> also<00:03:18.580> practice<00:03:19.030> by<00:03:19.510> like<00:03:19.720> sitting<00:03:20.019> on

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
you can also practice by like sitting on

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.460 
you can also practice by like sitting on
standing<00:03:20.830> on<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.130> chair<00:03:21.459> or<00:03:21.790> like<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.060> ledge

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
standing on like a chair or like a ledge

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.770 
standing on like a chair or like a ledge
or<00:03:23.470> couch<00:03:23.709> or<00:03:24.100> something<00:03:24.310> so<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.630> can

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
or couch or something so that you can

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.600 
or couch or something so that you can
use<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.019> bigger<00:03:26.350> hoop<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.890> get<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.070> feel<00:03:27.280> for<00:03:27.310> it

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
use a bigger hoop to get a feel for it

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.040 
use a bigger hoop to get a feel for it
and<00:03:27.820> it<00:03:27.880> won't<00:03:28.000> hit<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.450> ground<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.690> start

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
and it won't hit the ground so to start

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.490 
and it won't hit the ground so to start
it<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:33.120> am<00:03:35.820> just<00:03:36.820> going<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.390> take<00:03:38.019> it<00:03:38.050> my<00:03:38.260> right

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
it I am just going to take it my right

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.390 
it I am just going to take it my right
hand<00:03:39.000> place<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.209> on<00:03:40.300> my<00:03:40.420> lower<00:03:40.690> back<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.530> give

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
hand place it on my lower back and give

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:56.310 
hand place it on my lower back and give
a<00:03:42.430> little<00:03:42.640> push<00:03:43.030> up<00:03:43.799> towards<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.920> left

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.710 

and<00:03:57.370> don't<00:03:58.370> get<00:03:58.430> discouraged<00:03:59.030> for<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.480> really

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
and don't get discouraged for a really

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.210 
and don't get discouraged for a really
long<00:03:59.840> time<00:04:00.110> life<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.530> only<00:04:00.680> able<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:00.950> be<00:04:01.040> like

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
long time life is only able to be like

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.530 
long time life is only able to be like
one<00:04:01.370> or<00:04:01.460> two<00:04:01.490> rotations<00:04:02.060> for<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.300> food<00:04:02.450> would

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
one or two rotations for the food would

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.500 
one or two rotations for the food would
go<00:04:02.660> flying<00:04:02.960> off<00:04:03.230> but<00:04:04.220> eventually<00:04:05.150> something

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
go flying off but eventually something

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.000 
go flying off but eventually something
will<00:04:05.660> click<00:04:05.960> and<00:04:06.290> then<00:04:06.410> you'll<00:04:06.590> be<00:04:06.740> able<00:04:06.800> to

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
will click and then you'll be able to

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.250 
will click and then you'll be able to
kind<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.220> do<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.430> for<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:08.240> little<00:04:08.540> bit<00:04:08.630> longer<00:04:08.870> so

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
kind of do it for a little bit longer so

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.110 
kind of do it for a little bit longer so
show<00:04:10.190> your<00:04:10.310> eyes<00:04:10.400> from<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.910> other<00:04:11.300> side<00:04:13.120> the

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
show your eyes from the other side the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.820 
show your eyes from the other side the
main<00:04:14.330> thing<00:04:14.630> I<00:04:14.750> think<00:04:15.020> is<00:04:15.230> making<00:04:15.440> sure<00:04:15.800> that

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
main thing I think is making sure that

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.610 
main thing I think is making sure that
you<00:04:16.070> bend<00:04:16.640> over<00:04:16.820> enough<00:04:17.390> so<00:04:18.350> there's<00:04:18.560> a

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
you bend over enough so there's a

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.410 
you bend over enough so there's a
smaller<00:04:18.950> space<00:04:19.400> so<00:04:19.640> I<00:04:19.700> think<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.880> lot<00:04:20.030> of<00:04:20.150> people

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
smaller space so I think a lot of people

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.110 
smaller space so I think a lot of people
try<00:04:20.930> to<00:04:20.989> go<00:04:21.230> like<00:04:21.410> this<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:22.550> then<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.940> like

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
try to go like this and then it like
