this is the PKI snore honor we did a lot

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.130 
this is the PKI snore honor we did a lot
of<00:00:35.860> moving<00:00:36.010> today<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:37.030> Marauder<00:00:37.360> does<00:00:37.989> the

of moving today the Marauder does the
job<00:00:38.379> and<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:42.610> lot<00:00:42.850> of<00:00:42.879> drilling<00:00:45.449> sampling<00:00:46.449> the

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
job and a lot of drilling sampling the

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.790 
job and a lot of drilling sampling the
bite<00:00:46.750> at<00:00:46.989> different<00:00:47.500> depths

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.930 

all<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.070> drilling<00:00:55.309> was<00:00:55.489> worth<00:00:55.699> it<00:00:55.850> because

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
all the drilling was worth it because

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.579 
all the drilling was worth it because
look<00:00:56.269> what<00:00:56.390> happened<00:00:56.719> next

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.960 

the<00:01:03.589> flight<00:01:03.859> was<00:01:04.040> steady<00:01:04.369> maybe<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.759> fish

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
the flight was steady maybe the fish

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.490 
the flight was steady maybe the fish
caught<00:01:05.239> were<00:01:05.449> a<00:01:05.509> nice<00:01:05.810> size<00:01:06.140> I<00:01:08.409> don't<00:01:09.409> know

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
caught were a nice size I don't know

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.800 
caught were a nice size I don't know
about<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:09.979> but<00:01:10.220> I<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.520> admit<00:01:10.729> I<00:01:11.149> had<00:01:11.570> fun

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
about you but I have to admit I had fun

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.810 
about you but I have to admit I had fun
watching<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:12.380> walleye<00:01:12.710> extravaganza

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.230 

I<00:01:19.290> mean<00:01:20.290> it<00:01:20.470> was<00:01:20.650> steady<00:01:21.040> action<00:01:21.550> for<00:01:21.760> a<00:01:21.790> couple

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
I mean it was steady action for a couple

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.270 
I mean it was steady action for a couple
of<00:01:22.270> hours<00:01:25.890> unfortunately<00:01:26.890> I<00:01:26.920> lost<00:01:27.040> some

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
of hours unfortunately I lost some

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.380 
of hours unfortunately I lost some
footage<00:01:27.460> because<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.910> heads<00:01:28.120> on<00:01:28.300> my

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
footage because the heads on my

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.719 
footage because the heads on my
camcorder<00:01:28.660> were<00:01:29.050> dirty<00:01:29.370> didn't<00:01:30.370> see<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.610> until

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
camcorder were dirty didn't see it until

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.140 
camcorder were dirty didn't see it until
later<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:33.040> that<00:01:33.100> certainly<00:01:33.520> didn't<00:01:33.940> stop<00:01:34.119> us

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
later but that certainly didn't stop us

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
later but that certainly didn't stop us
from<00:01:34.450> getting<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.810> good<00:01:35.020> amount<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.320> footage<00:01:35.650> I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.749 

have<00:01:47.170> never<00:01:47.380> seen<00:01:47.650> anyone<00:01:48.009> work<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.369> ice<00:01:48.520> like

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
have never seen anyone work the ice like

00:01:48.759 --> 00:02:03.540 
have never seen anyone work the ice like
this<00:01:48.790> and<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.479> was<00:01:49.660> a<00:01:49.690> treat<00:01:56.820> that<00:02:02.220> was<00:02:03.220> on<00:02:03.369> top

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
this and it was a treat that was on top

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.520 
this and it was a treat that was on top
of<00:02:03.729> every<00:02:03.940> detail<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.390> obviously<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.289> paid

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
of every detail and obviously it paid

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:18.229 
of every detail and obviously it paid
off

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.270 

yes<00:02:19.239> these<00:02:19.450> lures<00:02:19.750> do<00:02:20.050> kick<00:02:20.290> butt<00:02:20.530> but<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.159> was

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
yes these lures do kick butt but it was

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.130 
yes these lures do kick butt but it was
his<00:02:21.400> persistence<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.239> finding<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.810> feeding

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
his persistence in finding the feeding

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.320 
his persistence in finding the feeding
fish<00:02:23.319> that<00:02:23.560> impressed<00:02:23.920> me<00:02:24.129> the<00:02:24.250> most<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:25.180> then

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
fish that impressed me the most and then

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.500 
fish that impressed me the most and then
I've<00:02:25.420> seen<00:02:25.629> these<00:02:25.810> lures<00:02:26.049> work<00:02:26.290> before<00:02:30.510> what

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
I've seen these lures work before what

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.880 
I've seen these lures work before what
was<00:02:31.659> something<00:02:32.049> the<00:02:32.140> witness<00:02:32.500> was<00:02:32.739> his

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
was something the witness was his

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.089 
was something the witness was his
methodology<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.760> see<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:35.500> he<00:02:35.650> didn't<00:02:35.980> get<00:02:36.040> a

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
methodology and I see if he didn't get a

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.589 
methodology and I see if he didn't get a
bite<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.610> five<00:02:36.819> minutes<00:02:37.180> he<00:02:37.299> was<00:02:37.330> moving

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
bite in five minutes he was moving

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:45.290 
bite in five minutes he was moving
looking<00:02:37.870> for<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.290> feeding<00:02:38.620> fish

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.790 

that<00:02:46.300> was<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.420> bit<00:02:46.660> skeptical<00:02:47.230> at<00:02:47.260> first<00:02:47.320> but

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
that was a bit skeptical at first but

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.040 
that was a bit skeptical at first but
once<00:02:48.010> he<00:02:48.100> found<00:02:48.280> him<00:02:48.550> let's<00:02:49.240> just<00:02:49.330> say<00:02:49.630> he<00:02:49.900> made

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
once he found him let's just say he made

00:02:50.050 --> 00:03:11.450 
once he found him let's just say he made
a<00:02:50.080> believer<00:02:50.320> out<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.620> me

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.680 

then<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.580> lures<00:03:12.790> just<00:03:13.240> did<00:03:13.420> their<00:03:13.600> magic

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
then the lures just did their magic

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.120 
then the lures just did their magic
these<00:03:16.690> lures<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.110> great<00:03:17.290> swimmers<00:03:17.740> did<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.920> lot

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130
