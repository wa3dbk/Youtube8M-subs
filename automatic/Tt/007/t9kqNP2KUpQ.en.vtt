00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
as well so it does seem plausible and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.410 
as well so it does seem plausible and
very<00:02:34.709> viable<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.550> could<00:02:35.790> be<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> heist

location in grand theft auto 5 it'd be a

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.160 
location in grand theft auto 5 it'd be a
very<00:02:39.030> cool<00:02:39.209> heist<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:40.020> your

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
very cool heist it's not your

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.920 
very cool heist it's not your
stereotypical<00:02:41.160> bank<00:02:41.970> robbing<00:02:42.330> heist<00:02:42.540> or<00:02:42.780> you

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
robbing a bank but this one's even

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.420 
robbing a bank but this one's even
better<00:02:48.209> because<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.110> yacht<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.680> am<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.190> genie
