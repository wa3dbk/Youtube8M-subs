 we are a company specializing in the right of motions and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.359
 It vibrates stripping too much pressure for more than 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.509
 we intervene have particularly on the Paris region in the 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.619
 collectors for just over three years 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.320
 we have treated to date about thirty thousand square meters the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.619
 principle of surface preparation by hydro demolition involves 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.290
 demolish the surface of the concrete superficially to create a certain 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.530
 hanging for the repair of shotcrete 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.520
 the principle of this technique are volumetric pumps coupled to a 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.940
 thermal engine that 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.980
 there is in the pressurized water up to 3000 bar 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.180
 if they are manual operations and each aaa operator to sanaa one of 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.070
 pistol and a pressure lance 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.680
 and performs hydrodemolition work just like at a 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.440
 same principle as an expensive quarter 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.160
 she did destructuring the concrete to create the scene hanging surface 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.130
 for the projected concrete frauds this motionless anathema very easy to 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.610
 move signed debut more and no less than a machine on for dead 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.730
 making about 3 tons pulled by a 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.000
 a light vehicle little okami in masters a team of two people 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.960
 she said that the man on the surface who is the head of equipped 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.370
 and the operator launched killer on the underside that manages the work of 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.590
 demolition proper with alternating every two hours 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.550
 for rest times and operator safety once 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.770
 evolution is up the yields make belga 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.450
 but we had 50% yields in 50 days 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.850
 there with time the evolution between the sinkers 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.620
 the traditional chiefs his tour in the east 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.130
 more or less complex 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.090
 the demolition book page a technical comparison 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.850
 the traditional for this type of surface preparation 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.290
 is that it allows the via rotations by the operators not if he has 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.290
 still a decline and percent and the road-related projections bias 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.460
 withdrawal by dubai time aude% and it still allows to minimize 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.899
 the impact on the health of each operator 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.779
 and optimize a little bit 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.779
 so much effort 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.819
 compare it to what is said 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.819
 realized with pecqueur markdowns 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.879
 so there is no help from the streets of the repercussions of the unrest 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.229
 musculoskeletal on the work in the network two teams are from 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.720

 tommy hilfiger jackhammer 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.109
 so that's the important father 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.109
 8% 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.559
 to avoid repetitive work that causes forgetfulness disorders 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.189
 musculoskeletal tms that are scared by the table does in 55 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:52.169
 so there is the constraint is to do the demolition but it is very 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.739
 important to be finished 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.859
 work 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.129

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.009
 all day 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.849
 there are delays farming 2% and internet teams and even that 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.109
 within the same team that people can alternate tasks 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.159
 it's very important because we do not realize that right away and if 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.329
 we do not make a tag, we do not have much time to do the demolition 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.629
 the jackhammer 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.400

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.279
 unrest 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:26.499
 at the traffic level we have photos or tingling cramps 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:30.369
 and this is the first signed last of a complement but after that can 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.219
 induce irreversible tendon disorders at the level of the 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.219
 decisions and that we realize later 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.329
 but
