00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.800
 hi girls how are you waiting 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.440
 you are very good to me they are going to do 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.410
 these videos because they fill us all 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.770
 of expectations what today's video is about 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.770
 a raffle loves to put these voices 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.000
 I love I promised you in my last 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.730
 draw I promised you I did not tell you that 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.010
 I was thinking about this year will be every 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.140
 two months a draw and then of this 7 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.699
 is the draw that I have already this year 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.620
 I tell you that if you did not go it's the 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.239
 fortunate in the past draw can be 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.040
 that maybe those who do this and that 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.869
 if you are not the lucky one in this draw 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.880
 it may be that it is done in the next so 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.280
 that you do not give up below because you can 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.740
 say that you have neither in the next one so 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.229
 how good they see you signal I will not talk 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.660
 much more the beneficiaries of gifts 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.369
 and I hope very much that you like it and 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.710
 lots of luck to all 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.710
 I forgot to tell you that the draw 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.640
 starts today and ends on day 3 of 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.869
 September 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.380
 and well I'll start at the most 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.500
 little one in this blog here that is 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.720
 like a very pretty pink is from h &amp; m that 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.750
 I entered the draw I will also give away 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.700
 this little mirror is cute, it's like 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.250
 It has floral pattern I wanted it 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.979
 for me then what do I invite you from 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.659
 put something like that in reality are 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.680
 cool things 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.150
 he opens 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.220
 and look 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.140
 mirror up and mirror down to the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.270
 winner will love you I told you that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.430
 this brochita was so that this 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.060
 sponge was to wash the face and 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.970
 lie is to wash brushes so 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.240
 I will tell you one like this that I have 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.760
 and so I hope you like it and it's like 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.730
 Once you get a sponge which to catch so 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.690
 with your hand and then with your brush 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.880
 imaginary is that this is a brush and 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.380
 then you put a little ham what 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.959
 that whatever is coming is from 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.610
 our house and how clean is that you go to 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.620
 say that I'm stupid but I was 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.250
 clean on the face with this one was 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.730
 sponge but good the next one is 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.950
 this blog that also this one h &amp; m 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.900
 which is a color so it's pretty much 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.000
 I think it looks good with all the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.220
 skin tones was not going to catch very 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.430
 pink because it may be that the person is 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.980
 Very white or very brunette and this 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.410
 is the most special thing you are to put in 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.239
 the nail is that I do not know what it's called but 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.330
 I'm going to bring it closer and you'll see it 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.810
 super good here are little things to put 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.180
 in the girls nail and here comes a lime and 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.540
 two I think they pay me glue 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.239
 also and comes two chopsticks that is that 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.310
 I said well this I have to put in the 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.010

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.420
 like and good is a normal little notebook and 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.530

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.140
 die having bought in workshop 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.690

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.190
 that all the colors come, it's worth a 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.310
 Shadows game 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.160

 you're going to love the first ones I'm going to 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.169
 explain the rules of the draw that is 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.330
 time would not be very demanding is the 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.430
 first rule to subscribe to the channel 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.580

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.770

 Social that is Facebook and Instagram 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.120
 if you want also twitter because 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.430

 winning new do not revenge me sports for 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.760
 another video question also here was born 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.590
 the winner does not follow me in my networks 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.940
 you will know that the winner was born 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.750
 because they always published there the 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.480
 winner 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.520
 but the third rule is I'm going to leave 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.220
 here below two links of two videos of mine 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.440
 you just have to go to the two videos and 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.740
 comments appeared and the winner what 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.660
 does I go to see if he's commenting 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.110
 in this video and in addition to winning this 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.680
 draw 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.100

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.160

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.200

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.680

 someone who may like you so 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.370
 I hope all of your others do 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.410
 because it would be a pity if the person who 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.720
 I won it because I did not do it 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.940
 followed these two steps to comment and 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.040
 comment on the two videos that I told you 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.990
 you only have to comment on what has 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.450

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.169

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.189
 Well, you two, and yes, because 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.900
 surely you will ask the winner 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:23.029
 just comment a video can lead to 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.270
 in addition to taking the draw will take 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:28.069

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.080
 winner just tell me in this video 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:32.360
 because the winner will only take what 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.490
 that is drawn, I hope that you 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.229

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.419
