00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.310
 the milton cruz the fan of são paulo 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.160
 Have a reason, you worried, good night. 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.340
 today to the fore 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.920
 I think I do not think so because the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.980
 staff worked hard on this 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.109
 period there in the parana worked hard 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.300
 I think we in those two games 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.019
 against Awaí mainly against the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.289
 victory the team is resentful a little 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.869
 pacing the ball time so I guess 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.669
 that the kind people who take care of a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.380
 little because in this semifinal of 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.260
 liberators, then the people are more 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.079
 that the head turned on in this game of 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.450
 liberators and more we had to 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.020
 do two great games there that's for 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.289
 also gives a lively crowd and the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.770
 players fills to porto alegre 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:55.199
 confident to do a good result there but 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.020
 God damn it, on Wednesday before the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.059
 advice packing captain danilo 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.690
 felipe is different 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.930
 It's a pleasure once again with this bread 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.340
 I particularly some time right in 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.979
 contact with wen in suspension and he 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.570
 started the training on Friday 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.380
 but it's a guy who has identification with 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.030
 the club is not 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.299
 I think the palm trees are needing 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.970
 And we wait for you one more time. 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.909
 a little patience that is a bit 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.350
 difficult at the palm trees we expected 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.540
 with his arrival we have a little 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.090
 of tranquility for him to be 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.890
 I was able to fit the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.619
 the impression you give is that you 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.630
 trained a lot if short ball touch and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.390
 fast is not easy to do controls 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.100
 speed but that was in our 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.590
 pre-season what happened there 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.530
 season is we always was 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.659
 trying to make those games is not what 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.390
 they play the games and it's always there 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.759
 approaching mano is always doing these 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.579
 pre-season games to bring the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.070
 time to go out with a quick guess 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.159
 that is working and there is no 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.770
 specific center is this 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.580
 we lose a little, but it's him 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.849
 You're always asking, was it for pro? 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.700
 who is playing it is a fall from the side 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.430
 another is centralized to ensure the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.519
 So I think it 's working. 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.530
 I think this is not stopping playing 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.720
 with two of speed how is it 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.860
 this expectation of working alongside the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.690
 ronaldo with the next football 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.370
 presenting your football can grow 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.349
 more and you start to feel 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.910
 possibility of ronaldo is that ronaldo 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.799
 inside the park are Jorge must 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.209
 back to playing big time I believe 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.640
 that this will happen still play in a 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.849
 level of average to good I think 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.709
 I also agree with you, if 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.599
 dedicating much 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.019
 we realize that he wants to come back 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.180
 to play wants to help corinthians 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.459
 so I guess the expectation is great right? 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:02.010
 I think ronaldo but it's the people there 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.780
 so I think the bigger faster 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.450
 he come back to help the staff 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.090
 corinthians will help us too 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.670
 Jose appeared José appeared was time 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.069
 to record I see this cute little animal 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.299
 This kid is fancy in how much 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:24.660
 time little work is 94 years old 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:26.940
 lives a kit facing the father of 51 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.620
 But a little boy comes, let's start with 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.260
 a good one so that the first presence today 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.090
 here we have here all the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.579
 Brazilian championship teams 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.840
 I'll ask for chiquinho to see which team 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:52.280
 He thinks he's going to be the champion. 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:53.579
 Brazilian come game that gave 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:00.060
 die 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:02.489
 the throwing athlete already retired Jose 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.000
 appeared in the victory of são paulo 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.410
 Saints win in draw is good to see 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.400
 that little kid goes to Sunday people 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.400
 thinks this is a historic moment 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.230
 I think now the bug will catch and I know 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.090
 what he played 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:29.030
 it's time it was drums 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.870
 the milton cross predicts increase without glasses 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:45.770
 I'll find that I do not know and 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:47.510
 This leaves me here to connect a business. 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.410
 of the liberators are two only to whom 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.750
 will sort 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.790
 It's not a game, that's what we're going to have to 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.070
 send bullet who practices são paulo or 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:03.950
 inter porto Alegre returned better than 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:09.410
 nobody is there, there's the show, little boy 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:18.970
 Let's see if the kid is hitting a 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:18.970
 great success
