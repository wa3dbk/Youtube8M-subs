in Taiwan and there's the i guess the
UPC<00:03:01.660> coating<00:03:02.200> for<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:04.360> let's<00:03:04.630> open<00:03:04.989> this

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
UPC coating for that and let's open this

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.360 
UPC coating for that and let's open this
up<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.940> see<00:03:06.940> what<00:03:07.090> this<00:03:07.120> is<00:03:07.269> all<00:03:07.510> about<00:03:07.569> I<00:03:11.370> was

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
up and see what this is all about I was

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:22.190 
up and see what this is all about I was
very<00:03:12.940> easy<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.359> open<00:03:17.700> takes<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:19.980> standard

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
very easy to open takes the standard

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:36.590 
very easy to open takes the standard
4-pin<00:03:23.200> molex<00:03:23.560> which<00:03:24.280> only<00:03:24.459> uses<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.150> two<00:03:25.329> pins

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.400 

jumps<00:03:37.600> with<00:03:38.639> two<00:03:39.639> screws<00:03:41.190> with<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.250> hard<00:03:42.459> drive

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
jumps with two screws with a hard drive

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.740 
jumps with two screws with a hard drive
and<00:03:44.410> I'll<00:03:44.650> be<00:03:44.769> right<00:03:44.950> back<00:03:45.100> with<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.370> hard<00:03:45.579> drive

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
and I'll be right back with a hard drive

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.120 
and I'll be right back with a hard drive
ok<00:03:46.750> what<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:46.989> have<00:03:47.200> here<00:03:47.380> is<00:03:47.440> an<00:03:47.680> older<00:03:47.920> hard

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
ok what I have here is an older hard

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.360 
ok what I have here is an older hard
drive<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.700> basically<00:03:49.120> just<00:03:49.299> use<00:03:49.480> for

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
drive the basically just use for

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.789 
drive the basically just use for
mock-ups<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:53.790> have<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.030> fan<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:56.440> what<00:03:56.709> I'm

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
mock-ups and have the fan and what I'm

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.789 
mock-ups and have the fan and what I'm
going<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:56.980> do<00:03:57.130> is<00:03:57.430> I'm<00:03:57.880> going<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.030> use<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.480> two

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
if you have one of the older hard drives

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.860 
if you have one of the older hard drives
with<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.300> molex<00:05:02.310> powers<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.580> say<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.000> power

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:15.300 

we<00:05:07.870> get<00:05:08.020> this<00:05:08.200> tightened<00:05:08.860> up<00:05:08.950> here<00:05:14.160> you<00:05:15.160> can

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
we get this tightened up here you can

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.530 
we get this tightened up here you can
basically<00:05:20.340> hook<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.460> right<00:05:21.670> up<00:05:22.090> to<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.360> hard

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
basically hook it right up to the hard

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.840 
basically hook it right up to the hard
drive<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:23.200> then<00:05:23.950> plug<00:05:24.160> in<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.400> power<00:05:24.550> under

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
drive and then plug in the power under

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.940 
drive and then plug in the power under
this<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:25.800> then<00:05:26.800> you<00:05:26.830> want<00:05:27.130> to<00:05:27.250> have<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:28.950> power

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
this and then you want to have to power

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.920 
this and then you want to have to power
cables<00:05:30.430> just<00:05:30.700> 2<00:05:31.450> pi<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:31.900> somehow<00:05:32.290> and<00:05:33.930> loop

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
cables just 2 pi that somehow and loop

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.220 
cables just 2 pi that somehow and loop
it<00:05:35.050> around<00:05:37.500> and<00:05:38.500> there<00:05:39.100> you<00:05:39.190> go<00:05:39.930> let<00:05:40.930> me<00:05:41.020> give
