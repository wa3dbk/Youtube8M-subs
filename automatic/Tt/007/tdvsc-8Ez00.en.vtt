00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.929 
grotesque it's gonna be but he's been
focusing<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.380> eyes<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.100> teeth<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
focusing in on eyes and teeth so that is

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.850 
focusing in on eyes and teeth so that is
leading<00:01:42.270> me<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.020> perhaps<00:01:43.200> we

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
leading me to think that perhaps we

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.469 
leading me to think that perhaps we
might<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> scene<00:01:44.700> where<00:01:44.909> somebody<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
might see a scene where somebody is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.499 
might see a scene where somebody is
grabbed<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> stuffed<00:01:46.409> inside<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.070> suit<00:01:47.509> see

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
grabbed and stuffed inside of a suit see

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.440 
grabbed and stuffed inside of a suit see
in<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.720> eyes<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.350> seen<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.189> teeth<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.759> maybe

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
in the eyes and seen the teeth and maybe

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.420 
in the eyes and seen the teeth and maybe
even<00:01:51.810> some<00:01:52.020> blood<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.560> mucus<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.280> is

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
even some blood and mucus and that is

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.959 
even some blood and mucus and that is
gonna<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.820> oh<00:01:54.060> it's<00:01:54.479> gonna<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.689> creepy<00:01:55.470> because

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
gonna be oh it's gonna be creepy because

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.190 
gonna be oh it's gonna be creepy because
obviously<00:01:56.969> before<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> children's<00:01:57.869> bodies

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
obviously before the children's bodies

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.889 
obviously before the children's bodies
inside<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.740> suit<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.479> the<00:02:00.479> customers<00:02:00.869> are

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
inside the suit and the customers are

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.130 
inside the suit and the customers are
complained<00:02:01.350> about<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.770> smell<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
complained about the smell and

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.930 
complained about the smell and
and<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.409> mucus<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:03.950> stuff<00:02:04.159> like<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:04.670> are

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
and the mucus and stuff like that so are

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.730 
and the mucus and stuff like that so are
we<00:02:05.030> gonna<00:02:05.150> see<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.330> children's<00:02:05.840> eyes<00:02:06.080> inside

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
we gonna see the children's eyes inside

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.990 
we gonna see the children's eyes inside
these<00:02:06.860> animatronics<00:02:07.220> because<00:02:07.700> that<00:02:07.820> looks

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
these animatronics because that looks

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.150 
these animatronics because that looks
like<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.240> that<00:02:08.899> looks<00:02:09.080> very<00:02:09.530> similar<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.890> my<00:02:10.130> eye

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
like a that looks very similar to my eye

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.059 
like a that looks very similar to my eye
actually<00:02:10.850> very<00:02:11.660> similar<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.110> my<00:02:12.319> eye<00:02:12.350> hazel

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
actually very similar to my eye hazel

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.590 
actually very similar to my eye hazel
eyes<00:02:13.190> that's<00:02:13.490> kind<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.700> like<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> hazely<00:02:14.330> brown

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
eyes that's kind of like a hazely brown

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.040 
eyes that's kind of like a hazely brown
color<00:02:14.900> there<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.790> pupil<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:17.540> iris<00:02:17.750> are

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
color there the the pupil and iris are

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.500 
color there the the pupil and iris are
obviously<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.350> lot<00:02:18.590> bigger<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.280> image<00:02:20.120> but

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
obviously a lot bigger in that image but

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.140 
obviously a lot bigger in that image but
it<00:02:21.380> kinda<00:02:21.620> has<00:02:21.740> to<00:02:21.770> be<00:02:21.950> stylized<00:02:22.490> as<00:02:22.760> well<00:02:22.940> but

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
it kinda has to be stylized as well but

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.490 
it kinda has to be stylized as well but
that's<00:02:23.330> what<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.510> looks<00:02:23.540> like<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.140> the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
that's what it looks like you the the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.870 
that's what it looks like you the the
team<00:02:24.650> are<00:02:24.770> working<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.190> at<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.400> moment<00:02:25.430> teeth

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
team are working on at the moment teeth

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.050 
team are working on at the moment teeth
and<00:02:26.150> eyes<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:27.380> as<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:27.890> already<00:02:28.160> know<00:02:28.310> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
and eyes and that as we already know the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.699 
and eyes and that as we already know the
main<00:02:29.420> focus<00:02:29.840> when<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:30.320> look<00:02:30.530> at<00:02:30.620> the

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
main focus when we look at the

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.140 
main focus when we look at the
animatronics<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.430> then<00:02:31.610> I'm<00:02:31.760> sure<00:02:31.970> they're

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
animatronics and then I'm sure they're

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.449 
animatronics and then I'm sure they're
gonna<00:02:32.270> be<00:02:32.390> working<00:02:32.780> on<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.650> head<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
gonna be working on the the head and the

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.010 
gonna be working on the the head and the
bodies<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.910> stuff<00:02:35.090> as<00:02:35.239> well<00:02:35.450> but<00:02:35.480> we're<00:02:35.870> not

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
bodies and stuff as well but we're not

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.449 
bodies and stuff as well but we're not
allowed<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.290> see<00:02:36.560> them<00:02:36.770> just<00:02:37.070> yet<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.400> don't

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
allowed to see them just yet I don't

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.190 
allowed to see them just yet I don't
think<00:02:37.850> we'll<00:02:38.120> see<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.270> reveal<00:02:38.600> picture<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.050> them

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
think we'll see a reveal picture of them

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.690 
think we'll see a reveal picture of them
until<00:02:39.470> we<00:02:39.590> get<00:02:39.709> some<00:02:39.950> kind<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.220> trailer<00:02:40.610> or<00:02:40.670> a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
until we get some kind of trailer or a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.790 
until we get some kind of trailer or a
poster<00:02:41.090> or<00:02:41.239> something<00:02:41.269> like<00:02:41.660> that<00:02:41.870> but<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.530> love

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
poster or something like that but I love

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.080 
poster or something like that but I love
it<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.070> love<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.519> love<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:43.850> you're<00:02:43.940> teasing

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
it I love it I love that you're teasing

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.850 
it I love it I love that you're teasing
us<00:02:44.330> I<00:02:44.540> love<00:02:45.320> that<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.500> showed<00:02:45.680> us

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.020 
us I love that you showed us
I<00:02:45.950> don't<00:02:46.130> think<00:02:46.310> this<00:02:46.370> particular<00:02:46.640> looks<00:02:46.940> like

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
I don't think this particular looks like

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.449 
I don't think this particular looks like
any<00:02:47.269> animatronic<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.340> doesn't<00:02:49.340> look<00:02:49.430> like

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
any animatronic it doesn't look like

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.860 
any animatronic it doesn't look like
folks<00:02:49.760> he<00:02:49.910> doesn't<00:02:50.150> like<00:02:50.360> cheek<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.660> isn't

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
folks he doesn't like cheek it isn't

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.020 
folks he doesn't like cheek it isn't
life<00:02:51.050> ready<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.980> looks<00:02:52.250> pretty<00:02:52.550> squashed

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
life ready and it looks pretty squashed

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.880 
life ready and it looks pretty squashed
in<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.810> doesn't<00:02:53.870> look<00:02:54.440> like<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:54.830> actually

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
in so it doesn't look like it's actually

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.370 
in so it doesn't look like it's actually
gonna<00:02:55.220> be<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.400> final<00:02:55.670> product<00:02:55.940> but<00:02:56.630> they<00:02:57.230> are

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
gonna be a final product but they are

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.490 
gonna be a final product but they are
experimenting<00:02:58.130> with<00:02:58.160> eyes<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.910> mouth<00:02:59.500> pieces

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
experimenting with eyes and mouth pieces

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.020 
experimenting with eyes and mouth pieces
and<00:03:00.920> stuff<00:03:01.250> trying<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.550> make<00:03:01.670> them<00:03:01.760> look<00:03:01.790> as

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
and stuff trying to make them look as

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.850 
and stuff trying to make them look as
realistic<00:03:02.360> or<00:03:02.630> as<00:03:02.720> horrific<00:03:02.870> as<00:03:03.230> possible<00:03:03.680> and

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
realistic or as horrific as possible and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.920 
realistic or as horrific as possible and
look<00:03:04.310> at<00:03:04.400> those<00:03:04.489> teeth<00:03:04.730> they<00:03:05.480> look<00:03:05.690> like<00:03:05.810> they

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
look at those teeth they look like they

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.009 
look at those teeth they look like they
could<00:03:05.959> be<00:03:06.170> Foxy's<00:03:06.769> teeth<00:03:07.100> but<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.510> the

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
could be Foxy's teeth but on the

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.080 
could be Foxy's teeth but on the
endoskeletons<00:03:09.620> side<00:03:10.549> of<00:03:10.670> things<00:03:10.820> or<00:03:10.970> maybe

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
endoskeletons side of things or maybe
