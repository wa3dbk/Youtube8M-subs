Factory but this is actually where I
have<00:02:53.870> one<00:02:54.050> of<00:02:54.140> my<00:02:54.230> problems<00:02:54.710> with<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.100> movie

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
have one of my problems with the movie

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.580 
have one of my problems with the movie
the<00:02:55.970> first<00:02:56.210> half<00:02:56.540> in<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.810> real<00:02:56.960> world<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.410> very

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
the first half in the real world is very

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.740 
the first half in the real world is very
creatively<00:02:58.100> shot<00:02:58.460> and<00:02:58.670> visually<00:02:59.090> interesting

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
creatively shot and visually interesting

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.570 
creatively shot and visually interesting
but<00:03:00.050> once<00:03:00.230> we<00:03:00.380> get<00:03:00.470> inside<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.980> factory

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
but once we get inside the factory

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.670 
but once we get inside the factory
almost<00:03:02.090> everything<00:03:02.780> is<00:03:02.900> done<00:03:03.050> with<00:03:03.170> computers

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
almost everything is done with computers

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.170 
almost everything is done with computers
and<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.400> doesn't<00:03:04.700> mean<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:04.820> there's<00:03:05.030> not<00:03:05.120> a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
and that doesn't mean that there's not a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.690 
and that doesn't mean that there's not a
lot<00:03:05.270> of<00:03:05.420> creativity<00:03:05.960> behind<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.740> but<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.580> be

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
lot of creativity behind it but to be

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.670 
lot of creativity behind it but to be
honest<00:03:08.060> after<00:03:08.240> five<00:03:08.570> years<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:09.260> images<00:03:09.560> are

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
honest after five years the images are

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.530 
honest after five years the images are
starting<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.980> look<00:03:10.070> a<00:03:10.250> little<00:03:10.460> fake<00:03:10.850> unlike

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
starting to look a little fake unlike

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.730 
starting to look a little fake unlike
the<00:03:11.660> 71<00:03:12.170> movie<00:03:12.410> where<00:03:12.560> pretty<00:03:12.680> much

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
the 71 movie where pretty much

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.040 
the 71 movie where pretty much
everything<00:03:13.190> was<00:03:13.310> functional<00:03:13.820> I<00:03:13.970> had<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.450> real

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
everything was functional I had a real

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.960 
everything was functional I had a real
hard<00:03:15.080> time<00:03:15.650> believing<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.490> what<00:03:16.790> they're

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
hard time believing that what they're

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.970 
hard time believing that what they're
looking<00:03:17.360> at<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.690> really<00:03:18.080> there<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.920> know

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
looking at is really there and I know

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.960 
looking at is really there and I know
it's<00:03:19.220> supposed<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.430> be<00:03:19.520> a<00:03:19.550> factory<00:03:19.880> of

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
it's supposed to be a factory of

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.820 
it's supposed to be a factory of
imagination<00:03:20.690> but<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.080> whole<00:03:21.260> point<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.800> that

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
imagination but the whole point is that

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.460 
imagination but the whole point is that
it<00:03:22.190> exceeds<00:03:22.820> imagination<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.870> yet<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.290> still

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
it exceeds imagination and yet is still

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.470 
it exceeds imagination and yet is still
reality<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.550> I<00:03:25.610> really<00:03:26.030> don't<00:03:26.210> get<00:03:26.360> that

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
reality and I really don't get that

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.570 
reality and I really don't get that

my<00:03:28.790> main<00:03:29.300> problem<00:03:29.720> with<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.110> imagery<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.710> just

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
my main problem with the imagery is just

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.060 
my main problem with the imagery is just
how<00:03:31.340> dark<00:03:32.030> and<00:03:32.330> ominous<00:03:32.570> everything<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.710> I

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
how dark and ominous everything is I
