00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.479 
I think you know he'd really made his
mark<00:02:17.000> on<00:02:17.269> you<00:02:17.629> know<00:02:17.780> on<00:02:18.019> one<00:02:18.860> thing<00:02:19.129> which<00:02:19.340> was

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.040 
mark on you know on one thing which was
improv<00:02:19.879> which<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.209> amazing<00:02:20.450> because<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.810> lot<00:02:21.019> of

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
improv which is amazing because a lot of

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.330 
improv which is amazing because a lot of
actors<00:02:21.379> don't<00:02:21.560> really<00:02:21.830> make<00:02:21.950> their<00:02:22.129> mark

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
actors don't really make their mark

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.750 
actors don't really make their mark
anyway<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.030> he<00:02:23.690> did<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.769> really<00:02:25.280> hope<00:02:25.489> that

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
anyway and he did and I really hope that

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.360 
anyway and he did and I really hope that
he<00:02:25.910> knew<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.450> as<00:02:26.720> opposed<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.620> just<00:02:27.739> you<00:02:28.340> know

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.369 
he knew that as opposed to just you know
failing<00:02:29.360> like<00:02:29.480> he<00:02:29.720> didn't<00:02:29.900> live<00:02:30.050> up<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.170> his

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:30.379 
failing like he didn't live up to his

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.509 
failing like he didn't live up to his
