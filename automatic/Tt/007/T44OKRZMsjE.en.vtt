00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
completely missed what he just did there

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.630 
completely missed what he just did there
because<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:49.940> couldn't<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:52.550> was<00:00:53.550> trying

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
because I couldn't see it I was trying

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:05.440 
because I couldn't see it I was trying
to<00:00:53.820> set<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:54.350> he<00:00:55.350> did<00:00:55.500> someone<00:00:55.890> attack

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:21.680 

oh<00:01:09.440> wow<00:01:10.440> Zeus<00:01:13.820> best<00:01:14.820> turn<00:01:15.300> down<00:01:15.510> flame<00:01:20.690> it

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
oh wow Zeus best turn down flame it

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.050 
oh wow Zeus best turn down flame it
costs<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.200> lot<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.890> stuff<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.250> fight<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.850> guy

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
costs a lot of stuff to fight this guy

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.780 
costs a lot of stuff to fight this guy
so<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.690> was<00:01:24.840> probably<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.500> best<00:01:25.790> decision

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so it was probably not the best decision

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:35.060 
so it was probably not the best decision
to<00:01:30.440> fight<00:01:31.440> him<00:01:31.560> alone<00:01:33.680> because<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.890> would

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
to fight him alone because I would

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.770 
to fight him alone because I would
really<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.759> bothered<00:01:35.940> if<00:01:36.300> I<00:01:36.390> had<00:01:36.539> to<00:01:36.630> fight

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
really be bothered if I had to fight

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.230 
really be bothered if I had to fight
them<00:01:36.899> alone<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.350> lost

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.359 

but<00:01:44.869> oh<00:01:45.170> well<00:01:47.470> it's<00:01:48.470> going<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:48.710> be<00:01:48.860> worth<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.280> in

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
but oh well it's going to be worth it in

00:01:49.369 --> 00:02:05.950 
but oh well it's going to be worth it in
the<00:01:49.399> end<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.850> hope

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.830 

okay<00:02:06.680> let's<00:02:06.890> see<00:02:07.070> here<00:02:08.709> stud<00:02:09.709> on<00:02:09.830> wine<00:02:10.009> hunt

but<00:02:13.520> whatever

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.650 

I<00:02:21.950> think<00:02:22.819> that's<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.030> movie<00:02:23.330> used<00:02:23.540> at<00:02:23.630> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
I think that's the movie used at the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.740 
I think that's the movie used at the
beginning

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.440 

God's<00:02:31.440> banish

that's funny I was just sitting there

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.530 
that's funny I was just sitting there
thinking<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:36.250> bet<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.730> would<00:02:37.030> hurt<00:02:37.270> if<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.510> hit

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
thinking I bet that would hurt if it hit

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.190 
thinking I bet that would hurt if it hit
me<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.440> hit<00:02:38.620> me<00:02:39.599> didn't<00:02:40.599> do<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.930> wasn't<00:02:41.140> that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
me it hit me didn't do it wasn't that

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.230 
me it hit me didn't do it wasn't that

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:52.990
