 Knife problems itself and the ILO and 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.310
 itself have already recognized the conditions 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.590
 the profession and why 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.050

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.090
 responsible for the particular risk is the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.549

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.099
 we know about the high risk 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.370
 and high rainfall is not only 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:41.610
 inherent in the nature of the function but also 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.829
 particular conditions in 15 years to 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.019

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.060
