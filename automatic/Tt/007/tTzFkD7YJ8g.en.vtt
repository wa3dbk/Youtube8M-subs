than that we had to report this Monday
that<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.470> think<00:00:19.740> Apple<00:00:20.720> has<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:22.140> product<00:00:22.410> that

that I think Apple has a product that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.130 
that I think Apple has a product that
Tesla<00:00:23.220> could<00:00:23.340> use<00:00:23.580> every<00:00:24.570> Tesla<00:00:24.960> has<00:00:25.109> a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.189 
touchscreen in it every new car has a
touchscreen<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.210> there's<00:00:27.359> no<00:00:27.630> standard<00:00:28.080> for

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199

putting you know Apple's iOS and the

putting you know Apple's iOS and the
Tesla<00:00:34.140> which<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> think<00:00:34.440> would<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.559> great

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
Tesla which I think would be great

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
I would totally believe that and that is

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.119 
I would totally believe that and that is
the<00:00:36.660> most<00:00:36.899> believable<00:00:37.320> take<00:00:37.739> away<00:00:37.890> from<00:00:38.040> the

the most believable take away from the

the most believable take away from the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
iOS on in the Tesla cars would would

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
iOS on in the Tesla cars would would
would<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.980> mean<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> would<00:00:47.550> give<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
would give Tesla a better system than

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350

terrible and I hope Apple doesn't do it
and<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.250> Apple<00:01:11.490> does<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.760> great<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.600> Tesla

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
and if Apple does it great go with Tesla

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.899 
well okay so but I mean it wouldn't be
and<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.770> say<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.250> perhaps<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.759> was

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and as you say you know perhaps it was

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.030 
and as you say you know perhaps it was
just<00:02:02.939> a

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
just a

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.430 
just a
you<00:02:04.610> know<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.910> that<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.450> had<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:05.810> just<00:02:06.050> sort

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
you know that that you had to just sort

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.469 
you know that that you had to just sort
of<00:02:06.590> throw<00:02:06.980> around<00:02:07.070> ideas<00:02:07.450> because<00:02:08.450> you

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
of throw around ideas because you

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.240 
of throw around ideas because you
couldn't<00:02:09.080> be<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.259> big<00:02:09.560> tech<00:02:09.800> company<00:02:10.160> you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
couldn't be a big tech company you

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.100 
couldn't be a big tech company you
couldn't<00:02:10.550> be<00:02:10.610> an<00:02:10.729> Apple<00:02:11.060> or<00:02:11.120> Google<00:02:11.210> and<00:02:11.660> not

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
couldn't be an Apple or Google and not

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.260 
couldn't be an Apple or Google and not
maybe<00:02:12.380> look<00:02:12.680> at<00:02:12.860> Tesla<00:02:13.100> not<00:02:13.670> look<00:02:13.910> at<00:02:14.060> doing

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
maybe look at Tesla not look at doing

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.700 
maybe look at Tesla not look at doing
something<00:02:14.630> with<00:02:14.780> Tesla<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.470> right

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
something with Tesla is that right

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.320 
something with Tesla is that right
absolutely<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.430> think<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.700> partnership<00:02:17.090> makes<00:02:17.210> a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
absolutely I think a partnership makes a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.640 
absolutely I think a partnership makes a
lot<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.480> sense<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.810> mean<00:02:17.840> everyone<00:02:18.350> who's<00:02:18.530> in

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
lot of sense I mean everyone who's in

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.720 
lot of sense I mean everyone who's in
the<00:02:18.680> tech<00:02:18.890> space<00:02:19.010> is<00:02:19.250> trying<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.490> get<00:02:19.580> in<00:02:19.670> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
the tech space is trying to get in the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.520 
the tech space is trying to get in the
car<00:02:19.880> space<00:02:20.150> Google's<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.960> car<00:02:21.170> space

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
car space Google's in the car space

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.110 
car space Google's in the car space
obviously<00:02:21.830> Apple<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.610> trying<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.850> get<00:02:22.940> in<00:02:23.030> the

obviously Apple is trying to get in the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.820 
obviously Apple is trying to get in the
car<00:02:23.270> space<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.660> makes<00:02:23.780> perfect<00:02:23.960> sense<00:02:24.200> tells

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
car space it makes perfect sense tells

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
us the most interesting and exciting and

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.330 
us the most interesting and exciting and
cool<00:02:26.600> car<00:02:26.870> company<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.470> apples<00:02:28.010> kind<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.280> the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
cool car company and apples kind of the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.130 
cool car company and apples kind of the

still the most exciting and cool tech

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.890 
still the most exciting and cool tech
company<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:30.770> it<00:02:31.190> makes<00:02:31.640> sense<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.570> lot<00:02:32.810> of

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.420 
company so it makes sense on a lot of
ways<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.290> just<00:02:33.500> don't<00:02:33.680> think<00:02:33.830> knowing<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
ways I just don't think knowing the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
that if it was happening we would

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.050 
that if it was happening we would
probably<00:02:36.800> heard<00:02:37.040> about<00:02:37.070> it<00:02:37.220> oh<00:02:37.340> well<00:02:37.520> talk<00:02:38.030> to

think he's ready for that if you look at

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.460 
think he's ready for that if you look at
Elon<00:02:47.030> Musk's<00:02:47.360> history<00:02:47.750> of<00:02:47.870> selling<00:02:48.110> and

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
Elon Musk's history of selling and

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.800 
Elon Musk's history of selling and
creating<00:02:48.830> companies<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.459> think<00:02:50.180> he<00:02:50.570> would<00:02:50.660> only

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
creating companies I think he would only

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.449 
creating companies I think he would only
sell<00:02:51.140> Tesla<00:02:51.830> if<00:02:51.950> he<00:02:52.040> thought<00:02:52.250> he'd

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
sell Tesla if he thought he'd

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.590 
sell Tesla if he thought he'd
accomplished<00:02:52.880> everything<00:02:53.090> he<00:02:53.300> wanted<00:02:53.510> to

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
accomplish or he thought it wasn't

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.620

possible<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.790> accomplish<00:02:56.180> what<00:02:56.300> he<00:02:56.330> wanted<00:02:56.540> to

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
possible to accomplish what he wanted to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.500 
possible to accomplish what he wanted to
accomplish<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:57.350> he<00:02:58.040> hasn't<00:02:58.250> built<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.880> there's

headquarters there in LA he was very big

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.199 
headquarters there in LA he was very big
on<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.290> Model<00:03:24.650> X<00:03:24.830> and<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.280> SUV<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.940> how<00:03:26.060> it's

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
on the Model X and the SUV and how it's

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.300 
on the Model X and the SUV and how it's
for<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.420> soccer<00:03:26.690> mom<00:03:27.019> these<00:03:27.320> days<00:03:27.560> right<00:03:28.160> but

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
for the soccer mom these days right but

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.650 
for the soccer mom these days right but
that's<00:03:28.430> also<00:03:28.580> a<00:03:28.670> really<00:03:29.000> expensive<00:03:29.269> car<00:03:29.630> I

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
that's also a really expensive car I

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.240 
that's also a really expensive car I
mean<00:03:29.900> it's<00:03:30.019> roughly<00:03:30.410> it's<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.830> little<00:03:31.010> cheaper

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
mean it's roughly it's a little cheaper

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.530 
mean it's roughly it's a little cheaper
but<00:03:31.340> it's<00:03:31.489> roughly<00:03:31.700> in<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:31.940> Model<00:03:32.209> S<00:03:32.299> space

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
but it's roughly in the Model S space

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.789 
but it's roughly in the Model S space
it's<00:03:32.720> something<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.019> you<00:03:33.080> buy<00:03:33.230> if<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.650> can

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
it's something that you buy if you can

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.560 
it's something that you buy if you can
afford<00:03:34.160> an<00:03:34.489> expensive<00:03:34.760> vehicle<00:03:35.390> something

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
afford an expensive vehicle something

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.150 
afford an expensive vehicle something
