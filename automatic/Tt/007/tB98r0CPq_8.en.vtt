starch and school glue a 4-ounce school
glue<00:00:21.720> will<00:00:21.960> be<00:00:22.109> sufficient<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:22.949> you're

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
glue will be sufficient because you're

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.070 
glue will be sufficient because you're
going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.460> use<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.850> United<00:00:24.269> need<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.840> is

going to use the United need to do is

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.370 
going to use the United need to do is
take<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.590> 4-ounce<00:00:26.070> bottle<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:27.510> school<00:00:27.869> glue<00:00:28.080> and

take a 4-ounce bottle of school glue and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.080 
take a 4-ounce bottle of school glue and
dump<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.010> into<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:30.150> bowl<00:00:31.309> make<00:00:32.309> sure<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.669> try<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
dump it into a bowl make sure you try to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.400 
dump it into a bowl make sure you try to
get<00:00:33.300> all<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.380> out<00:00:35.329> then<00:00:36.329> you're<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
get all of it out then you're going to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.100 
get all of it out then you're going to
take<00:00:37.910> two<00:00:38.910> ounces<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.610> liquid<00:00:41.610> starch<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
take two ounces of liquid starch and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.029 
take two ounces of liquid starch and
you're<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.309> slowly<00:00:44.700> add<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.930> into<00:00:46.170> your

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
you're going to slowly add it into your

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.680 
you're going to slowly add it into your
mix<00:00:47.989> you<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.379> not<00:00:49.559> want<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.370> dump<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.270> too

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
mix you do not want to dump this in too

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.430 
mix you do not want to dump this in too
fast<00:00:51.989> because<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.610> put<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:54.000> bit<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
fast because as you put a little bit in

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.700 
fast because as you put a little bit in
go<00:00:55.440> ahead<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.680> stir<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> into<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:57.539> mix<00:00:57.840> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
go ahead and stir it into your mix and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.520 
go ahead and stir it into your mix and
it's<00:00:59.520> important<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> know<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.570> some<00:01:01.050> school

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it's important to know that some school

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.660 
it's important to know that some school
glows<00:01:01.800> will<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.780> work<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.159> I'm<00:01:05.159> not<00:01:05.369> sure

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
glows will not work and I'm not sure

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.640 
glows will not work and I'm not sure
exactly<00:01:06.030> why<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.689> make<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> composition<00:01:07.530> as

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
exactly why I just make a composition as

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.170 
exactly why I just make a composition as
a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.920> thing<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.369> little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.729> more

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
a little thing right a little bit more

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.580 
a little thing right a little bit more
of<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.869> starch<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> I'm<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.020> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> add

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
of a starch so I'm just going to add

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.859 
of a starch so I'm just going to add
right<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> top<00:01:15.030> again<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:18.299> mix<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.750> in

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
right to the top again and mix it in

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.800 
right to the top again and mix it in
once<00:01:19.500> again<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.310> kind<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.670> slow<00:01:20.970> slow

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
once again so it's kind of a slow slow

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.520 
once again so it's kind of a slow slow
process<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> completed<00:01:24.290> but<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.439> only

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
process to get it completed but it only

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.960 
process to get it completed but it only
takes<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.040> 15<00:01:26.490> minutes<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.939> total<00:01:28.790> it's<00:01:29.790> not

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
takes like 15 minutes in total it's not

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030 
takes like 15 minutes in total it's not
sticking<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.900> your<00:01:31.020> hands<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.650> more<00:01:31.860> like

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
sticking to your hands it's more like

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.069 
sticking to your hands it's more like
falling<00:01:32.729> off<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> them<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
falling off of them that's the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.130 
falling off of them that's the
consistency<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.799> want<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.549> keep<00:01:35.759> adding

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
consistency you want just keep adding

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.870 
consistency you want just keep adding
little<00:01:37.140> tiny<00:01:37.320> bit<00:01:38.930> of<00:01:39.930> your<00:01:40.290> liquid<00:01:40.740> starch

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.149 

but<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.030> definitely<00:01:45.299> do<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.600> want<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.829> drop

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
but you definitely do not want to drop

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.080 
but you definitely do not want to drop
all<00:01:47.490> your<00:01:47.549> liquid<00:01:48.299> starch<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:49.049> time<00:01:50.090> if

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
all your liquid starch at one time if

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.340 
all your liquid starch at one time if
you<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> you're<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> end<00:01:52.170> up

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
you do that you're just going to end up

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.330 
you do that you're just going to end up
with<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:53.280> stringy<00:01:54.210> mess

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.459 

just<00:02:01.340> keep<00:02:01.520> adding<00:02:01.789> until<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.899> have<00:02:03.259> used

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
just keep adding until you have used

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:12.850 
just keep adding until you have used
your<00:02:03.890> entire<00:02:04.219> 2<00:02:05.090> ounces<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.780> as<00:02:11.959> we<00:02:12.170> slowly<00:02:12.500> add

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
your entire 2 ounces so as we slowly add

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.979 
your entire 2 ounces so as we slowly add
it<00:02:13.069> in<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.660> little<00:02:14.660> bit<00:02:14.959> at<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> time<00:02:15.319> of<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
it in a little bit at a time of the

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.030 
it in a little bit at a time of the
liquid<00:02:17.989> starch<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.940> notice<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.920> it's<00:02:21.920> no

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
liquid starch you notice that it's no

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.030 
liquid starch you notice that it's no
longer<00:02:22.250> sticking<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:23.000> my<00:02:23.090> hands<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:27.319> it's

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
longer sticking to my hands and it's

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.559 
longer sticking to my hands and it's
more<00:02:28.400> less<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.480> kind<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.290> get<00:02:30.650> at<00:02:30.860> the

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
more less the kind that you get at the

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.699 
more less the kind that you get at the
stores<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:35.390> that's<00:02:35.780> all<00:02:36.019> there<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.410> making

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
stores so that's all there is to making

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.850 
stores so that's all there is to making
it<00:02:39.730> quite<00:02:40.730> simple<00:02:41.239> a<00:02:41.450> lot<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.440> people<00:02:42.560> do<00:02:42.739> we

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
it quite simple a lot of people do we

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.890 
it quite simple a lot of people do we
add<00:02:42.980> food<00:02:43.250> coloring<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.819> theirs<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.420> don't

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
add food coloring to theirs I don't

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.800 
add food coloring to theirs I don't
because<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.920> fact<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:47.480> gets<00:02:47.630> all<00:02:47.780> over

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
because the fact that it gets all over
