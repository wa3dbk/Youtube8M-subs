00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
hey guys in German Android temper calm

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.500 
hey guys in German Android temper calm
and<00:00:08.040> we're<00:00:08.130> taking<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.490> look<00:00:08.639> at<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.059> follow<00:00:09.360> up

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
and we're taking a look at the follow up

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.180 
and we're taking a look at the follow up
to<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.690> original<00:00:09.780> sprinkle<00:00:10.650> game<00:00:10.860> from

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
to the original sprinkle game from

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.910 
to the original sprinkle game from
mediocre<00:00:11.820> games<00:00:12.090> called<00:00:12.690> sprinkle<00:00:13.259> Islands

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
mediocre games called sprinkle Islands

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.519 
mediocre games called sprinkle Islands
and<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.580> builds<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:15.030> top<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.540> success<00:00:16.230> of

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
and it builds on top of the success of

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.609 
and it builds on top of the success of
that<00:00:17.010> original<00:00:17.279> game<00:00:17.730> which<00:00:18.230> really<00:00:19.230> took

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
that original game which really took

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.720 
that original game which really took
things<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> new<00:00:20.189> level

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
things to a new level

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.170 
things to a new level
as<00:00:20.939> far<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.680> graphical<00:00:22.680> performance<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.550> just

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
as far as graphical performance and just

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.640 
as far as graphical performance and just
fun<00:00:24.960> gameplay<00:00:25.230> goes<00:00:26.240> and<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.810> when<00:00:28.019> Islands

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
fun gameplay goes and so when Islands

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.799 
fun gameplay goes and so when Islands
the<00:00:30.830> idea<00:00:31.830> instead<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.790> having<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:35.570> let's<00:00:36.570> see

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the idea instead of having the let's see

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.510 
the idea instead of having the let's see
here<00:00:37.050> instead<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.380> having<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> fire<00:00:38.100> truck

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
here instead of having the fire truck

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.119 
here instead of having the fire truck
stuck<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.510> end<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.350> level<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
stuck at one end of the level and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.810 
stuck at one end of the level and
shooting<00:00:41.700> around<00:00:42.530> we<00:00:43.530> now<00:00:43.770> progress<00:00:44.489> through

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
shooting around we now progress through

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.190 
shooting around we now progress through
levels<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.800> drive<00:00:46.800> along<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:48.200> shooting

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
levels and drive along as we go shooting

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.819 
levels and drive along as we go shooting
down<00:00:49.520> the<00:00:50.520> fires<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> case<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
down the fires as was the case in the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.040 
down the fires as was the case in the
original<00:00:52.949> game<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:54.149> also<00:00:54.329> moving<00:00:54.719> through

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
original game but also moving through

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
original game but also moving through
the<00:00:55.140> level<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.030> next<00:00:57.329> obstacle<00:00:58.670> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the level to get to the next obstacle so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.099 
the level to get to the next obstacle so
you'll<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.239> different<00:01:00.600> things<00:01:00.840> come

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
you'll see that different things come

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.340 
you'll see that different things come
along<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:03.210> controls<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.930> also<00:01:04.080> been

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
along and the controls have also been

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.100 
along and the controls have also been
improved<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.430> help<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.510> we're

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
improved to help out because we're

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.660 
improved to help out because we're
moving<00:01:07.740> through<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.040> level<00:01:08.600> now<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:11.460> move

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
moving through a level now as you move

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.490 
moving through a level now as you move
up<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.060> down<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.960> angle<00:01:13.860> will<00:01:14.369> also<00:01:14.760> improve

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
up and down the angle will also improve

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.320 
up and down the angle will also improve
and<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.340> see<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.640> interact<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and you can see you interact with the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.530 
and you can see you interact with the
level<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.869> move<00:01:19.470> around<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.090> go<00:01:21.509> up

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
level to move around but so as you go up

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.590 
level to move around but so as you go up
and<00:01:21.869> down<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.770> angle<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.490> spout<00:01:24.270> will

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
and down the the angle of the spout will

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.359 
and down the the angle of the spout will
change<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.009> don't<00:01:26.220> have

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
change as well so you don't have

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.510 
change as well so you don't have
independent<00:01:27.090> controls<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.799> changing<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
independent controls for changing the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.760 
independent controls for changing the
the<00:01:31.910> spout<00:01:32.210> angle<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:32.990> going<00:01:33.350> up<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.650> down

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
the spout angle and going up and down

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.640 
the spout angle and going up and down
which<00:01:34.040> is<00:01:34.190> nice<00:01:35.110> makes<00:01:36.110> it<00:01:36.230> a<00:01:36.290> little<00:01:36.410> bit

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
which is nice makes it a little bit

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.520 
which is nice makes it a little bit
easier<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.190> control<00:01:37.670> because<00:01:38.030> before<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.810> got

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
easier to control because before it got

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.280 
easier to control because before it got
a<00:01:39.590> little<00:01:39.770> bit<00:01:39.980> annoying<00:01:40.610> at<00:01:41.240> times<00:01:41.300> trying<00:01:42.230> to

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
a little bit annoying at times trying to

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.410 
a little bit annoying at times trying to
control<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.400> so<00:01:43.430> with<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.910> movement<00:01:44.300> and

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
control it so with the movement and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.340 
control it so with the movement and
everything<00:01:44.810> they<00:01:45.340> decided<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.370> improve<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
everything they decided to improve the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.950 
everything they decided to improve the
ergonomics<00:01:48.350> of<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.710> game<00:01:48.890> as<00:01:49.100> well<00:01:49.810> but<00:01:50.810> as

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
ergonomics of the game as well but as

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.530 
ergonomics of the game as well but as
you<00:01:51.080> can<00:01:51.200> see<00:01:51.490> everything<00:01:52.490> still<00:01:53.300> plays

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
you can see everything still plays

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.469 
you can see everything still plays
extremely<00:01:54.290> smoothly<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.010> nicely<00:01:55.640> just<00:01:56.210> as<00:01:56.360> it

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
extremely smoothly and nicely just as it

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.690 
extremely smoothly and nicely just as it
did<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.840> original<00:01:57.229> game<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.710> they're

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
did in the original game and they're

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.969 
did in the original game and they're
really<00:01:58.960> touting<00:01:59.960> some<00:02:00.229> of<00:02:00.380> their<00:02:00.620> water

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
really touting some of their water

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.740 
really touting some of their water
physics<00:02:01.280> which<00:02:01.700> have<00:02:01.910> improved<00:02:02.390> even<00:02:02.630> more

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
physics which have improved even more

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.859 
physics which have improved even more
apparently<00:02:04.090> although<00:02:05.090> we<00:02:05.509> thought<00:02:05.720> they

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
apparently although we thought they

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.490 
apparently although we thought they
looked<00:02:06.110> pretty<00:02:06.170> darn<00:02:06.830> good<00:02:07.009> beforehand<00:02:08.500> now

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
looked pretty darn good beforehand now

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.250 
looked pretty darn good beforehand now
the<00:02:09.979> main<00:02:10.340> goal<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.640> each<00:02:11.300> level<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:11.840> still<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
the main goal of each level is still the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.140 
the main goal of each level is still the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
same where you're trying to put out all

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.140

the fire with as little water as

the fire with as little water as
