00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
with a pickup most often if you look at

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.389 
with a pickup most often if you look at
other<00:00:29.869> cones<00:00:30.259> you<00:00:30.500> have<00:00:30.649> to<00:00:30.829> pay<00:00:31.099> a<00:00:31.130> premium

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
other cones you have to pay a premium

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.069 
other cones you have to pay a premium
and<00:00:31.790> get<00:00:31.880> very<00:00:32.060> specific<00:00:32.300> designs<00:00:32.899> with

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
and get very specific designs with

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.420 
and get very specific designs with
pickups<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:33.560> they<00:00:33.649> won't<00:00:33.800> actually<00:00:33.950> let<00:00:34.280> you

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
pickups and they won't actually let you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.060 
pickups and they won't actually let you
choose<00:00:35.059> that<00:00:35.690> sort<00:00:35.930> of<00:00:36.020> thing<00:00:36.200> so<00:00:36.230> keep<00:00:36.950> in

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
choose that sort of thing so keep in

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.230 
choose that sort of thing so keep in
mind<00:00:37.250> that<00:00:37.340> if<00:00:37.460> you<00:00:37.520> like<00:00:37.670> something<00:00:37.880> you<00:00:37.970> here

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.240 
mind that if you like something you here

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.000 
mind that if you like something you here
it's<00:00:38.930> always<00:00:39.080> available<00:00:39.320> with<00:00:39.650> them<00:00:39.800> without

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
it's always available with them without

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.150 
it's always available with them without
a<00:00:40.040> pickup<00:00:40.630> so<00:00:41.630> the<00:00:42.380> campfire<00:00:42.740> series<00:00:43.040> is

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
a pickup so the campfire series is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.380 
a pickup so the campfire series is
definitely<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:43.670> most<00:00:43.790> furphy<00:00:44.270> and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
definitely the most furphy and

mechanism which is extremely versatile

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.819 
mechanism which is extremely versatile
and<00:01:10.969> we'll<00:01:11.479> get<00:01:11.780> into<00:01:11.929> there<00:01:12.259> how<00:01:12.439> that<00:01:12.649> can

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
and we'll get into there how that can

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.959 
and we'll get into there how that can
play<00:01:13.069> out<00:01:13.100> we<00:01:13.909> have<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:15.259> really<00:01:16.100> bright<00:01:16.429> slap

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
play out we have the really bright slap

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:20.440 
play out we have the really bright slap
characteristic<00:01:17.630> on<00:01:17.749> top<00:01:19.210> which<00:01:20.210> is

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
characteristic on top which is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.419 
characteristic on top which is
accomplished<00:01:21.200> by<00:01:21.259> having<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.740> proprietary

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
accomplished by having a proprietary

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.649 
accomplished by having a proprietary
design<00:01:22.819> of<00:01:23.060> cutaway<00:01:23.719> MDF<00:01:24.499> here<00:01:24.829> and<00:01:24.950> here<00:01:25.659> the

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
design of cutaway MDF here and here the

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.510 
design of cutaway MDF here and here the
body<00:01:26.869> is<00:01:26.990> contiguous<00:01:27.289> however<00:01:27.770> this<00:01:28.130> little

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
body is contiguous however this little

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.300 
body is contiguous however this little
bit<00:01:28.639> of<00:01:28.729> space<00:01:28.939> is<00:01:29.179> cut<00:01:29.359> away<00:01:29.539> inside<00:01:29.929> there<00:01:30.310> it

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
bit of space is cut away inside there it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.099 
bit of space is cut away inside there it
allows<00:01:31.429> for<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:31.850> nicer<00:01:32.149> kind<00:01:32.539> of<00:01:32.600> knock<00:01:32.810> on<00:01:32.990> the

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
allows for a nicer kind of knock on the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.899 
allows for a nicer kind of knock on the
edge<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:34.759> really<00:01:35.119> bright<00:01:35.539> slaps<00:01:35.959> on<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.259> hip

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
edge and really bright slaps on the hip

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.539 
edge and really bright slaps on the hip
so<00:01:37.909> here<00:01:38.569> we<00:01:38.659> have<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.170> edge<00:01:39.560> being<00:01:40.310> played

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
so here we have the edge being played

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:55.980 
so here we have the edge being played
within<00:01:41.119> without<00:01:41.420> snares

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.180 

now<00:01:56.990> with<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.230> very<00:01:57.350> simple<00:01:57.590> flick<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.160> the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
now with a very simple flick of the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
now with a very simple flick of the
switch<00:01:58.250> here<00:01:58.580> we're<00:01:58.850> gonna<00:01:58.940> turn<00:01:59.090> this

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
switch here we're gonna turn this

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.580 
switch here we're gonna turn this
narrows<00:01:59.480> on<00:02:01.960> remember<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.050> snares<00:02:03.320> can<00:02:03.500> be

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
narrows on remember the snares can be

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.130 
narrows on remember the snares can be
positioned<00:02:04.040> in<00:02:04.220> any<00:02:04.820> variant<00:02:05.390> between<00:02:05.780> off

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
positioned in any variant between off

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.650 
positioned in any variant between off
and<00:02:06.470> on<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:07.190> you<00:02:07.250> have<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.910> choice<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.360> having

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
and on so you have the choice of having

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.240 
and on so you have the choice of having
a<00:02:08.780> lot<00:02:08.960> of<00:02:09.050> snare<00:02:09.229> contact<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.830> little<00:02:10.009> scenario

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
a lot of snare contact a little scenario

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.870 
a lot of snare contact a little scenario
attack<00:02:10.670> or<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.390> variation<00:02:11.990> between<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.350> two<00:02:12.880> so

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
attack or a variation between the two so

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.630 
attack or a variation between the two so
here<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.210> have<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.980> most<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.220> way<00:02:16.310> so

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
here we have it on most of the way so

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.040 
here we have it on most of the way so
we're<00:02:16.730> gonna<00:02:16.850> have<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> lot<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.180> scenario<00:02:17.450> act

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.240 

you<00:02:24.050> can<00:02:24.170> see<00:02:24.320> how<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.560> brightens<00:02:24.980> up<00:02:25.100> the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
you can see how that brightens up the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.150 
you can see how that brightens up the
attack<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.760> makes<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.090> lot<00:02:26.270> more<00:02:26.450> distinct

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
attack and makes it a lot more distinct

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.770 
attack and makes it a lot more distinct
with<00:02:28.160> all<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.520> these<00:02:28.610> cones<00:02:28.970> with<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.510> snares

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
with all of these cones with the snares

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.050 
with all of these cones with the snares
on<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.320> find<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.709> lot<00:02:30.980> more<00:02:31.010> precision<00:02:31.790> in

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
on you find a lot more precision in

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:39.040 
on you find a lot more precision in
quick<00:02:32.900> little<00:02:33.140> hits<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:35.770> big<00:02:37.630> booming<00:02:38.630> hits

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
now as with all of the characters cones

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.850 
now as with all of the characters cones
the<00:02:41.510> scenario<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.110> amiss<00:02:42.290> fashion<00:02:42.620> such<00:02:42.830> that
