00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
this recipe I'm going to make the rice

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.390 
this recipe I'm going to make the rice
the<00:00:22.050> same<00:00:22.350> way<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.890> would<00:00:23.010> do<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> pasta

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the same way that I would do the pasta

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.849 
the same way that I would do the pasta
so<00:00:23.730> instead<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.119> making<00:00:24.660> rice<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
so instead of making rice with the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.099 
so instead of making rice with the
double<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> amount<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.939> water<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.390> then<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
double the amount of water and then the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.839 
double the amount of water and then the
traditional<00:00:28.260> method<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.460> going<00:00:29.789> to

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
traditional method I'm actually going to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.550 
traditional method I'm actually going to
boil<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.510> then<00:00:30.630> drain<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> way

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560

boil<00:01:05.640> until<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.150> al<00:01:06.330> dente<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
boil until it's al dente and this is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.469 
boil until it's al dente and this is
just<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> way<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.790> would<00:01:08.909> boil<00:01:09.119> any

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
recipe but it would taste good if that's

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.380 
recipe but it would taste good if that's
all<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.850> use<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.240> as

by the way it starts to cook if I'm

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.000 
by the way it starts to cook if I'm
going<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.330> need<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.570> increase<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.320> heat<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.680> lot

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
going to need to increase the heat a lot

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.310 
going to need to increase the heat a lot
this<00:03:12.820> is<00:03:13.030> simmering<00:03:13.270> but<00:03:13.600> it's<00:03:13.750> simmering<00:03:14.140> it

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.969 
it's a different color and they're not
burnt<00:04:29.750> so<00:04:30.050> this<00:04:30.199> is<00:04:30.349> the<00:04:30.439> color<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.710> we're

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979

stop<00:04:35.150> cooking<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.569> tip<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.080> pan<00:04:36.289> sideways<00:04:36.800> I

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
stop cooking I tip the pan sideways I

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.980 
stop cooking I tip the pan sideways I
let<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.520> oil<00:04:37.550> come<00:04:37.939> over<00:04:38.150> here<00:04:38.389> because<00:04:38.870> the

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
let the oil come over here because the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.379 
let the oil come over here because the
oil<00:04:39.139> is<00:04:39.319> still<00:04:39.469> hot<00:04:39.800> so<00:04:40.250> if<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.460> keep<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:40.699> oil

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
oil is still hot so if you keep the oil

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.510 
oil is still hot so if you keep the oil
on<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.780> onions<00:04:42.710> which<00:04:42.830> are<00:04:42.949> already<00:04:43.129> perfect

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
on the onions which are already perfect

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.670 
on the onions which are already perfect
it<00:04:43.909> will<00:04:44.150> burn<00:04:44.360> them<00:04:44.539> but<00:04:44.900> by<00:04:45.050> separating<00:04:45.530> it

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
it will burn them but by separating it

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.290 
it will burn them but by separating it
like<00:04:45.860> this<00:04:46.069> you<00:04:46.520> can<00:04:46.699> keep<00:04:46.879> your<00:04:47.030> onions

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300
