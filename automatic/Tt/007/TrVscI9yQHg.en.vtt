your games in game maker aid app rake up
game<00:00:24.210> made<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.779> an<00:00:25.350> earlier<00:00:25.890> tutorial<00:00:26.099> will<00:00:26.939> be

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
game made in an earlier tutorial will be

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.919 
game made in an earlier tutorial will be
used<00:00:27.510> as<00:00:27.750> an<00:00:28.019> example<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.160> one<00:00:29.570> so<00:00:30.570> we

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
used as an example in this one so we

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.990 
used as an example in this one so we
have<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.410> breakout<00:00:31.740> game<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.640> just

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
have the breakout game and we can just

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.650 
have the breakout game and we can just
take<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.480> look<00:00:33.719> at<00:00:33.870> how<00:00:34.130> it<00:00:35.130> plays<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.480> have

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
take a look at how it plays so we have

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.229 
take a look at how it plays so we have
this<00:00:39.870> game<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.829> will<00:00:41.010> be<00:00:41.160> adding<00:00:41.370> sounds

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
this game and we will be adding sounds

and<00:01:01.129> then<00:01:03.140> we<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.320> use<00:01:05.060> one<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.600> where<00:01:07.380> every

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
and then we can use one for where every

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.730 
and then we can use one for where every
time<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.369> bat<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.180> hit<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.900> use<00:01:10.140> this

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
time the bat is hit we can use this

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.760 
time the bat is hit we can use this
before<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.750> click<00:01:13.080> open<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:15.259> we<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> sound

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:34.350 
and also have this whenever the stone
green<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:29.200> hit<00:03:30.200> once<00:03:30.470> again

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.750 

and<00:03:36.130> whenever<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.400> die<00:03:37.580> you'll<00:03:38.270> have<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:39.020> sound

and whenever you die you'll have a sound

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.870 
and whenever you die you'll have a sound
so<00:03:40.760> set<00:03:41.390> this<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.780> die<00:03:42.340> okay<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:46.430> object<00:03:46.730> 8

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
so set this to die okay and the object 8

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.040 
so set this to die okay and the object 8
+<00:03:47.090> 4<00:03:47.560> 8<00:03:48.560> &amp;<00:03:48.800> 9<00:03:48.830> are<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.550> yellow<00:03:50.060> stones<00:03:50.450> we<00:03:50.840> also

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
+ 4 8 &amp; 9 are the yellow stones we also

need sounds here stone here and stone
hit<00:03:59.680> ok<00:04:00.680> so<00:04:01.460> now<00:04:01.700> we<00:04:01.760> have<00:04:02.000> these<00:04:02.180> sounds<00:04:02.600> one

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
hit ok so now we have these sounds one

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.660 
hit ok so now we have these sounds one
final<00:04:03.860> thing<00:04:04.520> we<00:04:04.700> need<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.880> do<00:04:05.120> is<00:04:05.330> whenever

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
final thing we need to do is whenever

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.150 
final thing we need to do is whenever
the<00:04:07.670> stones<00:04:07.940> are<00:04:08.180> destroyed<00:04:08.570> we<00:04:09.080> need<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.530> play

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
the stones are destroyed we need to play

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.010 
the stones are destroyed we need to play
a<00:04:10.190> sound<00:04:12.400> so<00:04:13.400> this<00:04:13.760> we<00:04:13.940> can<00:04:14.090> do<00:04:14.240> in<00:04:14.480> timelines

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
a sound so this we can do in timelines

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.920 
a sound so this we can do in timelines
and<00:04:15.260> this<00:04:15.950> one<00:04:16.160> death<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.700> we<00:04:17.390> can<00:04:17.510> add<00:04:17.690> a

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
and this one death and we can add a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.830 
and this one death and we can add a
sound<00:04:18.830> here<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:20.180> says<00:04:20.540> don't<00:04:21.230> destroy<00:04:21.880> ok<00:04:22.880> so

sound here that says don't destroy ok so

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.460 
sound here that says don't destroy ok so
let's<00:04:24.200> try<00:04:24.440> this<00:04:24.560> out

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:43.710 

we<00:04:32.470> hear<00:04:32.620> they<00:04:32.740> die<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:42.190> all<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.210> sounds<00:04:43.570> are

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
we hear they die and all the sounds are

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.240 
we hear they die and all the sounds are
playing<00:04:45.870> one<00:04:46.870> last<00:04:46.900> thing<00:04:47.320> we<00:04:47.650> will<00:04:47.800> add<00:04:48.040> is

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
playing one last thing we will add is

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.330 
playing one last thing we will add is
music<00:04:48.850> background<00:04:49.300> music<00:04:49.680> we<00:04:50.680> can<00:04:50.800> use<00:04:50.980> WAV

called controller and here I'll add an

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.740 
called controller and here I'll add an
event<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:29.460> use<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.730> one<00:05:30.850> called<00:05:31.240> other<00:05:31.420> and

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
event and use the one called other and

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.940 
event and use the one called other and
on<00:05:32.440> room<00:05:32.980> start<00:05:33.600> so<00:05:34.600> this<00:05:35.110> is<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.440> one<00:05:35.740> that

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
on room start so this is the one that

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.700 
on room start so this is the one that
draws<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.490> score<00:05:36.910> and<00:05:37.120> lives<00:05:37.570> on<00:05:37.870> screen<00:05:38.230> here

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
draws the score and lives on screen here

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.760 
draws the score and lives on screen here
I'll<00:05:38.950> also<00:05:39.190> add<00:05:39.550> room<00:05:39.850> start<00:05:40.150> and<00:05:40.420> add<00:05:41.230> the

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
I'll also add room start and add the

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.930 
I'll also add room start and add the
