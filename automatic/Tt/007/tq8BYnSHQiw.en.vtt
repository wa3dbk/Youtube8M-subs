00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.100
 I have him through you Efron I did not know yet 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.569
 what's all in red star of my subconscious Sarah's wish 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.339
 This I am another strategy insights when I finally get up 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.879
 to 6000 years 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:15.849
 so pure 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.390
 for 30 seconds 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.929
 right after my time 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.050
 it was in the constitutional judge 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.280
 not a protected term 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.960
 but what does it really mean to us? 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.289
 come and go 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.999
 some miss some more less 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.030
 this could be relieved it already a special one 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.320
 A guarantee is plentiful 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.330
 sooner or later success 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.200
 disappeared 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.580
 a pity, actually 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.940
 There has ever been a hero on the people too great hopes 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.880
 Oh, they mean the Neanderthal man 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.890
 yes that is one of our many 7 ancestors and by boat more long 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.810
 Time have nothing to do but in 2010 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 It always came out big 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.990
 the Neanderthals a dispute No 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.910
 how long has he been considered as a countless miss attempt of evolution 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.540
 but in 2010 researchers should put it in a new light 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.500
 For the first time he can get well out of his rotten bones and in 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.630
 final act 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.090
 the decision processes change the picture of the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.340
 Neanderthal man several tens of thousands of years ago on the modern 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 People met our direct ancestors 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.660
 and so you imagined the meeting so far 4 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.390
 Humans and Neanderthals fight for the same habitat 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 and the only one proven 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.870
 according to the common theory 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.439
 has become the modern man 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.289
 from Africa out across the earth the Neanderthal man spreads to 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.829
 that time already had settled in Europe became in the confrontation 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.829
 extinguished 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.679
 Minute at the moment 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.879
 the Neanderthal has a way, he lives 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.879
 yet his genes are good food much of Bismarck 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.589
 the breast 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.559
 there is only one explanation 

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:23.170
 Human and 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.309
 or did they come faster and as already suspected 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.309
 they have fathered common offspring 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:33.549
 up to four percent of our genes come from the Neanderthals 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.239
 this heritage opened yet another surprising insight 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.959
 it is also evidence of the common origin 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.959
 after people live the 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:54.429
 Here the belief stubbornly sticks to a Chinese special way 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:58.439
 also as justification for the uniqueness of the Chinese people 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.629
 should serve 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.680
 fossilized bones found here should provide the necessary evidence 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.680
 deliver 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:13.689
 from the vicinity of Beijing come skull Resta the over 400 thousand 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.039
 Years old should be 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:19.169
 Fragments of the resistance felt 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.009
 Georgener and finds are considered lost 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.449
 but with the help of casts one has set up a theory until today 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.449
 in China business cycle act 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.449
 not in Africa 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:40.539
 but in no country have the modern Chinese out of the peak in man 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.539
 develops the idea 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.169
 in the face of these constructions 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.079
 they are supposed to prove the similarity between Peking the Chinese bung 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.319
 Investigations on the genetic material of today 's Chinese put the thesis on the 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.819
 test bench 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.819
 things are incorruptible 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:05.239
 they tell a clear story 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.759
 Even with Chinese there are traces of Neanderthal man and that though 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.749
 demonstrably never one of them 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:15.779
 got to China 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:17.279
 the explanation 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:21.519
 After the modern man left in Africa and deal with the Neanderthals 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.439
 He resided in Asia, too 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.710
 in his genome 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.710
 the proximity of the Neanderthal man to date in the ORF of Chinese because 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.710
 our proof 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.169
 with the investigations 2010 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.379
 The Neanderthal man has come closer to us 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.300
 He helps to further the history of the common origin of all people 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.180
 substantiate 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.979
 Leander Valley choked a real back thought that 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.590
 by the way 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.980
 Occasionally they meet fellows so other planets 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.559
 fortunately rare 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.689
 since the last time I have the moon on the cheek 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:05.889
 be determined 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.789
 we also found out that si 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.889
 they were supposed to have started in their earliest youth 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.930
 with a wildcard citizen 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.530
 yes that was his style one tends crash 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.910
 after the tristesse the mouth has become but that must be enough for the topic now 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.639
 high 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:22.720
 a pity, actually 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.129
 Thanks anyway for the wonderful interview 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.050
 I hope they stay with us and I will be allowed to open a shop for them again 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.009
 next year 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.199
 same time same place 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.779
 so Nicosia one can be microseconds him 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.440
 I suddenly 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.710
 wonderful 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.960
 all the best for the earth all the best for you we will meet again in the new year 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.490
 Speaking of new year 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.009
 a new Year 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.990
 is like a new questions Kunkel 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.170
 as long as nothing unfavorable is known about him you should give the loan 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:03.889
 they hold the book to the broadcast 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.889
 and eating meat 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:12.189
 and next Wednesday 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:17.009
 Experience a new adventure this time outside to solve the rainforest 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.219
 people try on the internet 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:24.050
 but they are the last of their kind 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.689
 is there still a chance for her? 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:28.029
 Know adventure 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:29.929
 on Wednesday 22 4 15
