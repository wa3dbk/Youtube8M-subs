living at least at this point I tell me
so<00:00:07.529> did<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.700> adventures<00:00:09.179> are<00:00:09.360> probably<00:00:09.900> even

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
so did the adventures are probably even

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.259

the<00:00:10.139> misadventures<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.130> film<00:00:11.400> make<00:00:12.090> you

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
the misadventures of the film make you

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.020 
the misadventures of the film make you
value<00:00:12.630> yours<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> little<00:00:13.410> ma<00:00:13.880> hmm<00:00:14.940> I

don't force the adventures but I think

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.620 
don't force the adventures but I think
it<00:00:17.369> was<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.699> was<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> very<00:00:18.390> memorable

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
experience it was definitely a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.279 
experience it was definitely a
once-in-a-lifetime<00:00:21.150> experience<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.109> kind

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.439 
once-in-a-lifetime experience the kind
of<00:00:22.380> things<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> got<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.420> I

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
of things that I got to do and that I

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.570 
of things that I got to do and that I
got<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.810> see<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:26.039> whole<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.460> whole

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
got to see and the whole the whole

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.330 
got to see and the whole the whole
process<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.150> making<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.570> film<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.949> think

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
process of making the film and I think

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.890 
process of making the film and I think
that<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.820> if<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.090> feel<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.630> during

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
that if you if you feel that way during

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.299 
that if you if you feel that way during
the<00:00:30.990> making<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> film<00:00:31.619> somewhere<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> does

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the making of the film somewhere it does

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.630 
the making of the film somewhere it does
show<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.669> screen<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.710> can<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.130> I

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
show on screen so can you see it I

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.459 
show on screen so can you see it I
really<00:00:36.420> did<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.020> most<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
really did see it in most of the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.130 
really did see it in most of the
interviews<00:00:37.829> we've<00:00:38.160> been<00:00:38.280> watching<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:39.140> have

you know we've we kept saying is that

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.139 
you know we've we kept saying is that
chemistry<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.800> something<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.489> supposed

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
chemistry is something that is supposed

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.240 
chemistry is something that is supposed
to<00:00:45.270> exist<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.690> paper<00:00:45.930> I've<00:00:46.739> done<00:00:46.950> three<00:00:47.219> films

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
to exist on paper I've done three films

where people really commented on the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.920 
where people really commented on the
chemistry<00:00:49.950> chemistry<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.910> got<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.480> those<00:00:51.719> on

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
okay you don't have to guess who this

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.190 
okay you don't have to guess who this
person<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> who<00:01:09.390> these<00:01:09.510> people<00:01:09.570> are<00:01:09.990> but

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
person is a who these people are but

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.570 
person is a who these people are but
continuous<00:01:10.650> abiding<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.460> we

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
continuous abiding it's like that we

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.870 
continuous abiding it's like that we
hardly<00:01:11.820> knew<00:01:12.540> each<00:01:12.570> other<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.260> um<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.860> mean<00:01:14.700> my

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
hardly knew each other so um I mean my

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.039 
hardly knew each other so um I mean my
point<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> don't<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.930> know

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
point is that you don't have to know

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
point is that you don't have to know
each<00:01:16.200> other<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> good

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
each other to have a to have a good

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.460 
each other to have a to have a good
chemistry<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.420> don't<00:01:18.630> think<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.110> guys<00:01:19.259> do

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
chemistry I don't think but you guys do

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.630 
chemistry I don't think but you guys do
have<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.650> personal<00:01:19.950> equation<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.580> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
have a personal equation as and you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.160 
have a personal equation as and you
don't<00:01:21.030> hate<00:01:21.150> each<00:01:21.180> other<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.720> yeah<00:01:22.020> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
of found a middle ground first it was

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.870 
of found a middle ground first it was
like<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.409> can't<00:01:28.740> stand<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:29.729> now

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
like you know I can't stand you but now
