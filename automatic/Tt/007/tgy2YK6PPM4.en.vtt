 less slow or no-man's land

 it promises to rely heavily on 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.500
 tv series and will include elements such as 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.260
 survival by location 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.530
 safe choices between right and wrong and 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.530
 Of course many a bis for now he does not 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.110

 December for you who do not know this 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.979
 it's not the new tomb raider 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.650
 it follows a line of gameplay 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.290
 different with isometric vision and 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.720
 multiplayer for four players already 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.159
 ray software within the intended 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.890
 for 2015 and the game and sports the fc 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.909
 receives new fighters and the best of 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.520
 grace 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.829
 In all, three athletes are 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.439
 out of the original cast 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.440
 they come by means of an update that 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.660
 still brings corrections to some flaws 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.060
 urias in the gameplay as for example 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.280
 in the bar is mine and not now 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.980
 regenerates while the fighter is in the 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.920
 defensive mode and things do not go 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.780
 nothing good at crytek the company lost 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.450
 important producers 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.210
 responsible for roots or on the pump and 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.640
 another responsible for crises 3 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.350
 what the industry says is that they are 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.440
 going through a serious financial crisis 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.320
 which is currently being denied by 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.130
 and there is a light at the end of the tunnel 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.500
 for next day nursery school and dog that is 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.050
 responsible for iconic games 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.690
 character said in an interview that 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.410
 they do not rule out making games again 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.420
 his 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.090
 the problem is that they are currently 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.610
 other types of games 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.890
 geared towards exploration and history 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.640
 with deep east type characters 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.620
 or vans 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.410
 Let's hope they change their minds. 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.350
 it's because it would be really cool to crash back 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.390
 then it was the gamer bridge today hope 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.860
 If you liked it, forget it. 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.110
 that range to help spread 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.550
 and subscribe to the channel so you do not lose 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.440
 the next contents that are 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.180
 planning a novelty there and you do not 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.180
