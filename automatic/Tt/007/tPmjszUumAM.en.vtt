you<00:01:58.320> one<00:01:58.530> hand<00:01:58.850> maybe<00:02:00.649> so<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.829> kind<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.189> goes

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
you one hand maybe so this kind of goes

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.370 
you one hand maybe so this kind of goes
in<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.750> fits<00:02:06.810> right<00:02:07.200> in

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
in just like this so it fits right in

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
in just like this so it fits right in
between<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.860> frame<00:02:08.160> rails<00:02:08.190> there<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.940> goes

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
between the frame rails there it goes

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.650 
between the frame rails there it goes
right<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.509> bottom<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:12.060> don't<00:02:12.390> know<00:02:12.599> if

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
right to the bottom and I don't know if

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.370 
right to the bottom and I don't know if
I<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:13.050> really<00:02:13.140> show

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
I can really show

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.590 
I can really show
with<00:02:13.680> one<00:02:13.860> hand<00:02:14.070> but<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:15.120> reason<00:02:15.390> why<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.540> ended

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
with one hand but the reason why I ended

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.150 
with one hand but the reason why I ended
up<00:02:15.840> choosing<00:02:16.110> these<00:02:16.320> batteries<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:16.920> because

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
up choosing these batteries is because

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.530 
up choosing these batteries is because
blocka<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:20.240> just<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.390> right

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
blocka for like this is a just the right

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.360 
blocka for like this is a just the right
width<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.410> fit<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.740> between<00:02:22.830> those<00:02:23.130> frame

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
width to fit in between those frame

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.300 
width to fit in between those frame
rails<00:02:23.580> in<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.790> bottom<00:02:24.770> so<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:25.920> absolutely

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
rails in the bottom so it's absolutely

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.930 
rails in the bottom so it's absolutely
perfect

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
perfect

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.380 
perfect
and<00:02:27.710> I<00:02:28.710> just<00:02:29.370> confirm<00:02:29.760> with<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.970> few<00:02:30.120> minutes

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
and I just confirm with a few minutes

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.020 
and I just confirm with a few minutes
ago<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.070> one<00:02:32.280> thing<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.580> wasn't<00:02:32.760> sure

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
ago that this is one thing I wasn't sure

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.170 
ago that this is one thing I wasn't sure
about<00:02:33.120> because<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.600> so<00:02:33.690> tight<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.970> I

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
about because it's so tight is that I

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.380 
about because it's so tight is that I
can<00:02:36.480> fit<00:02:37.070> three<00:02:38.070> vertical<00:02:38.490> stacks<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.300> the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
can fit three vertical stacks of the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.580 
can fit three vertical stacks of the
batteries<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.970> there'll<00:02:41.970> be<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.230> block<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.410> four

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
batteries so there'll be a block of four

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.130 
batteries so there'll be a block of four
here<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.070> block<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.580> four<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.360> then

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
here a block of four here and then

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.870 
here a block of four here and then
coming<00:02:46.530> up<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.890> can<00:02:47.130> actually<00:02:47.220> fit<00:02:47.490> three

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
coming up I can actually fit three

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.410 
coming up I can actually fit three
levels<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.480> batteries<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.460> I<00:02:50.460> can<00:02:51.000> fit<00:02:51.210> all<00:02:51.240> the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
levels of batteries so I can fit all the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.700 
levels of batteries so I can fit all the
batteries<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.840> here<00:02:51.870> without<00:02:52.350> too<00:02:52.560> much

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
batteries in here without too much

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.310 
batteries in here without too much
trouble<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:54.300> really<00:02:54.690> tight<00:02:54.900> because

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
trouble and it's really tight because

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.520 
trouble and it's really tight because
even<00:02:55.800> with<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:57.660> inch<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.110> between<00:02:58.410> each

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
even with just one inch in between each

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.970 
even with just one inch in between each
vertical<00:02:59.100> stack<00:02:59.490> and<00:02:59.960> then<00:03:00.960> there's<00:03:01.860> only

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
vertical stack and then there's only

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.910 
vertical stack and then there's only
probably<00:03:02.610> two<00:03:03.030> inches<00:03:03.390> left<00:03:03.660> or<00:03:04.200> maybe<00:03:04.590> three

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
probably two inches left or maybe three

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.100 
probably two inches left or maybe three
or<00:03:05.070> four<00:03:05.250> inches<00:03:05.580> no<00:03:06.330> more<00:03:06.510> on<00:03:06.600> four<00:03:06.840> inches

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
or four inches no more on four inches

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.500 
or four inches no more on four inches
for<00:03:07.290> sure<00:03:07.470> between<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.760> top<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.300> table

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
for sure between the top of the table

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.930 
for sure between the top of the table
batteries<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.500> tank<00:03:10.770> so<00:03:11.580> it's<00:03:11.700> really

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
batteries and the tank so it's really

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.050 
batteries and the tank so it's really
tight<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.630> they'll<00:03:12.960> fit<00:03:13.230> in<00:03:13.380> there<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.620> think

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
tight but they'll fit in there I think

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.540 
tight but they'll fit in there I think
so<00:03:15.060> I'm<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.510> gonna<00:03:15.800> make<00:03:16.800> up<00:03:17.040> these<00:03:17.250> racks

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
so I'm just gonna make up these racks

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.540 
so I'm just gonna make up these racks
and<00:03:18.000> then<00:03:18.350> so<00:03:19.350> my<00:03:19.650> general<00:03:19.950> idea<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.370> I'm

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
and then so my general idea is that I'm

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.160 
and then so my general idea is that I'm
gonna<00:03:20.670> run<00:03:21.530> six<00:03:22.530> vertical<00:03:23.660> aluminum<00:03:24.660> these

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
gonna run six vertical aluminum these

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.240 
gonna run six vertical aluminum these
angle<00:03:25.620> pieces<00:03:25.830> or<00:03:26.310> possibly<00:03:27.150> some<00:03:27.300> square<00:03:27.660> and

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
angle pieces or possibly some square and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.750 
angle pieces or possibly some square and
those<00:03:29.250> will<00:03:29.430> come<00:03:29.580> up<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.060> then<00:03:30.990> these<00:03:31.760> these

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
those will come up and then these these

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.670 
those will come up and then these these
pieces<00:03:33.060> running<00:03:33.480> across<00:03:33.810> they'll<00:03:34.170> just<00:03:34.380> all

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
pieces running across they'll just all

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.100 
pieces running across they'll just all
have<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.010> bunch<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:36.000> those<00:03:36.090> running<00:03:36.420> across<00:03:36.660> for

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
have a bunch of those running across for

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.360 
have a bunch of those running across for
where<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.980> batteries<00:03:38.340> sit<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:40.560> yeah<00:03:41.160> pretty

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
where the batteries sit so yeah pretty

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.010 
where the batteries sit so yeah pretty
simple<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.000> should<00:03:42.150> be<00:03:42.300> really<00:03:42.630> light<00:03:42.900> in

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
simple and it should be really light in

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.900 
simple and it should be really light in
the<00:03:43.110> end<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.250> should<00:03:44.400> be<00:03:44.490> plenty<00:03:44.700> strong

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
the end and it should be plenty strong

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.699 
the end and it should be plenty strong
because<00:03:45.180> I'm<00:03:45.300> gonna<00:03:45.390> hopefully<00:03:46.320> tie<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.560> into

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
because I'm gonna hopefully tie it into

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.280 
because I'm gonna hopefully tie it into
a<00:03:46.890> few<00:03:47.790> spots<00:03:48.030> in<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.270> frame<00:03:48.510> here<00:03:48.840> maybe<00:03:49.200> even

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
a few spots in the frame here maybe even

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.949 
a few spots in the frame here maybe even
this<00:03:49.680> big<00:03:49.920> plate<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.490> it's<00:03:51.420> gonna<00:03:51.540> be<00:03:51.750> bolted

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
this big plate and it's gonna be bolted

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.920 
this big plate and it's gonna be bolted
into<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.790> this<00:03:53.790> little<00:03:54.000> stringer<00:03:54.480> down<00:03:54.660> here

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
into the this little stringer down here

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.630 
into the this little stringer down here
in<00:03:55.020> various<00:03:55.290> places<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:55.980> hope<00:03:56.130> so

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
in various places to the hope so

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.520 
in various places to the hope so
yeah<00:03:57.390> it<00:03:57.450> should<00:03:57.570> be<00:03:57.660> pretty<00:03:57.990> strong<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.470> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
yeah it should be pretty strong in the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.890 
yeah it should be pretty strong in the
end<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.720> what<00:04:00.720> else<00:04:02.240> that's<00:04:03.240> about<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.720> for

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
end and what else that's about it for

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.570
