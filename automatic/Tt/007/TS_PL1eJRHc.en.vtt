00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.870
 the mod 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.450
 we are going to start by users of 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.670
 issued that appears to disappear 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.350
 execute write on run percent 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.840
 app data percent and that's why second 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.390
 we write here percent percent 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.610
 app data percent talked in your folder 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.020
 roaming they go to their point more graft and already 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.210
 who have created the minecraft version 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.780

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.629
 we'll run mics so they see if 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.189
 the good mod works and in milan cher no 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.900
 it is necessary to have this open with 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.260
 some other launcher can close it 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.519
 and all because if they have it good it is already 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.519
 your decision they want to have 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.590
 open because they work a lot 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.510
