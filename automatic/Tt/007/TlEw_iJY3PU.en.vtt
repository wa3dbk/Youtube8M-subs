we<00:00:16.740> don't<00:00:16.920> use<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> lot<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.520> machinery<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.300> our

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
we don't use a lot of machinery in our

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.839 
we don't use a lot of machinery in our
process<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.590> are<00:00:19.770> really<00:00:20.070> using<00:00:20.369> all<00:00:20.730> of

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
process so we we are really using all of

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.999 
process so we we are really using all of
the<00:00:21.060> old<00:00:21.210> methods<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.380> goes<00:00:22.560> back<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
the old methods it goes back to the

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.849 
the old methods it goes back to the
original<00:00:23.460> traditions<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.150> rolls-royce<00:00:27.859> with

bros Roy just slowing it down slightly
and<00:00:31.080> trying<00:00:31.770> to<00:00:31.830> get<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.010> best<00:00:32.160> performance

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and trying to get the best performance

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.250 
and trying to get the best performance
out<00:00:33.150> of<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> robust<00:00:33.570> if<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.750> possibly<00:00:33.930> can

about rushing the car through that's
that's<00:00:36.750> that's<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.140> difference<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.650> main

we can use every all of our knowledge
and<00:01:02.240> put<00:01:02.450> that<00:01:02.540> into<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.810> robot<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:03.410> this<00:01:03.740> can

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
and put that into the robot and this can

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.150 
and put that into the robot and this can
then<00:01:03.980> replicate<00:01:04.790> this<00:01:05.239> time<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.020> time<00:01:06.080> again

spray kota so when you stretch them you

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.990 
spray kota so when you stretch them you
can<00:01:27.800> see<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.950> different<00:01:28.190> kind<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.460> neat<00:01:28.580> rolls

royce leather it's got completely all
the<00:01:31.310> way<00:01:31.400> through<00:01:31.640> if<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.240> stretch<00:01:32.479> it<00:01:32.510> the

the way through if you stretch it the

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.650 
the way through if you stretch it the
color<00:01:33.740> remains<00:01:34.220> constant<00:01:34.580> on<00:01:35.090> average<00:01:35.330> we

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
color remains constant on average we

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.719 
color remains constant on average we
look<00:01:35.930> at<00:01:36.140> about<00:01:36.650> between<00:01:36.979> three<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:37.430> four

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
look at about between three and four

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.420 
look at about between three and four
hours<00:01:38.150> per<00:01:38.450> body<00:01:38.950> just<00:01:39.950> for<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.160> college

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
hours per body just for the college

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.590 
hours per body just for the college
process<00:01:42.369> we<00:01:43.369> have<00:01:43.460> four<00:01:43.700> guys<00:01:43.910> in<00:01:44.210> each<00:01:44.330> booth

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
process we have four guys in each booth

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.510 
process we have four guys in each booth
so<00:01:45.080> you<00:01:45.200> guys<00:01:45.440> assigned<00:01:45.800> a<00:01:45.979> quarter<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.369> the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
so you guys assigned a quarter of the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.580 
so you guys assigned a quarter of the
car<00:01:46.729> they<00:01:47.180> jump<00:01:47.540> straight<00:01:47.810> on<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.110> car<00:01:48.350> and

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
car they jump straight on the car and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.550 
car they jump straight on the car and
start<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.070> sand<00:01:49.340> away<00:01:49.640> they<00:01:50.300> then<00:01:50.630> check<00:01:51.200> over

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
start to sand away they then check over

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.290 
start to sand away they then check over
for<00:01:51.710> any<00:01:51.830> infections<00:01:52.550> they<00:01:52.700> may<00:01:52.880> have<00:01:52.970> missed

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
for any infections they may have missed

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.540 
for any infections they may have missed

or anything which which you would find

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.520 
or anything which which you would find
really<00:01:55.910> difficult<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.690> see<00:01:56.900> but<00:01:57.259> they<00:01:57.410> will

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
really difficult to see but they will

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.710 
really difficult to see but they will
still<00:01:57.680> find<00:01:58.040> it<00:01:58.220> when<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.090> actually<00:01:59.240> see<00:01:59.600> it
