got<00:00:55.900> them<00:00:56.110> packaged<00:00:56.560> here<00:00:56.680> in<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.070> muffler

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
got them packaged here in the muffler

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.330 
got them packaged here in the muffler
inside<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:59.170> with<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.740> addition<00:01:00.070> of<00:01:00.160> some

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
inside and with the addition of some

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.330 
inside and with the addition of some
heat<00:01:00.580> we're<00:01:00.850> able<00:01:01.060> to<00:01:01.390> catalyze<00:01:01.810> the<00:01:02.410> exhaust

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
heat we're able to catalyze the exhaust

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.690

and<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:04.360> depth<00:01:04.720> to<00:01:04.989> then<00:01:05.620> produce<00:01:05.920> basically

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
and the depth to then produce basically

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.630 
and the depth to then produce basically
water<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.780> nitrogen<00:01:08.740> which<00:01:08.920> makes<00:01:09.190> up<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.610> good

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
water and nitrogen which makes up a good

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.300 
water and nitrogen which makes up a good
portion<00:01:10.000> of<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.330> air<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:11.500> it<00:01:11.650> just<00:01:11.830> exits

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
portion of the air then it just exits

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.520 
portion of the air then it just exits
out<00:01:12.490> of<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.790> muffler<00:01:13.390> here<00:01:13.780> we've<00:01:14.380> got<00:01:14.470> a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
out of the muffler here we've got a

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.920 
out of the muffler here we've got a
couple<00:01:14.830> ports<00:01:15.340> where<00:01:15.760> temperature<00:01:16.510> sensors

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
couple ports where temperature sensors

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.500 
couple ports where temperature sensors
would<00:01:17.140> be<00:01:17.400> installed<00:01:18.400> on<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.909> actual<00:01:19.360> machine

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
would be installed on the actual machine

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.330 
would be installed on the actual machine
such<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.050> way<00:01:20.260> to<00:01:20.320> maintain<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.980> proper

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
such a way to maintain the proper

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.240 
such a way to maintain the proper
temperatures<00:01:22.030> for<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.740> chemical<00:01:23.740> reactions

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
temperatures for the chemical reactions

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.190 
temperatures for the chemical reactions
and<00:01:24.550> then<00:01:24.760> on<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.060> backside<00:01:25.330> of<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.840> muffler

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
and then on the backside of the muffler

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.290 
and then on the backside of the muffler
is<00:01:26.440> where<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:27.100> would<00:01:27.250> have<00:01:27.460> a<00:01:27.490> knock<00:01:27.790> sensor

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
is where you would have a knock sensor

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.540 
is where you would have a knock sensor
to<00:01:28.840> ensure<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.229> we've<00:01:29.530> actually<00:01:29.770> met<00:01:30.250> the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
to ensure that we've actually met the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.540 
to ensure that we've actually met the
exhaust<00:01:31.270> gas<00:01:32.110> requirements<00:01:33.010> to<00:01:33.250> meet<00:01:33.370> the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
exhaust gas requirements to meet the
