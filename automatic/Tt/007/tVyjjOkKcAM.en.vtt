00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.650
 not 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.830
 in the 17 th century France the verandas are related to the garden of the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.930
 seas or orangery 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.930
 we were the plants to protect them from frost and cold 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.980
 it represented uncertain art of living and a certain refinement for the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.439
 bigger steel greenhouses like the garden of plants or a 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.890
 autumn concert were built in the 19th century witnessed a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.669
 certain refined and bucolic lifestyle today the verandas 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.090
 do not come back to fashion 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.100
 and these are places that we take pleasure in decorating the verandas 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.100
 exception is the subject of your team this season 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.520
 by then the doors of the contemporary train 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.000
 gold of what is good even millions of other Girondins who have accomplished 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.220
 it now offers all the modern comforts 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.480
 four owners will open their doors for them no doubt 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.480
 their veranda then within sight of the vineyards it will replace 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.960
 this 3 Napoleon style veranda is inspired by 19th century models and 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.730
 occupies the ground floor of a house in western Paris 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.460
 the elegance and finesse of the steel structure also makes up a place 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 magical tailor-made among these rumors 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.200
 hello on the rise 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.650
 we did it at the farm to meet and then 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.420
 so to present a company that makes glasses we will move forward from 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.460
 how many generations for three generations 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.830
 the ambassador make this admission absolutely i imagine that the techniques and 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.080
 materials that evolves between with always the same way as before 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.110
 that we work in particular the way there are always farmers who 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.609
 crosses with the forge 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:32.699
 but also modern means warns machines that allows for 

00:01:32.699 --> 00:01:35.569
 fold cut us off for the triple triple glazing equation 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.309
 glazing on double glazing also and argon gas today the 

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:42.649
 constraints and environmental standards requires us peace to 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.119
 his soul and double glazing with the regattas inside that protects 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.100
 bad weather a porch like this 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.590
 tony how long does it make then to make porch like that 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.600
 it's about 14 hours 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.950
 at 4 or 5 o'clock for the break and after 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 so for the growth pose remains a bit take up losing 16 years 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.549
 minimum 15 days of work so it is inevitably and it is always the question 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:04.470
 who's angry 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.610
 an important point of their holidays at the sea to tell between two and four 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.780
 thousand euros per square meter 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.610
 but for re-contextualized compared to there is a house like 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.940
 this one in a prestigious place is not much thing it is an added value 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.420
 it will stay in time it appears that in the port is the rotor 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.020
 even a very long time we will see if the owner 600 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.020
 especially through the person is then necessary 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.599
 As a reminder 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.060
 thank you draws you home not so simple so this veranda is a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.469
 living room now 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.510
 complete or is it still just passing through teaching 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:38.120
 ka-sat is completely 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.689
 sale that is very nice to send today is nice 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.439
 great sun in the festive heart despite all the time it is practically 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.969
 it is true that he does very very good things more or less in this piece 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.829
 these are the two radiators here that are enough to heat the veranda we 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:50.950
 have floor heating 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.470
 okay and we have surface on each side in fact the fed will make 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.890
 which allows the isère to actually have broken anyway nice what is it 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.579
 is very very cold their wake 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.510
 a little cool from 10 years old serves as a party but otherwise actually I am 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.209
 happy that the problem is very good even the summer thanks to three-quarters 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.670
 full so it breaks a little bit and so it's very scary with regard to 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.329
 regards the decoration 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.709
 we are in total harmony with the rest of the house yes we do with my 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.119
 husband we spoiled the Indians had antiques with however not exempt from 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:21.179
 porcelain 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:25.019
 and percent and antique salon I do not know anymore the perfect 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.819
 hyphen between the outside and the inside of the house and the canopy 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:28.579
 risk 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.379
 in a farm in fact 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.409
 we need the verdière it must be this one with tonight at this 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.849
 respect warned Saturday early 20th century both the recovery started 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.219
 thirty square meters the fair presents five troops because it is not 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.049
 necessary because these are the 25 years later and privileges named 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.359
 today the team but it allows us to actually keep our 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.199
 children who are starting to be a bit tall 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.319
 but but here I do not know what we are not without each other 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.049
 so actually it's a room to live a very nice room 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:58.769
 he is very often 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.069
 I did not submit pleasure anyway thank you for the verdict
