00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
they go and immediately it does respond

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.499 
they go and immediately it does respond
so<00:04:51.169> then<00:04:51.319> you<00:04:51.409> can<00:04:51.559> count<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:52.099> I<00:04:52.369> think<00:04:52.969> it<00:04:53.389> is<00:04:53.479> a

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
so then you can count so I think it is a

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.079 
so then you can count so I think it is a
great<00:04:53.989> great<00:04:54.529> interactive<00:04:55.309> toy<00:04:55.519> like<00:04:55.789> I<00:04:55.879> said
