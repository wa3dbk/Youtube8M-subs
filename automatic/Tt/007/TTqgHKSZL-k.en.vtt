00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 no 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.600
 and 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.960
 m 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.960

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.839
 Hello everyone I'm still at home 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.169
 sony and this time I'm in 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.820
 xperia z2 tablet company then 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.840
 at the level of the technical sheet we will 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.969
 still the hand please even if 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.430
 normally you know it we already have 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.899
 a 10.1-inch screen that is capable 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.449
 to display a definition of type full 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.159
 1080p hd 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.129
 we also have a processor 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:46.769
 snapdragon 1 801 clocked at 2.3 gigahertz 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.699
 couple and a gpu adreno 330 and three 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.070
 judges to RAM 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.759
 storage space is limited to 16 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.900
 Giga with a micro SD card slot 

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.000
 on some models we will have a 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.240
 connection 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.460
 with networks type iv gt e and then 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.820
 otherwise obviously we have an exmor sensor 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.010
 of 8.1 million pixels that will be 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.720
 able to film in full hd 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.120
 the battery for its part reaches the six 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.220
 milliamperes mines and one has the mode 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.170
 stamina who is in the party what 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.810
 should normally confer a very 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.670
 good autonomy 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 so at the design level and well we 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.080
 still have a screen that is rather 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.760
 in 16/10 format I feel we have 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.710
 wide border on each side so that 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.090
 it's a little embarrassing it's true 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.730
 now the good side of it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.720
 to make it easier to apprehend 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.820
 canton hold the tablet in hand on 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.440
 will not risk ripping on 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.910
 the screen and that's already already 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.430
 not bad 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.140
 otherwise the physical buttons are 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.060
 find either the slice left game we have 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.620
 the power button first 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.900
 man so he's acting as a signature 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.060
 in all the latest products launched by 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.640
 sony we went from buttons to the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.910
 volume control on the right slice 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.110
 there is absolutely nothing and on the 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.790
 lower slice we will find the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.500
 connector for the dock as well as the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.270
 headphone jack 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.410
 the access hatches she is on 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.600
 the top and so that's where power can 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.390
 housing the micro SD card and for the 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.020
 models that proposes it to the port for 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.020
 SIM card 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.220
 on top we will also have a 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.620
 infrared port to take control 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.870
 of our household equipment the doubs 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.920
 the tablet is dark or clear 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.360
 depends on the version since it is 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.110
 declines in black and white and the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.250
 texture and matte 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.450
 on the other hand we can notice 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.100
 that it attracts a lot of traces of 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.420
 fingers what is really very 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.800
 impressive with this tablet I 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.300
 believe it's his weight already for 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.620
 start and his finesse since his 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.570
 the slimmest tablet on the market 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.300
 it is even thinner than an ipad r 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.500
 it's still rather impressive 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.900
 considering that it is treated 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.420
 to resist the dust 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.300
 splashing and dips 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.800
 so the verdict down for now my 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.760
 impressions are pretty positive it's 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.370
 true that I find that the borders in 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.430
 back of the screen are pretty awesome 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.900
 but in the end we get used to it rather well 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.099
 the quality of the screen against it 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.920
 is really very impressive 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.530
 I think in my opinion that can win at 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.150
 movies quietly 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.250
 at the bottom of the bed it can be pretty cool 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.569
 after for the rest obviously 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.130
 wait to have it on test so that I 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.290
 can give me a really good idea 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.800
 really more accurate anyway 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.850
 it's a beautiful object and that's for sure 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.850
 he will not leave anyone indifferent
