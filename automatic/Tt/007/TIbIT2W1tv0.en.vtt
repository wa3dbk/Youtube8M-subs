00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.490
 for youtube today I want to teach you 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.650
 some tips to get the strings of 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.300
 any song I wanted to make this video 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.280
 because many of you ask me 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.740
 about strumming I think it's a very 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.179
 complicated for all of us what 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.490
 first you have to do to play 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.550
 any song with some strum and 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.609
 be easy, the complicated is to do the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.230
 Strum easier for you salgado 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.630
 example in this song by juan solo 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.109
 dear heart the strum comes more or 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.109
 less so 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.090
 this can be a complicated receipt for 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.790
 you so something very simple that you can 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.460
 to do is start with something very easy 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.730
 example thus only a trait towards 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.730
 down 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.990
 with just one strum down the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.510
 song would be something like this 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:11.060
 heart two points of eternal foolishness me 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 has nothing is for lonely by world 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.380
 roamed the streets semi-colon 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.080
 since you do this first step you can 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 complicate the strumming a bit by making it 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.250
 as you want but more complete or something 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.270
 A) Yes 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.490
 dear heart all together 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.340
 the eternal foolishness 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:42.170
 has once again lonely for not 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.670
 through the streets vagabonds semicolon and 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.880
 what I am doing is simply a 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.439
 trait down another up and in 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:57.189
 not so difficult silence went without brakes 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:02:04.060
 behind the first one that steals a weight 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:04.060
 so naive a thousand revolutions to have 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.539
 since you have a second version you can 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.940
 make a third version that sounds a 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.069
 little more complete yet for example 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.069
 something like dear heart 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.180
 is the one who has once again scream is 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.730
 around the world 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.700
 through the streets to finish 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.740
 and without brakes 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.110
 first weight 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.690
 and so you can go a little harder 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.550
 strum until you get something 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.200
 more complete something that sounds more 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.210
 interesting and something that you like 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.950
 for this song I liked something like that 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.950
 with bass and strum for example 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.780
 that looks a bit like the version 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.550
 original of Juan only the theme is that no 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.560
 you stay without touching the song alone 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.390
 because you do not get the strum that I do 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.269
 here in the tutorials or what does the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.730
 artist in his original song pulls out a 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.190
 version that comes out to you may be the 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.530
 simple like a strum down or 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.629
 it can be a little more complicated not 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.150
 matter in all my tutorials I'll 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.560
 I teach some version of the strum that 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.440
 make you easy for you to be able to 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.110
 do but it does not mean that it's always 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.790
 the original version the idea is that I 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.610
 I want to help you to actually touch the 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.079
 song and do not limit yourself just because 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.430
 you get the strum 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.130
 then to start playing a 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.160
 song starts with something very simple 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.049
 it can be a single strum down 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.150
 Step number two complicates the 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.340
 strum you can not make one towards 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.890
 down 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.870
 up and a hit for example and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.849
 step number 3 and you get the second 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.360
 version of the strum complicate a bit 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:01.260
 more it can still be something like that 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.260
 and more complete 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.890
 the idea is that you start playing that you do not 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.230
 you stop because you do not know the 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.180
 rasgueo internalize them simple then what 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.430
 Complicate and it does not matter that it does not look like 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.319
 so much to the original version I hope that 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.539
