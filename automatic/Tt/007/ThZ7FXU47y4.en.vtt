00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.409
 historic win of the football club barcelona 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.409
 in the stadium of the Mediterranean games the barsa won 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.310
 almería for 8 to 0 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.679
 in a match in which the whole 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.369
 of them is guardiola reserved 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.479
 a pique 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.370
 who won this match 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.540
 And he did 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.860
 the squatters fontás in the central axis of the defense 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.429
 next to Carlos Puyol 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.030
 barsa that resolved the meeting already in the first minutes of fact 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.400
 at 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.579
 26 of the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.250
 At first sight he already dominated 0 to three and that he had some chances before 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:50.260
 mark the first 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.760
 the day of more in elche leo messi returned to get a fateful 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.330
 bolt 101 in the first division league since he is a football club player 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.510
 Barcelona 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.670
 the match started very animated by this occasion for fiat and in fact it was the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.720
 most important of the whole party but 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.810
 at the moment when Barcelona opened the can practically ended 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.230
 already the meeting 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.290
 and only the guardiola team was the maximum dominator 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.440
 we are in mourning there were the first actions of the start the meeting in the 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.070
 minute 7 messi pointed is to put that value 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.700
 to the right of diego alves' goal the barsa played great and he 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.830
 He associated with wonder very close to the front of the area 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.220
 and in the minute 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.370
 17 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.080
 Leo Messi got the 0 to 1 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.230
 with that obstacle I see strong 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.040
 or the left one marked 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
 the Argentine sub 20 football in the first division league 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.050
 the barsa was still playing 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.520
 and he met fortune 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.190
 at minute 19 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.880
 Andres Iniesta 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.110
 just hit hard that ball inside the small area and send the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 ball below the crossbar of the goal of alves 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.490
 put the barsa 0 to 2 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 minute 19 we will see how to finish at point-blank 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:13.369
 with the toe of the wedding the fountain 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:14.679
 they would pass 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.849
 very few minutes pacts like 7 for that villa 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.659
 will send the ball to max weber 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.199
 and whoever has scored a goal in own goal 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.149
 would be the Peruvian acasiete 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:28.219
 santiago acasiete 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.219
 scored the zero to three for the barsa in the 26th minute 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.729
 of the first period 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.839
 we have again the maxwell combination that wants to center that ball 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:40.399
 to look for a partner 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.229
 if you are 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.039
 but the surprise of the goal in own goal 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.139
 already almost armies 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.669
 in the stadium 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.899
 of the Mediterranean games to formalize it 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.609
 poor s 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.589
 zero to three but see 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.799
 patience after more than forty meters 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.810
 of the debutant jc the central one that today replaced 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.229
 aquilanti cent 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:07.979
 for pedro the canary that solves wonder 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.229
 in 95 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.229
 scoring the fourth goal of Barcelona 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.699
 there were ten minutes and the barsa already had that stage 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.399
 important four-goal 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.399
 the barsa who would still get a red 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.080
 on the edge of rest 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.150
 in the absence of five minutes in which ends up finishing the ball is messi 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.789
 after another action 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.329
 on the right side 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.669
 third marked his tenth second goal in this way 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.439
 the Argentine his 100th goal in the first division league 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.679
 I managed to finally close the game that this result so bulky 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.349
 your attempt 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.349
 the almería surprise 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.989
 on the edge of the break the goal of Victor Vidal who had little work 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.449
 in this meeting of the sixteenth day 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.190
 there was the entire second half the public 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.230
 obviously very upset very angry about this result 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.489
 it seemed in the boot before the almeria 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.099
 efe 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.900
 at least cut distances but 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.789
 just in case he avoided it 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.399
 Vctor Valdés with that shot of piatti na best play of all the 

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.550
 second part for the lillo team 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.840
 from there he gave rest to xavi and iniesta 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.439
 inside the little borja 

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.819
 and he also had his afternoon 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.819
 the azulgrana youth squad that in the 17th minute marked 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.349
 in 0 to 6 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.099
 I could not believe it, diego alves 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.629
 buoyant erc and c's has scored this way his first goal in the league first 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:51.469
 division 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.020
 in a play that starts in the crescent 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.529
 Leo Messi 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:05:00.189
 it ends up getting rid of everyone as well as buoyant overcomes the central 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.770
 he has already finished raising the ball slightly each time against the barsa 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:06.439
 it was becoming 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.439
 in a danger play and in the 22nd minute 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.110
 the villa shot is used by messi to 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.479
 top off 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.319
 seventh of the azulgrana 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:21.360
 his goal number 101 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.430
 in the league of first division 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.650
 in the years that he has been defending the barcelona shirt and his goal by 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.870
 one hundred and thirteen of the current edition of the bbva league 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.339
 but the party had left 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:34.469
 a collector 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.900
 and it would have been marked by santiago quiche in the 28th minute 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:40.729
 still 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.729
 with 17 minutes to go 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:44.809
 the barsa 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:47.099
 closed a great win 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.869
 to match one achieved in the palms in the year 59 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.800
 this hard-hitting almeria 0 barcelona
