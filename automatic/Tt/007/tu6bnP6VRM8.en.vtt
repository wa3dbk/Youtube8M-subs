so now let's go reap the benefits and
enjoy<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.280> future<00:04:39.610> but<00:04:40.120> first<00:04:40.330> we<00:04:40.420> gotta<00:04:40.570> go

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
enjoy the future but first we gotta go

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.679 
enjoy the future but first we gotta go
through<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.900> prison

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 
through the prison

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:44.689 
through the prison
like<00:04:43.319> you<00:04:43.439> said<00:04:43.679> earlier<00:04:43.709> doesn't<00:04:44.489> really

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
like you said earlier doesn't really

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.169 
like you said earlier doesn't really
make<00:04:44.909> sense<00:04:44.969> that<00:04:45.299> you<00:04:45.539> can<00:04:45.719> use<00:04:46.709> the<00:04:47.179> bumpers

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:48.179 
make sense that you can use the bumpers

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:51.979 
make sense that you can use the bumpers
to<00:04:49.459> like<00:04:50.459> giving<00:04:50.819> up<00:04:50.909> your<00:04:51.029> ear<00:04:51.299> velocity<00:04:51.929> is

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:51.989 
to like giving up your ear velocity is

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:54.769 
to like giving up your ear velocity is
gonna<00:04:52.139> go<00:04:52.259> to<00:04:52.319> 0<00:04:52.559> at<00:04:52.769> some<00:04:52.979> point<00:04:53.219> yeah<00:04:53.879> I'm

00:04:54.769 --> 00:04:54.779 
gonna go to 0 at some point yeah I'm

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:59.869 
gonna go to 0 at some point yeah I'm
gonna<00:04:54.959> maybe<00:04:55.259> maybe<00:04:55.649> it's<00:04:56.179> maybe<00:04:57.179> it<00:04:58.879> like

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
gonna maybe maybe it's maybe it like

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.379 
gonna maybe maybe it's maybe it like
maybe<00:05:00.599> it's<00:05:00.809> not<00:05:00.929> just<00:05:01.289> your<00:05:02.179> momentum<00:05:03.179> maybe

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
maybe it's not just your momentum maybe

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.669 
maybe it's not just your momentum maybe
it's<00:05:03.539> not<00:05:03.629> just<00:05:03.899> your<00:05:03.989> momentum<00:05:04.409> from

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:04.679 
it's not just your momentum from

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.739 
it's not just your momentum from
traveling<00:05:05.489> in<00:05:05.699> a<00:05:05.819> straight<00:05:05.879> line<00:05:06.149> maybe<00:05:06.479> it's

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:06.749 
traveling in a straight line maybe it's

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:09.559 
traveling in a straight line maybe it's
also<00:05:07.219> from<00:05:08.219> rotating<00:05:08.699> about<00:05:08.879> your<00:05:09.089> own<00:05:09.209> center

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
also from rotating about your own center

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:12.769 
also from rotating about your own center
of<00:05:09.719> mass<00:05:10.519> travel<00:05:11.519> it<00:05:11.610> smashes<00:05:12.119> the<00:05:12.360> enemies

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779 
of mass travel it smashes the enemies

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:19.519 
of mass travel it smashes the enemies
too<00:05:13.049> that's<00:05:13.529> nice<00:05:13.769> oh<00:05:15.079> oh<00:05:18.050> my<00:05:19.050> god<00:05:19.319> this<00:05:19.469> is
