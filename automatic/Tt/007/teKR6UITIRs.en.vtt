00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.700
 hello everyone would not want to take off 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.470
 video about how to fix 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.040
 shutter slot for a memory card on 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.269
 playstation 2 slim because employees 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.519
 Russian post 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.190
 slightly damaged console which 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.050
 bought so it requires light 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.900
 repair I found an online video like 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.090
 it's easy to disassemble 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.340
 poddevaem and otkovyrivaem plastic 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.179
 the plugs below it hides the screws 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.679
 the screws just simply unscrew and all 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.450
 we just have to just pry 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.360
 something so plastic i like 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.020
 took the pick latch on the two halves 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.559
 console casing and literally under light 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.829
 by effort these latches open and we 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.550
 we can remove the top cover here are the problems 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.250
 it was such 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.180
 from the blow just the curtain flew out 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.680
 holder or don't know how it is right 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.489
 called and just what it takes 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.799
 put it back look at the second 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:10.220
 on the curtain which is near and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.299
 also by example and correct back 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.659
 actually nothing special here 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.020
 no here it turns out that we are all in 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.920
 principle and repaired actually well 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.150
 of course she is no longer firmly seated 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.970
 some such has become a little bit 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.020
 flimsy but the main thing is that it opens 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.640
 closes and damn it now 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.000
 it remains for us to repeat all the same 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.140
 only reverse order 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.970
 snap the top and bottom covers 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.880
 console and tighten the screws, they apparently 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.780
 some different lengths so the main thing 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.700
 take this into account and twist them as they 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:57.320
 were exactly screw to their seats and 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.360
 snap back the plastic plugs 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.579
 which closes the screws and basically everything 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.479
 the repair is nothing complicated 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.399
 absolutely no but this was it 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.459
 I cut a short video to not 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.500
 there was no surprise in principle 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.390
