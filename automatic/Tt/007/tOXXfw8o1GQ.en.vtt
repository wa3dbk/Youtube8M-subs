done three eight-and-forty and you want

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.730 
done three eight-and-forty and you want
to<00:01:14.180> really<00:01:14.330> pull<00:01:14.570> out<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.810> accent<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:15.619> make

to really pull out that accent and make

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.980 
to really pull out that accent and make
sure<00:01:15.860> you're<00:01:15.979> not<00:01:16.100> also<00:01:16.400> accenting<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.330> the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
sure you're not also accenting the the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.350 
sure you're not also accenting the the
uh<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.740> e<00:01:18.770> there<00:01:19.549> because<00:01:19.970> then<00:01:20.119> you<00:01:20.210> get

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
uh and the e there because then you get

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.840 
uh and the e there because then you get
that<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:21.259> basic<00:01:21.920> pattern<00:01:22.369> that<00:01:22.460> we<00:01:22.579> hear<00:01:22.729> all

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
that that basic pattern that we hear all

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.850 
that that basic pattern that we hear all
the<00:01:22.880> time<00:01:23.000> all<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.930> time<00:01:24.110> at<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.409> one<00:01:24.590> eighth

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
the time all the time at the one eighth

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:34.719 
the time all the time at the one eighth
and<00:01:32.829> probably<00:01:33.829> heard<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:33.979> pattern<00:01:34.430> a<00:01:34.520> few

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
and probably heard that pattern a few

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.480 
and probably heard that pattern a few
times<00:01:34.939> a<00:01:38.439> few<00:01:39.439> too<00:01:39.590> many<00:01:39.619> times<00:01:39.860> we<00:01:40.220> want<00:01:40.369> to

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
times a few too many times we want to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.550 
times a few too many times we want to
avoid<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:41.090> sounding<00:01:41.750> like<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.320> make<00:01:42.530> sure

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
avoid it sounding like that so make sure

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.350 
avoid it sounding like that so make sure
you're<00:01:42.799> only<00:01:42.979> accenting<00:01:43.790> on<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.030> two<00:01:44.210> and

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
you're only accenting on the two and

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.959 
you're only accenting on the two and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
lessons I have a lesson called the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.020 
lessons I have a lesson called the
vertical<00:01:56.119> technique<00:01:56.630> it's<00:01:57.200> easy<00:01:57.729> it's<00:01:58.729> easier

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
vertical technique it's easy it's easier

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.940 
vertical technique it's easy it's easier
to<00:01:59.659> play<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.990> beat<00:02:00.170> or<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.439> at<00:02:00.560> least<00:02:00.710> learn

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
to play the beat or to at least learn

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.609 
to play the beat or to at least learn
the<00:02:01.130> beat<00:02:01.310> in<00:02:02.210> my<00:02:02.450> opinion<00:02:02.869> if<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.200> look<00:02:03.350> at<00:02:03.469> it

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
the beat in my opinion if you look at it

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.010 
the beat in my opinion if you look at it
vertically<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:04.549> you<00:02:04.820> look<00:02:05.119> at<00:02:05.240> count<00:02:05.750> one

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
vertically so you look at count one

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.899 
vertically so you look at count one
you've<00:02:06.259> got<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.439> hi-hat<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.159> bass<00:02:07.340> drum<00:02:07.670> you

you'll be able to build a muscle memory
to<00:02:24.370> do<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.610> quicker<00:02:26.390> without<00:02:26.629> really<00:02:26.930> even

take a while to to work that up but it

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.460 
take a while to to work that up but it
is<00:03:21.889> a<00:03:21.919> neat<00:03:22.220> pattern<00:03:22.699> and<00:03:22.879> the<00:03:23.750> next<00:03:24.079> rhythm<00:03:24.349> is

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
is a neat pattern and the next rhythm is

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.379 
is a neat pattern and the next rhythm is
called<00:03:24.620> ride<00:03:24.829> Bell<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.340> hi-hat<00:03:25.669> with<00:03:25.849> foot<00:03:26.180> it

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
called ride Bell and hi-hat with foot it

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.319 
called ride Bell and hi-hat with foot it
really<00:03:27.049> brings<00:03:27.440> out<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.889> hi-hat<00:03:28.340> pattern

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.129 

because<00:03:32.329> you're<00:03:32.449> switching<00:03:32.659> over<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
because you're switching over to the

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:39.789 
because you're switching over to the
ride<00:03:33.319> Bell<00:03:37.659> so<00:03:38.659> we're<00:03:39.019> breaking<00:03:39.440> out<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.680> those

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
ride Bell so we're breaking out of those

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.289 
ride Bell so we're breaking out of those
straight<00:03:40.159> eighths<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.639> we<00:03:40.730> usually<00:03:40.879> play<00:03:41.209> it

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
straight eighths that we usually play it

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:48.159 
straight eighths that we usually play it
with<00:03:41.389> the<00:03:41.480> rock<00:03:41.659> beat<00:03:44.889> and<00:03:46.479> we're<00:03:47.479> adding<00:03:47.750> some

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
with the rock beat and we're adding some

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:54.000 
with the rock beat and we're adding some
groove<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.859> it<00:03:48.889> something<00:03:49.519> different

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.530 

all<00:03:55.010> right<00:03:55.129> so<00:03:55.310> anyway<00:03:55.489> on<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.879> this<00:03:56.030> ride<00:03:56.269> Bell

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
all right so anyway on to this ride Bell

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.960 
all right so anyway on to this ride Bell
and<00:03:56.810> hi-hat<00:03:57.319> with<00:03:57.500> foot<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.489> hi-hat<00:03:58.849> is

and hi-hat with foot the hi-hat is
optional<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.660> recommend<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.590> practice<00:04:00.800> that

optional I recommend you practice that

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.820

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
do that eventually but you can play the

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.020 
do that eventually but you can play the
beat<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.800> I<00:04:06.860> recommend<00:04:07.129> just<00:04:07.610> having<00:04:07.910> fun

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
beat and I recommend just having fun

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.790 
beat and I recommend just having fun
with<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.330> beat<00:04:08.480> even<00:04:08.780> if<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:08.989> can't<00:04:09.319> do<00:04:09.620> the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
with the beat even if you can't do the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.680 
with the beat even if you can't do the
hi-hat<00:04:10.190> part<00:04:10.489> yet<00:04:10.819> I'm<00:04:11.060> going<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.330> put<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.569> in

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
hi-hat part yet I'm going to put it in

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.030 
hi-hat part yet I'm going to put it in
so<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:11.900> can<00:04:12.019> see<00:04:12.140> what<00:04:12.260> it<00:04:12.319> sounds<00:04:12.620> like<00:04:12.650> but

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
so you can see what it sounds like but

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.490 
so you can see what it sounds like but
play<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.030> without<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:14.569> and<00:04:14.690> also<00:04:15.200> practice

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
play it without it and also practice
