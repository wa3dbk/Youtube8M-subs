I want<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.750> get<00:00:00.840> the<00:00:00.930> best<00:00:01.079> possible<00:00:01.350> fuel

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
I want to get the best possible fuel

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.710 
I want to get the best possible fuel
economy<00:00:02.429> that<00:00:02.550> you<00:00:02.700> can<00:00:02.879> from<00:00:03.149> your<00:00:03.300> vehicle

economy that you can from your vehicle
probably<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.560> first<00:00:04.740> thing<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:06.170> check

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
probably the first thing is to check

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.080 
probably the first thing is to check

is<00:00:32.099> important<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.969> want<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> keep<00:00:33.360> your

you're traveling on the interstate push

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.799 
you're traveling on the interstate push
you're<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.879> people<00:00:39.030> honking<00:00:39.629> at

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
you're going to have people honking at

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.080 
you're going to have people honking at
you<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.290> wanting<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.710> move<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.309> etc<00:00:41.489> but

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
you and wanting you to move over etc but

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.880 
you and wanting you to move over etc but
again<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.170> want<00:00:43.350> good<00:00:43.500> fuel<00:00:43.800> mileage

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
again if you want good fuel mileage

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.840 
again if you want good fuel mileage
which<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.520> call<00:00:44.730> hypermiling<00:00:45.860> that<00:00:46.860> would<00:00:47.070> be

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
which we call hypermiling that would be

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.069 
which we call hypermiling that would be
some<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> techniques<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.989> would

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
some of the techniques that you would

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.130 
some of the techniques that you would
want<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.410> use<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.030> at<00:00:51.030> all<00:00:51.210> counts<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
want to use so at all counts one of the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.720 
want to use so at all counts one of the
other<00:00:52.199> things<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.649> people<00:00:53.010> always<00:00:53.190> asking

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
other things that people always asking

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.220 
other things that people always asking
should<00:00:53.910> i<00:00:53.969> turn<00:00:54.030> my<00:00:54.329> air<00:00:54.510> conditioner<00:00:55.020> off

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
should i turn my air conditioner off

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
should i turn my air conditioner off
actually<00:00:56.190> some<00:00:56.610> recent<00:00:56.969> tests<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.390> shown

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
actually some recent tests have shown

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.080 
actually some recent tests have shown
that<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.430> should<00:00:59.699> use<00:00:59.879> your

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
that you know you can should use your

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.299 
that you know you can should use your
air<00:01:00.210> conditioner<00:01:00.780> speeds<00:01:01.079> above<00:01:01.320> 35<00:01:01.710> miles<00:01:02.129> an

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
air conditioner speeds above 35 miles an

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.020 
air conditioner speeds above 35 miles an
hour<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.210> car<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.719> less<00:01:04.339> as<00:01:05.339> less<00:01:05.790> wind

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
hour the car is less as less wind

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.220 
hour the car is less as less wind
resistance<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> would<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> window

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
resistance and it would with the window

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.450 
resistance and it would with the window
and<00:01:08.500> those<00:01:08.710> speeds<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.310> will<00:01:09.400> actually

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
and those speeds and will actually

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.150 
and those speeds and will actually
consume<00:01:10.000> less<00:01:10.270> fuel<00:01:10.660> another<00:01:11.620> myth<00:01:11.920> that's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
consume less fuel another myth that's

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.650 
consume less fuel another myth that's
out<00:01:12.370> there<00:01:12.610> people<00:01:12.790> would<00:01:13.060> pick<00:01:13.240> up<00:01:13.360> trucks

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
out there people would pick up trucks

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.520 
out there people would pick up trucks
think<00:01:13.900> they're<00:01:14.020> going<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.260> get<00:01:14.320> better

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
think they're going to get better

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.580 
think they're going to get better
mileage<00:01:14.830> by<00:01:15.190> lowering<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.760> tailgate

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
mileage by lowering the tailgate

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.050 
mileage by lowering the tailgate
actually<00:01:17.590> it<00:01:18.160> doesn't<00:01:18.370> improve<00:01:18.730> gas<00:01:19.000> mileage

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
actually it doesn't improve gas mileage

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.450 
actually it doesn't improve gas mileage
at<00:01:19.630> all<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.470> just<00:01:20.500> helps<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:21.070> wear<00:01:21.250> out

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
at all and it just helps the wear out

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.100 
at all and it just helps the wear out
the<00:01:21.670> bed<00:01:21.880> of<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.090> truck<00:01:22.120> from<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.600> tailgate

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
the bed of the truck from the tailgate

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.220 
the bed of the truck from the tailgate
bouncing<00:01:23.560> up<00:01:23.680> and<00:01:23.830> down<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.810> course<00:01:25.960> if<00:01:26.140> you

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
bouncing up and down of course if you

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.750 
bouncing up and down of course if you
really<00:01:26.410> want<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.680> get<00:01:26.740> good<00:01:26.950> gas<00:01:27.130> mileage<00:01:27.640> you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
really want to get good gas mileage you

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.360 
really want to get good gas mileage you
can<00:01:27.940> drive<00:01:28.240> something<00:01:28.480> like<00:01:28.780> that<00:01:29.050> and<00:01:29.370> that

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
can drive something like that and that

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.760 
can drive something like that and that
vehicle<00:01:30.880> not<00:01:31.810> really<00:01:32.110> trying<00:01:32.350> will<00:01:32.620> get

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
vehicle not really trying will get

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.660 
vehicle not really trying will get
anywhere<00:01:33.100> from<00:01:33.280> 30<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.840> 45<00:01:34.840> miles<00:01:35.110> per<00:01:35.260> gallon

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
anywhere from 30 to 45 miles per gallon

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.480 
anywhere from 30 to 45 miles per gallon
quite<00:01:36.670> easily<00:01:36.880> if<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.510> want<00:01:37.690> a<00:01:37.750> high<00:01:37.870> per<00:01:37.930> mile

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
quite easily if you want a high per mile

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.340 
quite easily if you want a high per mile
then<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:39.730> could<00:01:39.910> actually<00:01:40.390> get<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:40.870> excess<00:01:41.230> of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
then you could actually get in excess of

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.900 
then you could actually get in excess of
50<00:01:41.740> but<00:01:41.950> you<00:01:42.100> can't<00:01:42.310> improve<00:01:42.580> gas<00:01:42.850> mileage

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
50 but you can't improve gas mileage

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.870 
50 but you can't improve gas mileage
