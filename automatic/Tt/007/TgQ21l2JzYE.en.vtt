okay<00:00:03.149> here's<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.510> few<00:00:03.689> things<00:00:03.750> we<00:00:04.049> can<00:00:04.080> do<00:00:04.290> to

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
okay here's a few things we can do to

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.200 
okay here's a few things we can do to
vary<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.770> riff<00:00:04.980> first<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.549> all<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.970> first

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
vary the riff first of all the first

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.799 
vary the riff first of all the first
figure<00:00:06.589> let's<00:00:07.589> look<00:00:08.189> at<00:00:08.480> changing<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.510> rhythm

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
figure let's look at changing the rhythm

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.910 
figure let's look at changing the rhythm
a<00:00:09.900> bit<00:00:10.080> with<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> hammer<00:00:10.530> on<00:00:10.820> and<00:00:11.929> likewise<00:00:12.929> with

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
a bit with a hammer on and likewise with

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.000 
a bit with a hammer on and likewise with
a<00:00:13.950> band<00:00:14.690> so<00:00:15.690> that's<00:00:15.839> just<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.109> short<00:00:16.529> about

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
a band so that's just a short about

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.620 
a band so that's just a short about
quarter<00:00:17.340> step<00:00:17.580> Bend<00:00:17.789> not<00:00:18.000> trying<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> go<00:00:18.480> all

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
quarter step Bend not trying to go all

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.410 
quarter step Bend not trying to go all
the<00:00:18.660> way<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.109> beat<00:00:19.289> here<00:00:19.699> on<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.939> fourth

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the way to the beat here on the fourth

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.009 
the way to the beat here on the fourth
figure<00:00:21.930> let's<00:00:22.320> leave<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.830> same<00:00:23.390> as<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.840> was

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
figure let's leave it the same as it was

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.980 
figure let's leave it the same as it was
originally<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.699> second<00:00:27.359> bar<00:00:27.539> let's

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
originally but in the second bar let's

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.169 
originally but in the second bar let's
vary<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.500> by<00:00:28.529> coming<00:00:29.010> up<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> root<00:00:29.490> pulling

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
vary it by coming up to the root pulling

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.840 
vary it by coming up to the root pulling
off<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> minor<00:00:30.750> seven<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:32.040> then<00:00:32.550> going<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
off to the minor seven and then going to

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:43.180 
off to the minor seven and then going to
the<00:00:33.059> fifth<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.940> those<00:00:36.120> two<00:00:36.300> bars<00:00:36.540> would<00:00:36.840> be

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.950 

will<00:00:44.190> repeat<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.520> again<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.539> total<00:00:45.870> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
will repeat that again to get a total of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660 
will repeat that again to get a total of
four<00:00:46.170> bars<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.770> then<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.070> time<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.399> head<00:00:47.550> up

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
four bars and then it's time to head up

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.450 
four bars and then it's time to head up
to<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> c7<00:00:48.570> chord<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:49.530> use<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> same<00:00:50.100> approach

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
to the c7 chord we use the same approach

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.400 
to the c7 chord we use the same approach
so<00:00:51.000> that's<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> hammer<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.870> then<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> bend

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
so that's the hammer and then the bend

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:10.490 
so that's the hammer and then the bend
as<00:00:52.680> follows<00:01:07.189> and<00:01:08.189> then<00:01:09.030> back<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.900> g7

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
as follows and then back down to the g7

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.030 
as follows and then back down to the g7
repeating<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:12.090> before<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.990> that's<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.830> few

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
repeating as before and that's a few

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.420 
repeating as before and that's a few
variations<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> riff<00:01:16.430> okay

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
variations we can do on the riff okay

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.039 
variations we can do on the riff okay
let's<00:01:17.700> hear<00:01:17.820> how<00:01:18.000> these<00:01:18.180> new<00:01:18.420> ideas<00:01:18.600> are<00:01:18.960> going

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
let's hear how these new ideas are going

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:56.819 
let's hear how these new ideas are going
to<00:01:19.110> sound<00:01:19.409> over<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.770> rhythm<00:01:20.040> track

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.350 

now<00:01:57.829> let's<00:01:58.069> look<00:01:58.189> at<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.369> few<00:01:58.579> other<00:01:58.759> variations

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
now let's look at a few other variations

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.850 
now let's look at a few other variations
we<00:01:59.509> can<00:01:59.659> do<00:01:59.810> here<00:02:00.049> but<00:02:00.079> before<00:02:00.409> we<00:02:00.710> get<00:02:00.799> into

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
we can do here but before we get into

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.069 
we can do here but before we get into
that<00:02:01.039> let's<00:02:01.340> talk<00:02:01.460> about<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.819> rift<00:02:02.060> as<00:02:02.659> far<00:02:02.990> as

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
that let's talk about the rift as far as

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.899 
that let's talk about the rift as far as
the<00:02:03.170> riff<00:02:03.319> is<00:02:03.469> concerned<00:02:03.920> it's<00:02:04.250> really

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
the riff is concerned it's really

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.429 
the riff is concerned it's really
important<00:02:05.329> in<00:02:05.420> setting<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.840> groove<00:02:06.079> for<00:02:06.319> the

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
important in setting the groove for the

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.830 
important in setting the groove for the
tune<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:07.189> if<00:02:07.520> we<00:02:07.759> vary<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.149> much<00:02:08.299> more<00:02:08.599> than<00:02:08.750> we

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
tune so if we vary it much more than we

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.199 
tune so if we vary it much more than we
have<00:02:09.110> we'll<00:02:09.500> start<00:02:09.799> to<00:02:09.920> lose<00:02:10.129> that<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:11.060> that

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
have we'll start to lose that so that

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.970 
have we'll start to lose that so that
would<00:02:11.390> be<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.569> good<00:02:11.780> idea<00:02:11.959> if<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.650> want<00:02:12.769> to

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
would be a good idea if you want to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.370 
would be a good idea if you want to
experiment<00:02:13.430> with<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.880> riff<00:02:14.060> itself<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.049> if

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
experiment with the riff itself but if

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.080 
experiment with the riff itself but if
you<00:02:15.590> want<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.860> keep<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.250> context<00:02:16.849> of

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
you want to keep it in the context of

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.940 
you want to keep it in the context of
the<00:02:17.630> song<00:02:17.840> we're<00:02:18.019> playing<00:02:18.260> right<00:02:18.470> here<00:02:18.739> then

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
the song we're playing right here then

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.460 
the song we're playing right here then
to<00:02:19.579> keep<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:19.970> relatively<00:02:20.329> simple<00:02:21.019> in<00:02:21.079> terms<00:02:21.290> of

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
to keep it relatively simple in terms of

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.170 
to keep it relatively simple in terms of
the<00:02:21.530> variations<00:02:22.099> is<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.370> best<00:02:22.549> way<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.730> go

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the variations is the best way to go

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.690 
the variations is the best way to go
so<00:02:23.810> one<00:02:24.319> other<00:02:24.440> thing<00:02:24.560> talking<00:02:25.130> about<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.519> one

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
so one other thing talking about the one

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.030 
so one other thing talking about the one
chord<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.360> five<00:02:26.569> chord<00:02:26.930> we<00:02:27.560> had<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.829> five

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
chord and the five chord we had the five

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.069 
chord and the five chord we had the five
chord<00:02:28.370> in<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.700> beginning<00:02:29.150> on<00:02:29.930> our

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
chord in the beginning on our

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.900 
chord in the beginning on our
introduction<00:02:30.799> and<00:02:30.950> then<00:02:31.010> we<00:02:31.130> closed<00:02:31.519> on<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
introduction and then we closed on the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.289 
introduction and then we closed on the
one<00:02:32.209> chord<00:02:32.569> with<00:02:32.900> an<00:02:33.019> octave<00:02:34.000> but<00:02:35.000> if<00:02:35.090> we<00:02:35.209> were

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
one chord with an octave but if we were

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.880 
one chord with an octave but if we were
actually<00:02:35.450> playing<00:02:35.959> this<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.590> song

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
actually playing this in a song

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.490 
actually playing this in a song
traditionally<00:02:37.700> what<00:02:37.849> we<00:02:37.880> would<00:02:38.150> do<00:02:38.329> is<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:39.410> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
traditionally what we would do is in the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.920 
traditionally what we would do is in the
twelfth<00:02:39.829> bar<00:02:40.040> go<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.549> five<00:02:40.819> chord<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.329> d7

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
twelfth bar go to the five chord the d7

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.539 
twelfth bar go to the five chord the d7
each<00:02:42.079> time<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.799> then<00:02:42.920> whenever<00:02:43.220> you're<00:02:43.400> ready

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
each time and then whenever you're ready

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.340 
each time and then whenever you're ready
to<00:02:43.670> finish<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.180> song<00:02:44.420> then<00:02:44.900> we<00:02:45.019> would<00:02:45.170> go<00:02:45.290> to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
to finish the song then we would go to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.400 
to finish the song then we would go to
the<00:02:45.500> one<00:02:45.709> so<00:02:46.160> that's<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.790> basic<00:02:47.120> approach<00:02:47.480> now

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
the one so that's the basic approach now

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.860 
the one so that's the basic approach now
we've<00:02:48.590> got<00:02:48.739> four<00:02:49.010> bars<00:02:49.250> left<00:02:49.549> here<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.060> seven<00:02:50.660> D

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
we've got four bars left here a seven D

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.280 
we've got four bars left here a seven D
seven<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.500> g7<00:02:52.190> what<00:02:52.519> we're<00:02:52.639> gonna<00:02:52.730> do<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.290> just

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
seven and g7 what we're gonna do is just

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.650 
seven and g7 what we're gonna do is just
vary<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.739> little<00:02:54.889> bit<00:02:55.190> at<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.549> end<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.510> D

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
vary a little bit at the end of the D

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.509 
vary a little bit at the end of the D
seven<00:02:57.139> so<00:02:57.500> instead<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:57.859> doing<00:02:58.010> what<00:02:58.250> we<00:02:58.280> did

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
seven so instead of doing what we did

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:18.520 
seven so instead of doing what we did
before<00:02:58.700> which<00:02:59.359> is<00:02:59.389> something<00:02:59.720> like<00:02:59.870> this

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.600 

okay<00:03:19.530> let's<00:03:19.739> hear<00:03:19.860> how<00:03:19.920> these<00:03:20.069> variations

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
okay let's hear how these variations

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:52.800 
okay let's hear how these variations
will<00:03:20.760> sound<00:03:20.970> over<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.300> rhythm<00:03:21.540> track

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.840 

Oh
