00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Alas 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.210
 there are several ways to follow the team fdj point fr through these 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.789
 results throughout the year on the Tour de France 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.959
 but also not wrong of course the press 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.619
 the traditional press and then carney and then also the social networks 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.250
 social networks this is an area that the team fdj point fr held to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.529
 explore since now 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.789
 membership review 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.669
 how does it work how it goes 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.199
 we are on the tour de France and we will explain everything to you 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.840
 today in the entourage of a professional cycling team 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.839
 on return the so-called viral communication 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.260
 this is essential 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.780
 but it is really essential because it makes it possible to pass 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.610
 pretty nice posts 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.640
 it allows to convey a communication close to the public of 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.570
 supporters 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.540
 and percent yes today it's part of the communication strategy 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.110
 of a cycling team and it's no longer 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.049
 we try to centralize all the information 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.409
 so that to relay all the information passed by the teachers all 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.830
 the little ones all him all a publication that do it on their account 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.170
 the official facebook 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.460
 and in fact we centralize all that by recruiting for them posting photos 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.500
 belts 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500
 and we try to do the same in the sense 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.990
 certainly relay belts messages 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.320
 of the cycling team 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.859
 and percent and whether it's on facebook or twitter 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.349
 today the tales if the team on Facebook caterers 

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.539
 so on facebook the for more than 33000 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.549
 for the role the woman on facebook and percent and the followers on twitter 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.750
 we passed the 13 million mark 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.480
 a roma province pretty much in the same way 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.619
 % and even if later and still delayed for now 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.659
 faster in percentage 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.750
 we had a page of images chain at the base 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.190
 then we created a youtube page 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.000
 who today is rather clear of communication continue to publish more 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:52.820
 container on lines the chain 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.130
 but for the moment for the moment in the round did not care about youtube and percent we go 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.530
 try to grow the number of subscribers to maximize the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.200
 all this comes mahamoud 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.659
 give a little bit to know what we have like this and it's true that 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:08.939
 this year we have 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.629
 we have focused communication on the web since the disappointed not to do so 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.889
 now 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.889
 the bottom mark which kate records the cycling team 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.739
 halak of the stage queen of the tour% across one of what's going on within 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.510
 country and behind the scenes we have a wave an office in paris is therefore brought to 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.120
 several to listen to everything that is said everything that happens on TV at the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.200
 radio everything is said on the dj everything that happens during 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.459
 the stage but it's hard 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.010
 to keep the best off actually through the eyes of the team what's going on 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.089
 in order to see the barriers through videos of the fights 5 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.320
 he puts a team so this is the video 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.830
 all around 10% on site nevertheless cameraman directors 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.090
 editors who are there before 424 who follow the live tour who are there 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.219
 to allow us to 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.029
 at hal to have information and especially content the video relayed 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.299
 on social networks on youtube about sculptor on facebook anyway have 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.809
 a majority mandate for the visit of equipped 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:11.459
 the champion images of the day we try to send spades decided 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.589
 we were going to buy 

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:15.909
 the world to find as support we are online next day but also the 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.559
 the same day we look forward to the day's fact or from time to time looks 

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:23.819
 crossed as this couple is here today people are watching but we have 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.649
 more than 100000 start of the round good luck the strike is over this 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:29.869
 year we are happy 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.269
 why did you do it on facebook at 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.169
 a group 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.209
 reserved for supporters 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.669
 simply to work allow the fans to meet together 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.829
 we have it for sure 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.909
 on the web but also 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.999
 on the races 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.979
 in operations that we organize for the fan club they can 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.979
 register directly to participate in cocktails to make trips 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.789
 and he communicates a lot between them for 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.489
 for example tell band to meet a few kilometers on your state 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.419
 after 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.379
 and it works by itself 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.290
 you have a total of thirty thousand fans over 30000 even on the facebook page 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.329
 public 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.469
 is it 30 may the new not feel a little excluded by not doing 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.899
 part of the jumbo 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:14.659
 we definitely do not want to exclude them on the contrary 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.489
 we want to make a bow of a promotion of our supporters club 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.819
 and that is that these 30 billion yen join us in the club 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:24.270
 negredo that 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.770
 we want is also in the lead 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.490
 all come together so the batteries benefit from the many benefits of the 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.460
 club 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.870
 % and that is not only virtual but so we have a lot of passions and 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.840
 among others at the end of the race in the year we are aiming for a big party 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.539
