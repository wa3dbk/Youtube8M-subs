nice and well another great tip is

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.240 
nice and well another great tip is
sometimes<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.200> put<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.590> into<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> ziplock

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sometimes I just put this into a ziplock

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.440 
sometimes I just put this into a ziplock
bag<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.520> give<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.360> good<00:01:30.479> shake<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:32.240> I<00:01:33.240> think

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
bag and give it a good shake and I think

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.910 
bag and give it a good shake and I think
this<00:01:33.600> could<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.650> heat

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
this could have just a little more heat

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.410 
this could have just a little more heat
so<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.340> add<00:01:35.520> chili<00:01:35.790> powder<00:01:38.420> then

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
so I'm going to add chili powder then
we're<00:01:39.540> gonna<00:01:39.659> add<00:01:39.900> our<00:01:40.200> flour<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> our

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
we're gonna add our flour and our

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.399 
we're gonna add our flour and our

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
cornstarch and just continue tossing

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.469
