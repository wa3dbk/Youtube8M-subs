00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.420
 tutorial on how to install haters like this 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.269
 what good first thing I recommend 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.650
 do is a backup of your point folder 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:20.980
 minecraft and then go to this page there 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.829
 person to this one and download the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.539
 fun minecraft without being going to 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.400
 be more or less a program like that 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.519
 good let me down while you 're 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.599
 quick to download I explain they are going to 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.520
 install 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.350
 here is a search engine for mods going to 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.769
 installed this is the loft module and 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.110
 find the zeus hater and they will give you 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.500
 chains version ok van alen chains 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.500
 version 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.949
 and he is going to put this color bar 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.260
 This way, it was going to be a sound like 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.120
 bells that means the main cra 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.159
 life changed the version and to the installed 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.789
 these mods the next thing that you have to 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:04.309
 to do is get off, as you saw this 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:07.880
 let's show in folder we're going to 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.740
 cut that version 8 and we're going to open your 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.390
 magical point folder where stater says 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.520
 pax 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.650
 You already know to open the minecraft folder 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.600
 to go to the taskbar to bp 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.950
 data I say to the start bar sorry 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.860
 app data opens minecraft x and be pax 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.010
 let's save this because this one is 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.540
 wrong 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.580
 ok what next thing we're going to do is 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.520
 download this folder that you leave it to 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.470
 the inscription the link of the link is 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.240
 the folder of texture shaders 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.530
 shaders but the lowest I know the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.530
 I recommend for those who do not have 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.060
 a super super chivas computer and 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.550
 Well, we're going to stick to this, which is sider 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.260
 packs let's close this 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.830
 we are going to minimize and now we are going to 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.860
 open what is minecraft 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.920
 and there comes minecraft, let's give it 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.080
 login forgive me if you are going to see the quality 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.330
 of fps is very ugly because I'm not 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.240
 recording it with a program that is not 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.360
 to record games so they will see 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.160
 all complete with respect to minecraft 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.490
 is already opened this looks a bit 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.970
 slow I think it's because I have 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.150
 the follower is active 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.640
 okay 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.090
 although now they realize this goes 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.590
 fairly good 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.590
 or pretty good enough 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.739
 excellent here let's go to go to 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.349
 the options and here's the subject of 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.739
 shaders good there is no no no no no fuck 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.110
 I did me wrong there is going to 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.650
 choose the second and we will give in 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.519
 done 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.159
 where ready and the game will come back and this 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.349
 shaders best excellent if they realize 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.120
 the way and at the time of turning it 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.830
 feels a strange turn 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.060
 we are going to put games 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.060
 the way to jump 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.819
 they already have their shadow everything there is 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.450
 let's go on to keep putting what 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.450
 it seems to put we are going to put buckets of water 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.160
 of this back 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.130
 how is water like lava 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.130
 let's put a tree 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.350
 until the seed of the tree 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.920
 sweet the we sing 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.360
 the ground bone that excellent 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.740
 to make them grow now let's put 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.200
 this here 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.320
 and with it the world not only grow they give 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.730
 account is awesome to me it runs me 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.730
 just about 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.880
 and well it's excellent to see how it works 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.340
 move 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.220
 they realize that we are seeing the 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.840
 tree as if the wind moved it 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.420
 now let's show them the water the water 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.140
 it seems to me that in this version of ishares 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.140
 it almost does not change 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.440
 two 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.820
 up here where to put water 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.780
 but if you realize it's a bit 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.780
 different 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.280
 It has a strange texture 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.490
 as brightness 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.240
 and let's put the lava now 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.800
 Well, lava does not really change here 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.789
 but the shadow is impressive is 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.650
 awesome how this texture looks and 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:56.550
 I think I installed the tumen items but 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.200
 well let's put options and adjustments 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.150
 Of video 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.380
 and you already know performance 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.380
 let's put the 60 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.210
 let's put it by and nice 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.340
 let's give them and ready 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.890
 and keeps running a little bit wrong at 1.006 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.360
 but basically these haters the version 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.430
 I recommend them for those who 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.969
 have a powerful computer see the 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.870
 from behind that are there 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:34.180
 come as my best god 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.720
 but that's how it is installed 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.060
 shaders I show you guys for whom 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.460
 they believe that your computer supports this 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.820
 shaders let's see the sun as it looks 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.290
 until the sun there I have to put 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.290
 Video settings options 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.879
 far 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.879
 I can see the sun 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:00.880
 there is the sun 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.610
 there I am sun in the clouds clouds 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.200
 I think they do not cause shadow but good 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.970
 well if it is also excellent 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.820
 shaders I'm going to try to fix it 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.430
 to play it but well then 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.460
 basically that would be shaders boys I 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.500
 I will continue here and as good as 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.730
 know how to install them in the links 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.770
 are in the description check what 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.510
 give very light if they liked it for 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.980
 they did not know there is how the sail is 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.550
 ers I am until we see each other in the 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.550
 next bye
