the hero being more positive and
fighting<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:17.729> mankind<00:01:18.090> may<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.360> against<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
fighting for mankind may be against a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.380 
fighting for mankind may be against a
natural<00:01:19.080> disaster<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:21.030> not

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
natural disaster because it's not

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.109 
natural disaster because it's not
predictable<00:01:21.990> anymore<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.729> random

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
predictable anymore I think random

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.060 
predictable anymore I think random
deaths<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.689> shows<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.350> movies<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.860> kill
