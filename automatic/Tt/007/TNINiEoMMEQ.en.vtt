Hi, I'm Sarah with Lights for all Occasions
and you've probably noticed this gorgeous

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.970
display behind me, of lights.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.289
I'm so excited to tell you about our commercial
grade, high-end curtain lights.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.030
They're LED so there's a lot of great features
about them that I know you're going to want

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.790
to incorporate into your next event.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.660
These lights are so versatile, they have so
many great features that you can customize

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.930
them to whatever look you're going for, for
your event or your special venue.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.059
First of all, they span from six feet all
the way to 36 feet, so you can use them in

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.579
a large place and the great thing about that
is it only uses one power supply, one plug

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.800
so you don't have to worry about lots of extension
cords getting in the way.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.620
There's also one controller as well, so you
can connect them all and just use one controller

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.809
for the entire thing.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.300
They have lots of different functions, speeds,
light displays, they flicker or they can be

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.300
steady.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.579
Lots of different combinations that you can
use to fit the look that you're going for.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.960
Another great feature is that they are water
resistant, and so you can have them indoors

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.930
or outdoors, whatever your venue specifies.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.930
So I'm going to show you three different looks
that we have combining the different wires

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.090
and the different colored lights.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.090
You're going to love it.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.710
I know you're going to be creative with them
and excited to use them at your next event.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.250
One great look that you can incorporate into
your event using our lights is this gorgeous,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.820
classic, very elegant, timeless look, perfect
for that fairy tale wedding or a special birthday

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.820
party.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.430
It just creates such a warm twinkly kind of
ethereal look through these lights.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.159
The lights that I've used for this are our
white wire, warm white LED curtain lights,

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.649
and it goes perfectly against the white fabric.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.090
We've also paired it with our acrylic crystal
garland, and they all come together at the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.049
bottom of the drapery, and they're so easy
to manipulate as you can see they're bunched

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.549
together, just tie it off with a beautiful
ribbon, a wire, something to just bring it

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.710
all together, and the drapery look is just
so elegant, so classic it's going to be beautiful

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.170
at your special event.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.190
Another great look I wanted to show you using
our curtain lights is, taking away all of

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.080
the softness, this is really all about the
lights, okay?

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.930
This is a clear wire, our same warm white
lights, but it's against a stark wall.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.190
We've taken away that soft fabric, and so
you can see the different designs you can

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.500
bring in to showcase just the lights.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.599
We've done a criss-cross pattern and bunched
them together in the middle to soften it up

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.470
with this lace bow so it creates that really
urban, shabby chic look that's so popular

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.470
right now.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.180
And I love how when the lights bunch in the
middle of the bow, it kind of illuminates

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.070
it, and so it just gives a softer element
to it but still has that very modern minimalist

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.070
look.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.840
I think this is perfect for a bridal shower,
a birthday party, any point where you want

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.500
to use lights to illuminate a certain part
of your venue and showcase what great lights

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.459
they are.

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.040
For the final look that I'm going to show
you today, we're using our clear wire cool

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.190
white lights, as you've seen in the other
demonstrations of our different wires, we

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.020
do create with these lights a beautiful wall
of lights that can expand from six feet, up

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.150
to 36 feet.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.920
In this particular display we wanted to create
windows, so that you can see these gorgeous

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.970
jars on display.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.610
So what we've done is gathered up bunches
of each of the lines of light and these are

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.629
in groups of five, and you can decide however
long your span is, and then we've gathered

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.379
them again at the bottom to create almost
a diamond window, and then you can hang these

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.409
gorgeous metallic hobnail jars and soften
it up with some flowers to help the light

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.670
kind of bounce off the organza fabric and
the metallic jars.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.970
It just creates such a mystical, icicle kind
of feel perfect for winter wedding or any

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.459
kind of winter special event, but don't limit
these lights to just weddings.

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.780
These are perfect for display in a retail
window, these are great in casinos, in hotels

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.969
or any large venue where you want to showcase
a product or just illuminate for a gathering

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.360
or a special event.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.860
So these have many different varieties of
use and we'd love to hear how you use these

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.680
besides the ideas that I've shown you.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.650
So make sure you send us your pictures, leave
us your comments, we'd love to hear how you've

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.709
used these lights.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.460
