discuss<00:00:30.559> some<00:00:31.730> abdominal<00:00:32.730> exercises<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.420> I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
discuss some abdominal exercises that I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.130 
discuss some abdominal exercises that I
recommend<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:35.399> abdominal<00:00:36.360> exercises<00:00:36.960> are

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
recommend the abdominal exercises are

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.900 
recommend the abdominal exercises are
often<00:00:37.440> misunderstood<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> rectus<00:00:38.430> abdominis

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
often misunderstood the rectus abdominis

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.550 
often misunderstood the rectus abdominis
is<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.600> one<00:00:39.810> sheet<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.200> muscles

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
is actually just one sheet of muscles

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.800 
is actually just one sheet of muscles
that<00:00:41.130> runs<00:00:41.370> from<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> ribcage<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.330> pelvis

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
that runs from the ribcage to the pelvis

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.870 
that runs from the ribcage to the pelvis
when<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.560> recruit<00:00:43.950> one<00:00:44.130> muscle<00:00:44.460> fiber<00:00:44.670> you

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
when you recruit one muscle fiber you

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.090 
when you recruit one muscle fiber you
should<00:00:45.030> include<00:00:45.240> all<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:46.100> essentially

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
should include all of them essentially

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.550 
should include all of them essentially
all<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:47.580> do<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:48.060> they<00:00:48.270> keep<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.600> upright<00:00:48.930> or

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
all they do is they keep you upright or

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.380 
all they do is they keep you upright or
squatting<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.070> dead<00:00:50.190> lifting<00:00:50.580> they<00:00:51.210> also

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
squatting and dead lifting they also

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.260 
squatting and dead lifting they also
bring<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.740> squeeze<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.880> midsection

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
bring they squeeze the midsection

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.680 
bring they squeeze the midsection
together<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:55.890> you're<00:00:56.010> having<00:00:56.160> issues

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
together so if you're having issues

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.120 
together so if you're having issues
staying<00:00:57.690> upright<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.530> obviously<00:00:58.950> need<00:00:59.100> to

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
staying upright you obviously need to

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.250 
staying upright you obviously need to
incorporate<00:00:59.489> more<00:00:59.970> abdominal<00:01:00.360> work<00:01:00.900> you're

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
incorporate more abdominal work you're

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.630 
incorporate more abdominal work you're
gonna<00:01:01.350> want<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.620> incorporate<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.280> any<00:01:02.400> way<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
gonna want to incorporate it any way to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.389 
gonna want to incorporate it any way to
help<00:01:02.910> prevent<00:01:03.180> injury<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.009> like<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> do

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
help prevent injury so what I like to do

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.510 
help prevent injury so what I like to do
are<00:01:05.549> exercises<00:01:06.149> that<00:01:06.680> essentially<00:01:07.680> mimic<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
are exercises that essentially mimic the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.399 
are exercises that essentially mimic the
squat<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.240> deadlift<00:01:09.479> motion<00:01:09.960> or<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
squat and deadlift motion or the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.780 
squat and deadlift motion or the
position<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.010> may<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.250> stuck<00:01:11.550> in<00:01:11.700> if

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
position that you may get stuck in if

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.200 
position that you may get stuck in if
you<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.000> weak<00:01:12.210> abdominals<00:01:12.750> such<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
you have weak abdominals such as a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.719 
you have weak abdominals such as a
escaping<00:01:15.210> cable<00:01:16.050> crunch<00:01:16.320> or<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:17.010> standing

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
escaping cable crunch or a standing

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.399 
escaping cable crunch or a standing
crunch<00:01:18.060> with<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
crunch with the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.130 
crunch with the
the<00:01:19.649> bands<00:01:19.859> as<00:01:20.249> resistance<00:01:21.049> essentially<00:01:22.049> all

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the bands as resistance essentially all

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.370 
the bands as resistance essentially all
you<00:01:22.259> want<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.469> do<00:01:22.649> is<00:01:23.869> just<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.960> very<00:01:25.170> limited

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you want to do is just a very limited

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.679 
you want to do is just a very limited
motion<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.609> squeezing<00:01:27.149> your<00:01:27.299> midsection

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
motion just squeezing your midsection

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.520 
motion just squeezing your midsection
together<00:01:28.140> basically<00:01:29.039> just<00:01:29.490> bringing<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:31.200> fill

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
together basically just bringing to fill

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.609 
together basically just bringing to fill
this<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:33.240> also<00:01:33.479> want<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> use<00:01:33.959> resistance

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
this you also want to use resistance

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.859 
this you also want to use resistance
where<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.609> typically<00:01:36.030> can't<00:01:36.359> do<00:01:36.569> more<00:01:36.810> than

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
where you typically can't do more than

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.440 
where you typically can't do more than
about<00:01:37.340> maybe<00:01:38.340> 12<00:01:38.640> reps<00:01:38.969> at<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:39.929> most<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:41.450> most

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
about maybe 12 reps at the most the most

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.499 
about maybe 12 reps at the most the most
hype<00:01:42.659> hypertrophy<00:01:43.880> it's<00:01:44.880> kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.359> same

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
hype hypertrophy it's kind of the same

hype hypertrophy it's kind of the same
principle<00:01:45.719> is<00:01:46.079> doing<00:01:46.319> a<00:01:46.409> five<00:01:46.560> pound<00:01:46.770> dumbbell

curl<00:01:47.520> 100<00:01:48.359> times<00:01:48.569> you're<00:01:49.020> gonna<00:01:49.229> build

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
curl 100 times you're gonna build

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.139

endurance<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:50.490> you're<00:01:50.609> not<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.909> create

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
microscopic tears to make the muscles

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.880 
microscopic tears to make the muscles
stronger<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.599> an<00:01:57.719> option<00:01:58.110> as<00:01:58.409> well<00:01:58.590> as

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
stronger so this is an option as well as

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.350 
stronger so this is an option as well as
a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.120 

which<00:02:04.660> is<00:02:04.810> essentially<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.410> same<00:02:05.590> motion

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
which is essentially the same motion

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.090 
which is essentially the same motion
that's<00:02:07.030> what<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.330> people<00:02:07.800> just<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.890> very

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
that's what the people just a very

that's what the people just a very
