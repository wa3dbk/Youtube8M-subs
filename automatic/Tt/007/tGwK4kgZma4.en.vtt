00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.020
 27 June 1973 27 June 2013 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.910
 40 years have passed since the magic one 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.040
 night in the arena of milan marcello 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.349
 fiasconaro ran the 800 meters in a 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.670
 minute 43 seconds seven tenths the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.740
 world record that still today 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.660
 represent the 300 meters faster in the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.890
 course by an Italian marcello via 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.660
 school these days and times 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.970
 of Italy from South Africa where he lives 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.109
 to caress the Milanese track that it 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.830
 you wrote in the history of athletics 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.689
 light 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.990
 marco barker i met from the frogs a 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.020
 turning 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.850
 marcello fiasconaro a myth rather more 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.770
 of a myth 40 years later 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.090
 but what is left of you in these 40 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:44.120
 years of that day 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:47.360
 marco is always all the hard one was ache 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.449
 head because famous of the kit they have 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.210
 said it is the great final chi we have 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:58.640
 insured and every time I came back here 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.949
 and a great feeling of pride is not 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.629
 can tell the door will launch the 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.860
 movie you look at you every now and then 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.140
 you never wanted to see it again in fact 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.490
 given on facebook because I do n't hate it 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:19.640
 facebook however came facebook peas and 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:22.340
 we watched that I never saw the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.880
 complete race no saw in the start 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.720
 and then the last round I don't know why 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.840
 discuss why the most beautiful part of 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.240
 that race is the first 400 meters and of the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.750
 first those who say what they find like it 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:43.689
 the newfound for me is always the same as 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:47.539
 stadium full of people a fabulous place 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:50.240
 it is however a great pity that when the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.880
 meeting of how the wing turn there 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.369
 I'm more meeting this is Italy 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.850
 old italy spain and how many medals 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.270
 in america because they are not meeting 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.960
 international because all people 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.360
 they want to rise I think that oscar eleni 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.360
 who was one of the athletics singers of 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.950
 once but also today he threw in there 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.190
 the idea that however is not old of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.069
 remove these delete gates from 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.420
 both from the thing you think I don't know i 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.810
 side if there had not been 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.720
 realized over the years people 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.069
 when it's full full people 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:38.209
 but maybe I don't know who gets it 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:40.040
 some carabiniere wants to give a 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.069
 opinion on nelson mandela with these two 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.230
 showing what you look I was very 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.260
 sad when he left for South Africa 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:53.120
 because he was very upset too 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.980
 the news today that is even worse 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:01.069
 he is on the data that was a big one 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:03.319
 man or seven times was not for him must 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.170
 go much worse in South Africa the 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:10.959
 no change and he was very smart 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:18.290
 it is learned he took the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:22.790
 people purposes the world and boasts five 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:27.620
 all the nations behind these white 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.730
 squadron or almost all whites protection 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:36.440
 country with matera the president but of 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:39.680
 true here does not know that not everything however is 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:45.940
 the inhabitants of L'Aquila have been very well 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.940
 changed and now it doesn't go too much 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.989
 change is too slow 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:55.370
 yet still South Africa to be a 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:58.519
 great country that we hope to continue 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.690
 to change that will years 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:05.239
 let's do as we see it perhaps for the 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.450
 things for the holy seventies I don't know 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:12.829
 but perhaps this is the new blessed one 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.750
 but if between 73 and 70 years there is 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:19.329
 still your record crossed claim 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.329
 because I come with the place like this
