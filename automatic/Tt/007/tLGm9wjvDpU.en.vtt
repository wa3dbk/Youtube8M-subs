that<00:01:36.299> logic<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.259> doesn't<00:01:37.710> make

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
that logic like it just doesn't make

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.109 
that logic like it just doesn't make
sense<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.220> different<00:01:38.520> episodes<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.970> could

sense the different episodes you could
say<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.270> thing<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:39.630> nonetheless<00:01:39.840> I'm<00:01:40.799> not

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130

these two as a partnership were
absolutely<00:03:01.290> insane<00:03:01.650> it's<00:03:01.829> not<00:03:01.950> very<00:03:02.040> often

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
absolutely insane it's not very often

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.800 
absolutely insane it's not very often
that<00:03:02.430> when<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.120> actually<00:03:03.239> put<00:03:03.540> them<00:03:03.659> together

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
that when you actually put them together

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.899 
that when you actually put them together
they<00:03:04.230> do<00:03:04.290> kind<00:03:04.889> of<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.310> complement<00:03:05.849> each

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
they do kind of just complement each

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.179 
they do kind of just complement each
other<00:03:06.180> they<00:03:06.989> don't<00:03:07.200> have<00:03:07.290> incredible<00:03:07.739> passing

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
other they don't have incredible passing

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.800

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
now it's really hard to actually pull

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.050 
now it's really hard to actually pull
them<00:03:33.810> apart<00:03:33.900> but<00:03:34.560> for<00:03:35.040> once<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.519> actual<00:03:35.879> in

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060

a<00:03:38.669> lot<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.090> time<00:03:39.269> I<00:03:39.299> find<00:03:39.629> that<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.959> inform

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
a lot the time I find that the inform

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.259 
a lot the time I find that the inform
players<00:03:40.409> just<00:03:41.129> that<00:03:41.549> they<00:03:41.699> kind<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.060> don't

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
players just that they kind of don't

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.879 
players just that they kind of don't
really<00:03:42.569> play<00:03:42.750> as<00:03:42.930> well<00:03:43.079> as<00:03:43.139> you'd<00:03:43.349> expect<00:03:43.470> them

so<00:04:16.799> different<00:04:17.099> and<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.669> so<00:04:17.940> great<00:04:18.209> i<00:04:18.269> can

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
so different and it is so great i can

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.969 
so different and it is so great i can
imagine<00:04:18.870> if<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.229> were<00:04:19.289> to<00:04:19.380> actually<00:04:19.560> put

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
imagine if you were to actually put

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.339 
imagine if you were to actually put
messy<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.519> cost<00:04:20.940> upfront<00:04:21.180> together<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:22.139> would

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
messy and cost upfront together it would

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.440 
messy and cost upfront together it would
just<00:04:22.500> be<00:04:22.680> ridiculous<00:04:23.219> because<00:04:23.450> there's

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
just be ridiculous because there's

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.420 
just be ridiculous because there's
something<00:04:24.810> about<00:04:24.960> costa<00:04:25.560> that's<00:04:25.979> just<00:04:26.219> so

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
something about costa that's just so

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.540 
something about costa that's just so
different<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.909> any<00:04:27.060> player

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
different to any player

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.490 
different to any player
used<00:04:27.759> that<00:04:27.940> just<00:04:28.150> made<00:04:28.360> him<00:04:28.389> so<00:04:28.930> incredible

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
used that just made him so incredible

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.100 
used that just made him so incredible
yes<00:04:29.770> something<00:04:30.460> just<00:04:30.669> so<00:04:30.909> unique<00:04:31.180> in<00:04:32.050> that

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
yes something just so unique in that

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.469 
yes something just so unique in that
he's<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:33.190> lot<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.699> time<00:04:33.909> you<00:04:34.000> find<00:04:34.210> with<00:04:34.419> the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
he's a lot of the time you find with the

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.820 
he's a lot of the time you find with the
really<00:04:34.720> tall<00:04:34.900> one<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:35.199> that<00:04:35.319> you<00:04:35.440> lose<00:04:35.650> the

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
really tall one so that you lose the

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.770 
really tall one so that you lose the
pace<00:04:36.039> but<00:04:36.250> he<00:04:36.400> just<00:04:36.610> really<00:04:37.060> really<00:04:37.090> had<00:04:37.389> it<00:04:37.569> so

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
pace but he just really really had it so

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.689 
pace but he just really really had it so
I<00:04:37.990> cannot<00:04:38.590> stress<00:04:38.770> enough<00:04:38.889> how<00:04:39.159> good<00:04:39.580> this

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
I cannot stress enough how good this

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.969 
I cannot stress enough how good this
Diego<00:04:40.090> Costa<00:04:40.419> card<00:04:40.629> was<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:41.020> will<00:04:41.349> use<00:04:41.740> the

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
him but also don't get me wrong Romelu

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.960 
him but also don't get me wrong Romelu
Lukaku<00:04:47.349> was<00:04:47.889> also<00:04:48.250> absolutely<00:04:48.550> sensational

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
Lukaku was also absolutely sensational

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.580 
Lukaku was also absolutely sensational
it<00:04:49.270> was<00:04:49.389> such<00:04:49.599> a<00:04:49.629> good<00:04:49.870> partnership<00:04:50.199> and<00:04:50.500> they

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
it was such a good partnership and they

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.020 
it was such a good partnership and they
just<00:04:50.800> scored<00:04:50.949> goal<00:04:51.250> off<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.550> goal<00:04:51.729> off<00:04:51.879> the

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
just scored goal off the goal off the

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.510 
just scored goal off the goal off the
goal<00:04:52.240> it<00:04:52.930> was<00:04:53.110> amazing<00:04:53.349> Lukaku<00:04:54.069> actually<00:04:54.400> got

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
goal it was amazing Lukaku actually got

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.100 
goal it was amazing Lukaku actually got
quite<00:04:54.639> a<00:04:54.729> few<00:04:54.879> more<00:04:55.000> system<00:04:55.449> costs<00:04:55.659> up<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.080> I

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
quite a few more system costs up so I

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.119 
quite a few more system costs up so I
don't<00:04:56.319> really<00:04:56.349> know<00:04:56.560> what's<00:04:56.710> take<00:04:56.860> away<00:04:57.009> from

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
don't really know what's take away from

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.010 
don't really know what's take away from
that<00:04:57.190> but<00:04:57.729> because<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.030> just<00:04:58.389> how<00:04:58.509> incredible

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
that but because of just how incredible

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.290 
that but because of just how incredible

the win for this episode I'm a little
bit<00:05:03.219> reluctant<00:05:03.400> sometimes<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:04.000> give<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.270> to

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
bit reluctant sometimes to give it to

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.450 
bit reluctant sometimes to give it to
the<00:05:04.389> overpriced<00:05:04.690> guy<00:05:04.930> but<00:05:05.379> Kosta<00:05:05.740> was<00:05:05.770> just<00:05:06.159> so

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
the overpriced guy but Kosta was just so

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.850 
the overpriced guy but Kosta was just so
so<00:05:06.669> good<00:05:06.879> I<00:05:06.940> cannot<00:05:07.360> be<00:05:07.539> a<00:05:07.870> bigger<00:05:08.409> bigger

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
so good I cannot be a bigger bigger

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.249 
so good I cannot be a bigger bigger
hyper<00:05:09.219> up<00:05:09.490> for<00:05:09.759> him<00:05:09.909> but<00:05:10.120> hopefully<00:05:10.810> this

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
hyper up for him but hopefully this

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.510 
hyper up for him but hopefully this
season<00:05:11.590> he'll<00:05:11.710> get<00:05:11.830> some<00:05:11.979> more<00:05:12.159> in<00:05:12.250> forms

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
season he'll get some more in forms

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.070 
season he'll get some more in forms
which<00:05:12.879> will<00:05:13.060> lower<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.360> price<00:05:13.569> of<00:05:13.750> this<00:05:13.840> one

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
which will lower the price of this one

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.080 
which will lower the price of this one
and<00:05:14.289> maybe<00:05:14.469> he'll<00:05:14.740> get<00:05:14.889> even<00:05:15.340> better<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.879> mean

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
and maybe he'll get even better I mean

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.670 
and maybe he'll get even better I mean
if<00:05:16.539> it<00:05:16.690> was<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:16.870> get<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.020> team<00:05:17.199> of<00:05:17.319> the<00:05:17.379> year<00:05:17.409> I'm

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
if it was to get a team of the year I'm

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.899 
if it was to get a team of the year I'm
sure<00:05:17.860> it'd<00:05:17.949> be<00:05:17.979> one<00:05:18.219> of<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.370> best<00:05:18.520> cards<00:05:18.819> on

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
sure it'd be one of the best cards on
