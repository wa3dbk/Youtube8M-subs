00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
quarter inches and it's going to be just

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.199 
quarter inches and it's going to be just
like<00:02:18.540> before<00:02:18.959> where<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.380> measure<00:02:19.650> in<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.849> each

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
like before where we measure in on each

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.150 
like before where we measure in on each
side<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:22.880> then<00:02:23.880> we're<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.599> to<00:02:24.690> connect<00:02:25.160> all

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
side and then we're going to connect all

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.110 
side and then we're going to connect all
of<00:02:26.819> our<00:02:26.970> lines<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.440> one<00:02:28.739> actually

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
of our lines and I have one actually

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.570 
of our lines and I have one actually
ready<00:02:30.800> right<00:02:31.800> here<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.340> where

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
ready right here and this is just where

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.720 
ready right here and this is just where
we've<00:02:35.790> connect<00:02:37.010> connected<00:02:38.010> all<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.520> dots

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
we've connect connected all of the dots

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.030 
we've connect connected all of the dots
okay<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.870> then<00:02:40.140> you're<00:02:40.530> going<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.739> use<00:02:40.920> your

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
okay so then you're going to use your

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.850 
okay so then you're going to use your
ruler<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:44.900> your<00:02:45.900> craft<00:02:46.170> knife<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.530> start

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
ruler and your craft knife and start

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.910 
ruler and your craft knife and start
exactly<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> corner<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:49.350> carefully

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
exactly on the corner and then carefully

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.600 
exactly on the corner and then carefully
stop<00:02:51.290> right<00:02:52.290> at<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.680> other<00:02:52.860> corner<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.459> then

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
stop right at the other corner and then

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.090 
stop right at the other corner and then
just<00:02:53.790> turn<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.360> keep<00:02:54.630> going<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:55.910> around

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
just turn it and keep going on around

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.820 
just turn it and keep going on around
the<00:02:59.100> frame<00:02:59.510> so<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.230> fun<00:03:01.380> part<00:03:01.440> this

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the frame so now for the fun part this

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.009 
the frame so now for the fun part this
is<00:03:02.010> actually<00:03:02.430> where<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.760> get<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.239> do<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> little

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
is actually where you get to do a little

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.699 
is actually where you get to do a little
bit<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.620> drawing<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.400> doodling<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.709> I've

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
bit of drawing and doodling and I've

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.890 
bit of drawing and doodling and I've
already<00:03:08.069> started<00:03:08.310> but<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:09.420> want<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.690> just

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
draw some really really simple designs

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.610 
draw some really really simple designs
it<00:03:12.420> doesn't<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.750> don't<00:03:12.870> have<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.230> get<00:03:13.410> crazy

it doesn't you don't have to get crazy
you<00:03:14.519> can<00:03:14.750> make<00:03:15.750> geometric<00:03:16.590> designs<00:03:17.040> like

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
you can make geometric designs like

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.500 
you can make geometric designs like
triangles<00:03:18.890> you<00:03:19.890> can<00:03:20.130> put<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.400> little<00:03:20.760> dot<00:03:21.150> on

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
triangles you can put a little dot on

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.460 
triangles you can put a little dot on
the<00:03:22.109> inside<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.459> make<00:03:23.670> stripes<00:03:24.470> that's

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
the inside you can make stripes that's

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.270 
the inside you can make stripes that's
always<00:03:25.769> fun

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
always fun

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.430 
always fun

it's whatever you want but you just want
to<00:03:28.500> keep<00:03:28.709> your<00:03:29.130> overall<00:03:29.760> design<00:03:30.150> really

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
to keep your overall design really

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.110 
to keep your overall design really
really<00:03:31.290> simple<00:03:31.769> okay

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
really simple okay

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.150 
really simple okay

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
so the next thing we're gonna do is

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.759 
so the next thing we're gonna do is
start<00:03:35.489> filling<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.329> our<00:03:36.600> design<00:03:37.320> with<00:03:37.650> this

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
start filling in our design with this

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.880 
start filling in our design with this
really<00:03:38.220> thick<00:03:38.549> tacky<00:03:39.480> glue<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.200> you'll<00:03:40.709> want

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
really thick tacky glue and you'll want

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.060 
really thick tacky glue and you'll want
to<00:03:40.980> go<00:03:41.100> ahead<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.310> start<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.030> flow<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:43.070> the

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
to go ahead and start the flow of the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.890 
to go ahead and start the flow of the
glue<00:03:44.280> on<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.579> separate<00:03:45.060> thing<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:45.510> I'm<00:03:45.660> all

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
glue on a separate thing so I'm all

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.319 
glue on a separate thing so I'm all
ready<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.380> go<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.280> scrap<00:03:47.760> piece<00:03:48.000> of<00:03:48.180> paper

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
ready to go on a scrap piece of paper

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.180 
ready to go on a scrap piece of paper
over<00:03:48.510> there<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.109> now<00:03:49.470> we're<00:03:49.829> just<00:03:49.950> going<00:03:50.160> to

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
over there and now we're just going to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.440 
over there and now we're just going to
carefully<00:03:51.049> outline<00:03:52.579> our<00:03:53.579> shapes<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.359> you

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
carefully outline our shapes and you

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.400 
carefully outline our shapes and you
want<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.720> keep<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.109> really<00:03:55.829> thick<00:03:57.260> we<00:03:58.260> would

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
want to keep it really thick we would

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.220 
want to keep it really thick we would
call<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.829> thick<00:03:59.430> bead<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.150> glue<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.049> you

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
call this a thick bead of glue and you

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.229 
call this a thick bead of glue and you
just<00:04:01.440> keep<00:04:01.620> going<00:04:01.829> around<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.730> can<00:04:02.910> do<00:04:03.060> your

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
just keep going around you can do your

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.120 
just keep going around you can do your
scalloped<00:04:03.870> edges<00:04:04.380> here

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
scalloped edges here

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.460 
scalloped edges here
and<00:04:05.579> you're<00:04:06.420> going<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.569> do<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:07.290> your

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
and you're going to do that for your

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.009 
and you're going to do that for your
entire<00:04:07.890> design<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:09.120> then<00:04:09.660> you're<00:04:09.810> going<00:04:09.900> to

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
entire design and then you're going to

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.410 
entire design and then you're going to
set<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.380> aside<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.859> dry<00:04:10.910> so<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.239> highlight

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
set that aside to dry so to highlight

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.690 
set that aside to dry so to highlight
that<00:04:12.870> texture<00:04:13.350> we're<00:04:13.500> going<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.680> put<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.220> piece

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
that texture we're going to put a piece

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.930 
that texture we're going to put a piece
of<00:04:14.970> foil<00:04:15.709> down<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.039> I'm<00:04:17.190> putting<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.639> shiny

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
of foil down and I'm putting the shiny

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.339 
of foil down and I'm putting the shiny
side<00:04:18.299> down<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:19.850> we're<00:04:20.850> going<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.000> put<00:04:21.349> the

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
side down and we're going to put the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.219 
side down and we're going to put the
design<00:04:22.800> side<00:04:23.159> of<00:04:23.280> our<00:04:23.370> frame<00:04:23.640> down<00:04:24.180> also<00:04:24.810> and

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
design side of our frame down also and

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.020 
design side of our frame down also and
you<00:04:25.590> want<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.860> leave

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
you want to leave

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.170 
you want to leave
about<00:04:27.389> two<00:04:27.630> inches<00:04:27.990> around<00:04:28.170> on<00:04:28.710> all<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.910> sides

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
about two inches around on all the sides

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.680
