 as you see here we will do every part 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.620
 corresponding with colored sheets to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.530
 I liked doing it this way 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.809
 but if you prefer you can print the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.809
 color image the result that we 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.329
 will remain this and we will continue with the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.519
 next step now we will cover the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.630
 notebook with a sheet of the color of 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.690
 our choice 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.940
 we put the sheet with solid glue and 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 the excess can be removed or folded 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.799
 inward will be as you prefer 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.040

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.360
 will be ready and to preserve the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.430
 decorated I will cover with adhesive plastic 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.439
 if you do not have this plastic 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.680

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.560
