00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
I mean you just saw i had a there's BSN

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.270 
I mean you just saw i had a there's BSN
in<00:02:33.750> there<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.290> option<00:02:35.960> what<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.080> well<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.620> not

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
in there a option what it well is it not

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.820 
in there a option what it well is it not
we've<00:02:38.580> got<00:02:38.610> got<00:02:39.390> some<00:02:39.570> more<00:02:39.750> protein<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.710> you

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
we've got got some more protein that you

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.710 
we've got got some more protein that you
can<00:02:41.070> pick<00:02:41.730> up<00:02:41.880> from<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.440> Walmart<00:02:43.610> in<00:02:44.610> here<00:02:45.000> we've

can pick up from a Walmart in here we've
got<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:46.280> what<00:02:47.280> else<00:02:47.460> we<00:02:47.550> got<00:02:47.670> here<00:02:47.880> for<00:02:48.030> protein

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
got a what else we got here for protein

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.570 
got a what else we got here for protein
I<00:02:50.240> mean<00:02:51.240> proteins<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.170> really<00:02:52.440> hot<00:02:52.680> hot<00:02:53.100> product

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
I mean proteins a really hot hot product

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.990 
I mean proteins a really hot hot product
I<00:02:54.770> recommend<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.950> give<00:02:56.130> protein<00:02:56.550> that's<00:02:56.760> about

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I recommend to give protein that's about

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.360 
I recommend to give protein that's about
20<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.840> 30<00:02:58.110> grams<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.770> protein<00:02:58.980> per<00:02:59.190> serving

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
20 to 30 grams of protein per serving

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.580 
20 to 30 grams of protein per serving
this<00:03:00.270> is<00:03:00.390> going<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.600> really<00:03:00.720> help<00:03:01.020> boost<00:03:01.350> your

those are the ones that stand out for me

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.520 
those are the ones that stand out for me
with<00:03:31.709> paste<00:03:31.980> flavor<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:33.260> good<00:03:34.260> high<00:03:34.500> quality

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
produced in red meat so why not take it

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.590 
produced in red meat so why not take it
all<00:03:47.160> you're<00:03:47.459> doing<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.760> ingesting<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.390> little

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
all you're doing is ingesting a little

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.860 
all you're doing is ingesting a little
bit<00:03:48.750> more<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.140> going<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.350> really<00:03:49.709> help<00:03:50.010> build

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
bit more it's going to really help build

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.380 
bit more it's going to really help build
lean<00:03:51.870> muscle<00:03:52.880> what<00:03:53.880> you're<00:03:54.000> going<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> do<00:03:54.300> with

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
lean muscle what you're going to do with

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.210 
lean muscle what you're going to do with
creatine<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.930> actually<00:03:55.350> cycle<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:56.010> and

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
creatine is actually cycle it in and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.520 
creatine is actually cycle it in and
then<00:03:56.790> you're<00:03:57.360> going<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.510> basically<00:03:57.810> load<00:03:58.230> for

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
then you're going to basically load for

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.259 
then you're going to basically load for
about<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.040> week<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.489> then<00:03:59.580> you're<00:04:00.000> just<00:04:00.030> going

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
about a week and then you're just going

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.590 
about a week and then you're just going
to<00:04:00.360> kind<00:04:00.570> of<00:04:00.600> hit<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:01.080> normal<00:04:01.650> spot<00:04:01.920> so<00:04:02.610> what<00:04:03.570> I

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
to kind of hit a normal spot so what I

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.670 
to kind of hit a normal spot so what I
do<00:04:03.720> is<00:04:03.900> usually<00:04:04.380> do<00:04:04.500> about<00:04:05.450> for<00:04:06.450> about<00:04:07.320> 40

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
do is usually do about for about 40

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.300 
do is usually do about for about 40
grams<00:04:07.980> or<00:04:08.970> know<00:04:09.180> about<00:04:09.390> 30<00:04:09.840> grams<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.440> day<00:04:10.709> for

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
grams or know about 30 grams a day for

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.910 
grams or know about 30 grams a day for
about<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.640> week<00:04:11.850> after<00:04:12.390> that<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.260> week<00:04:13.530> then<00:04:13.830> I

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
about a week after that that week then I
