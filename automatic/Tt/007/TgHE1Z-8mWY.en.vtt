00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
that kind of thing

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.359 
that kind of thing

it gets a little bit out of control
quite<00:00:29.699> quickly<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.330> what<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> thought<00:00:30.810> I'd<00:00:30.960> do

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
quite quickly so what I thought I'd do

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.470 
quite quickly so what I thought I'd do
is<00:00:31.289> design<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> bunch<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.430> mechanisms<00:00:33.000> they<00:00:33.329> do

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
is design a bunch of mechanisms they do

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.880 
is design a bunch of mechanisms they do
it<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.719> controlled<00:00:34.020> manner<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.680> you're<00:00:34.800> not

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
it in a controlled manner so you're not

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.440 
it in a controlled manner so you're not
gonna<00:00:35.010> burn<00:00:35.309> down<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.760> whole<00:00:35.940> house<00:00:36.149> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
taking a look at three different designs

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.720 
ado let's crack straight on now the
first<00:00:43.770> design<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.160> we're<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> be

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
first design that we're going to be

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.369 
first design that we're going to be
taking<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> look<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.570> episode<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.230> what

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
taking a look at in this episode is what

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.650 
taking a look at in this episode is what
I<00:00:46.410> like<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.800> call<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.430> simple<00:00:47.730> fire<00:00:48.239> strip

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I like to call the simple fire strip

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.090 
I like to call the simple fire strip
lighting<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:49.680> when<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:49.860> flick

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
lighting so you see here when we flick

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.610 
lighting so you see here when we flick
this<00:00:50.250> lever<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:51.239> our<00:00:51.360> fires<00:00:51.629> turn<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.199> they

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
this lever all of our fires turn on they

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.500 
this lever all of our fires turn on they
look<00:00:52.800> very<00:00:52.829> nice<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.730> provide<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> very

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
look very nice and they provide a very

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.000 
look very nice and they provide a very
good<00:00:54.629> light<00:00:54.989> source<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.500> when<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.710> flick<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
good light source then when we flick the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.130 
good light source then when we flick the
lever<00:00:56.129> once<00:00:56.489> more<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.180> blocks<00:00:57.449> close<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.960> it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
lever once more the blocks close up it

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410 
lever once more the blocks close up it
shuts<00:00:58.590> off<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> fire<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.399> you<00:01:00.120> get<00:01:00.300> this

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
shuts off the fire and you get this

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.330 
shuts off the fire and you get this
little<00:01:00.750> indent<00:01:01.170> now<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> little<00:01:02.039> bit

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
little indent now that is a little bit

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.070 
little indent now that is a little bit
frustrating<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:03.120> would<00:01:03.300> prefer<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.960> was

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
frustrating I would prefer it if it was

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.630 
frustrating I would prefer it if it was
flush<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.559> wall<00:01:04.710> however<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.489> don't

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
flush with the wall however I don't

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.310 
flush with the wall however I don't
think<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.030> looks<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.299> bad<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.140> could

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
think it looks that bad and you could

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.920 
think it looks that bad and you could
use<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.740> piece<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:07.950> detail<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.670> base

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
use it as a piece of detail in your base

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.179 
use it as a piece of detail in your base
so<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.439> things<00:01:10.650> started<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
so you want to get things started with a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.550 
so you want to get things started with a
three<00:01:11.640> deep<00:01:11.850> area<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.600> length<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.380> up

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
three deep area the length of it is up

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.289 
three deep area the length of it is up
to<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.890> because<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.640> an<00:01:14.880> infinitely

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
to you because it is an infinitely

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480 
to you because it is an infinitely
expandable<00:01:15.900> design<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.830> anyway<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.189> want<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
expandable design so anyway you want to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
expandable design so anyway you want to
place<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.850> line<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.420> netherrack<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:19.049> along

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
place a line of netherrack going along

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.660 
place a line of netherrack going along
like<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.890> full<00:01:20.130> length<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.610> your

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
like this for the full length of your

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.940 
like this for the full length of your
thing<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.630> place<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.080> line<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.560> sticky

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
thing and then place a line of sticky

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.770 
thing and then place a line of sticky
pistons<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:23.729> long<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.330> nether<00:01:24.509> rack

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
pistons for as long as your nether rack

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.469 
pistons for as long as your nether rack
is<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.369> blocks<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
is going for and then blocks on the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.870 
is going for and then blocks on the
faces<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> those<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:29.130> go<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> couple<00:01:29.610> up

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
faces of those and then go a couple up

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.149 
faces of those and then go a couple up
like<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.329> place<00:01:30.930> dispensers<00:01:31.680> facing

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
like this place dispensers facing

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.710 
like this place dispensers facing
downwards<00:01:32.670> into<00:01:32.880> your<00:01:33.150> nether<00:01:33.270> rack<00:01:33.479> which

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
downwards into your nether rack which

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.660 
downwards into your nether rack which
are<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.960> course<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.710> dispense<00:01:35.430> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
are of course going to dispense the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.100 
are of course going to dispense the
flint<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.090> steel<00:01:36.119> which<00:01:36.570> will<00:01:36.750> light<00:01:36.930> your

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
flint and steel which will light your

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.929 
flint and steel which will light your
flame<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.040> top<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.549> all<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.729> these

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
flame then on top of all of these

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.490 
flame then on top of all of these
dispensers<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.689> want<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.900> place<00:01:40.020> redstone

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
dispensers you want to place redstone

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.280 
dispensers you want to place redstone
dust<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.119> redstone<00:01:42.119> torches<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> back<00:01:43.110> of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
dust and redstone torches on the back of

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
dust and redstone torches on the back of
each<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.560> those<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.310> should<00:01:44.579> see<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
each of those and you should see if you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.639 
each of those and you should see if you
are<00:01:45.329> doing<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.659> correctly<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.259> your

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
are doing this correctly that your

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
are doing this correctly that your
pistons<00:01:47.100> will<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.399> extend<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> when<00:01:48.689> we

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
pistons will then extend and when we

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.420 
pistons will then extend and when we
place<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.140> lever<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.590> then<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.280> will

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
place this lever here then that will

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.160 
place this lever here then that will
toggle<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.240> we<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.720> now<00:01:51.960> is

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
toggle that so all we have to do now is

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
toggle that so all we have to do now is
place<00:01:52.680> flint<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.189> steels<00:01:53.460> inside<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.270> those

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
place flint and steels inside of those

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.810 
place flint and steels inside of those
dispensers<00:01:55.140> there<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.610> each

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
dispensers there just get one in each

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.389 
dispensers there just get one in each
one<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.799> when<00:01:58.950> we<00:01:59.070> flick<00:01:59.250> our

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
one like that and then when we flick our

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.370 
one like that and then when we flick our
lever<00:01:59.610> you'll<00:01:59.939> see<00:02:00.149> their<00:02:00.360> fire<00:02:00.689> comes<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
lever you'll see their fire comes on and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.740 
lever you'll see their fire comes on and
when<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.040> flick<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.399> again<00:02:02.670> these<00:02:03.119> blocks<00:02:03.450> push

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
when we flick it again these blocks push

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.039 
when we flick it again these blocks push
it<00:02:03.899> out<00:02:04.460> now<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.670> second<00:02:06.090> design<00:02:06.329> albeit<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
it out now this second design albeit a

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.330 
it out now this second design albeit a
little<00:02:07.079> bit<00:02:07.439> more<00:02:07.619> expensive<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
little bit more expensive and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.729 
little bit more expensive and
complicated<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.479> probably<00:02:09.929> my<00:02:10.080> favorite<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
complicated is probably my favorite I

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.680 
complicated is probably my favorite I
like<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.310> call<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.700> pop-up<00:02:12.000> campfire<00:02:12.510> and

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
like to call it the pop-up campfire and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.820 
like to call it the pop-up campfire and
we'll<00:02:12.870> see<00:02:13.050> here<00:02:13.290> when<00:02:13.410> we<00:02:13.440> flick

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
we'll see here when we flick

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
we'll see here when we flick
clever<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.580> fire<00:02:14.820> comes<00:02:15.180> on<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.570> then<00:02:16.050> when

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
clever the fire comes on and then when

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.380 
clever the fire comes on and then when
we<00:02:16.320> flick<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.650> again<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.250> fire<00:02:17.520> turns<00:02:17.880> off<00:02:18.120> now

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
we flick it again the fire turns off now

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.480 
we flick it again the fire turns off now
the<00:02:18.450> way<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:18.870> works<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.500> dispenser

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
the way that this works is a dispenser

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.210 
the way that this works is a dispenser
will<00:02:20.730> fire<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.360> fire<00:02:21.690> charge<00:02:22.110> right<00:02:22.710> on<00:02:22.950> through

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
will fire a fire charge right on through

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.680 
will fire a fire charge right on through
the<00:02:23.370> netherrack<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.240> will<00:02:24.330> ignite<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
the netherrack and it will ignite the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.840 
the netherrack and it will ignite the
top<00:02:25.050> now<00:02:25.290> unfortunately<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.130> only<00:02:26.280> works<00:02:26.670> with

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
top now unfortunately it only works with

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.910 
top now unfortunately it only works with
fire<00:02:27.120> charges<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:28.470> flint<00:02:28.740> and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
fire charges and not with flint and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.800 
fire charges and not with flint and
steel<00:02:28.950> which<00:02:29.370> means<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.730> one<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.240> little

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
steel which means this one is a little

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.600 
steel which means this one is a little
bit<00:02:30.930> more<00:02:31.050> expensive<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.710> use<00:02:31.740> however<00:02:32.490> I

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
bit more expensive to use however I

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.550 
bit more expensive to use however I
think<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:33.240> looks<00:02:33.450> really<00:02:33.840> cool<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.290> don't

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
think it looks really cool so I don't

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.100 
think it looks really cool so I don't
mind<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.060> build<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.540> one<00:02:36.780> you're<00:02:36.990> going

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
mind so to build this one you're going

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.900 
mind so to build this one you're going
to<00:02:37.200> want<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.410> start<00:02:37.650> off<00:02:37.830> with<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:38.130> three<00:02:38.580> deep

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
to want to start off with a three deep

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.780 
to want to start off with a three deep
area<00:02:39.330> once<00:02:39.630> again<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.530> width<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.280> up<00:02:41.580> to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
area once again the width of it is up to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.730 
area once again the width of it is up to
you<00:02:42.000> however<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.990> remember<00:02:43.200> the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
you however you have to remember the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.710 
you however you have to remember the
Pistons<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.490> only<00:02:44.640> push<00:02:44.880> 12<00:02:45.210> blocks<00:02:45.480> but

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
Pistons can only push 12 blocks but

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.180 
Pistons can only push 12 blocks but
anyway<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.470> want<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:46.800> go<00:02:46.890> into<00:02:47.010> this

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
anyway you just want to go into this

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.100 
anyway you just want to go into this
corner<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.700> place<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:48.030> piston<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.540> then<00:02:48.930> go

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
corner and place a piston and then go

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.440 
corner and place a piston and then go
over<00:02:49.380> into<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:49.890> corner<00:02:50.280> as<00:02:50.430> well<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.880> place

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
over into this corner as well and place

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.360 
over into this corner as well and place
another<00:02:51.630> piston<00:02:52.350> then<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.920> just<00:02:53.100> want<00:02:53.280> to

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
another piston then you just want to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.340 
another piston then you just want to
place<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.820> block<00:02:54.060> there<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.570> carry<00:02:55.050> them<00:02:55.230> out

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
place a block there and carry them out

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.770 
place a block there and carry them out
all<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.860> way<00:02:55.980> over<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.550> piston<00:02:56.820> find<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
all the way over to this piston find the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.210 
all the way over to this piston find the
middle<00:02:57.959> block<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.500> place<00:02:59.070> them

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220

any old item it doesn't really matter
I'm<00:03:18.420> going<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.660> be<00:03:18.780> using<00:03:18.989> diamonds<00:03:19.200> because

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
I'm going to be using diamonds because

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.080 
I'm going to be using diamonds because
I'm<00:03:19.680> rich<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.370> then<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.580> just<00:03:20.760> want<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:20.910> place

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
I'm rich and then you just want to place

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.030 
I'm rich and then you just want to place
hoppers<00:03:21.780> running<00:03:22.140> into<00:03:22.470> each<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.890> those

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
hoppers running into each of those

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520 
hoppers running into each of those
droppers<00:03:23.550> take<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.150> comparator<00:03:24.840> output<00:03:25.290> from

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
droppers take a comparator output from

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.250 
droppers take a comparator output from
either<00:03:25.709> side<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.459> then<00:03:27.390> you<00:03:27.810> want<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.080> run

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
either side and then you want to run

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.860 
either side and then you want to run
redstone<00:03:28.769> dust<00:03:29.010> into<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> block<00:03:30.360> there<00:03:30.660> should

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
redstone dust into a block there should

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.449 
redstone dust into a block there should
be<00:03:30.989> right<00:03:31.200> underneath<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.800> piston<00:03:32.310> if

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
be right underneath this piston if

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.949 
be right underneath this piston if
you've<00:03:32.790> done<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> different<00:03:33.239> size<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.840> this

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
you've done it a different size to this

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.050 
you've done it a different size to this
then<00:03:34.260> that'll<00:03:34.800> be<00:03:34.830> in<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.040> different<00:03:35.340> place<00:03:35.580> but

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
then that'll be in a different place but

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.400 
then that'll be in a different place but
from<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.390> side<00:03:36.570> you<00:03:36.600> then<00:03:36.870> want<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.140> place<00:03:37.290> a

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
from this side you then want to place a

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.440 
from this side you then want to place a
repeater<00:03:37.560> set<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.489> four<00:03:38.670> ticks<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.120> then<00:03:39.420> a

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
repeater set it to four ticks and then a

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.500 
repeater set it to four ticks and then a
repeater<00:03:39.989> set<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.709> 2<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.220> there<00:03:41.580> we<00:03:41.730> go<00:03:41.910> then

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
repeater set to 2 and there we go then

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.150 
repeater set to 2 and there we go then
you<00:03:42.600> just<00:03:42.780> want<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.989> put<00:03:43.170> all<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.410> your<00:03:43.739> fire

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
you just want to put all of your fire

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.310 
you just want to put all of your fire
charges<00:03:44.640> into<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.120> dispenser<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.840> you're

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
charges into that dispenser and you're

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.280 
charges into that dispenser and you're
done<00:03:46.970> obviously<00:03:47.970> this<00:03:48.209> block<00:03:48.480> back<00:03:48.720> here<00:03:49.050> is

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
done obviously this block back here is

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.990 
done obviously this block back here is
your<00:03:49.560> input<00:03:49.709> block<00:03:50.130> so<00:03:50.430> let's<00:03:50.700> give<00:03:50.880> it<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
your input block so let's give it a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.759 
your input block so let's give it a
quick<00:03:51.209> test<00:03:51.420> run<00:03:51.690> you<00:03:52.050> just<00:03:52.230> flick<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.530> lever

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
quick test run you just flick this lever

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.100 
quick test run you just flick this lever
our<00:03:53.040> fire<00:03:53.580> comes<00:03:53.910> on<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.390> then<00:03:54.690> when<00:03:54.900> when<00:03:55.019> you

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
our fire comes on and then when when you

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.290 
our fire comes on and then when when you
flick<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.380> back<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:56.070> can<00:03:56.280> see<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.489> resets<00:03:57.120> the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
flick it back you can see it resets the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.550 
flick it back you can see it resets the
flame<00:03:57.540> now<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.780> can<00:03:57.989> change<00:03:58.290> up<00:03:58.410> these

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
flame now you can change up these

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.350 
flame now you can change up these
repeater<00:03:58.950> timings<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.760> get<00:03:59.910> a<00:03:59.940> slightly

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
repeater timings to get a slightly

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.390 
repeater timings to get a slightly
faster<00:04:00.510> pulse<00:04:01.080> but<00:04:01.380> in<00:04:01.590> all<00:04:01.800> honesty<00:04:02.220> it

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
faster pulse but in all honesty it

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.790 
faster pulse but in all honesty it
doesn't<00:04:02.940> really<00:04:03.060> matter

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
doesn't really matter

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.110 
doesn't really matter
the<00:04:04.800> final<00:04:05.220> design<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.700> we're<00:04:05.790> going<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:06.000> be

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
the final design that we're going to be

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.850 
the final design that we're going to be
take<00:04:06.300> a<00:04:06.330> look<00:04:06.510> at<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.750> today's<00:04:06.989> episode<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.830> a

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
take a look at in today's episode is a

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.009 
take a look at in today's episode is a
little<00:04:08.400> bit<00:04:08.550> on<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.850> outside<00:04:09.330> it's<00:04:09.870> also

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
little bit on the outside it's also

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.289 
little bit on the outside it's also
quite<00:04:10.410> expensive<00:04:10.739> and<00:04:11.130> fairly<00:04:12.060> pointless

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
quite expensive and fairly pointless

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.240 
quite expensive and fairly pointless
however<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:13.080> really<00:04:13.590> like<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.830> way<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:14.130> this

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
however I really like the way that this

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.370 
however I really like the way that this
looks<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.730> call<00:04:15.239> it<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.480> fire<00:04:15.690> pit<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.229> you

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
looks I call it the fire pit and you

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.990 
looks I call it the fire pit and you
will<00:04:16.500> see<00:04:16.709> why<00:04:16.919> in<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.190> couple<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.519> seconds<00:04:17.850> so

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
will see why in a couple of seconds so

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.610 
will see why in a couple of seconds so
we<00:04:18.090> flip<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:18.390> lever<00:04:18.570> here<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.019> you'll<00:04:19.410> see

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
we flip this lever here and you'll see

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.010 
we flip this lever here and you'll see
our<00:04:19.650> fire<00:04:20.220> comes<00:04:20.609> on<00:04:20.850> and<00:04:21.060> then<00:04:21.510> when<00:04:21.660> we<00:04:21.780> flick

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
our fire comes on and then when we flick

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.320 
our fire comes on and then when we flick
the<00:04:22.140> lever<00:04:22.260> again<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:23.100> fire<00:04:23.370> gets<00:04:23.669> put<00:04:23.910> out<00:04:24.060> by

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
the lever again the fire gets put out by

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.450 
the lever again the fire gets put out by
the<00:04:24.390> water<00:04:24.630> streams<00:04:25.140> which<00:04:25.470> is<00:04:25.710> quite<00:04:26.250> nice

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
the water streams which is quite nice

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.440 
the water streams which is quite nice
now<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.820> water<00:04:27.030> does

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
now the water does

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.390 
now the water does
take<00:04:27.540> a<00:04:27.570> while<00:04:27.840> to<00:04:27.870> go<00:04:28.170> away<00:04:28.290> but<00:04:28.920> once<00:04:29.160> it's

to be doing a tutorial on this specific
design<00:04:38.070> simply<00:04:38.550> because<00:04:38.880> they<00:04:39.330> require<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.720> lot

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
design simply because they require a lot

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.390 
design simply because they require a lot
of<00:04:39.930> variables<00:04:40.560> how<00:04:40.800> you're<00:04:40.980> going<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.220> build

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
of variables how you're going to build

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.830 
of variables how you're going to build
it<00:04:41.670> where<00:04:41.880> you're<00:04:42.000> going<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.240> place<00:04:42.420> it<00:04:42.660> and

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
it where you're going to place it and

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.290 
it where you're going to place it and
it's<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.530> don't<00:04:44.160> know<00:04:44.520> I<00:04:44.550> don't<00:04:44.790> see<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
it's just I don't know I don't see the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.390 
it's just I don't know I don't see the
point<00:04:45.450> in<00:04:45.630> doing<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:46.140> it's<00:04:46.590> also<00:04:46.770> got<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.130> bunch

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
point in doing it it's also got a bunch

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.430 
point in doing it it's also got a bunch
of<00:04:47.610> redstone<00:04:47.970> up<00:04:48.330> at<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.570> top<00:04:48.780> here<00:04:49.020> which

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
of redstone up at the top here which

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.470 
of redstone up at the top here which
looks<00:04:49.680> pretty<00:04:49.800> ugly<00:04:50.190> from<00:04:50.730> whatever<00:04:51.090> angle

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
looks pretty ugly from whatever angle

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.760 
looks pretty ugly from whatever angle
you<00:04:51.600> look<00:04:51.720> at<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.020> which<00:04:52.140> is<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.410> bit<00:04:52.590> of<00:04:52.620> a

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
you look at it which is it a bit of a

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.200 
you look at it which is it a bit of a
shame<00:04:52.980> however<00:04:53.340> if<00:04:53.520> you<00:04:53.640> are<00:04:53.760> building<00:04:53.970> this

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
shame however if you are building this

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.090 
shame however if you are building this
in<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.450> cave<00:04:54.660> then<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.290> suppose<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.770> will<00:04:55.890> look

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
in a cave then I suppose it will look

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.010 
in a cave then I suppose it will look
fairly<00:04:56.340> good<00:04:56.610> now<00:04:57.300> if<00:04:57.390> you<00:04:57.480> think<00:04:57.690> I'm<00:04:57.810> wrong

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
fairly good now if you think I'm wrong

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.690 
fairly good now if you think I'm wrong
