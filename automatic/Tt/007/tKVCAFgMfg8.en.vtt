00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.680
 delirium 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.910

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.610

 bolton decals 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.820

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.630
 that's better when we remove 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.580
 coordinates before order reason the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.580
 stress and it's really less stupid 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.400
 know, however, that the day of my 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.400
 four times that I never go back 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:00.120
