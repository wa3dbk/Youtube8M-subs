00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
folks that are into that are really are

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.580 
folks that are into that are really are
anti<00:01:12.780> gun<00:01:13.110> anti<00:01:14.780> what<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.960> whole<00:01:16.140> other<00:01:16.259> side

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
anti gun anti what that whole other side

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.770 
anti gun anti what that whole other side
was<00:01:16.770> about

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
was about

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.660 
was about
conversely<00:01:18.780> most<00:01:19.770> people<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.430> into

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
conversely most people that are into

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.060 
conversely most people that are into
ended<00:01:21.119> guns<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.630> defends<00:01:22.080> self-defense<00:01:22.740> law

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
ended guns and defends self-defense law

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.580 
ended guns and defends self-defense law
enforcement<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.759> whatnot<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
enforcement and whatnot I think that

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.249 
enforcement and whatnot I think that
people<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.100> into<00:01:26.340> UFOs<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.270> orbs<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
people that are into UFOs and orbs and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.370 
people that are into UFOs and orbs and
alien<00:01:28.710> contact<00:01:29.009> are<00:01:29.520> nut<00:01:30.329> cases<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
alien contact are nut cases so I

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.140 
alien contact are nut cases so I
immediately<00:01:31.770> ended<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> middle<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
immediately ended up in the middle of a

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.300 
immediately ended up in the middle of a
dilemma<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.470> reason<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.009> is

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
dilemma and the reason for that is

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.510 
dilemma and the reason for that is
because<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:36.930> happen<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> firearms

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
because I happen to be a firearms

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.850 
because I happen to be a firearms
instructor<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.479> happen<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.470> tactical

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
instructor I happen to be a tactical

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.030 
instructor I happen to be a tactical
instructor<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.420> come<00:01:43.110> from<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.470> background<00:01:43.619> of

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
instructor I come from a background of

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.300 
instructor I come from a background of
law<00:01:44.220> enforcement<00:01:45.320> like<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.040> have

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
law enforcement like you know have

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.770 
law enforcement like you know have
always<00:01:47.490> been<00:01:47.759> extremely<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.570> rut<00:01:49.500> conservative

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
always been extremely a rut conservative

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.960 
always been extremely a rut conservative
but<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> reality<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:53.130> you'll<00:01:53.430> see<00:01:53.670> as

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
but the reality is as you'll see as

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.399 
but the reality is as you'll see as
you'll<00:01:54.240> find<00:01:54.509> out<00:01:54.659> when<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> start<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.259> figure

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
you'll find out when I start to figure

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.959 
you'll find out when I start to figure
out<00:01:55.590> how<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> move<00:01:55.920> videos<00:01:56.369> from<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.729> than<00:01:56.880> the

out how to move videos from one than the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.170 
out how to move videos from one than the
