like last year we did a lot of

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.300 
like last year we did a lot of
photography<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.060> videos<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:37.220> felt<00:03:38.220> like

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
photography and videos and I felt like

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.339 
photography and videos and I felt like
it<00:03:38.519> was<00:03:38.669> enjoyable<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.359> it<00:03:39.479> did<00:03:39.659> involve<00:03:39.989> all

it was enjoyable and it did involve all
of<00:03:40.409> us<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.669> think<00:03:42.260> having<00:03:43.260> them<00:03:43.530> see<00:03:43.919> her

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
of us and I think having them see her

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.250 
of us and I think having them see her
and<00:03:44.879> they<00:03:45.060> can<00:03:45.209> really<00:03:45.359> see<00:03:45.659> much<00:03:45.810> more<00:03:45.989> she
