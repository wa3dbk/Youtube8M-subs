minute again
I<00:04:11.230> had<00:04:12.230> forgotten<00:04:12.650> but<00:04:13.370> last<00:04:13.609> winter<00:04:14.349> when<00:04:15.349> I

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
I had forgotten but last winter when I

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.319 
I had forgotten but last winter when I
drove<00:04:15.709> this<00:04:15.920> thing<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.190> little<00:04:16.370> bit<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.820> had<00:04:17.239> it

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
drove this thing a little bit I had it

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.789 
drove this thing a little bit I had it
all<00:04:17.449> ready<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.959> mount<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.259> on<00:04:18.380> there<00:04:18.620> at<00:04:18.739> a

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
all ready to mount it on there at a

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.560 
all ready to mount it on there at a
Subaru<00:04:19.220> right<00:04:19.489> here<00:04:19.729> and<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:22.400> would<00:04:22.669> not<00:04:23.000> it

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
Subaru right here and it would not it

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.480 
Subaru right here and it would not it
was<00:04:23.720> heating<00:04:24.020> up<00:04:24.139> and<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.800> discovered<00:04:25.340> that

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
was heating up and I discovered that

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.330 
was heating up and I discovered that
there<00:04:25.729> was<00:04:25.820> no<00:04:26.000> water<00:04:26.210> flow<00:04:26.570> whatsoever<00:04:27.340> and

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
there was no water flow whatsoever and

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.670 
there was no water flow whatsoever and
so<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.880> had<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.060> raise<00:04:29.270> that<00:04:29.509> radiator<00:04:30.050> up<00:04:30.289> high

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
so I had to raise that radiator up high

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.800 
so I had to raise that radiator up high
enough<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.699> pump<00:04:31.970> could<00:04:32.240> pick<00:04:32.479> up<00:04:32.509> the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
enough that the pump could pick up the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.680 
enough that the pump could pick up the
water<00:04:33.020> because<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:34.190> is<00:04:34.400> just<00:04:34.430> a<00:04:34.759> itsy<00:04:35.449> bitsy

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
bottom of that radiator and I don't

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.860 
bottom of that radiator and I don't
think<00:05:06.620> it's<00:05:06.800> going<00:05:07.009> to<00:05:07.070> work<00:05:07.280> but<00:05:08.060> where<00:05:08.690> else

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
think it's going to work but where else

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.270 
think it's going to work but where else
can<00:05:08.960> I<00:05:09.110> put<00:05:09.289> that<00:05:09.320> radiator<00:05:09.830> I<00:05:09.919> don't<00:05:10.099> want<00:05:10.220> to

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
can I put that radiator I don't want to

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.620 
can I put that radiator I don't want to
setting<00:05:10.550> up<00:05:10.639> after<00:05:11.000> I've<00:05:11.120> lowered<00:05:11.330> this<00:05:11.570> down

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
setting up after I've lowered this down

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.800 
setting up after I've lowered this down
so<00:05:12.080> low<00:05:12.349> I<00:05:12.710> don't<00:05:13.580> want<00:05:13.699> to<00:05:13.759> setting<00:05:14.000> up<00:05:14.060> way<00:05:14.780> up

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
so low I don't want to setting up way up

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.810 
so low I don't want to setting up way up
high<00:05:15.169> up<00:05:15.199> there<00:05:15.620> I<00:05:15.830> mean<00:05:16.159> it<00:05:16.310> would<00:05:16.460> stick<00:05:16.669> up

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
high up there I mean it would stick up

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.719 
high up there I mean it would stick up
like<00:05:17.090> a<00:05:17.330> foot<00:05:18.199> above<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.470> motor<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.159> it<00:05:19.520> just

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
like a foot above the motor and it just

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.450 
like a foot above the motor and it just
be<00:05:19.880> real<00:05:20.060> ugly<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.509> I<00:05:20.570> love<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:21.020> look<00:05:21.229> I<00:05:21.590> think

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
be real ugly and I love the look I think

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.320 
be real ugly and I love the look I think
it's<00:05:22.610> just<00:05:22.699> right<00:05:23.060> I<00:05:23.389> mean<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.470> suits<00:05:24.770> me<00:05:25.330> and

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
it's just right I mean it suits me and

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.469 
it's just right I mean it suits me and
that's<00:05:26.840> all<00:05:26.990> counts<00:05:27.409> right<00:05:27.590> Oh<00:05:27.889> since<00:05:28.789> I<00:05:28.909> try

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
that's all counts right Oh since I try

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.129 
that's all counts right Oh since I try
but<00:05:30.280> anyway<00:05:31.280> I've<00:05:32.270> been<00:05:32.330> researching<00:05:32.659> that<00:05:33.080> a

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
but anyway I've been researching that a

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.899 
but anyway I've been researching that a
little<00:05:33.320> bit<00:05:33.380> today<00:05:33.560> and<00:05:33.889> chopping<00:05:34.280> around<00:05:34.370> and

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909 
little bit today and chopping around and

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.999 
little bit today and chopping around and
you<00:05:35.720> know<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:36.020> seems<00:05:36.169> to<00:05:36.349> me<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:36.560> answer<00:05:36.860> is<00:05:36.979> a

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
you know it seems to me the answer is a

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.990 
you know it seems to me the answer is a
remote<00:05:37.430> water<00:05:37.669> pump<00:05:37.970> kobo<00:05:38.720> and<00:05:39.639> Jegs<00:05:40.639> has<00:05:40.789> got

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
remote water pump kobo and Jegs has got

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.560 
remote water pump kobo and Jegs has got
them<00:05:41.150> and<00:05:42.520> now<00:05:43.520> i'm<00:05:43.820> on<00:05:43.970> us<00:05:44.120> being<00:05:44.270> a<00:05:44.389> little

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
them and now i'm on us being a little

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.290 
them and now i'm on us being a little
bit<00:05:44.690> money<00:05:44.930> on<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:45.139> cold<00:05:45.380> growth<00:05:46.150> in<00:05:47.150> the

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
bit money on the cold growth in the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.529 
bit money on the cold growth in the
right<00:05:47.479> places<00:05:47.780> so<00:05:48.590> that<00:05:48.889> might<00:05:49.190> be<00:05:49.419> the<00:05:50.419> right

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
right places so that might be the right

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:55.120 
right places so that might be the right
place<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:52.550> we're<00:05:53.090> gonna<00:05:53.210> find<00:05:53.419> out<00:05:53.659> I<00:05:54.130> know
