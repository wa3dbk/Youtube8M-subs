00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
starters my ID is 3 3 7 3 7 which i

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.019 
starters my ID is 3 3 7 3 7 which i
think<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.119> quite<00:00:21.240> an<00:00:21.390> interesting<00:00:21.510> ID<00:00:22.490> and<00:00:23.490> I

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
think is quite an interesting ID and I

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.269 
think is quite an interesting ID and I
don't<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> nature<00:00:25.019> yet<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.619> let's<00:00:26.010> find

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
don't know the nature yet so let's find

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.980 
don't know the nature yet so let's find
out

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
out

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.170 
out
timid<00:00:28.580> it<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.970> timid<00:00:31.340> which<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:32.820> think<00:00:33.059> is

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
timid it is timid which I don't think is

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.880 
timid it is timid which I don't think is
particularly<00:00:33.540> very<00:00:33.840> good<00:00:34.079> because<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.680> think

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
particularly very good because I think

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.160 
particularly very good because I think
this<00:00:35.640> guy<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.630> good<00:00:37.469> attacker<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:39.170> don't

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
this guy is a good attacker I don't

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.479 
this guy is a good attacker I don't
think<00:00:40.320> he's<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> special<00:00:40.950> attacker<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.430> I

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
think he's a special attacker but I

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.280 
think he's a special attacker but I
don't<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.090> really<00:00:42.600> don't<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.079> mean

obviously and that that's kind of like

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.050 
obviously and that that's kind of like

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
am a red color that's not really

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.420 
am a red color that's not really
entirely<00:01:45.960> brown<00:01:46.410> it's<00:01:46.710> some<00:01:48.830> I'm<00:01:49.830> not<00:01:50.040> sitting

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
entirely brown it's some I'm not sitting

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.630 
entirely brown it's some I'm not sitting
sure<00:01:50.610> I'm<00:01:50.790> gonna<00:01:50.940> nickname<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:55.220> so<00:01:56.220> yeah

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
sure I'm gonna nickname this so yeah

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.430 
sure I'm gonna nickname this so yeah
there<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:56.940> speculation<00:01:57.149> obviously<00:01:58.050> that<00:01:58.289> the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
there was speculation obviously that the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.870 
there was speculation obviously that the
arts<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.890> decreased<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.640> fine<00:01:59.850> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
arts have decreased for fine and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.580 
arts have decreased for fine and
Shoney's<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.630> people<00:02:00.869> finding<00:02:01.259> them<00:02:01.410> left

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
Shoney's and people finding them left

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.080 
Shoney's and people finding them left
right<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:01.950> center<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:04.530> was<00:02:04.800> 517<00:02:05.700> resets<00:02:06.509> so

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
right and center this was 517 resets so

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.580 
right and center this was 517 resets so
you<00:02:09.090> know<00:02:09.239> they<00:02:09.780> think<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.380> in<00:02:10.500> a

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
you know they think it's one in a

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.320 
you know they think it's one in a
thousand<00:02:11.009> charts<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.610> know<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.970> that's

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
thousand charts and you know it that's

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.420 
thousand charts and you know it that's
probably<00:02:12.630> true<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.620> really<00:02:14.040> probably<00:02:14.220> is

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
probably true that really probably is

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.699 
probably true that really probably is
true<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.980> know<00:02:17.209> on<00:02:18.209> average<00:02:18.420> there's<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.110> 50/50

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
true you know on average there's a 50/50

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.220 
true you know on average there's a 50/50
chance<00:02:19.739> of<00:02:20.130> getting<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.550> shiny<00:02:20.810> if<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.050> do<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
chance of getting a shiny if you do a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.160 
chance of getting a shiny if you do a
500<00:02:22.830> stop<00:02:23.010> resets<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.780> that's<00:02:24.780> pretty<00:02:25.049> much

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
500 stop resets and that's pretty much

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.490 
500 stop resets and that's pretty much
it<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:29.299> so<00:02:30.299> yeah<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.750> thought<00:02:31.049> this<00:02:31.230> would<00:02:31.440> take

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
it so so yeah I thought this would take

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.770 
it so so yeah I thought this would take
flipping<00:02:32.430> forever<00:02:32.790> literally<00:02:33.180> because<00:02:33.690> I

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
flipping forever literally because I

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.930 
flipping forever literally because I
thought<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.049> was<00:02:34.200> at<00:02:34.320> 8000<00:02:35.310> sharks<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.730> didn't

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
thought it was at 8000 sharks I didn't

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.910 
thought it was at 8000 sharks I didn't
think<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.780> odds<00:02:37.019> are<00:02:37.200> decrease<00:02:37.620> but

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
think that the odds are decrease but

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.970 
think that the odds are decrease but
people<00:02:38.730> find<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> shiny<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.720> easily<00:02:39.989> now<00:02:40.380> and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
people find the shiny so easily now and

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.690 
people find the shiny so easily now and
yeah<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:46.680> know<00:02:46.829> everyone's

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
yeah it's just you know everyone's

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.770 
yeah it's just you know everyone's
finally<00:02:48.030> shiny<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:49.519> which<00:02:50.519> in<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.700> way<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.060> not

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
finally shiny so which in a way is not

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.750 
finally shiny so which in a way is not
good<00:02:52.140> because<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:53.070> know<00:02:53.190> we<00:02:53.310> had<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.549> hunt

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
good because you know we had to hunt

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.630 
good because you know we had to hunt
real<00:02:54.269> hard<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> past<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:56.100> when<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.370> comes
