just the point I know math alarm was
recently<00:00:37.260> updated<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.739> think<00:00:37.920> today<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
recently updated I think today and it

bugs where it couldn't actually disable
alarm<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.170> kind<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.320> locked<00:00:46.559> me<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.800> lock<00:00:47.489> me

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
alarm it kind of locked me up lock me

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
probably been squashed now i hope so

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.110 
probably been squashed now i hope so
i've<00:00:52.110> installed<00:00:52.500> this<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.890> i<00:00:52.980> said<00:00:53.309> let's<00:00:53.969> go

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
i've installed this as i said let's go

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.729 
i've installed this as i said let's go
back<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.360> our<00:00:54.539> home<00:00:54.750> screen<00:00:55.110> let's<00:00:55.379> open<00:00:55.620> up

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
back to our home screen let's open up

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:06.289 
back to our home screen let's open up
our<00:00:55.890> alarm<00:00:56.219> clock<00:00:57.500> okay<00:00:58.500> i<00:01:00.140> just<00:01:01.140> keep<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:05.299> get

our alarm clock okay i just keep see get
a<00:01:06.330> little<00:01:06.570> barking<00:01:07.159> okay<00:01:08.570> alright<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.930> save

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
a little barking okay alright so save

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.070 
a little barking okay alright so save
that<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.210> minute<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.630> should<00:01:12.840> go<00:01:12.930> off

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that and in a minute this should go off

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.510 
that and in a minute this should go off
and<00:01:13.290> should<00:01:13.500> ask<00:01:13.680> me<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> solve<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.310> math

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and should ask me to solve a math

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640 
and should ask me to solve a math
problem<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:15.000> order<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.390> disengage<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.350> alarm

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
problem in order to disengage the alarm

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
problem in order to disengage the alarm
so<00:01:16.950> let's<00:01:17.549> hope<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.880> works<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.330> keeps

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
so let's hope it works and it just keeps

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.140 
so let's hope it works and it just keeps
going<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.049> going<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.850> now<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.000> hit

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
going and going and going now but hit

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.039 
going and going and going now but hit
snooze<00:01:32.090> it's<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> ask<00:01:33.450> me<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> actually

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
snooze it's going to ask me to actually

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.469 
snooze it's going to ask me to actually
solve<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.100> problem<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.759> that's<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
solve this problem and that's not one of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.899 
solve this problem and that's not one of
these<00:01:36.600> easy<00:01:36.930> four<00:01:37.200> times<00:01:37.500> four<00:01:37.799> things<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.400> mean

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
these easy four times four things I mean

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.429 
these easy four times four things I mean
this<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.509> does<00:01:39.780> take<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> little

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
this is actually does take a little

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.100 
this is actually does take a little
little<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.880> coherence<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.570> order<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.899> solve

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
little like coherence in order to solve

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.990 
little like coherence in order to solve
this<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> little<00:01:44.130> easier<00:01:44.369> since<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.729> 10

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
this was a little easier since it's 10

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.389 
this was a little easier since it's 10
so<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.840> makes<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.229> little<00:01:46.619> bit<00:01:46.950> simpler

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
so that makes it a little bit simpler

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.999 
so that makes it a little bit simpler
but<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.360> still<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.990> lot<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:49.649> are<00:01:49.829> like

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
but it's still a lot of these are like

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.030 
but it's still a lot of these are like
65<00:01:50.850> x<00:01:51.240> 13<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> stuff<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.890> does

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
65 x 13 and stuff like that so it does

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280 
65 x 13 and stuff like that so it does
take<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> little<00:01:53.540> little<00:01:54.540> coherence<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.079> order

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
take a little little coherence in order

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.690 
take a little little coherence in order
to<00:01:55.380> solve<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.130> good<00:01:56.159> thing<00:01:56.310> actually

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
to solve so that's a good thing actually

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.520 
to solve so that's a good thing actually
so<00:01:57.299> let<00:01:57.390> me<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.600> type<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> answer<00:01:58.290> here

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
so let me just type in the answer here

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.560 
so let me just type in the answer here
so<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.520> type<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.820> wrong<00:02:00.060> here's<00:02:00.420> what

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
so if I type it wrong here's what

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.850 
so if I type it wrong here's what
happens<00:02:01.250> nothing<00:02:02.250> absolutely<00:02:02.790> nothing<00:02:03.860> so

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
happens nothing absolutely nothing so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.550 
happens nothing absolutely nothing so
680

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.450 

see<00:02:11.560> this<00:02:11.740> is<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.920> problem<00:02:12.040> i<00:02:12.340> was

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
see this is the problem i was

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.920 
see this is the problem i was
experiencing<00:02:12.910> earlier<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.480> can't<00:02:13.720> actually

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
experiencing earlier you can't actually

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.280 
experiencing earlier you can't actually
get<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.970> your<00:02:15.970> snooze<00:02:16.390> button<00:02:16.810> there<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.140> can

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
get to your snooze button there you can

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.870 
get to your snooze button there you can
actually<00:02:17.440> touch<00:02:17.740> it<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.310> even<00:02:18.520> if<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.640> put<00:02:18.790> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
actually touch it so even if you put the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.350 
actually touch it so even if you put the
problem<00:02:19.570> in<00:02:19.690> right<00:02:20.880> kind<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:21.940> gives<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.300> a

actually disable it with this new

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.920 
actually disable it with this new
problem<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.800> is<00:02:57.400> helpful<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:58.120> go<00:02:58.330> ahead

problem so that is helpful so go ahead

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.390 
problem so that is helpful so go ahead
and<00:02:59.050> solve<00:02:59.320> this<00:02:59.530> problem<00:02:59.980> you're<00:03:00.100> gonna<00:03:00.220> see

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
and solve this problem you're gonna see

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.610 
and solve this problem you're gonna see
42<00:03:00.820> x<00:03:01.420> 6<00:03:01.960> that<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:04.350> 252<00:03:05.350> i<00:03:05.830> believe<00:03:06.930> what<00:03:07.930> okay

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
42 x 6 that is 252 i believe what okay

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.120 
42 x 6 that is 252 i believe what okay
so<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.100> did<00:03:09.250> snooze<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:11.500> was<00:03:11.620> a<00:03:11.650> right<00:03:11.860> in<00:03:12.010> I

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
so it did snooze that was a right in I

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.490 
so it did snooze that was a right in I
was<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.340> right<00:03:12.490> answer<00:03:12.700> wasn't<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.090> 42<00:03:13.420> x<00:03:13.630> 6<00:03:13.870> 252

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
was a right answer wasn't it 42 x 6 252

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.880 
was a right answer wasn't it 42 x 6 252
I<00:03:14.710> think<00:03:15.040> okay<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:15.960> for<00:03:16.960> some<00:03:17.200> reason<00:03:17.230> it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
I think okay so for some reason it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.050 
I think okay so for some reason it
popped<00:03:18.160> up<00:03:18.310> again<00:03:18.430> but<00:03:18.700> that's<00:03:18.820> probably

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
popped up again but that's probably

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.850 
popped up again but that's probably
because<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.690> kind<00:03:20.020> of<00:03:20.050> had<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.230> work<00:03:20.470> around<00:03:20.620> the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
because I kind of had to work around the

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.630 
because I kind of had to work around the
little<00:03:21.010> books<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:22.150> was<00:03:22.300> happening<00:03:22.510> there<00:03:22.870> so

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
little books that was happening there so

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.350 
little books that was happening there so
just<00:03:24.640> be<00:03:24.820> careful<00:03:25.060> with<00:03:25.240> this<00:03:25.510> man<00:03:26.070> alright<00:03:27.070> so

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
just be careful with this man alright so

just be careful with this man alright so
300<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.520> popping<00:03:30.880> up<00:03:31.060> like<00:03:31.270> in<00:03:31.570> what

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940
