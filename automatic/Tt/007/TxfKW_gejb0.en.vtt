00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
be like a quarter of a stop lower I got

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.640 
be like a quarter of a stop lower I got
the<00:00:58.859> 800<00:01:02.570> 320<00:01:03.570> watt<00:01:03.750> seconds<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.470> they're

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the 800 320 watt seconds and they're

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.359 
the 800 320 watt seconds and they're
awesome<00:01:05.339> they're<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.510> versatile<00:01:07.369> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
awesome they're just so versatile the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.140 
awesome they're just so versatile the
slow<00:01:08.640> thing<00:01:08.939> spins<00:01:09.270> down<00:01:10.580> on<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> stand

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
slow thing spins down on the stand

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.399 
slow thing spins down on the stand
also<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.659> pull<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:12.960> out<00:01:18.140> pull<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.170> out

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
also you can pull this out pull it out

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.740 
also you can pull this out pull it out
and<00:01:19.650> adjust<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:21.090> sometimes<00:01:21.270> it's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and adjust it because sometimes it's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.179 
and adjust it because sometimes it's
down<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.500> can't<00:01:22.680> go<00:01:22.799> any<00:01:22.979> tighter

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
down here and you can't go any tighter

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
down here and you can't go any tighter
so<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.909> pull<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.360> swing<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.049> backwards

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
so you pull it out swing it backwards

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.310 
so you pull it out swing it backwards
that's<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> lot<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.580> people<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:27.290> they<00:01:28.290> just

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.170 
that's a lot of people know they just
don't<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.369> my<00:01:32.579> two<00:01:32.640> cents<00:01:33.000> I
