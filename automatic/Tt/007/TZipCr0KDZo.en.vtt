00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.120
 so hello everyone but the video is almost not 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.799
 what is so simple we have here the first fell 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.929
 snow 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.639
 but, too, even dubbed when 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.740
 managed only today in the morning piled 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.440
 bumps 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.760
 here I am quietly run in until 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.580
 still on summer and not 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.939
 by the way here is what I was talking about 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.060
 here I left home here please 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:30.090
 rim brakes here it all stuck 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.559
 to drive more like to Moscow on foot 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.910
 unscrew when you drive this 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.020
 winter is necessary here but does not mean 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.000
 had to pull the tires a little not 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.480
 but at the back it was at least so 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.260
 a little somewhere about 2 food and atmosphere 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.610

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:59.640
 let me down I don't know how much I let down 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:03.390
 us to atmospheres 1 can there 1 and 3 1 and 5 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.140
 that is, a tangible subsided in so noticeable 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.950
 better bike ride became palpable and 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.470
 pass it began to wind it with the less 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:20.670
 that means this strange Chinese 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:23.820
 speedometer view means reading walking 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.409
 not enough here I had to even put 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.299
 native magnet that will not work anymore 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.820

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.920

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.500
