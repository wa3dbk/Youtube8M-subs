00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.740
 hi dimoks my name is sergey 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.810
 knees and work in the company did not shaft and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.070
 at the request of Peter Salnikov, I will tell 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.070
 you about your five favorite filter 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.640
 it was a difficult choice actually 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.189
 because it started to remember 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.899
 games that influenced me and how 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.510
 I like the list more 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:38.910
 and 150 projects so probably I 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.740
 wrong not all good games those 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.690
 who don't like now 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:47.020
 first probably postponing the squad of high school 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.630
 from it was the brothers goal makers game 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.010
 xcom it was their 2 famous project after 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.870
 childbirth old doors 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.550
 they made lye to minus which 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.470
 which is now to do a remake but not important 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.010
 it is important that Ozersky from was the first 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:04.120
 full political strategy with 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.010
 equipment fighters manipulation 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.480
 objects and other things that you 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.250
 like in gascony so here it was 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.460
 first gentlemen more than that in my opinion 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.280
 in terms of botaki skiing scott is much 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.110
 more interesting than xcom it is much 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.220
 more tactically diverse for example 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.140
 such techniques as throwing a grenade 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.540
 Comrades so I threw on the next 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.850
 go when the enemy breaks in 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.860
 X-com and such a mummy new except 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.860
 but there is an economy and it is also good 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.490
 2 Perhaps this is a game of civilization Sid 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.869
 meier 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.820
 I can not name any specific 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.470
 part because I always play the most 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.820
 last now i play more 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.970
 civilization 5 and in a revolution which 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.500
 came out on ipad they are different but they are all 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.259
 built on one very correct 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.520
 civilization scheme this game is about 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.180
 balancing progress and military power 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.710
 and besides it's interesting 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.040
 generally from a historical point of view on and 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.679
 it's still interesting how the game is about 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.000
 many small choices say that 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.039
 life in general is a lot of small 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.720
 choices that lead you to something 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.750
 bad or good such a civilization 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.560
 it is such a compact life which 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.560
 plays in 24 hours 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.700
 and to close the topic with strategies 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.290
 another strategy that scared me 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.140
 remembered and that son a long time ago 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.060
 there was no football 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.810
 i'm not talking about don thief for example either 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.569
 contract because football was unique 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.920
 not so much with its setting as 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.459
 the presence of the third dimension and she 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.170
 really was hard to understand 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.360
 especially important player but she was 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.970
 very interesting you once I played 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.620
 six or seven o'clock like you and not 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.239
 opened a second wind began 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.560
 use actual creams which 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.190
 other strategies in principle not 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.109
 is used 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.400
 you understand that the hillwood is like its many 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.160
 strategies all start to play the same way 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.120
 you secrete no frame and then 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.930
 leave it build 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.970
 in many strategies on this proper 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.870
 all your tactics and ends but 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.400
 football cinema appeared other more 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.470
 Interestingly maybe we will remove about the choice 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.160
 What units to attack? 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.200
 have you appeared 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.519
 you maneuver manifested itself by the tail 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.160
 the flanks although in my opinion it was not 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.160
 some important things that not others 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.099
 which are other strategies but your own 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.639
 By this madness and these dimensions it is very 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.639
 I remember very much 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.970
 of the more recent games I really like 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.860
 Allah, yes only the first I understand 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.780
 that it falls like almost everything 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.460
 cooperative games depends on the company with 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.410
 which you play but I'm so lucky 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.170
 that the first year where they played there very much 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.140
 for example, the fun company of us was the husband 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.530
 wife and wife naturally chose zoe 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.030
 and her husband if properly played where 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.980
 Negro 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.630
 and this is very touching 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.340
 moment or for example basically everything once 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.370
 later happy to collect or so 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.600
 by helicopter but here at the cost of our life our 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.700
 comrade trying to save his wife 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.570
 although in principle we will win ibiza already 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.459
 fly away in the end everyone throws the pilot 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.769
 western helicopter and run back 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.930
 to save this couple why is it fun 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.580
 dies restart injury zone and here 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.989
 I really like the games that 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.100
 let you create your story 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.630
 a civilization that already called it a laser 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.910
 squad challenge downturn were unique events 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.960
 and here comes out probably one of the best 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.960
 games about their history 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.909
 and finally, probably something from the very 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.550
 fresh this chart series 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.869
 Ancharted good not so that he allows 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.199
 create your story he is not at all 

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:48.559
 allows you to move away from the plot 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:52.789
 left-right but how to play fair 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:53.660
 ancharted not the best but good about 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.180
 movie 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.310
 that is, this is the case when the game 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.330
 pretend to be a movie but successfully 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.980
 not trying to flirt with 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.890
 interactivity like heavy rain 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.230
 Anchar then here have a straight clone 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:09.260
 Indiana Jones with game mechanics from 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.880
 tomb raider and at the same time it passes and 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.290
 playing bovine this is one of those games 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.270
 sunset frame is more interesting to watch or 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.890
 started playing every time I played 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.780
 uncharted my whole family sat down 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.780
 in front of the TV and watched it left 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.350
 on whether or fragment can be tied but there is 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.120
 still a bunch that do not like that 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:33.610
 did not mention for example total war 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.590
 this is elite this is colonization of sid mayer 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.180
 because colonization 7 though was not 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.950
 a tangle of alarm but that faith 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.590
 was with great moral in texts was 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.080
 a game about the destruction of a whole people for the sake of 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.800
 arrived people who sit britain 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.600
 far and far from you and her 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.150
 play without destroying I know that very 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.940
 few chose colonization of the way 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.240
 simulations in 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:00.090
 local culture but this is probably one of 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.890
 such games are serious moral 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.500
 a choice that you don't understand until then 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.030
 until I pass I do not speak there 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:10.290
 lose play man moral 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:13.160
 Ryan's choice of screen hobby from the point of view 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:16.710
 plot level i don't know budget 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.290
 series Russian hairstyle while on the game 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.680
 I can't shoot the actors 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.680
 with photo
