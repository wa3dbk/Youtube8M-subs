00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
continuity on offense Indiana was a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.060 
continuity on offense Indiana was a
little<00:01:20.820> bit<00:01:20.939> choppy<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:22.950> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
little bit choppy but you know if you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.039 
little bit choppy but you know if you
look<00:01:23.340> deeper<00:01:23.850> into<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.180> stats<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> game

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
look deeper into the stats in the game

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.230 
look deeper into the stats in the game
another<00:01:25.560> glaring<00:01:25.920> thing<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.939> when

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
another glaring thing that when

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
another glaring thing that when
everybody<00:01:27.600> was<00:01:27.750> talking<00:01:27.990> about<00:01:28.320> how<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
everybody was talking about how the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.560 
everybody was talking about how the
Knicks<00:01:29.310> played<00:01:29.610> better<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.180> everything

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
Knicks played better and everything

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.929 
Knicks played better and everything
there's<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.470> stat<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.890> stood<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.759> me

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
there's one stat that stood out to me

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:33.980 
there's one stat that stood out to me
and<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.210> think<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.540> difference<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and I think it's a difference of the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.530 
and I think it's a difference of the
game<00:01:34.170> free<00:01:34.439> throws<00:01:34.710> absolutely<00:01:35.579> no<00:01:35.820> there's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
game free throws absolutely no there's

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.770 
game free throws absolutely no there's
no<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:37.079> cannot<00:01:37.590> be<00:01:37.920> an<00:01:38.100> NBA<00:01:38.460> team<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.119> only

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
no you cannot be an NBA team and only

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.800 
no you cannot be an NBA team and only
make<00:01:39.960> 19<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.770> 30<00:01:40.979> 35<00:01:41.700> shots<00:01:41.970> especially<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
make 19 of 30 35 shots especially on the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.899 
make 19 of 30 35 shots especially on the
road<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.170> ridiculous<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.770> left<00:01:43.979> 14<00:01:44.460> points

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
road it's ridiculous you left 14 points

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.690

lay<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> floor<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.280> that's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.369> difference

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
lay on the floor and that's a difference

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.179 
lay on the floor and that's a difference
in<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> ballgame<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.810> does<00:01:49.560> New<00:01:49.920> York
