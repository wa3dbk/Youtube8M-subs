00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 The corners are very sharp 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.370
 wish this problem was with the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.290
 predecessor the galaxy s 4 so not yet 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.500
 Available like this archive 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.199
 proves once again a corner here 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.510
 100 percent there, the details are almost 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.000
 as well preserved as in the middle of the picture 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 Here you can get from one for smartphones 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.439
 speak usual quality 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.000
 in photos under bad 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.170
 lighting conditions like here in the sham 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.059
 a candle catches the galaxy s 5 on the right 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.820
 surprisingly a bit more light 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.860
 the miniature eiffel tower below in the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.230
 the middle is not anymore when it comes to consumption 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.450
 make out 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.370
 In return, the case is with his 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870
 optical image stabilizer of course 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.820
 clear in the advantage 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.329
 these shot out of hand 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.120
 Recordings are clearly left sharp 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.980
 on the right shake you switch the lightning 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.579
 so one should think that the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.780
 Xenon flash of the case around the led of the s5 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.489
 should be superior 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.369
 but as you can see he is the opposite 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.010
 the case itself the steel door behind 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.520
 left gets more light on the s5 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.970
 as the case also expires the areas 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.009
 is not larger in consumption 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.460
 synonymous with the videos in full hd does that 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.659
 s5 the clearly sharp shots and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.150
 not just in the corners 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.369
 Although with motives go with many 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.530
 details in the case of a panning even when 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.630
 s5 lost a few details 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.579
 but because the reason is clear 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.799
 is better than the consumption falls, the 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.720
 hardly worth it 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.520
 for the second video was the frame 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.860
 with the two smartphones on it 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.750
 held by hand 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.790
 here arise due to consumption 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.990
 of the optical stabilizer the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.899
 calmer pictures 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.610
 there the digital stabilizing of the s5 can 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.070
 right not keep up 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.320
 but of course it succeeds in running 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.390
 not even the optical stabilizer 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.159
 to compensate for all movements 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.790
 Overall, however, the recording remains 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.270
 Quiet to finish something again 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.009
 quieter motive that casey can left 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.750
 the small movement of the hand almost 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.090
 fully compensate 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.340
 while the s5 right that 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.340
 quiver as good as unrestrained in the picture 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.200
 to conclude yet another 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.040
 Video the case under use of the son 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.620
 the zoom is activated via the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.819
 volume region sees this movement 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.629
 of course you then in the 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.580
 admission 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.099
 even if like here a tripod for 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.319
 use comes during the siemens can 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.220
 the software compression artifacts 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.769
 not avoid 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.160
 just the data rate of 17 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.890
 megabits per second but not these 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.130
 movement is relatively supple and that 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.660
 result pleasing sharp and also here 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.760
 you can see again that the blurred 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.440
 Do not corner at higher focal lengths 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.950
 occur only in the wide angle 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.480
 setting for zoom rides can indeed 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.849
 also buttons on the touchscreen 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.220
 to be used here was now the 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.709
 User interface of the camera later 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.269
 Over the picture these switches are placed 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.400
 appears only after the 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.200
 volume rocker has already been touched 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.569
 and even this movement is enough 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.940
 a produce from picture wagner 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.459
 it would be better if these elements 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.709
 be permanently visible at least 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.760
 if the user wishes this but one 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.100
 Unfortunately, this option is missing 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.530
 Imagine the samsung galaxy ace 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.370
 in media check it leaves extremely 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.950
 ambivalent 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.609
 On the one hand you succeed in photos and 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.139
 videos with the optical 10x zoom 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.480
 excellent there can be no other 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.459
 keep up with the smartphone 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.470
 as a substitute for a video camera emerges 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.569
 However , the zoom is not 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.239
 did not ride smooth enough and before 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.849
 all things for the operation of the zooms 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.519
 about the volume rocker inevitably 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.440
 to wobble in the picture above all things 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.169
 but the picture quality is disappointing 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.819
 Wide angle mode than in smartphones 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.819
 usual picture area
