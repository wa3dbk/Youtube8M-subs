we're going to see is what we've seen
over<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.920> past<00:00:29.189> year<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:29.640> two<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
over the past year or two is that the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.500 
over the past year or two is that the
companies<00:00:30.890> that<00:00:31.890> are<00:00:31.980> able<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> generate<00:00:32.610> real

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
free cash flow and earnings are going to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.840 
free cash flow and earnings are going to
continue<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.829> whilst<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> ones<00:00:38.670> that

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
continue to do so whilst the ones that

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.590 
continue to do so whilst the ones that
are<00:00:38.969> marginally<00:00:39.750> getting<00:00:40.020> by<00:00:40.230> are<00:00:41.540> sort<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
are marginally getting by are sort of

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.950 
are marginally getting by are sort of
forced<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.640> decrease<00:00:44.640> their<00:00:44.910> costs<00:00:45.660> by

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
forced to decrease their costs by

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.080 
forced to decrease their costs by
basically<00:00:46.829> cutting<00:00:47.129> back<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> capital

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
basically cutting back on the capital

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.600 
basically cutting back on the capital
expenditures<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.870> exploration<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.579> I

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
expenditures and exploration so I

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.420 
expenditures and exploration so I
suspect<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.570> we'll<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.949> same<00:00:53.190> thing

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
suspect that we'll see is the same thing

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.069 
suspect that we'll see is the same thing
for<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> rest<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.000> quarter<00:00:54.360> read<00:00:54.930> last

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
costs by way of again like I mentioned

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.140 
costs by way of again like I mentioned
reducing<00:01:31.770> capital<00:01:32.189> expenditures<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.939> such

reducing capital expenditures and such

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.539 
reducing capital expenditures and such
so<00:01:33.590> looking<00:01:34.590> out<00:01:34.740> there<00:01:34.979> which<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.280> what<00:01:35.520> I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
so looking out there which is what I

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.660 
so looking out there which is what I
really<00:01:36.390> do<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.689> try<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:36.930> find<00:01:37.229> an<00:01:37.920> opportunity

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
really do is try and find an opportunity

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.149 
really do is try and find an opportunity

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that if I was a mining company I'd take

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.520 
that if I was a mining company I'd take
take<00:01:41.880> over<00:01:42.240> right<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.140> touched<00:01:43.409> upon

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
interesting and the exploration space is

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.060 
interesting and the exploration space is
we're<00:02:45.070> really<00:02:45.370> focused<00:02:45.989> it's<00:02:46.989> getting<00:02:47.800> tough
