and<00:04:16.080> so<00:04:16.860> your<00:04:17.640> macbook<00:04:17.970> was<00:04:18.090> like<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.450> all

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
and so your macbook was like this all

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.380 
and so your macbook was like this all
your<00:04:19.110> ports<00:04:19.380> are<00:04:19.530> accessible<00:04:20.120> enough<00:04:21.120> room

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
your ports are accessible enough room

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.150 
your ports are accessible enough room
the<00:04:22.230> only<00:04:22.440> thing<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.710> didn't<00:04:23.100> like<00:04:23.160> and<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:25.160> think

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
the only thing I didn't like and I think

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.910 
the only thing I didn't like and I think
that<00:04:26.610> although<00:04:27.540> this<00:04:27.990> case<00:04:28.290> is<00:04:28.470> really<00:04:28.680> good

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
that although this case is really good

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.090 
that although this case is really good
with<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.070> ventilation<00:04:29.670> I<00:04:30.860> should<00:04:31.860> have<00:04:31.950> got

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
with the ventilation I should have got

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.940 
with the ventilation I should have got
another<00:04:32.400> color<00:04:32.670> but<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.330> only<00:04:33.450> black<00:04:33.950> didn't

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
another color but the only black didn't

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.580 
another color but the only black didn't
really<00:04:35.100> want<00:04:35.280> block<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:36.360> on<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.870> back<00:04:37.110> here<00:04:37.440> or

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
really want block so on the back here or

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.200 
really want block so on the back here or
on<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.740> side<00:04:38.040> here<00:04:38.220> it's<00:04:38.400> got<00:04:38.580> for<00:04:39.120> the
