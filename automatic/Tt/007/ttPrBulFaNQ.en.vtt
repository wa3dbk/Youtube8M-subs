 Now it's logical to head in the row 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.890
 But what is certain when buying 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.890

 between the ring 12 50 something rather 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.090
 smaller size standard is so 13 5 the

 to strength we have mm in this case 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.320
 thick to the topic it is always thicker 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.019
 the softer that there is one 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 a little bit of complacent because studies 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.860
 that ultimately results in horses

 average from 2 to 2 5 cm 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.110
 that means in the end but always place 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.700
 from the time the maximum 85 centimeters that 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.250
 ultimately endangered at targets 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.320
 would be with at least 14 in sixteen 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.570
 Strength recommend only to see if that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.240
 bit fits or long enough 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.410
 i go to fund drives and cisco 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.979
 bit apart 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.140
 and then it really should be at the bit 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.910
 with loose rain left and right maximum 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.840
 half a centimeter to get out the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.850
 baking stinks was longer here 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.780
 should be set to look at even 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.069
 no case that the heart and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.590
 Dauergrinsen has that would be very negative 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:31.410
 One says at the recorded trains may 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.970
 do not sag the baking piece and 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:38.789
 It should be the tasks here 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.740
 Two folds form at the nose-ring 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.099
 right that the two fingers and am 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.970
 I have to look at my cheekbone square 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.800
 that the pad covers the bones in 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.380
 the eu is even needed once 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.450
 all around with the finger comes through 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.759
 every wheel has a long synonymous 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.009
 I do not print here 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.039
 it is always bones with thinner 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.229
 skin over it so the story has one 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.739
 hardly allow movement in any case 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.989
 it has to stop so it does not bother 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.959
 you any new moves though 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:21.560
 it should not be too restrictive 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:21.560
 simply make the baker's drink quite easy 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:29.129
 the horses are in the forefront generally 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.799
 has become broader so is 42 and 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.840
 the standard measure is the 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.629
 complete headband including the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.239
 He will say that fits now 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.129
 quite well 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.319
 even with the neck piece there is a lot 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.620
 to be observed 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.719
 There are so many variations anatomically 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.540
 not anatomical in many horses 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.189
 At atom is very good but now would 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.219
 I do not even go for an anatomical 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.120
 because they are just behind the ears very much 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.159
 narrow 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.659
 there are the normal actually sitting on 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.150
 Best I have now only the experience 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:06.000
 made because the anatomical then 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.219
 really start from here on this 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.379
 sit and it just bothers her 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.999
 I think in the neck is already important 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.069
 that they are a bit padded 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:17.269
 in most cases it is already real 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.560
 nice if the neck pieces over the 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.780
 So the straps over the luggage 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.640
 Run long because I'm not the thin one 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.530
 also has belt still in the neck are 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.180
 Wide nose straps find many 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.670
 but they are also beautiful for you 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.340
 every horse is suitable because I have to 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.290
 pay attention to how is the head 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.599
 simply built when I'm waiting for a horse 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.579
 with after long mouth split where I 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.040
 anyway has no place for the 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.439
 noses or I again for the bit and 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.959
 the nose ring I have to watch what I 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.560
 because not too fat because I will 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.720
 begin to really clamp here 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.400
 and then I'll break it 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.380
 I do not say many filigree ones 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.530
 horses have very little space 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.959
 between mouth and then I go already 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.640
 really on the narrower yes it will 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.770
 many also mixed with big horses 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.230
 thus the types are also different they 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.610
 we are getting bigger head especially 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.720
 a wide playing with the ponies 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.090
 that is very extreme 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.910
 and then you really have to think about it 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.250
 if I can handle the pony trense 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.250
 or whether I'm going to a full-blooded pension 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.350
 if the zivi is recorded you are allowed 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.000
 not clear the fast after handle 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.620
 which may also not get bored that 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.540
 the second problem because when he is so long 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.990
 is like, for example, I say now 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.510
 so deep hangs then hill in it one man 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.190
 now really dangerous this golden one 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.710
 Now the pony brick one sees 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.550
 ends up further back when I'm on the back 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.210
 lay the neck 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.130
 as the wagon trains so stallion types are 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.220
 It also has a very short neck 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.470
 There is usually time to reach 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.150
 even ponies also ill 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.620
 So it has to be with us already 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.630
 to let fly so jokes is 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.610
 to make sure that at the 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.900
 passform it is that tidy at 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.360
 Horse's head rests that she does not 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.550
 beating anywhere then she is allowed to 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.740
 Do not miss it 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.080
 field of view is obstructed then you have to 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.380
 take care that they are relatively in the back 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.620
 long survive that they are not straight 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:21.350
 yet druckstelle contrast, where stop 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.600
 even the neck piece is already here 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.950
 happened very well what I we are the 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.080
 here to end 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.080
 that means she fills that up 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.070
 points 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.500
 It may not be allowed to last longer 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.660
 be short because i really do get here then 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.970
 the pressure on the neighbors there was 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.830
 it can be even three inches 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.810
 that should already be padded because 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.330
 For example, I had many times and when I was 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.730
 her fall several hours on it so it 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.060
 must actually sit casually on the horse 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.010
 but it must not disturb 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.730
 and it can not be up 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.730
 any bones
