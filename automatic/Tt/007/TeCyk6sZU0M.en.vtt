00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
it was really rough for me when I left

left school and started painting alone

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.209 
left school and started painting alone
full-time<00:00:58.120> I<00:00:58.540> when<00:00:59.500> I<00:00:59.530> was<00:00:59.620> living<00:00:59.980> at<00:01:00.040> home

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
full-time I when I was living at home

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.639 
full-time I when I was living at home
and<00:01:00.519> working<00:01:00.820> at<00:01:01.180> home<00:01:01.510> so<00:01:01.960> I<00:01:02.019> had<00:01:02.170> no<00:01:02.440> reason

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
and working at home so I had no reason

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.439 
and working at home so I had no reason
to<00:01:02.829> ever<00:01:02.980> leave<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.370> house<00:01:03.489> like<00:01:03.969> go<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.330> buy

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
to ever leave the house like go and buy

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.510 
to ever leave the house like go and buy
milk<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:04.989> I'm<00:01:05.049> chat<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:05.830> person<00:01:06.250> selling

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
milk and I'm chat to the person selling

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:19.460 
milk and I'm chat to the person selling
me<00:01:06.700> milk<00:01:06.970> first<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.850> way<00:01:10.060> too<00:01:10.119> long<00:01:15.149> oh<00:01:16.500> yeah

me milk first like way too long oh yeah

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.270 
me milk first like way too long oh yeah
I<00:01:21.600> mean<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:22.869> think<00:01:23.110> this<00:01:23.320> is<00:01:23.440> how<00:01:23.560> they<00:01:23.710> paint

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
I mean I think this is how they paint

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.029 
I mean I think this is how they paint
cars<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:26.080> they<00:01:26.170> don't<00:01:26.350> use<00:01:26.440> oil<00:01:26.710> paint

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
cars but they don't use oil paint

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:35.090 
cars but they don't use oil paint
they<00:01:27.160> used<00:01:27.369> enameled

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.010 

I<00:01:35.220> think<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.210> bit<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> guilt<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.869> being

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
I think a little bit of a guilt of being

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.649 
I think a little bit of a guilt of being
an<00:01:37.140> artist<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.890> time<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:38.580> any<00:01:38.670> time<00:01:39.030> when

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
an artist in this time or any time when

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.710 
an artist in this time or any time when
you<00:01:39.840> could<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.850> either<00:01:41.850> doing<00:01:42.119> something<00:01:42.210> more

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you could be either doing something more

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.170 
you could be either doing something more
proactively<00:01:43.409> positive<00:01:44.070> directly<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
proactively positive directly in the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.690 
proactively positive directly in the
world<00:01:45.830> it's<00:01:46.830> hard<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.190> do<00:01:47.280> something<00:01:47.460> that's

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
world it's hard to do something that's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.370 
world it's hard to do something that's
not<00:01:47.820> justified<00:01:48.360> by<00:01:48.540> anything<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.049> don't<00:01:49.290> know

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
not justified by anything I don't know

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.609 
not justified by anything I don't know
if<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.590> actually<00:01:50.869> succeed<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.080> but<00:01:52.470> that's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
if I actually succeed in that but that's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:17.580

that if you feel a kinship from for a
moment<00:05:31.540> at<00:05:31.720> least<00:05:31.960> with<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.500> world<00:05:33.060> you<00:05:34.060> feel

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
moment at least with the world you feel

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.010

a<00:05:34.360> little<00:05:34.540> less<00:05:34.930> alone<00:05:35.770> in<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:36.310> world<00:05:36.490> which

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
a little less alone in the world which

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.760 
a little less alone in the world which
which<00:05:38.020> is<00:05:38.140> great

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770
