but<00:01:48.290> of<00:01:48.439> course<00:01:49.299> Kane<00:01:50.299> had<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.320> come<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.860> be<00:01:52.040> a

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
but of course Kane had to come and be a

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.420 
but of course Kane had to come and be a
jerk<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:52.880> not<00:01:53.540> play<00:01:53.840> fair<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.470> ruin<00:01:54.950> things
