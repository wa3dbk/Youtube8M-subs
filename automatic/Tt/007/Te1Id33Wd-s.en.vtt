00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.480 
hack in computer I found it kind of
stupid<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:29.770> you<00:02:29.890> could<00:02:30.040> just<00:02:30.160> check<00:02:30.430> a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
locker or whatever while there's like

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.380 
locker or whatever while there's like
five<00:02:32.470> raters<00:02:32.860> blasting<00:02:33.280> at<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:34.270> a

five raters blasting at you just a

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.510 
five raters blasting at you just a
thought<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.410> reason<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.860> say<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.310> these

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
thought so the reason I say that these

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.940 
thought so the reason I say that these
to<00:02:36.850> fill<00:02:37.240> in<00:02:37.480> for<00:02:37.510> each<00:02:37.900> other<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.290> because

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
to fill in for each other is because

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.070 
to fill in for each other is because
perhaps<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.610> could<00:02:40.030> be<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.209> solution<00:02:40.660> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
perhaps this could be a solution the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.810 
or he or she could safely lock-picker
hack<00:02:56.380> something<00:02:56.680> while<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.130> defend<00:02:57.520> them<00:02:57.700> and

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
hack something while you defend them and

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.760 
hack something while you defend them and
so<00:02:58.390> when<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.780> come<00:02:58.959> back<00:02:59.080> they<00:02:59.260> don't<00:02:59.440> loot<00:02:59.620> it

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
so when you come back they don't loot it

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.470 
so when you come back they don't loot it
for<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.160> or<00:03:00.370> maybe<00:03:00.820> they<00:03:01.000> do<00:03:01.060> when<00:03:01.270> they<00:03:01.360> could

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
for you or maybe they do when they could

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.820 
for you or maybe they do when they could
have<00:03:01.510> their<00:03:01.720> own<00:03:01.780> inventory<00:03:02.140> like<00:03:02.560> they<00:03:02.680> do<00:03:02.800> in

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
have their own inventory like they do in

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.040 
have their own inventory like they do in
other<00:03:03.040> fog<00:03:03.400> games<00:03:03.700> but<00:03:04.150> instead<00:03:04.510> maybe<00:03:04.780> they

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
other fog games but instead maybe they

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.510 
other fog games but instead maybe they
could<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.410> have<00:03:05.530> an<00:03:05.650> unlock<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.160> once<00:03:06.370> you're

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
could just have an unlock so once you're

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.949 
could just have an unlock so once you're
done<00:03:06.610> fighting<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.120> just<00:03:07.360> loot<00:03:07.570> your<00:03:07.750> stuff

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959
