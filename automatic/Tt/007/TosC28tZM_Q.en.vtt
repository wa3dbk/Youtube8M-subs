00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
in part for its opening uninhabited

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.910 
in part for its opening uninhabited
areas<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.049> there<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.230> see<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.410> Boosters

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
areas and there you see the Boosters

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.370 
areas and there you see the Boosters
there<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.850> two<00:02:47.000> lights<00:02:47.209> on<00:02:47.450> either<00:02:47.750> side<00:02:48.140> they

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
there the two lights on either side they

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.500 
there the two lights on either side they
have<00:02:48.650> been<00:02:48.950> separated<00:02:49.579> and<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.970> light<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
have been separated and the light in the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.240 
have been separated and the light in the
middle<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.109> main<00:02:51.260> stage<00:02:51.500> continuing<00:02:52.099> to

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
middle is the main stage continuing to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.949 
middle is the main stage continuing to
burn<00:02:52.400> that's<00:02:52.970> what<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.269> looks<00:02:53.420> like<00:02:53.569> up<00:02:53.750> there

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
burn that's what it looks like up there

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:54.470 
burn that's what it looks like up there
with

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
with

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.030 
with
on<00:02:54.540> board<00:02:54.750> camera<00:02:55.170> there's<00:02:55.349> another<00:02:55.590> booster

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
on board camera there's another booster

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.750 
on board camera there's another booster
which<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.370> out<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.700> camera<00:02:57.300> range<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
which is out of camera range the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.149 
which is out of camera range the
on-board<00:03:00.209> computer<00:03:00.330> detects<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.680> drop<00:03:01.950> in

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
on-board computer detects the drop in

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.100 
on-board computer detects the drop in
fuel<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.790> separates<00:03:03.450> them<00:03:03.629> so<00:03:03.659> right

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
fuel and separates them so right

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.320 
fuel and separates them so right
as<00:03:04.290> they<00:03:04.950> had<00:03:05.129> no<00:03:05.370> more<00:03:05.580> propellant<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.150> burn

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
as they had no more propellant to burn

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.420 
as they had no more propellant to burn
the<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:07.019> first<00:03:07.290> decrease<00:03:07.590> than<00:03:07.950> V<00:03:08.099> onboard

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
the the first decrease than V onboard

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.070 
the the first decrease than V onboard
computer<00:03:08.940> detected<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.569> drop<00:03:09.750> in

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
computer detected the drop in

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.500 
computer detected the drop in
acceleration<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.160> therefore<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.819> decided<00:03:12.269> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
acceleration and therefore I decided to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.039 
acceleration and therefore I decided to
separate<00:03:12.900> them<00:03:13.489> fine<00:03:14.489> shots<00:03:14.790> as<00:03:15.030> we<00:03:15.660> mentioned

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
separate them fine shots as we mentioned

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.350 
separate them fine shots as we mentioned
the<00:03:16.200> sky<00:03:16.470> is<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:16.799> clear<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:17.280> could<00:03:17.459> see<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
the sky is so clear you could see the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.839 
the sky is so clear you could see the
first<00:03:18.750> stage<00:03:19.019> continuing<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.980> burn<00:03:20.160> do<00:03:20.790> you

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
first stage continuing to burn do you

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.550 
first stage continuing to burn do you
ever<00:03:20.910> give<00:03:21.120> us<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.329> look<00:03:21.480> at<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:21.810> on<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.260> upper

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
ever give us a look at the on the upper

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.229 
ever give us a look at the on the upper
left<00:03:22.769> on<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.069> lower<00:03:23.250> left<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:23.970> screen<00:03:24.120> you

left on the lower left of the screen you

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.880 
left on the lower left of the screen you
have<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> cursor<00:03:24.930> crawling<00:03:25.440> up<00:03:25.560> there<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.799> then

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
have a cursor crawling up there and then

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.400 
have a cursor crawling up there and then
you<00:03:25.950> have<00:03:26.069> some<00:03:26.250> numbers<00:03:26.690> we<00:03:27.690> expecting<00:03:28.230> the

you have some numbers we expecting the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.750 
you have some numbers we expecting the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
velocity in kilometers per second we've

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.970

had<00:03:45.569> separation<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.319> fairing<00:03:46.680> right<00:03:46.859> on

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
had separation of the fairing right on

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.229 
had separation of the fairing right on
time<00:03:47.190> that's<00:03:47.459> what<00:03:47.609> it<00:03:47.700> looks<00:03:47.879> like<00:03:48.030> there's

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
time that's what it looks like there's

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.580 
time that's what it looks like there's
another<00:03:48.450> half<00:03:48.720> which<00:03:48.959> is<00:03:49.109> out<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.410> camera

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
another half which is out of the camera

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.190 
another half which is out of the camera
range<00:03:49.980> there<00:03:50.730> are<00:03:50.849> two<00:03:51.060> pyrotechnic<00:03:51.780> cords

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
range there are two pyrotechnic cords

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.259

two<00:03:52.530> sets<00:03:52.829> of<00:03:52.950> pyrotechnic<00:03:53.579> or<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.760> should<00:03:54.060> say

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
two sets of pyrotechnic or I should say

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.410 
two sets of pyrotechnic or I should say
that<00:03:54.420> separate<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.930> fairing<00:03:55.260> right
