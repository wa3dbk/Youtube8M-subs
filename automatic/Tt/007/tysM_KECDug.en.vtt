00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
this so so far I should have this then

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.050 
this so so far I should have this then
what<00:02:26.710> you're<00:02:26.860> going<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.100> do<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.490> take<00:02:27.700> a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
what you're going to do is to take a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.500 
what you're going to do is to take a
small<00:02:28.480> portion<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.530> your<00:02:29.890> hair<00:02:30.550> from<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.120> side

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
small portion of your hair from the side

small portion of your hair from the side
and<00:02:31.920> bring<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.070> over<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.960> portion<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.590> you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
and bring it over that portion that you

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.140 
and bring it over that portion that you
have<00:02:38.130> for<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.250> fan<00:02:39.490> so<00:02:40.240> something<00:02:40.660> like<00:02:40.840> this

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
have for the fan so something like this

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.020 
have for the fan so something like this
like<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.560> just<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.740> conceal<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.400> edges<00:02:45.760> of

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
like this just to conceal the edges of

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.390 
like this just to conceal the edges of
the<00:02:46.660> pan<00:02:46.900> then<00:02:47.230> you're<00:02:47.650> going<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.920> go<00:02:48.130> ahead

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
the pan then you're going to go ahead

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.449 
the pan then you're going to go ahead
and<00:02:48.580> do<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.910> same<00:02:49.150> thing<00:02:49.480> for<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.840> other<00:02:49.870> side

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
and do the same thing for the other side

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:58.770 
and do the same thing for the other side
take<00:02:51.459> some<00:02:51.790> here<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:54.390> bring<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.420> over<00:02:57.780> just

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
take some here and bring it over just

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.180 
take some here and bring it over just
making<00:02:59.650> an<00:02:59.800> X<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:01.410> what<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.590> do<00:03:02.860> at<00:03:02.980> this

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
making an X and what you do at this

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.940 
making an X and what you do at this
point<00:03:03.550> is<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:04.000> take<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.450> hair<00:03:04.930> pin<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:07.950> secure

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
point is to take a hair pin and secure

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.300 
point is to take a hair pin and secure
it<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.970> will<00:03:10.120> stay<00:03:10.420> in<00:03:10.450> place<00:03:10.800> or<00:03:11.800> you<00:03:12.100> could

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
it so it will stay in place or you could

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.860 
it so it will stay in place or you could
use<00:03:12.520> our<00:03:12.970> two<00:03:13.720> pins<00:03:14.110> just<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:15.370> make<00:03:15.640> sure<00:03:16.090> that

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
use our two pins just to make sure that

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.340 
use our two pins just to make sure that
it's<00:03:17.880> not<00:03:18.880> moving<00:03:20.850> okay<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:21.910> it's<00:03:22.900> pretty

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
it's not moving okay so it's pretty

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.060 
it's not moving okay so it's pretty
secure<00:03:23.650> right<00:03:24.160> now<00:03:24.720> so<00:03:25.720> then<00:03:26.380> what<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.950> will

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
secure right now so then what you will

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.180 
secure right now so then what you will
do<00:03:27.340> is<00:03:27.700> if<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.840> hair<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:29.110> not<00:03:29.410> staying<00:03:29.920> in

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
do is if the hair is not staying in

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.970 
do is if the hair is not staying in
place<00:03:30.250> for<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.880> front<00:03:31.239> just<00:03:32.080> lay<00:03:32.470> them<00:03:32.739> flat

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
place for the front just lay them flat

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.199 
place for the front just lay them flat
and<00:03:33.549> then<00:03:33.820> you<00:03:33.850> could<00:03:34.150> use<00:03:34.330> a<00:03:34.630> pin<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:36.430> ensure

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
and then you could use a pin to ensure

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.150 
and then you could use a pin to ensure
that<00:03:37.600> they<00:03:37.959> stay<00:03:37.989> in<00:03:38.890> place<00:03:40.680> or<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:41.739> can<00:03:41.950> leave

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
that they stay in place or you can leave

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:51.050 
that they stay in place or you can leave
it<00:03:42.190> alone

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.290 

I<00:03:51.150> think<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:51.989> will<00:03:52.110> give<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.349> character<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:53.700> I'll

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
I think it will give a character so I'll

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.920 
I think it will give a character so I'll
just<00:03:54.599> leave<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:55.050> yeah<00:03:55.880> so<00:03:56.880> that's<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:57.630> far

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
just leave it yeah so that's that so far

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.449 
just leave it yeah so that's that so far
and<00:03:58.170> to<00:03:58.650> give<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:59.130> the<00:04:00.560> straight<00:04:01.560> effect<00:04:02.250> that

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
and to give you the straight effect that

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.690 
and to give you the straight effect that
I<00:04:02.489> had<00:04:02.910> what<00:04:03.599> I<00:04:03.630> did<00:04:03.989> was<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.440> took<00:04:04.560> some<00:04:04.920> hair
