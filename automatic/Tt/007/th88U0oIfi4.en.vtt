the smoothness of the screen and the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.250 
the smoothness of the screen and the
graphics<00:02:12.250> processor<00:02:12.940> way<00:02:13.450> advanced<00:02:13.930> more

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
graphics processor way advanced more

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.610 
graphics processor way advanced more
than<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.590> other<00:02:14.709> cars<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.280> we're<00:02:15.430> driving
