00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.370 
if there's plumbing don't try to move
things<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.000> yourself<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:51.960> once<00:01:52.229> we

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
things like that yourself but once we

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.469 
things like that yourself but once we
started<00:01:52.680> opening<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.880> realized<00:01:54.360> that

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
started opening this up we realized that

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.060 
started opening this up we realized that
pretty<00:01:54.990> much<00:01:55.110> everything<00:01:55.530> went<00:01:55.740> through<00:01:55.920> this

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
pretty much everything went through this

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.190 
pretty much everything went through this
so<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.729> kind<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.090> blew<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> budget<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
so that kind of blew the budget about a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.020 
so that kind of blew the budget about a
thousand<00:01:58.920> dollars<00:01:59.189> more<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.000> are

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
thousand dollars more so there are

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.490 
thousand dollars more so there are
