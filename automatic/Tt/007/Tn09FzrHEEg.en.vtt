00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:09.809
 to be an example to show how 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.120
 important it is or how much better it is 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.889
 is when you pick up vocabulary and that 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.809
 combined with the visualization of that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.020
 whole with complex numbers just in the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.140
 So it's looking for a big pay level 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.640
 a complex number with the complex 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.820
 corrected number to z 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.660
 in the multiplication 2 results in the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.840
 division i which vocabulary one calls 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 First of all we obviously have one 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 complex number and the complex 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.980
 conjugated that would be the reflection 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.120
 the rax so it could be her, it 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.590
 may be any other here 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.219
 I want that he does not blackboard picture now 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.129
 shoot dead 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.699
 What else do we know ten times? 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.800
 always z amount up two so the amount 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.270
 from z 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.100
 multiplied by itself gives in 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.379
 this fall so then two must 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.939
 amount of z 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.500
 be root equal to two so I know 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.600
 Be the length of, must root two 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.909
 what else do I know 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.670
 if I change that equation through 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.380
 z cross I multiply over him would 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.810
 times across 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.630
 if i have a complex number with him 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.930
 multiply that corresponds to the rotation 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 90 degrees that is the picture it can 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.400
 never be 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.869
 I'll try to fix this old 90 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.390
 Grad angle to get 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.390
 So we would have z here and shows here 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.570
 So who can it be only this structure? 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.790
 where we have a 90 degree angle why 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.930
 because of this multiplication because that 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.970
 if I now the story so 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.619
 yes, the complex has been visualized 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.149
 just pay somewhere on this axis 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.600
 Here are root 2 with the length 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:06.479
 root length two as is the result 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.640
 now if the complex number on this 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.220
 Axis then it means yes for the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.520
 complex number a + b mali 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.540
 that the two values ​​must be the same 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.460
 otherwise I will not land on the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.000
 axis here 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:25.170
 and how do i get on root 2 the length 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.440
 draws amount is indeed the same root 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.140
 quadrath + b square that can only be one 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.920
 square +1 square 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.760
 So my number one must plus one 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.330
 and corresponding complexed complex 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.600
 conjugates to z1 - one e only once 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.180
 as an example, as I just vocabulary 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:52.700
 call me clarify everything and me 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.700
 then slowly tinkered with the solution
