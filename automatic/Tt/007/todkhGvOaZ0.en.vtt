00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.870 
of damage for anything not diamond over
I<00:03:32.660> guess<00:03:32.930> center<00:03:33.830> field<00:03:34.130> is<00:03:34.250> pretty<00:03:34.430> quick<00:03:34.700> it

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
I guess center field is pretty quick it

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.280 
I guess center field is pretty quick it
can<00:03:34.910> kill<00:03:35.210> pretty<00:03:35.450> easily<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:35.900> I'm<00:03:36.140> pretty

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
can kill pretty easily so I'm pretty

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:49.410 
can kill pretty easily so I'm pretty
happy<00:03:36.650> for<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:38.050> matter<00:03:39.050> too<00:03:39.260> long<00:03:39.410> gone<00:03:39.650> okay

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.180 

yeah<00:03:50.420> I<00:03:50.450> think<00:03:50.690> pretty<00:03:51.170> weird<00:03:51.470> i<00:03:51.620> don't<00:03:52.010> think

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
yeah I think pretty weird i don't think

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.280 
yeah I think pretty weird i don't think
it's<00:03:52.400> much<00:03:52.520> else<00:03:52.940> at<00:03:53.240> a<00:03:53.270> gun<00:03:53.560> better<00:03:54.560> gun<00:03:56.290> right

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
it's much else at a gun better gun right

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.650 
it's much else at a gun better gun right
of<00:03:57.410> them<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.430> could<00:03:58.580> shoot<00:03:58.910> three<00:03:59.390> empty

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
of them and it could shoot three empty

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.690 
of them and it could shoot three empty
seats<00:03:59.840> at<00:03:59.959> once<00:04:00.140> i<00:04:00.350> think<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:00.830> it<00:04:01.310> would<00:04:01.520> go

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
seats at once i think so it would go

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.590 
seats at once i think so it would go
through<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.000> wear<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:02.540> go<00:04:02.720> back<00:04:03.140> and<00:04:04.150> also<00:04:05.150> it

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
through to wear and go back and also it

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.440 
through to wear and go back and also it
can<00:04:06.230> nearly<00:04:06.770> insta-kill<00:04:07.489> not<00:04:07.790> armor<00:04:08.090> people

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
can nearly insta-kill not armor people

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.780 
can nearly insta-kill not armor people
anybody<00:04:08.959> near<00:04:09.200> non<00:04:09.380> armor<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:09.980> it's<00:04:10.580> still

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
anybody near non armor and it's still

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.640 
anybody near non armor and it's still
does<00:04:10.970> a<00:04:11.030> good<00:04:11.360> amount<00:04:11.570> of<00:04:11.720> damage<00:04:12.020> I<00:04:12.410> think

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
does a good amount of damage I think

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.460 
does a good amount of damage I think
like<00:04:12.739> 82<00:04:14.200> yep<00:04:15.200> all<00:04:15.530> right<00:04:15.890> I<00:04:15.920> think<00:04:16.250> that's<00:04:16.549> it

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
like 82 yep all right I think that's it
