00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.290
 the audio has been there for a year and a half 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.880
 a brother with the a1 sportback 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.590
 well who know the means that the 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.150
 get two doors and more space 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.150
 but also applies to this a1 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.160
 you can of course recognize the audi a1 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.720
 to export two but who looks closely 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.610
 also sees the b-pillar forward again 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.890
 placed and the roof 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.400
 a little further 8 runs through audi also 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.930
 on that the a1 sportback 6 mm high and 6 mm 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.070
 is broader but forgive us 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.150
 cannot be called name 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.220
 very handy of course two 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.580
 export a look or see what people bring along 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.580
 can take 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.660
 well for redemption is soon too 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.250
 tight but for children 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.380
 I think you as father mother brother 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.729
 this tastes like becoming a sportback 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.530
 is that you get more luggage space 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.450
 at the audio one that is not really it 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.160
 case in the a1 sportback you get it 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.540
 wants 70 liters of luggage space and that is it 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.450
 no less than 3 liters more than in the ordinary 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.490
 acadia a well can take bean district or 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.940
 double fold the couch but there 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.940
 then stay with 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.979
 the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.810
 this spurred on gives a new ep 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.250
 4t vision to sit bonnet that is 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.720
 scoop in the department 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.880
 because he found 40 hp and 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.440
 cylinder shutdown, we have low load 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.360
 or constant driving then become two 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.130
 cylinders off and therefore 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.110
 runs the fashion more economically as well as well 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.390
 much more economical than the other engine that is now 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.890
 already livable the question is sure 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.239
 you notice that you ride them in two sentences 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.160
 well you don't see it 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.600
 you also hear it not only feel sometimes 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.709
 your small vibration especially at low 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.000
 speeds 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.360
 maybe that's that nature too 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.360
 can close
