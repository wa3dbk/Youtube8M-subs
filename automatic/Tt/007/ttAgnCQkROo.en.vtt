00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
might tuck it inside inside the hole

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.500 
might tuck it inside inside the hole
just<00:02:37.220> like<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:38.950> yep<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.489> like<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.060> I

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
just like that yep just like that and I

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.250 
just like that yep just like that and I
do<00:02:42.110> it<00:02:45.880> or<00:02:46.880> if<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.150> doesn't<00:02:47.450> work<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
do it or if that doesn't work if the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.289 
do it or if that doesn't work if the
hole<00:02:48.470> is<00:02:48.799> all<00:02:49.160> full<00:02:49.840> then<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:51.079> tend<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:52.180> just<00:02:53.180> go

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
hole is all full then I tend to just go

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:59.720 
hole is all full then I tend to just go
around<00:02:55.510> just<00:02:56.510> go<00:02:56.690> around<00:02:56.750> it

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.220 

but<00:03:00.569> these<00:03:00.750> ones<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.849> think<00:03:02.849> they're<00:03:03.030> best<00:03:03.239> tuck

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
but these ones I think they're best tuck

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.930 
but these ones I think they're best tuck
them<00:03:04.440> inside<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:05.069> hole<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.459> does<00:03:05.610> look<00:03:05.819> better

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
them inside the hole it does look better

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.100 
them inside the hole it does look better
when<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.330> put<00:03:06.510> them<00:03:06.629> inside<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.260> hole<00:03:10.760> so

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
when you put them inside the hole so

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.170 
when you put them inside the hole so
it's<00:03:13.110> not<00:03:13.290> too<00:03:13.709> neat<00:03:13.950> because<00:03:14.250> obviously<00:03:14.910> I

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
it's not too neat because obviously I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.520 
it's not too neat because obviously I
don't<00:03:15.269> have<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.480> member<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:17.840> but<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.349> can

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
don't have a member of but as you can

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.920 
don't have a member of but as you can
see<00:03:20.300> I've<00:03:21.300> tried<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.140> then<00:03:23.569> take<00:03:24.569> your<00:03:24.750> bobby

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
see I've tried and then take your bobby

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.780 
see I've tried and then take your bobby
pins<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.950> then<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:27.209> just<00:03:27.480> pin<00:03:27.750> down<00:03:27.989> all<00:03:28.349> the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
pins and then you just pin down all the

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.920 
pins and then you just pin down all the
loose<00:03:29.790> hair<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:32.120> just<00:03:33.120> can't<00:03:33.510> be<00:03:33.599> arsed<00:03:33.900> to

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
loose hair that just can't be arsed to

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.400 
loose hair that just can't be arsed to
stay<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.230> one<00:03:34.500> place<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.950> guess<00:03:35.810> yeah<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:37.200> bug

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
stay in one place I guess yeah that bug

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.259 
stay in one place I guess yeah that bug
didn't<00:03:37.890> really<00:03:38.160> help<00:03:40.250> yeah<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.730> just<00:03:42.120> like
