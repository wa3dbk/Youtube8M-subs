00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.489
 whole six short relatively difficult technique called Faces 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.889
 That's why it's so difficult because he picks up every face he has learned 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.150
 different 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.630
 yet another phenomenon is what faces there is I have none 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.300
 Language for it 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.830
 you always see when it comes to testimonies much do us very much 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.940
 very hard to describe faces this is something we do with our brains 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.869
 do not do our perception 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.990
 Eyes nose mouth then 2 against children but we can actually in the 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:36.380
 Describe participants 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.840
 finally make the experiment itself to try to make a celebrity too 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.400
 describe only one year looks like 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.750
 and then test if a friend or partner as ordered due to the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.530
 Description this person recognizes that we almost do not succeed 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.059
 we put our people 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.100
 not apart 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.180
 Mostly the same thing would happen most of the time with names here 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.170
 do not realize that they also took songs stuck 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.390
 and you can live that 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.970
 improve in Valais name memory that goes first to another 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.920
 The way that you treat people differently then has it again 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.460
 to do with attention 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.750
 a goal of mine remembers you the name of a person 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.950
 because the first time meets 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.369
 there is nothing safe as 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.070
 ten minutes later to ask 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.590
 what were they called again 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.590
 you should not do so offensive offensive and with the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.800
 Name of the person 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.310
 set apart properly 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.050
 that means we introduce ourselves 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.300
 here questions are called her 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.689
 how do you write that where does the name come from? 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.659
 So even background information you keep this name 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.429
 This can be explained to Merkel 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.390
 you have to name 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.910
 bragging the person by name 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.850
 a few times 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.960
 That does not even affect the rating the more unpleasant the feeling one has 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.140
 Talk to him now so exaggerated Mittermeier year once at a Meier 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.190
 Mr. Meier, good bye, Mr. Meier 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.730
 It felt like other people like their names as well 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.500
 start a series flattered if you do that 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.710
 and you notice the name by which you recover 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.500
 The Dylan blame but you also noticed him a little bit better 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.409
 also 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.409
 should you name the traitor 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.860
 has a meaning 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.890
 Also something you can after good internet for example Meier are country real or 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.719
 For example, farmers in the country belong to Mayerhöfer 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.989
 Percent of north of Germany abused and in certain regions 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.719
 as many people as so come this name 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.159
 So with the German team is missing here to the name 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.090
 to remember Montazeri will reach the whole one should also ask what 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.489
 me person else too 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.779
 only the name is a little bit "meant by demand for hobbies 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:38.249
 after all sorts of other around this box is double that there is such a thing 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:40.749
 to make it a little bigger 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.590
 the whole synonymous set a scene that means you are one 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.329
 People with his name 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.959
 in a picture above 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.419
 Jan Meier, for example, stands in his field 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.249
 This can be especially strong Petersen help yourself remember the name of the field 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.399
 in the brain again when you see the person 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.799
 that they do not introduce a person with a fishing rod in his hand 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.599
 Also not everyone has seen that the brain can reconstruct that when I am 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.089
 the person again very much and knows that the AWD Niger for example more courtly 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:09.779
 is that working 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.849
 and also because one should deal with names 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.719
 what's more is by first name 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.809
 not everyone knows nor knows Nelson 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.979
 Battle of Trafalgar Square spent 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.460
 so already wounded 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.400
 actually logically we are called is that Elber is 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.999
 that Lord Nelson obeys 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.999
 So he's called by first name 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:35.709
 so you can remember 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.699
 but have a close match of the better and also there you can think again 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.209
 how do you save that? 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.179
 there are not networks for informing unfortunately and the renunciation of 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.290
 and again you can find one in both sentences 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.239
 to remember this somewhat longer Amstad Lord Nelson 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.329
 has his ideas how to do that 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.799
 could save so 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.799
 that you come back to these things 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.909
 Essen and Nils Kinderschar 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.849
 For example, he does not know punctually, you can also imagine that 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.979
 Of course he has never done that, but that is mine for me 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.440
 the whole thing to remember and the bond is a bit harder has a Marine de 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.129
 is seen behind 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.309
 many mistakes will be exceeded 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:25.499
 for example 

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:28.499
 Pröll the Gerbstedter on top of the column in bronze 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.449
 or you can also imagine here from Brontosaurus closes with a 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:33.409
 cannon 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.759
 also that they want it and therefore live by 10 o'clock in the street 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.520
 Shit exploit a movie does the wet Sirte and Jan help this name 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.529
 save 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:43.889
 this exercise 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.319
 And Lena techniques go a lot more for a perfect memory 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.460
 find it in my book 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.939
 easy to remember everything 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.029
 the compact course on DVD from which you have just seen a part 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:59.740
 is there 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.629
 they just get the book to remember everything 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.460
 Derek at the publisher at www Rome wanted EA 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.160
 at Emerson 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.590
 and of course in the book trade
