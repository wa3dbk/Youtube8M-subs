kind<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:00.540> keep<00:04:00.720> on<00:04:00.930> once<00:04:01.680> it<00:04:01.859> heats<00:04:02.579> up<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.940> can

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
kind of keep on once it heats up you can

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.649 
kind of keep on once it heats up you can
keep<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.329> on<00:04:03.449> low<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.159> it'll<00:04:05.359> just<00:04:06.359> kind<00:04:06.569> of

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
keep it on low and it'll just kind of

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.899 
keep it on low and it'll just kind of
sit<00:04:06.870> there<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.290> like<00:04:07.440> if<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.739> want<00:04:07.889> to<00:04:08.069> make

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.430 
sit there so like if you want to make
like<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> big<00:04:09.359> batch<00:04:09.599> and<00:04:09.959> have<00:04:10.109> a<00:04:10.139> bunch<00:04:10.379> of

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
like a big batch and have a bunch of

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.240 
like a big batch and have a bunch of
people<00:04:10.530> over<00:04:10.940> it<00:04:11.940> said<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:13.079> like<00:04:13.949> the<00:04:14.099> thing

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
people over it said and like the thing

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.890 
people over it said and like the thing
is<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.519> can<00:04:14.669> keep<00:04:14.849> adding<00:04:15.090> apple<00:04:15.690> juice

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
is you can keep adding apple juice

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.289 
is you can keep adding apple juice
because<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.620> spices<00:04:17.099> will<00:04:17.250> keep<00:04:17.489> its<00:04:18.000> kind<00:04:18.239> of

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
because the spices will keep its kind of

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.110 
because the spices will keep its kind of
like<00:04:18.449> tea<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.950> can<00:04:20.099> keep<00:04:20.280> infusing<00:04:20.820> the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
like tea you can keep infusing the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.140 
like tea you can keep infusing the
Apple's<00:04:21.329> use<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.750> spices<00:04:22.160> I<00:04:23.160> mean<00:04:23.820> there's

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
Apple's use of the spices I mean there's

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.350 
Apple's use of the spices I mean there's
a<00:04:24.240> certain<00:04:24.449> point<00:04:24.690> but<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.169> can<00:04:26.120> have<00:04:27.120> a<00:04:27.150> lot

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
of apple juice and one of the reasons

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.830 
of apple juice and one of the reasons
for<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.430> is<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:30.060> are<00:04:30.330> gonna<00:04:30.540> actually

in<00:05:54.330> my<00:05:54.449> case<00:05:54.479> I<00:05:54.780> know<00:05:54.840> sometimes<00:05:55.110> you<00:05:55.349> mix<00:05:55.560> this

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
in my case I know sometimes you mix this

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.070 
in my case I know sometimes you mix this
with<00:05:55.830> vodka<00:05:56.099> um<00:05:56.669> although<00:05:57.630> that<00:05:57.780> might<00:05:57.900> just

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
with vodka um although that might just

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.450 
with vodka um although that might just
be<00:05:58.169> because<00:05:58.289> we<00:05:58.620> don't<00:05:58.770> have<00:05:58.830> other<00:05:59.039> stuff<00:05:59.310> in

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
be because we don't have other stuff in

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.990 
be because we don't have other stuff in
the<00:05:59.550> house<00:05:59.720> that's<00:06:00.720> your<00:06:00.930> taste<00:06:01.550> but<00:06:02.550> you<00:06:02.880> know
