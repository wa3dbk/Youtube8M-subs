00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360

 movies of the weekend definitely but too 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.779
 I already have a criticism of both 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.460

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 Cinema movie from the team 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.240
 the court finds this alpha unit 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.130
 or a team called guilty 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.000
 she becomes a ten-year-old 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.559
 imprisonment in one 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.739
 high security prison 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:45.800
 we are innocent as the plan looks 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.870
 from post 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.460
 you kind of listen to her especially 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.120
 are responsible for these men 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.120
 mend sexy 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.610
 i shit a fucking damn 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.470
 plane brings the team we 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.729
 together 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.840
 how are you going to stop those only 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.840
 rest that is really exciting 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:25.210
 I'm just laughing at you like that 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 is a damn nice cookie-making 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.910
 you timesharing I'm there 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.290
 he wanted to escape by having a sick one 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.180
 Bathing has closed with a short 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.370
 defibrillator i stand on the cards 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.200
 the mission is not over yet 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:45.050
 are you talking about leaving our files? 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.050
 we were tricked now is payday 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.850
 They are the best and teaching methods 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.850
 are exceptional 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.780
 I do not need a long time I am good 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.190
 Leipzig 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.670
 give my team an hour are 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.670
 unbeatable 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.610
 the aid 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.320
 you have my field place I brought 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:44.460
 would have almost similar to the allowed 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:47.280
 Hindered the team is from the year 2010 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.680
 in the original of the tk team and goes 117 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.780
 minutes in the extended version 134 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.360
 minutes and tells the story of 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.130
 the well-known and great series of 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.170
 aliens but a little more than prequel 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.540
 namely this strand of action like it 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.400
 this came to be from lawless 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.600
 militarily hunted and offended and 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.220
 dishonorably dismissed 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.170
 yes this story will be in this movie 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.560
 so hannibal face got told 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.120
 you as well as broken sword murdoch as 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.920
 well known team and looking forward to the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.170
 actually an elite unit at 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.060
 are military and that is bravo or 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.780
 the most difficult assignments bravura 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.760
 master 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.180
 until one day they hunt down 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.710
 forged us dollars and yes 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.500
 a kind of bank printing stamp or 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.660
 note print stamp in an entry advised 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.130
 and even victims and hunted during 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.280
 then we have these 120 here 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.840
 minutes film sugar of 110 million us 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.450
 dollar budget has engulfed one 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.030
 action jumble it in a row only 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.860
 still in absolute time-lapse mode 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.390
 To look filled is very much possible 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.860
 action packed together so you 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.930
 on the paths to actual 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.880
 History loses something 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.650
 a movie very very negative again 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.780
 could not be there would not be one 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.090
 relatively successful cast with liam neeson 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.040
 and bradley cooper as hannibal and 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.350
 facebook as well as pixel and 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.390
 harm the ball so that murdoch and 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.590
 You have to complete paypal rockers 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.450
 say you have a four-wheeled here 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.970
 found something very funny with each other 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.070
 harmonizes and their chemistry is right 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.050
 In any case, you should be careful 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.240
 the team is at all the comparison to 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.980
 series to dare i love the series 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.020
 I grew up with this one 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.239
 Feel the emotion of this team what poverty 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.860
 victim right a kind of robin hood the 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.020
 new time remains for me as 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.580
 childhood memory unrepeatable or 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.690
 irretrievable and creates this 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.130
 film in no case 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.720
 and you should not compare these 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.550
 otherwise you would have to dare the film 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.610
 Definitely worst grades give it 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.039
 is something completely different 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.469
 is a pure action kracher the very 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.300
 very expensive with a little charm and 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:41.889
 a not so bad script 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.180
 and I have very low expectations 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.280
 and am still surprised 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.259
 this has made the movie none 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.509
 great stripes but for many on sunday 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.490
 at 20:15 maybe just right 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.599
 and he is not a complete drive so 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.729
 You can watch this movie 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.530
 look at it but not necessarily 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.789
 two or three times would still be 15 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.680
 minutes shorter he would probably be 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.330
 still much better in the cast kriebel 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.159
 even the wonderful from the jessica biel 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.169
 and one or the other known 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.039
 but face it a third time too 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.500
 say in the end 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.319
 clever plans with very very expensive ones 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.199
 action is often a little too cgi-heavy 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:16.360
 But otherwise a film of the acts for 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.189
 me as far as okay goes of course 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.750
 can you look at apple rocker with a 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.460
 occupy other actors and then 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.029
 seriously believe in the original 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.979
 to meet 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:25.389
 you have to change that one should you 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.919
 do not see film and for me that means 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.680
 in terms of points really 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.580
 neatly done the actionfilm 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.159
 seven and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.870
 in his genre a total of a movie like 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.520
 said you can watch it once but 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.949
 Do not have to look twice and that is 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.300
 An evaluation of me then at six of 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.219
 ten possible points 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.870
 okay that 's it from me for today me 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.430
 Your wonderful week would be a tomorrow 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.199
 which one of course with the 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.580
 raffle for sunday otherwise you can 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.289
 you tell me what you are doing on the weekend 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.330
 looking at the primetime 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.580
 and yes it was mine for today 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.770
 tomorrow 15 clock as I said a raffle 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.690
 and by that time I hope you are tomorrow 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.690
 of course again at 3
