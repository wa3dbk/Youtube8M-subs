00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
and today I want to show you the eggs of

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.520 
and today I want to show you the eggs of
mega<00:00:10.550> soma<00:00:10.760> electrons<00:00:11.510> electrons<00:00:12.290> and<00:00:12.440> how

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
mega soma electrons electrons and how

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.040 
mega soma electrons electrons and how
you<00:00:12.590> reach<00:00:12.950> reach<00:00:13.250> them<00:00:13.550> from<00:00:13.790> the<00:00:14.120> orbit

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.050 
you reach reach them from the orbit

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.560 
you reach reach them from the orbit

box that's what I hit here
it<00:00:21.650> was<00:00:21.980> a<00:00:22.010> female<00:00:22.400> of<00:00:22.850> mega<00:00:23.119> soma<00:00:23.420> la<00:00:23.900> force<00:00:24.230> in

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
it was a female of mega soma la force in

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.340 
it was a female of mega soma la force in
it<00:00:24.910> from<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:25.970> 21st<00:00:26.750> of<00:00:27.190> April<00:00:28.190> today<00:00:28.730> step

21st of June two months later the male
was<00:00:33.949> in<00:00:34.730> for<00:00:35.360> about<00:00:35.780> one<00:00:36.650> week<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:37.160> then<00:00:37.730> I

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
was in for about one week and then I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.170 
was in for about one week and then I
removed<00:00:38.720> the<00:00:38.899> male<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:40.010> female<00:00:40.040> was<00:00:40.940> in

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
removed the male and the female was in

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.470 
removed the male and the female was in
the<00:00:41.300> box<00:00:41.510> for<00:00:41.750> one<00:00:41.899> month<00:00:42.170> 25th<00:00:42.950> of<00:00:43.239> May<00:00:44.239> I

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
the box for one month 25th of May I

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.680 
the box for one month 25th of May I
removed<00:00:44.960> it<00:00:45.140> an<00:00:45.350> hour<00:00:45.860> out<00:00:46.190> check<00:00:46.579> is<00:00:46.760> 25th<00:00:47.390> of

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
removed it an hour out check is 25th of

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.119 
removed it an hour out check is 25th of
June<00:00:48.079> now<00:00:48.500> 21<00:00:49.510> -<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.809> I<00:00:51.170> already<00:00:51.620> found<00:00:51.829> two

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
June now 21 - and I already found two

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.430 
June now 21 - and I already found two
eggs<00:00:52.520> now<00:00:52.790> you<00:00:52.850> see<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.360> substrate<00:00:53.960> here<00:00:54.230> if

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
eggs now you see the substrate here if

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.150 
eggs now you see the substrate here if
you<00:00:54.559> look<00:00:54.739> at<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.180> close<00:00:56.180> you<00:00:56.540> see<00:00:56.690> is<00:00:56.809> very

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
you look at it close you see is very

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.430 
you look at it close you see is very
compacted<00:00:58.160> on<00:00:59.090> the<00:00:59.270> bottom<00:00:59.719> of<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.200> box

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
compacted on the bottom of the box

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.160 
compacted on the bottom of the box
that's<00:01:01.039> what<00:01:01.280> I<00:01:01.309> did<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.090> you<00:01:02.510> have<00:01:02.719> to<00:01:02.899> press

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
that's what I did so you have to press

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.249 
that's what I did so you have to press
the<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:04.070> five<00:01:04.910> centimeters<00:01:05.660> on<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.930> bottom

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
the the five centimeters on the bottom

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.370 
the the five centimeters on the bottom
very<00:01:06.710> hard<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.880> female<00:01:08.479> can<00:01:09.020> lay<00:01:09.050> the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
very hard so that the female can lay the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.040 
very hard so that the female can lay the
eggs<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:09.920> there<00:01:10.160> so<00:01:10.460> now<00:01:10.670> we<00:01:10.729> have<00:01:10.940> to<00:01:11.179> open<00:01:11.360> it

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
eggs in there so now we have to open it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.460 
eggs in there so now we have to open it
very<00:01:12.140> carefully<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:14.090> see<00:01:14.360> where<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.869> eggs<00:01:15.080> are

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
very carefully to see where the eggs are

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.260 
very carefully to see where the eggs are
and<00:01:16.539> let's<00:01:17.539> break<00:01:17.899> some<00:01:18.310> Singh<00:01:19.310> apart<00:01:19.759> to<00:01:20.060> have

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
and let's break some Singh apart to have

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.870 
and let's break some Singh apart to have
a<00:01:20.300> look<00:01:20.890> but<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:22.039> could<00:01:22.220> we<00:01:22.369> get<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.580> lot<00:01:22.849> of

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
a look but it could we get a lot of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.730 
a look but it could we get a lot of
warmth<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:23.539> it<00:01:23.690> I<00:01:23.840> don't<00:01:24.050> like<00:01:24.289> them<00:01:24.560> really

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
warmth in it I don't like them really

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.740 
warmth in it I don't like them really
because<00:01:25.429> they<00:01:25.899> disturb<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:28.789> substrate<00:01:29.450> and

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
because they disturb the substrate and

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.010 
because they disturb the substrate and
sometimes<00:01:30.259> if<00:01:30.860> you<00:01:30.950> are<00:01:31.250> unlucky<00:01:31.810> they<00:01:32.810> can

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
sometimes if you are unlucky they can

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.230 
sometimes if you are unlucky they can
also<00:01:33.229> disturb<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.950> eggs<00:01:34.160> in<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.670> substrate

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
also disturb the eggs in the substrate

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.050 
also disturb the eggs in the substrate
so<00:01:36.050> now<00:01:36.259> we<00:01:36.319> have<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.830> look<00:01:37.520> through<00:01:37.849> the

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
so now we have to look through the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.749 
so now we have to look through the
substrate<00:01:38.690> here<00:01:39.069> where<00:01:40.069> do<00:01:40.220> we<00:01:40.310> see<00:01:40.520> an<00:01:40.610> egg

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
substrate here where do we see an egg

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.969 
substrate here where do we see an egg
they<00:01:40.970> are<00:01:41.149> pretty<00:01:41.450> big<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:42.259> can't<00:01:42.679> really

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
they are pretty big so you can't really

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.609 
they are pretty big so you can't really
miss<00:01:43.280> them<00:01:43.580> mostly<00:01:44.479> they<00:01:44.630> are<00:01:44.660> also<00:01:44.990> in<00:01:45.259> a<00:01:45.349> kind

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
miss them mostly they are also in a kind

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.190 
miss them mostly they are also in a kind
of<00:01:45.800> a<00:01:45.950> little<00:01:46.940> node

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.930 

there<00:01:53.200> are<00:01:53.320> pieces<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.220> beetle<00:01:54.580> cellies

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
there are pieces of the beetle cellies

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.440 
there are pieces of the beetle cellies
deep<00:01:55.270> down<00:01:55.660> in<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.020> substrate<00:01:56.500> so<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.740> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
deep down in the substrate so that the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.280 
deep down in the substrate so that the
female<00:01:58.450> is<00:01:58.930> bringing<00:02:00.540> material<00:02:01.540> from<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.990> top

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
female is bringing material from the top

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.430 
female is bringing material from the top
to<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.650> bottom<00:02:02.980> of<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.970> box<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.750> don't<00:02:05.380> know

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
to the bottom of the box I don't know

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.669 
to the bottom of the box I don't know
whether<00:02:05.590> it's<00:02:05.860> meant<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.940> feed<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.690> the

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
whether it's meant to to feed the the

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.600 
whether it's meant to to feed the the
lorry<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:10.230> emerge<00:02:11.230> from<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.770> eggs<00:02:11.950> hatch

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
lorry that emerge from the eggs hatch

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.460 
lorry that emerge from the eggs hatch
from<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.000> exit<00:02:13.300> they<00:02:13.480> want<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.960> feed<00:02:14.200> them

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
from the exit they want to feed them

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.720 
from the exit they want to feed them
with<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.240> could<00:02:16.390> be<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.630> they<00:02:17.730> make

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
with this but it could be that they make

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.930 
with this but it could be that they make
they<00:02:19.630> put<00:02:19.900> some<00:02:20.170> material<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.670> large

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
they put some material that the large

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.150 
they put some material that the large
can<00:02:22.300> eat<00:02:22.540> next<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.380> place<00:02:23.650> where<00:02:23.980> they<00:02:24.130> are

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
can eat next to the place where they are

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.880 
can eat next to the place where they are
we<00:02:24.400> proceed<00:02:24.820> so<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:28.470> freshly<00:02:29.470> hatched

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
we proceed so that the freshly hatched

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.130 
we proceed so that the freshly hatched
lure<00:02:30.850> we<00:02:31.060> can<00:02:31.530> eat<00:02:32.530> from<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.580> material<00:02:34.540> so

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
lure we can eat from this material so

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.870 
lure we can eat from this material so
now<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:38.040> kind<00:02:39.040> of<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.250> search<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.850> have

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
now this is a kind of a search you have

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.860 
now this is a kind of a search you have
to<00:02:40.260> crumble<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:42.459> whole<00:02:42.730> thing<00:02:43.090> carefully<00:02:43.450> so

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
to crumble the whole thing carefully so

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.350 
to crumble the whole thing carefully so
that<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.110> don't<00:02:44.380> kill<00:02:45.010> an<00:02:45.280> egg<00:02:45.490> when<00:02:46.209> you

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
that you don't kill an egg when you

00:02:46.360 --> 00:03:10.400 
that you don't kill an egg when you
press<00:02:46.690> too<00:02:46.990> hard<00:02:48.360> okay

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.910 

I<00:03:10.440> don't<00:03:11.190> know<00:03:11.280> how<00:03:11.430> many<00:03:11.940> extra<00:03:12.920> female

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
I don't know how many extra female

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.830 
I don't know how many extra female
already<00:03:14.900> positioned<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:17.330> subside<00:03:18.330> here<00:03:18.540> but

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
already positioned and subside here but

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.230 
already positioned and subside here but
I'm<00:03:19.230> sure<00:03:20.300> we<00:03:21.300> can<00:03:21.660> find<00:03:22.320> some<00:03:22.730> if<00:03:23.730> we<00:03:24.030> go

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
I'm sure we can find some if we go

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.380 
I'm sure we can find some if we go
through<00:03:24.450> careful<00:03:24.870> here<00:03:25.020> I<00:03:25.170> see<00:03:25.500> one<00:03:25.680> here<00:03:26.390> you

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
through careful here I see one here you

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.850 
through careful here I see one here you
see<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:28.460> this<00:03:29.460> is<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.850> egg<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.510> mega<00:03:31.260> soma<00:03:31.500> in

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
see that this is the egg of mega soma in

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.330 
see that this is the egg of mega soma in
a<00:03:32.010> false<00:03:32.370> helices<00:03:33.530> from<00:03:35.690> Central<00:03:36.690> America<00:03:37.340> now

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
a false helices from Central America now

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.380 
a false helices from Central America now
I<00:03:38.550> have<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.060> prepared<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.900> box<00:03:40.820> to<00:03:41.820> put<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.180> egg

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
I have I prepared a box to put the egg

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.290 
I have I prepared a box to put the egg
in<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.960> make<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.560> hole<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:44.160> look<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:44.970> there<00:03:45.180> are

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
in I make a hole I look that there are

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.260 
in I make a hole I look that there are
no<00:03:46.340> earth<00:03:47.340> warms<00:03:47.850> in<00:03:48.060> here<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:49.670> try<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.730> put<00:03:51.060> some

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
no earth warms in here I try to put some

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.990 
no earth warms in here I try to put some
of<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.510> original<00:03:52.200> material<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.130> press<00:03:53.580> it<00:03:53.820> a

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
of the original material I press it a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.700 
of the original material I press it a
little<00:03:54.240> bit<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:55.280> if<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.460> can<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:56.910> now<00:03:57.120> I

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
little bit so that if I can and now I

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:05.000 
little bit so that if I can and now I
put<00:03:58.710> the<00:03:58.860> egg<00:03:59.100> back<00:03:59.150> into<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:03.560> turn<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.740> I

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
put the egg back into that turn and I

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.230 
put the egg back into that turn and I
put<00:04:05.490> some<00:04:05.520> other<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.710> the<00:04:07.710> original<00:04:08.370> material

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
put some other of the original material

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.940 
put some other of the original material
material<00:04:09.960> over<00:04:10.290> it<00:04:10.410> cover<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:14.240> so<00:04:15.710> it<00:04:16.710> could<00:04:16.920> be

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
material over it cover it so it could be

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.099 
material over it cover it so it could be
possible<00:04:17.310> for<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.000> egg<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.450> breathe<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.840> little

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
possible for the egg to breathe a little

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.710 
possible for the egg to breathe a little
bit<00:04:19.290> also<00:04:19.650> it<00:04:20.010> should<00:04:20.160> be<00:04:20.190> possible<00:04:20.549> to<00:04:21.480> take

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
bit also it should be possible to take

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.020 
bit also it should be possible to take
in<00:04:21.989> some<00:04:22.290> more<00:04:22.470> of<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.010> humidity<00:04:23.370> from<00:04:23.670> the

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
in some more of the humidity from the

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.310 
in some more of the humidity from the
surrounding<00:04:24.780> substrate<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:26.510> now<00:04:27.510> a<00:04:27.540> closely

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
surrounding substrate and now a closely

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.930 
surrounding substrate and now a closely
there<00:04:28.470> are<00:04:28.590> some<00:04:28.860> small<00:04:29.460> holes<00:04:29.730> here<00:04:30.240> in<00:04:31.110> the

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
there are some small holes here in the

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.010 
there are some small holes here in the
on<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.390> lid<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:33.960> little<00:04:34.770> box<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.870> when<00:04:36.870> we

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
on the lid of the little box and when we

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.490 
on the lid of the little box and when we
go<00:04:37.200> we<00:04:37.530> have<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.980> look<00:04:38.280> through<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.730> whole

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
go we have to look through the whole

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.780 
go we have to look through the whole
material<00:04:40.500> mostly<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.790> female<00:04:42.330> compresses<00:04:43.790> at

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
material mostly the female compresses at

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.560 
material mostly the female compresses at
the<00:04:44.970> substrate<00:04:45.600> very<00:04:46.440> carefully<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.570> lays

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
the substrate very carefully and lays

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:56.720 
the substrate very carefully and lays
the<00:04:48.840> egg<00:04:52.520> into<00:04:53.520> it<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:55.350> we<00:04:55.680> have<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.100> be

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
the egg into it and we have to be

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:07.570 
the egg into it and we have to be
careful<00:04:57.450> not<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:58.700> squash<00:04:59.700> the<00:05:00.030> egg

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.230 

and<00:05:07.670> in<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.750> meantime<00:05:09.220> while<00:05:10.220> I'm<00:05:10.250> looking

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
days or weeks that it will be a pop pop

days or weeks that it will be a pop pop
and<00:05:53.750> look<00:05:54.050> at<00:05:54.230> another<00:05:54.410> egg<00:05:54.800> and<00:05:57.370> inside<00:05:58.370> a
