00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 hello everyone today let's talk about this 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.069
 fantastic scoop of the lang lang brand 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.700
 recently lang lang has taken out the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.019
 market two very good teams this and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.190
 another version that I do not have here now 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.199
 same but I put a picture is a version 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.100
 crushed completely very big and it's 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.220
 impressive as I had commented in a 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.560
 ambo cge singh this cube is a scoop and 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.150
 where are the centers here to see what 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.420
 is happening the centers are these 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.850
 pieces here these big pieces with 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.100
 three stickers and we obviously have six 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.790
 not the six scoop centers 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.520
 we would have this piece is a center this 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.280
 piece is a center and this piece is a 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.320
 center and this also not and then the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.920
 corners because obviously they are the other 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.000
 pieces we have 8 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:59.359
 and as he had said they are also organized 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.609
 in two groups we have six of a kind and 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.640
 two of another type we have six 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.770
 triangular little ones with a sticker 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.439
 is 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.850
 this is these are corners and then 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.619
 we have these here that also have 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.420
 three stickers but they are smaller than 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.630
 the centers worth this is a good center 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.860
 big and this is a corner you see that 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.090
 has small people respirations and 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.390
 we have this and it is clear then I do 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.390
 I put it, let's see 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.760
 so for example here we would have center 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.110
 center center center corner center 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.210
 corner to corner corner 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.730
 then you can see a bit the 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.400
 cube structure not your four 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.980
 corners and their centers around here no more or 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.890
 least it's a matter of seeing it a bit and it's 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:50.490
 a very big game here I saw it already 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.040
 Size is typical fish size but I have 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.080
 something more representative a 7 by 7-6 ou 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.100
 and let's see if we put it in vertical 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.580
 that vertically, because it's much more 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.540
 big if we put it like that more or less 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.540
 you see what 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.460
 we go like a seven seven or a little 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.530
 bigger as this cube rotates as well as 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:19.290
 it's a scoop has 120 degree turns 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:23.130
 let's see it one hundred twenty 120 120 yes 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.530
 I now turn this face 120 and what happens 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.560
 this has been deformed not effectively 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.640
 this puzzle is deformed and much then 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.430
 we see here a turn of 120 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.470
 120 and we complete what happens is that the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.760
 scripts are pretty cubes 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.490
 awesome because because I when 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.710
 turn 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:48.950
 I half of the cube is 50% of the 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.280
 cube however me when I turn a cube 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.810
 normal a 7 by 7 turn and that then 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.580
 I'm not moving almost anything not 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.250
 all this does not move I'm just 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.440
 moving this but here I move 50% of the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.350
 cube is not what it is is pretty 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.280
 impressive and as you can see has a 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.240
 Impeccable perfect click mechanism 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.730
 click click click is no problem 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.480
 you see for fast tours you tour 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.700
 perfectly its very good cube and other 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.950
 thing that I really like in this cube are 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.330
 the stickers this purple color me 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.760
 love the purple color normally not 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.560
 it's in the cubes we have the blue 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.710
 orange but the purple usually does not 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.810
 is and here it is and I like it a lot and 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.220
 I also really like how they are 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.310
 distributed the colors because sometimes 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.750
 you like colors in a bucket but 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.430
 they put two colors together that do not remain 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.930
 well for example a red and an orange a 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.610
 red in pink that you like a lot 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.500
 the colors but they put them together and 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.120
 they are bad and here they are very good 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.010
 distributed for example the blue and the 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.080
 purple even if they are together nothing happens 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.020
 are the colors that are well understood and 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.590
 are these three so this blue white 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.060
 purple I love this color 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.910
 You see that all are good 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.190
 all combine very well so that up to 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.319
 the stickers are nice let's see 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.660
 now a couple of very interesting states 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.160
 and by the way this cube is just face 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.790
 I hope to have spoiled it on the ground 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.759
 because this little corner 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.190
 now dance when normally the 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:24.009
 corner is well joined and here is a 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.600
 little bailonga and that I do not like to see if 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.669
 can fix it this state is very 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.729
 interesting because we have the whole cube 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.690
 resolved and a broken corner gives this that 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.580
 a person does it and the first thing that 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.680
 does is try to turn this piece not 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.930
 good as you know we really have two 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.490
 turned corners what happens is that this 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.610
 corner even if it is rotated I see it 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.259
 anyway I do not find out then at the end 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.750
 it seems that the only thing we have to 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.060
 to do is turn this piece and call a lot 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.349
 the attention and this state is also 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.289
 pretty impressive we have two 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:56.410
 centers in its position but rotates two 180 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.120
 degrees you see everything solved and this center 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.800
 he is effectively in his position I 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.360
 had a normal skip would not give me 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.770
 realize that it is rotated 180 degrees 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.810
 because because the normal script is a 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.699
 square and he is already not me but 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.620
 here you see I have to turn this 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.669
 center and I have to turn this center 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.349
 then clear if the final that 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.610
 we solve this cube can we 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.710
 present this situation and then what 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.110
 here goes the panic that is 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.669
 going with this cube in these two 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.250
 states seem to me quite 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.800
 awesome good let's undo now 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.539
 complete 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.449
 this cube because I have two by the way 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.789
 Well, I have two because with one 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.750
 some modification even if it's already 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.190
 it's a pretty modification 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.789
 awesome but good anyway 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:37.430
 we're going to undo it and so 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:40.430
 what we form completely because 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.810
 this cube is deformed a lot we are going to 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.790
 watch 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.260
 if you see that as I said before it turns without 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.960
 problems 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.540
 sometimes it even costs a bit to see how 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.540
 how to spin it, not because you miss a 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.700
 little but good is a complicated challenge 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.690
 it's okay even if we know how to solve a script and 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.800
 sure that the first time that what 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.720
 we solve we lose ourselves and we 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.720
 we confuse because we think that a 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.730
 corner is a center and vice versa we are going to 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.310
 do a few more kilos and well I 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.940
 I think it's already quite messy what 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.940
 we inspect 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.620
 now that it looks like a kind of cube 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.000
 we're not going to compare it with one 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.340
 resolved you see no 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.200
 quite amazing is a how you 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.500
 I recommend without hesitation and if you like 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.170
 scoop can not miss in your collection 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.420
 this is so here I say goodbye with the 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.150
 same show 7 by 7 with this scoop and with 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.710
 this escape a very good I hope that 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.580
 you liked the video and as always 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.580
 see you in another
