yeah<00:00:44.820> I'm<00:00:44.940> showing<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.270> code<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.660> one

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
yeah I'm showing the code on that one

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.549 
yeah I'm showing the code on that one
it'll<00:00:47.070> already<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.370> entered<00:00:47.700> into<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.559> into

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it'll already be entered into the into

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.080 
it'll already be entered into the into
the<00:00:49.649> game<00:00:49.860> by<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> time<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.640> anyway

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the game by the time you see this anyway

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
the game by the time you see this anyway
so<00:00:51.149> it'll<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.870> fun<00:00:52.079> well<00:00:52.469> once<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.739> let<00:00:52.860> me<00:00:52.920> get

so it'll be fun well once I let me get

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.110 
so it'll be fun well once I let me get
this<00:00:53.100> closer<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> me<00:00:53.579> I'll<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.730> easier<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> get

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this closer to me I'll be easier to get

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.360 
this closer to me I'll be easier to get
the<00:00:55.520> promo<00:00:56.520> cards<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.899> we<00:00:57.989> go

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and then get the other one got to get

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.349 
and then get the other one got to get
Mudkip<00:01:01.050> free<00:01:01.379> from<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.920> there<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.430> so

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
Mudkip free from that to there we go so

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.410 
Mudkip free from that to there we go so
anyway<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:04.199> our<00:01:04.409> code<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.040> I'm<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:06.360> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
anyway have our code but I'm going to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
anyway have our code but I'm going to
use<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.570> before<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.170> video<00:01:07.409> gets<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.680> blood

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
use that before this video gets up blood

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
use that before this video gets up blood
so<00:01:07.979> don't<00:01:08.159> even<00:01:08.250> try<00:01:08.630> anyway<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
so don't even try anyway we have a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.560 
so don't even try anyway we have a
Mudkip<00:01:10.860> Torchic<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.400> treecko<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.180> starters

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
Mudkip Torchic and treecko the starters

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390 
Mudkip Torchic and treecko the starters

get a coin as you saw where it's a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.109 
get a coin as you saw where it's a
Pikachu<00:01:18.630> coin<00:01:19.640> we<00:01:20.640> should<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:20.909> kayo

core growl don't know yet then we have

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.630 
core growl don't know yet then we have
our<00:01:23.520> PEX<00:01:24.140> curious<00:01:25.140> fist<00:01:25.439> phantom<00:01:25.890> forces<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
our PEX curious fist phantom forces to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.980 
our PEX curious fist phantom forces to
phantom<00:01:26.909> forces<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.330> guess<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
phantom forces I guess really on that

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.080 
phantom forces I guess really on that
and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.740> also<00:01:29.509> flash<00:01:30.509> fire<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.110> x<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> y

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
and then also flash fire and x and y

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.270 
and then also flash fire and x and y
also<00:01:33.090> from<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:34.110> get<00:01:34.259> 0<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.860> pencils

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
also from this you get 0 you get pencils

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
also from this you get 0 you get pencils
I<00:01:35.400> didn't<00:01:35.790> even<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.119> part<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.600> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
I didn't even see that part of it you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.200 
I didn't even see that part of it you
get<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.350> pencils<00:01:37.799> evidently<00:01:38.220> those<00:01:39.030> look

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.430 
yet so that's pretty cool works well
with<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.829> steel<00:03:59.190> X<00:03:59.400> from<00:03:59.609> what<00:03:59.790> I've<00:03:59.880> heard<00:03:59.910> and

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
with a steel X from what I've heard and

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.199 
with a steel X from what I've heard and
looks<00:04:01.440> awesome<00:04:01.950> dialga<00:04:02.549> so<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.819> know<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.090> has

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
looks awesome dialga so you know it has

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.270 
looks awesome dialga so you know it has
to<00:04:03.239> be<00:04:03.359> cool<00:04:03.569> then<00:04:04.139> a<00:04:04.200> battle<00:04:04.620> compressor<00:04:04.769> a

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
to be cool then a battle compressor a

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.930 
to be cool then a battle compressor a
wee<00:04:06.239> mystery<00:04:06.840> energy<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.769> lamp<00:04:08.160> it's<00:04:08.370> so<00:04:08.760> at

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
wee mystery energy and lamp it's so at

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.789 
wee mystery energy and lamp it's so at
least<00:04:09.030> we're<00:04:09.209> able<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.450> get<00:04:09.540> an<00:04:09.630> e<00:04:09.870> x<00:04:10.019> from<00:04:10.530> this

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
least we're able to get an e x from this

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.699 
least we're able to get an e x from this
so<00:04:11.010> far<00:04:11.220> we<00:04:11.549> still<00:04:11.609> have<00:04:11.730> one<00:04:11.880> pack<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.239> go

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
so far we still have one pack to go

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.020 
so far we still have one pack to go
maybe<00:04:13.709> we<00:04:13.799> get<00:04:13.889> something<00:04:14.130> else<00:04:14.459> from<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:14.849> i

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
maybe we get something else from this i

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.370 
maybe we get something else from this i
don't<00:04:15.180> know<00:04:15.380> i'm<00:04:16.380> pretty<00:04:16.590> greedy<00:04:16.889> oh<00:04:18.380> he's

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
don't know i'm pretty greedy oh he's

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.870 
don't know i'm pretty greedy oh he's
opening<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:20.070> maybe<00:04:20.310> we<00:04:20.370> can<00:04:20.489> get<00:04:20.579> something

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
opening so maybe we can get something

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.750 
opening so maybe we can get something
else<00:04:21.090> too

getting a sum you're getting a pretty

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.420 
getting a sum you're getting a pretty
good<00:04:48.290> number<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.560> packs<00:04:48.860> you're<00:04:49.160> getting

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
which is kind of cool so it's hard to

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.010 
which is kind of cool so it's hard to
kind<00:04:52.940> of<00:04:53.030> recommend<00:04:53.449> but<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:53.660> think<00:04:53.900> it's<00:04:53.990> a

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
kind of recommend but I think it's a

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.960 
kind of recommend but I think it's a
pretty<00:04:54.139> cool<00:04:54.470> thing<00:04:54.500> too<00:04:54.979> I<00:04:55.220> like<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.760> case

and everything so for me that was the

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.900 
and everything so for me that was the
main<00:04:57.770> reason<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:58.130> wanted<00:04:58.160> it<00:04:58.490> cuz<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:58.639> like<00:04:58.760> to
