00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
detail on certain maps like this fab was

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.410 
detail on certain maps like this fab was
like<00:03:28.950> has<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> lot<00:03:29.489> more<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:29.880> than<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.180> really

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
like has a lot more to it than I really

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.000

thought<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:31.019> don't<00:03:31.410> know<00:03:31.470> there's<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.860> lot

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
thought I don't know there's just a lot

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.740 
thought I don't know there's just a lot
of<00:03:32.070> things<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.700> just<00:03:33.060> I'd<00:03:33.239> never<00:03:33.570> pay

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
of things on it that just I'd never pay

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.210 
of things on it that just I'd never pay
attention<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.470> same<00:03:34.920> thing<00:03:35.100> with<00:03:35.160> a

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
attention to and it same thing with a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.830 
attention to and it same thing with a
lot<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.430> maps<00:03:35.610> on<00:03:35.880> them<00:03:36.060> look<00:03:36.420> at<00:03:36.540> this<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:36.780> think

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
lot of maps on them look at this I think

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.630 
lot of maps on them look at this I think
it's<00:03:37.019> right<00:03:37.140> here<00:03:37.350> where<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.220> don't<00:03:38.580> know
