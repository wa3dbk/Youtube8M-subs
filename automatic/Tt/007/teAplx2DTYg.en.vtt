00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.980
 of course there was a disaster with current reporting on the big one 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:05.370
 occurred in 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.290
 near the van zomp an animal 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.400
 on the strabrecht heath with us i am van otterdijk liaison officer of 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.469
 tiggling on command of the fire was not with arguments 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.679
 in four busy days behind it may give a big garden 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.139
 yes we have the third busy day today and we hope to have the final today 

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:24.509
 blow so that in the coming days we will be with much less preference 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.150
 must be actively disabled 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.349
 Friday afternoon around half past three at sparta on the way to the third game 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.390
 but to take a look 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.040
 I saw in the distance very big cloud of smoke I thought it failed is good it 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.040
 creating the Christian Union for our environment during a good mass 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.010
 say he has such a big forest fire and he he once every thirteen years 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.950
 comes that priority, we have another show one 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.380
 big bigger problem it is it is a heath fire jerks the pleasure off the heath 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.620
 yes we have a three pole problem if you look at it with the past 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.340
 two days have always been warm weather combined with the wishes that 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.990
 always worried that the new fireplaces will arise 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.100
 I have done my utmost to prevent it from further reaching the area 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.410
 so that the fire brigade deployed many units 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.260
 and therefore it works 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.560
 that also means that we have the branding under control 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.330
 two other problems we have is that we are very close to forest area 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.530
 where we have a very difficult intermediate ring with with also with fire and 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.230
 people with jets of water with spades and such 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.070
 and the other is indeed that there is a thick layer of humus 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.680
 and that simply means that fire residues just miles into the ground 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.080
 and therefore a new fire has arisen 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.920
 a 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.799
 We are not satisfied with the summer fire brigade that Mierlo was doing 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.110
 A very large group of firefighters on ground comes together with rest of it 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.120
 country rap groups have been active there 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.700
 yes in pack you eat roma beyoncÃ© a fire brigade company that live on this 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.060
 moment one from our own region and we have two other compier 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.310
 deployed one from gelderland south and one from gelderland north east 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.250
 A cup reminds you of a hundred and four brand by people with one in number 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.840
 from brooklyn vehicles 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.780
 there are sun extinguishing because not without danger 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.360
 The Netherlands always provoke danger fire people can be enclosed by 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.970
 the village fiery and especially on the smoke that is also a very difficult for us 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.770
 well we have some resources for that, but keep monitoring that 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.659
 we can also work safely ourselves 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.540
 Kenny was the decision made earlier, a ditto damaged said the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.319
 winner 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.889
 yes then due to the heat hitchhiking router was a week ago along the A67 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.360
 after hole to men's clothes at the moment a lot of fire engines also one 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.219
 smoke development that is after always in the area 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.899
 it's just very wise that the walkers have a totally different fine 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:30.800
 have got 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.209
 what katie see at various press media where the area is located approximately 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.269
 Puma is a bit reminiscent of the ecb president's tiny roemer on the 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.749
 other side of the one the train came 6 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:44.689
 yes to collect as we are entitled to a session on the south side of the a7 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.790
 the one on the brechtse heide street after we know most people 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:52.189
 where he crosses the high road and the on to the viaduct 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:52.840
 bends 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.530
 on the highway, say, from that corner is a bit the fire went down mer 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.099
 been in the first instance and from there just about main streets where they are on 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.629
 it is a real natural disaster film 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.329
 it is precisely the leftist who they are always there for, so there is always just one 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.099
 natural fire would say so 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.089
 m the cook a lot 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.849
 many animals of the ordinary advance just a renewed this way yes we are 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.019
 I can not sore exactly in the branches what is the total effect people of 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.469
 state forest management are also at this morning I spoke in a man the bols overseers 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.519
 of state forest management and she is still very concerned about the quality of the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.699
 trees and the cetera that stand there 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.639
 for the rest I also understood that special biotopes still live in it 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.510
 the area 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.090
 then years what exactly damage is that will not be paid for this 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.409
 state forest management 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.079
 it is it was to be expected in the area and dolls that it turns out 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.179
 also from the neighborhood 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.980
 we have 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.230
 today we are trying to make a final move by properly replicating real fire 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.050
 extinguish there have support for the life of the ven see the 100 one 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:53.829
 sloping 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.759
 our company in June is present with 114 people then you should not think about it 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.180
 the end is material but especially to the people themselves 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.029
 that just with 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:07.719
 the savers try to search for the plumes of smoke together with the fire 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:11.649
 people who ever in grave say well make the wet so you really get out 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:12.190
 to be 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.460
 so that we smulder the other who now it is really good under 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.789
 gain control 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.599
 with that we hope that in the course of the evening that butcher now falls 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.059
 has been living 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:26.830
 and as we now see them all, geus sure some form in the coming weeks 

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:30.449
 control must be maintained and that may be reduced 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.509
 to a few units of the fire department than nature it is not difficult to 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.430
 a water shortage if you can brussel 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.900
 just very tricky we already have some water points in the past 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.289
 Landscaped in the area contributed to this case with such a big fire on you so much 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.289
 need water the first stroke with a Friday afternoon 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.599
 fire helicopter 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.190
 who creates water from the south willemsvaart canal and then leaves it 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:57.250
 Drop on the hot spots well we have the fire under control 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.879
 from the air say you have to stop because the effect of two and 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.199
 Half a cubic meter of water falling on the floor is that you can make your butcher splash the water apart 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.319
 found fire that ends up in other places and with it new browns 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.689
 we have organize 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.120
 so it means that I am putting the brakes on my ground troops 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.110
 and that means having one in the course of the attack Friday night 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.280
 large water transport there are very thick balvers long with whole 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.650
 large heavy pumps 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.400
 also those who have landed from the canal and then the emergency lane from 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.659
 the a67 that is also the reason 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:33.419
 why the a67 from a team from eindhoven to venlo is still just one and he 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.809
 I say but for traffic right now that says she is still 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:37.860
 always 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.090
 and we are with Rijkswaterstaat then see if it cannot happen 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.849
 make sure that tomorrow the road here can be fully released me 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.849
 it may still be that, for example, that transport hose is the bar 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.650
 damon albarn in the course of the night on a photo we see way 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.800
 before traffic can drive again this morning 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.800
 that decision has not yet been taken that will be done and it 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.219
 command 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:01.579
 approximately how many people have been extinguishing 

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:05.079
 of the brand and the next of kin Well I am you and I have a great event 

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:10.149
 aissati dahmane and the 400 probe are a fact and five hundred people are on this 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:11.599
 currently active in the area 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.249
 between fans who want to provide the fire brigade police and other services 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:18.339
 we can now say work at ease because I understand that seals in the 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.699
 wave of protests rocking toward a fire 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.199
 needles architect about disaster tourists then the bosses reason the first two 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.120
 may be days but it does have all on the side and we have people 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.800
 Daughter also feels the hot cetera we are entering the area 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.300
 food starts in the new 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.550
 I also see more and more cyclists hikers coming to the area as well 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.550
 already in my body by the police also for feyenoord the winner 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.070
 not 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.480
 those at risk social workers with vehicles are still dissatisfied with the market 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.300
 just leave 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.369
 but people have continued to make towers 

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:50.409
 nothing is yet known about the cause 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.889
 no cause I can not say anything that I do know is Friday 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:59.159
 natural incredibly hot it has been very dry for weeks so after that 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:02.669
 certain risks and what exactly the cause may be 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:03.839
 to be 

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:05.409
 he thanked for an explanation 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:08.559
 and good luck with the further course of extinguishing this fire 

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:12.529
 julio thanks and good luck with the broadcaster the knowledge march
