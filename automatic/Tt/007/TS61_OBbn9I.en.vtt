let's<00:01:38.830> go<00:01:38.950> ahead<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.160> break<00:01:39.280> through<00:01:39.460> drop<00:01:39.730> a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
let's go ahead and break through drop a

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.100 
let's go ahead and break through drop a
couple<00:01:39.910> more<00:01:40.210> goblins<00:01:40.510> there's<00:01:40.930> usually

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
couple more goblins there's usually

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.930 
couple more goblins there's usually
about<00:01:41.380> 50,000<00:01:42.160> gold<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.490> each<00:01:42.580> one<00:01:42.760> of<00:01:42.790> those

about 50,000 gold and each one of those
collectors<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:43.750> it's<00:01:43.870> definitely<00:01:44.200> worth<00:01:44.350> it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
collectors so it's definitely worth it

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.530 
collectors so it's definitely worth it
to<00:01:44.590> break<00:01:44.770> through<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.220> looking<00:01:46.120> at<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.330> rest

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
so we can go ahead and see if we can get

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.780 
so we can go ahead and see if we can get
to<00:01:52.510> that<00:01:52.680> alright<00:01:53.680> let<00:01:53.830> me<00:01:53.860> drop<00:01:54.100> my<00:01:54.160> giants

wizard<00:02:38.690> tower<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:39.170> will<00:02:39.349> be<00:02:39.470> at<00:02:39.650> fifty<00:02:40.010> percent

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
wizard tower we will be at fifty percent

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.339 
wizard tower we will be at fifty percent
alright<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.269> wrapping<00:02:41.540> up<00:02:41.660> looks<00:02:41.989> like<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.319> got

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
alright so wrapping up looks like we got

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.490 
alright so wrapping up looks like we got
over<00:02:42.680> 600,000<00:02:43.580> resources<00:02:44.090> left<00:02:44.569> about<00:02:44.810> 50,000

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
over 600,000 resources left about 50,000

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.410 
over 600,000 resources left about 50,000
a<00:02:45.530> beach<00:02:45.680> in<00:02:45.799> the<00:02:45.890> storages<00:02:46.310> because<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.849> don't

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
a beach in the storages because I don't

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.789 
a beach in the storages because I don't
think<00:02:47.569> we<00:02:47.630> had<00:02:47.750> enough<00:02:47.840> troops<00:02:48.170> as<00:02:48.500> well<00:02:48.709> as

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
think we had enough troops as well as

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:49.900 
think we had enough troops as well as
it's<00:02:48.920> not<00:02:48.980> really<00:02:49.400> worth<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.760> break

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
it's not really worth it to break

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.300 
it's not really worth it to break
through<00:02:50.090> all<00:02:50.180> those<00:02:50.299> walls<00:02:50.540> anyway<00:02:50.840> so

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
through all those walls anyway so

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.259 
through all those walls anyway so
620,000<00:02:52.310> resource<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.819> definitely<00:02:53.209> an

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
620,000 resource is definitely an

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.089 
620,000 resource is definitely an
amazing<00:02:53.599> rate<00:02:53.750> as<00:02:53.930> well<00:02:54.410> as<00:02:54.530> we<00:02:54.650> got<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:54.950> keep

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
amazing rate as well as we got to keep

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.949 
amazing rate as well as we got to keep
our<00:02:55.250> trophies<00:02:55.670> alright<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:56.569> looking<00:02:56.810> at<00:02:56.870> this

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
our trophies alright so looking at this

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.229 
our trophies alright so looking at this
base<00:02:57.170> Inferno<00:02:57.650> tower<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:58.160> burnout<00:02:58.519> tombstones

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
base Inferno tower is burnout tombstones

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.089 
base Inferno tower is burnout tombstones
everywhere<00:02:59.660> so<00:03:00.140> obviously<00:03:00.500> this<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.829> another

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
everywhere so obviously this is another

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.740 
everywhere so obviously this is another
one<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.370> those<00:03:01.519> bases<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.209> use<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.540> lazy

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
one of those bases to use the lazy

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.270 
one of those bases to use the lazy
farming<00:03:03.200> strategy<00:03:03.319> on<00:03:03.739> that's<00:03:03.950> pretty<00:03:04.160> much

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
farming strategy on that's pretty much

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.009 
farming strategy on that's pretty much
what<00:03:04.519> I'm<00:03:04.610> doing<00:03:04.910> today<00:03:05.060> I'm<00:03:05.599> using<00:03:05.660> the

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
what I'm doing today I'm using the

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.690 
what I'm doing today I'm using the
strategy<00:03:06.440> with<00:03:06.560> Giants<00:03:06.950> wall<00:03:07.370> breakers

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
strategy with Giants wall breakers

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.789 
strategy with Giants wall breakers
archers<00:03:08.239> and<00:03:08.269> goblins<00:03:08.989> if<00:03:09.319> you<00:03:09.500> use<00:03:09.620> this

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
archers and goblins if you use this

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.680 
archers and goblins if you use this
strategy<00:03:10.040> i<00:03:10.310> know<00:03:10.459> i<00:03:10.549> did<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.819> main<00:03:11.060> video<00:03:11.269> on<00:03:11.569> it

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
strategy i know i did a main video on it

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.819 
strategy i know i did a main video on it
i'm<00:03:11.810> sure<00:03:11.959> you<00:03:12.049> guys<00:03:12.079> can<00:03:12.200> find<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.620> on<00:03:12.739> my

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
i'm sure you guys can find it on my

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.400 
i'm sure you guys can find it on my
channel<00:03:13.160> it's<00:03:14.030> one<00:03:14.510> of<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.720> cheapest<00:03:15.200> most

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
channel it's one of the cheapest most

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.379 
channel it's one of the cheapest most
efficient<00:03:15.920> strategies<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.670> taking<00:03:17.150> people

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
efficient strategies and taking people

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.270 
efficient strategies and taking people
out<00:03:17.510> really<00:03:18.260> all<00:03:18.380> i<00:03:18.410> had<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.709> do<00:03:18.829> on<00:03:18.859> this<00:03:19.069> one

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
out really all i had to do on this one

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.400 
out really all i had to do on this one
was<00:03:19.489> drop<00:03:19.670> two<00:03:19.850> giants<00:03:20.269> to<00:03:20.660> wall<00:03:20.840> breakers<00:03:21.230> a

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
was drop two giants to wall breakers a

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.319 
was drop two giants to wall breakers a
ton<00:03:21.859> of<00:03:21.889> goblins<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.549> then<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.760> few<00:03:22.910> archers

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
ton of goblins and then a few archers

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.809 
ton of goblins and then a few archers
and<00:03:23.510> i<00:03:23.870> was<00:03:23.989> able<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.350> steal<00:03:24.590> over<00:03:24.950> 400,000

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
and i was able to steal over 400,000

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.670 
and i was able to steal over 400,000
resources<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:26.600> what's<00:03:26.930> good<00:03:27.109> about<00:03:27.200> this<00:03:27.319> is

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
resources and what's good about this is

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.129 
resources and what's good about this is
you<00:03:28.220> don't<00:03:28.310> have<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.670> wait<00:03:28.880> an<00:03:29.090> hour<00:03:29.480> for<00:03:29.870> your

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
you don't have to wait an hour for your

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:32.110 
you don't have to wait an hour for your
troops<00:03:30.349> to<00:03:30.560> train<00:03:30.769> up<00:03:30.920> if<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.579> have<00:03:31.790> troops

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
troops to train up if you have troops

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.699 
troops to train up if you have troops
being<00:03:32.359> trained<00:03:32.720> while<00:03:32.959> you're<00:03:33.109> battling<00:03:33.410> like

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
being trained while you're battling like

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.110 
being trained while you're battling like
this<00:03:33.889> you're<00:03:34.069> going<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.250> have<00:03:34.400> plenty<00:03:34.910> of

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
this you're going to have plenty of

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.490 
this you're going to have plenty of
troops<00:03:35.389> when<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.599> get<00:03:35.690> back<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.959> base<00:03:36.139> in<00:03:36.349> fact

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
troops when you get back to base in fact

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.920 
troops when you get back to base in fact
you'll<00:03:37.220> probably<00:03:37.280> only<00:03:37.849> be<00:03:38.000> missing<00:03:38.450> like<00:03:38.599> 20

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
you'll probably only be missing like 20

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.300 
you'll probably only be missing like 20
troops<00:03:39.230> so<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.500> only<00:03:39.650> should<00:03:39.920> take<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.099> couple

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
troops so it only should take a couple

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.979 
troops so it only should take a couple
minutes<00:03:40.549> to<00:03:40.760> train<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:41.359> it's<00:03:41.540> really<00:03:41.720> one<00:03:41.959> of

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
minutes to train so it's really one of

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.659 
minutes to train so it's really one of
the<00:03:42.079> most<00:03:42.169> efficient<00:03:42.650> strategies<00:03:43.099> and<00:03:43.310> if<00:03:43.609> you

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
the most efficient strategies and if you

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:44.770 
the most efficient strategies and if you
guys<00:03:43.760> haven't<00:03:44.000> checked<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.329> out<00:03:44.389> already<00:03:44.660> i

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
guys haven't checked it out already i

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.500 
guys haven't checked it out already i
would<00:03:45.049> go<00:03:45.169> ahead<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.440> scope<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.069> out<00:03:46.510> alright

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
would go ahead and scope it out alright

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.430 
would go ahead and scope it out alright
let's<00:03:47.660> go<00:03:47.720> ahead<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:47.870> do<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.079> same<00:03:48.260> thing

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
let's go ahead and do the same thing

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.659 
let's go ahead and do the same thing
with<00:03:48.530> this<00:03:48.620> next<00:03:48.859> base<00:03:49.010> most<00:03:49.250> of<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.459> stuff

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
with this next base most of the stuff

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:50.979 
with this next base most of the stuff
inside<00:03:49.819> of<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.090> mines<00:03:50.299> and<00:03:50.480> pumps<00:03:50.690> i<00:03:50.780> think

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
inside of the mines and pumps i think

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.720 
inside of the mines and pumps i think
there<00:03:51.530> might<00:03:51.680> be<00:03:51.739> some<00:03:52.130> in<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.310> storages

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
there might be some in the storages

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.280 
there might be some in the storages
because<00:03:53.000> looking<00:03:53.269> at<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:53.510> elixir<00:03:53.840> storages

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
because looking at the elixir storages

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.500 
because looking at the elixir storages
they<00:03:54.440> are<00:03:54.700> maybe<00:03:55.700> like<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:55.970> third<00:03:56.269> of<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.419> way

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
they are maybe like a third of the way

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.819 
they are maybe like a third of the way
filled<00:03:56.900> so<00:03:57.139> i'll<00:03:57.260> just<00:03:57.290> have<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.560> check<00:03:57.769> on

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
filled so i'll just have to check on

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.199
