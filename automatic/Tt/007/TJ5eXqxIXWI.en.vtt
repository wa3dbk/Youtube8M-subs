00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:05.120
 Hello Dear User to a commented gameplay trailer of Testsessions 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.880
 trained 2 here are gone and time is greater we show you some here 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.110
 Pictures that could be seen on the business area of ​​Games com and are here 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.020
 the act the new main character of Esther are Street 2 Ezio Auditore IT 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.300
 for the 10 as the name implies comes out of love »Flow Ernst 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.230
 and you can also see that Florence is sixteenth 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.830
 Among other things, we see here also this is in miniature 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.480
 a beautiful little church 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.960
 in the center 4 foil that means the whole also has a realism relation and 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.710
 a realism claim 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 the Florence as it is shown here leans in the very original 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.460
 Florence of the sixteenth century 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.070
 besides, we're just seeing some new people on the street of our some 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.540
 more 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.850
 Christa Hoffs improved a lot and the water feature 2 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.070
 This was also done in the animation of education when he was very much 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.800
 smoother on the way and also the fans have improved 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.230
 the whole but much more flavor water with filter really well done 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.660
 just like in the first part of this this time, of course, so again 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.330
 that the one must emphasize the vision in the missionary and so on 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.700
 that you always have to do most things and where to go 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.270
 here are also demos and kidneys 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.930
 continue to give his can be done against as similar to the yard 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.170
 Knives can go on or on our good friend the Vinci developed by 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.200
 Demasi got new in Assassin's Creed 2 of course they have the most diverse ones 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.830
 Possibilities to distract his opponents here for example with Siemens and the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.170
 you throw on the floor 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.600
 it makes sense cool 2 now has a Piccolo Mexes Tel the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.289
 means 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.389
 You can earn money through assignments and you can most likely 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.389
 for it also new weapons and clothes or whatever buy 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.490
 after having rejected possible witnesses and reaped for it like a poisoned one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.200
 Blade in the at the Gods of our goal 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.520
 and how defensively he is completely disoriented and becomes equal with the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.159
 Halberd wild to beat one should therefore nothing or stand by and 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.620
 this is precisely our mistake 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.479
 Michel Comte ECD the mission is fulfilled and we get 200 for it 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.629
 Forint 9 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.069
 So you see, the missions do not have to be done directly by us 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.150
 but it is just necessary for them to directly influence that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.899
 Target is turned off 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:25.839
 more weapons for Italy not just a hidden Cameroonian and exploit 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:26.860
 poisoned sound 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.580
 No, he also has two shepherd places as opposed to his 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.479
 Predecessor as he is her 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.949
 Here we also see a secret access to the catacombs 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:39.409
 then a couple at least plug in the water drawing sign then opens up 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.999
 because of one access 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.999
 to the catacombs in Florence 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.449
 right here you can also see what the new animation Santen of assassin's 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.309
 Creed 2 all too 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:57.719
 This passage Edlinger is able to make a significant difference to another game 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:04.590
 what really needs Adolf to the animation value namely Christoph Drescher 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.549
 in general in this tracking shot we have just seen 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.260
 you know the much deeper sponsor fresh wind she shows you the way 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.059
 where you have to go with 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.309
 in education, however, and he also shows much cleverer than 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:18.920
 Age yes from the first part 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.590
 because such a passage could not be overcome in the first part 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.589
 he hears that the bats are now attracting a guard 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.479
 also the same time suspicious 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.019
 looks around and 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.889
 we take the opportunity and throw them under 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.100
 that was our coach meeting i hope it pleased 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.850
 we'll get you out that's it again 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.270
 clear up to then
