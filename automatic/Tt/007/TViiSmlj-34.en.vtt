00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.939
 what is prejudice 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.759
 What is Prejudice? 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:17.169
 the side 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.169
 that's when a person 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:21.929
 better than the other 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.640
 or do you think it's better for 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.130
 school rita 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.489
 I'm afraid a lot of people do. 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.170
 I'll give an example of how 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.370
 the kind of person who does this 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.380
 a good example 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.380
 people containing error 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.230
 the organ stands out 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.100
 your palace 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.480
 just the noise 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.620
 this distance of 1 km from the base until the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.710
 by the way the central 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.260
 for example 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 inventory 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.210
 You noticed nothing. 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.210
 yesterday the exchange spoke ill of him 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.700
 anne hathaway speaks ill of the backwoods 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.330
 the two are basically the same 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.530
 the musical prejudice 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.570
 music for people 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.680
 I saw the final what I'm going 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.630
 it's a root 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.320
 and it's a comfort 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.310
 of all forms of high pressure 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.159
 even if she did not have it, you'd hit the person's 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.500
 so you say we went and what is better than the other 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.170
 The correct would be to say that 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.710
 that song in the theater 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.710
 they do not please us 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.050
 the essence 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.600
 increasingly 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 el moutawakel araújo classical music 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.950
 we exist 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.180
 in the classic 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.180
 Note that it was not certain people 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.750
 the hurt of the people that the observed in savior 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.779
 Why did they choose 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.289
 that plays on the radio 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:13.569
 touched belly 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.649
 a neighbor heard it hard if it ended 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.219
 but if it's over 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.049
 not because I choose 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.349
 so that such a point 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.289
 when the person or 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:25.449
 if so 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.619
 in the media 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.039
 she 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.789
 at this point it is better than the people who 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:36.199
 charter flight from eurofor board 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:37.709
 if you go to see 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.579
 catch a person you like 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.579
 You ask you to arrange 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.099
 a sunny day 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.280
 the course took place 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.100
 something like that 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.149
 So I'm never going to talk or know that there is. 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:55.209
 That's why most people 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.229
 that is why the weight of institutes 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:59.089
 were signed 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.930
 in Sao Paulo 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.239
 disclosed in the media 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.679
 they're better than they were running after things I read 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.429
 that could please the tribes only took 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.609
 It's easy, you have. 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.339
 here the people our target 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.409
 What you hardly talk about 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.389
 the water usp at a time 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.339
 I wanted to say something 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:28.339
 mathis more than we create so easy 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.360
 if you can generate bpn that wants to leave because they wanted 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.639
 the professional 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.509
 It's a good day 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.509
 psd just asked 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.519
 and then you find out 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.869
 one thing that pleases you weeks 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.809
 just accepting 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.419
 both tests 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:51.149
 and it was good today 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:54.619
 tomas people 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:56.150
 than listening to others 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.429
 so many studies 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:58.809
 Victor Oliveira 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.799
 reaches 1% 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.919
 It's funny because it's as if the person does not care 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.849
 as if the music were loose 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.199
 the fun 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:09.980
 the hobby is funny you have 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.259
 billion 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:12.959
 music said 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.249
 and artists 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:16.809
 composers there you hear 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:18.509
 I'm what's spoken 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.289
 so if you ever did it technology apple created south 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:23.809
 what I like 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:26.159
 the world's greatest merit commenting 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.469
 elokobi ufra 

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:29.379
 the Portuguese 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:32.229
 eurásia did not like it 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.069
 on the other hand there were more than 100 employees 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.439
 only you get nothing in the pine forest being better than the staff in that item 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.210
 the musician different music from the other person 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.949
 against the disease 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.580
 he always gives a little 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.580
 and do this 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.270
 for affection 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.270
 nor ten minutes I have successor out 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.919
 do not do it it's good it's satisfying you meet 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:06.289
 form of expression 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.009
 within the music 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.009
 on the car swing 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.449
 for anything 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.930
 search a more selective that want it 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.520
 hand kissed to you 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.830
 I'm curious 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.830
 because the flu or fever me for example 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.650
 people who listen 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.650
 It's that guy who boots on his cell phone. 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.129
 this makes the person's head with stand-up - beyond technique 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.270
 What she does not like 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.960
 Ricardo you you your musical style and who to be pushing down the throats of the 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.619
 your possession 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:08.139
 increase your mistake 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.139
 in a tone of caution does a good thing because 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.099
 if you compare as well to the forum as the original 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:18.099
 the Rio club has practically nothing to do 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.490
 similarities are 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.800
 minimum minimum 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.800
 originally he saved over the line 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.009
 the mayor of sousa 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:33.669
 the people who do not even have to sing again 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:37.529
 - that exaggerated appeal 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.879
 sexuality 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:42.240
 more beautiful 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.339
 his expression 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:46.339
 without affecting the environment and hit 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.419
 I finally asked to speak 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:52.220
 about the show 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.800
 Lazarus 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.029
 the cups participated 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.029
 in general I do not think 

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:02.979
 Carlos then with 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.979
 more than a thousand more votes were injured 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.780
 per day 18 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.419
 the vote goes until day 20 I'm pretty sure I'll pass 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:14.999
 but it was again for those who came back to the air because 

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:17.969
 has registered in powder 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:20.740
 I confess I thought mouse 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.610
 more subscribers should vote 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.919
 almost 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.639
 approach to village donations 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.629
 by will 

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:31.379
 half the goal of gilvan 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:32.699
 it's more than likely 

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.149
 Your composition is ungrateful. 

00:07:36.149 --> 00:07:37.770
 one thing 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.050
 firm common purpose
