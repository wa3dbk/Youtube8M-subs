00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.490
 so far, the integration of turks 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.859
 Here at us higher to a degree 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.400
 failed you have to say so why 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.260
 is that so 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.670
 School classes in which 80 percent of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.950
 children do not speak German properly 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.299
 right parallel societies in the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.400
 Turks live among themselves 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.980
 they are not really responsive anymore 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.470
 are for everyone in heven yes what can you do 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.230
 make in wuppertal trying on asian 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.570
 but get somehow Turkish 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.680
 teenagers to migrant children and they 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:43.620
 itself is the proof 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:45.510
 there are also other good grades 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.100
 passable diploma pounding on it 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.289
 but again and again if they are the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.239
 juvenile advises and in contrast to 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.620
 former German social worker take 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.949
 they the exhortations of amal to 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.559
 confirms the 15-year-old palmer 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.570
 Growing up like we are 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.430
 another nationality and the one 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.010
 understands us also have the problems 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.140
 or so wuppertal vohwinkel quartier 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.090
 height in this quarter live the girls 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.430
 and boys many at the bottom of the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.869
 society every second here comes out 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.210
 an immigrant family 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.400
 one in four is hartz 4 receivers no 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.590
 good place for successful integration 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.180
 but sees social worker at asiana 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.280
 the reason for that also with the migrants 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.930
 families often decades already here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.380
 live and still hardly speak German 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.720
 fits only stay under itself already 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.369
 important that you remember that slowly 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.079
 meanwhile third fourth generation 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.180
 that yes, a part of these are company 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.860
 that they have to cooperate with theirs 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.810
 children here are big that it's important 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.700
 is an education for the children too 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.420
 to have a good school diploma 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.100
 to study 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.530
 to give you more opportunities and better ones 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.180
 have options as your parents for 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.979
 the children and adolescents beats that 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.390
 youth center in the quartier height on the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.250
 bridge between the culture of her 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.369
 families and life in germany 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.659
 she has been taking care of for a good year 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.399
 25 year old at asian especially around the 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.780
 girls from migrant families 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.460
 because they came the Germans 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.520
 social worker barely approached 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.659
 the family left 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.340
 Often the girls do not even come in 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.050
 Teenagers is once a role model they 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.360
