00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
things first let's talk about a major

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.669 
things first let's talk about a major
concern<00:00:59.420> especially<00:00:59.690> with<00:01:00.109> you<00:01:00.199> younger<00:01:00.499> guys

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
concern especially with you younger guys

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.410 
concern especially with you younger guys
and<00:01:01.219> that's<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.489> ability<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.909> get<00:01:02.059> proper

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
and that's the ability to get proper

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.240 
and that's the ability to get proper
separation<00:01:02.600> without<00:01:03.289> wrapping<00:01:03.649> for<00:01:04.010> that

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
separation without wrapping for that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.280 
separation without wrapping for that
because<00:01:04.700> as<00:01:04.910> you<00:01:05.420> know<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.750> more<00:01:05.930> you<00:01:06.050> wrap

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
because as you know the more you wrap

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.620 
because as you know the more you wrap
your<00:01:06.470> bat<00:01:06.620> the<00:01:07.550> longer<00:01:08.000> it's<00:01:08.120> going<00:01:08.300> to<00:01:08.450> tend

pitcher we can even command as fastball
so<00:01:23.690> let's<00:01:24.200> look<00:01:24.350> up<00:01:24.470> let's<00:01:25.100> look<00:01:25.250> at<00:01:25.370> his<00:01:25.520> swing

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
so let's look up let's look at his swing

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.880 
so let's look up let's look at his swing
right<00:01:25.880> here<00:01:25.910> you<00:01:26.720> notice<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.260> this<00:01:27.440> swing<00:01:27.680> at

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
right here you notice that this swing at

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.180 
right here you notice that this swing at
the<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.370> set<00:01:28.960> separation<00:01:29.960> at<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.620> process<00:01:31.070> of

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
the the set separation at the process of

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.800 
the the set separation at the process of
separation<00:01:31.610> where<00:01:31.820> he<00:01:31.880> gets<00:01:31.970> his<00:01:32.210> hands<00:01:32.570> back

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
separation where he gets his hands back

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.450 
separation where he gets his hands back
so<00:01:33.410> that<00:01:33.530> he<00:01:33.620> can<00:01:33.740> use<00:01:33.770> his<00:01:33.950> hips<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.250> close

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
so that he can use his hips to close

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.070 
so that he can use his hips to close
hands<00:01:34.760> to<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.090> zone<00:01:35.300> he<00:01:35.690> doesn't<00:01:35.960> have<00:01:36.050> a

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
hands to the zone he doesn't have a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.210 
hands to the zone he doesn't have a
little<00:01:36.200> bit<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.440> a<00:01:36.470> wrap<00:01:36.650> right<00:01:36.950> if<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.100> look

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
little bit of a wrap right if you look

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.550 
little bit of a wrap right if you look
at<00:01:37.340> his<00:01:37.430> bat<00:01:37.610> head<00:01:37.790> it's<00:01:38.000> angled<00:01:38.540> away<00:01:38.930> from

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
at his bat head it's angled away from

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.640 
at his bat head it's angled away from
his<00:01:39.680> hands<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.150> fine<00:01:41.570> this<00:01:42.260> gives

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
his hands this is fine this gives

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.880 
his hands this is fine this gives
hitters<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.520> little<00:01:43.970> bit<00:01:44.060> more<00:01:44.240> leverage<00:01:44.890> and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
hitters a little bit more leverage and

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.040 
hitters a little bit more leverage and
it<00:01:46.010> gives<00:01:46.250> space<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.480> bat<00:01:47.630> head<00:01:47.780> can

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
it gives space so that the bat head can

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.200 
it gives space so that the bat head can
travel<00:01:48.410> through<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.770> zone<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.400> then<00:01:49.730> create

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
travel through the zone and then create

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.350 
travel through the zone and then create
that<00:01:50.300> torque<00:01:50.690> before<00:01:51.290> point<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.370> contact<00:01:52.820> but

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
that torque before point of contact but

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.190 
that torque before point of contact but
here's<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.930> thing

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
here's the thing

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.440 
here's the thing
what<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.650> want<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.010> avoid<00:01:55.250> as<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> hitter<00:01:55.790> is

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
what you want to avoid as a hitter is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.510 
what you want to avoid as a hitter is
you<00:01:56.690> want<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:56.960> avoid<00:01:57.110> having<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:57.980> bat<00:01:58.220> head

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
you want to avoid having that bat head

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.940 
you want to avoid having that bat head
wrap<00:01:59.240> so<00:01:59.570> much<00:01:59.780> that<00:02:00.050> it's<00:02:00.200> almost<00:02:00.320> parallel

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
wrap so much that it's almost parallel

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.380 
wrap so much that it's almost parallel
to<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.220> ground<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:01.670> if<00:02:01.730> you<00:02:01.850> look<00:02:01.970> at<00:02:02.060> his<00:02:02.210> back

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
to the ground so if you look at his back

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.940 
to the ground so if you look at his back
head<00:02:02.570> that's<00:02:03.020> about<00:02:03.290> as<00:02:03.410> far<00:02:03.560> as<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.800> wraps

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
head that's about as far as it wraps

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.290 
head that's about as far as it wraps
right<00:02:04.160> there<00:02:04.370> before<00:02:04.670> it<00:02:04.730> starts<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.090> get<00:02:05.180> on

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
right there before it starts to get on

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.000 
right there before it starts to get on
the<00:02:05.390> play<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.720> pitch<00:02:05.930> if<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.650> were<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.890> go

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
the play of the pitch if you were to go

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.830 
the play of the pitch if you were to go
down<00:02:07.040> more<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:07.670> get<00:02:07.880> parallel<00:02:08.300> that's<00:02:08.539> when

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
down more and get parallel that's when

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.050 
down more and get parallel that's when
you<00:02:09.409> can<00:02:09.560> find<00:02:09.769> yourself<00:02:10.039> in<00:02:10.129> trouble<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:10.939> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
you can find yourself in trouble so the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.030 
you can find yourself in trouble so the
