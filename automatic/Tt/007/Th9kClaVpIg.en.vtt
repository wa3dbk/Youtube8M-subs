pretty<00:01:51.469> huge<00:01:51.829> in<00:01:52.039> 3.2<00:01:52.549> power<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.689> it's<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.899> glass

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
pretty huge in 3.2 power so it's a glass

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.109 
pretty huge in 3.2 power so it's a glass
cannon<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.740> know<00:01:54.889> not<00:01:55.249> very<00:01:55.399> much<00:01:55.549> health<00:01:55.789> my

cannon you know not very much health my
lights<00:01:56.329> off<00:01:56.509> let's<00:01:56.719> look<00:01:56.779> at<00:01:56.959> that<00:01:57.999> let's<00:01:58.999> have

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
lights off let's look at that let's have

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.639 
lights off let's look at that let's have
a<00:01:59.119> look<00:01:59.240> at<00:01:59.359> my<00:01:59.450> traits<00:01:59.749> and<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:00.200> skills<00:02:00.469> are

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
a look at my traits and the skills are

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.219 
a look at my traits and the skills are
to<00:02:00.889> that<00:02:01.100> Shiva

so<00:02:03.229> yeah<00:02:03.409> I'm<00:02:03.679> ten<00:02:04.100> thirty<00:02:04.670> thirty<00:02:05.240> now<00:02:06.049> I

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
so yeah I'm ten thirty thirty now I

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.589 
so yeah I'm ten thirty thirty now I
increase<00:02:07.310> damage<00:02:07.759> depending<00:02:08.240> on<00:02:08.300> how<00:02:08.479> much

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
increase damage depending on how much

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.690 
increase damage depending on how much
adrenaline<00:02:09.110> you've<00:02:09.229> got<00:02:09.440> because<00:02:09.890> 12<00:02:10.399> percent

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
adrenaline you've got because 12 percent

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.940 
adrenaline you've got because 12 percent
more<00:02:10.849> damage<00:02:10.880> if<00:02:11.510> I've<00:02:11.690> got<00:02:11.870> full<00:02:12.260> adrenaline

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
more damage if I've got full adrenaline

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.440 
more damage if I've got full adrenaline
from<00:02:13.220> Berserker<00:02:13.670> stance<00:02:13.910> when<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.120> open<00:02:14.420> it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
from Berserker stance when I open it

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.480 
from Berserker stance when I open it
with<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.660> kill<00:02:14.870> shot<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.319> ten<00:02:16.190> percent<00:02:16.280> more

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
with a kill shot and ten percent more

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.220 
with a kill shot and ten percent more
damage<00:02:16.550> from<00:02:16.849> our<00:02:17.000> main<00:02:17.150> mark<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.020> scales

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
damage from our main mark so it scales

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.910 
damage from our main mark so it scales
really<00:02:18.440> well

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
really well

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.370

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
I mean arm 3 which is precision and

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.820 
I mean arm 3 which is precision and

and<00:02:37.070> creates<00:02:37.370> because<00:02:37.490> vulnerabilities<00:02:38.150> so

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
and creates because vulnerabilities so

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.780 
and creates because vulnerabilities so
strong<00:02:38.600> at<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.780> moment<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.670> rifle<00:02:40.670> and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
journaling you know my adrenaline stage

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.790 
journaling you know my adrenaline stage
so<00:02:59.270> yeah<00:02:59.510> it's<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.810> wasteful<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:00.470> avoids<00:03:00.709> got

the extra nine percent trip I'm using

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.180 
the extra nine percent trip I'm using
sweet<00:03:03.980> revenge<00:03:04.160> just<00:03:04.670> because<00:03:04.970> if<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.300> do<00:03:06.190> you

and<00:03:11.350> burst<00:03:12.350> skills<00:03:12.650> cussed<00:03:13.010> less<00:03:13.300> because

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
and burst skills cussed less because

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.040 
and burst skills cussed less because
it's<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.510> no-brainer
