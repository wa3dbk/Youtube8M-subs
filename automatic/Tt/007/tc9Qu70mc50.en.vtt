conservation<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.489> behavior<00:01:05.910> of<00:01:06.030> lines<00:01:06.240> yeah

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
conservation and behavior of lines yeah

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.790 
conservation and behavior of lines yeah
and<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.240> situation<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.229> Lions<00:01:10.590> as

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
and so as the situation for the Lions as

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.430 
and so as the situation for the Lions as
a<00:01:10.830> species<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.940> in<00:01:12.090> Africa<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.050> threatened

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
a species here in Africa as a threatened

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.969 
a species here in Africa as a threatened
is<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.640> mean<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.479> big<00:01:15.720> problem<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.380> now

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
is it I mean it's a big problem or now

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.770 
is it I mean it's a big problem or now
we're<00:01:17.220> very<00:01:17.250> concerned<00:01:17.640> about<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.240> lines<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
we're very concerned about the lines the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.570 
we're very concerned about the lines the
numbers<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.380> been<00:01:19.410> defining<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.100> lot<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
numbers have been defining a lot of the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.060 
numbers have been defining a lot of the
last<00:01:20.759> two<00:01:20.940> decades<00:01:21.200> many<00:01:22.200> countries<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
last two decades many countries the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.940 
last two decades many countries the
Lions<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.520> Asia<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.820> an<00:01:23.940> extinct<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.920> big

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
Lions of Asia to an extinct so the big

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
Lions of Asia to an extinct so the big
threat<00:01:26.399> is<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.940> fact<00:01:27.149> that<00:01:27.210> human<00:01:27.630> beings<00:01:27.930> as

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
threat is the fact that human beings as

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.870 
threat is the fact that human beings as
the<00:01:28.290> numbers<00:01:28.619> increase<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.729> more

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the numbers increase they have more

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.550 
the numbers increase they have more
livestock<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:31.080> they're<00:01:31.200> come<00:01:31.350> into

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
livestock and then they're come into

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.960 
livestock and then they're come into
conflict<00:01:31.800> with<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.190> Lions<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> with

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
conflict with the Lions and the with

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.400 
conflict with the Lions and the with
Alliance<00:01:33.360> come<00:01:33.509> anywhere<00:01:33.869> near<00:01:33.930> their<00:01:34.200> cows

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
Alliance come anywhere near their cows

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.350 
Alliance come anywhere near their cows
they<00:01:34.619> go<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.830> kill<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.190> lines<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.330> is

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
they go and kill the lines so this is

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.690 
they go and kill the lines so this is
the<00:01:36.600> big<00:01:36.810> big<00:01:37.050> problem<00:01:37.170> i'll<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.580> be

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the big big problem i'll be going to be

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.730 
the big big problem i'll be going to be
ski<00:01:38.910> or<00:01:39.149> hula<00:01:39.450> scales<00:01:39.780> come<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.320> us<00:01:40.410> and<00:01:40.590> our

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
ski or hula scales come on us and our

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.240 
ski or hula scales come on us and our
reward<00:01:43.910> but<00:01:44.910> what's<00:01:45.240> your<00:01:45.420> take<00:01:45.660> on<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:45.959> if

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
reward but what's your take on this if

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.240 
reward but what's your take on this if
the<00:01:47.250> parks<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:48.270> mainly<00:01:48.950> tourist<00:01:49.950> traps

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the parks are just mainly tourist traps

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.430 
the parks are just mainly tourist traps
or<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.030> actually<00:01:51.240> preserving<00:01:52.020> the

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
or is are you actually preserving the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.499 
or is are you actually preserving the
wildlife<00:01:52.890> within<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.429> reserve<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:54.360> in

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
wildlife within this reserve now in

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.330 
wildlife within this reserve now in
these<00:01:54.690> small<00:01:54.899> pox<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.590> visited<00:01:56.009> volka

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
these small pox like you visited volka

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.070 
these small pox like you visited volka

are they for tourism but also they have
a<00:02:00.929> large<00:02:01.560> conservation<00:02:02.280> potential<00:02:02.819> benefit

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
a large conservation potential benefit

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.469 
a large conservation potential benefit
and<00:02:04.020> by<00:02:04.229> working<00:02:04.979> with<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.850> genetics<00:02:06.330> of

and by working with the the genetics of

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.719 
and by working with the the genetics of
the<00:02:06.569> lines<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.050> managing<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.590> genetics<00:02:08.100> we

the lines and managing the genetics we

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.460 
the lines and managing the genetics we
can<00:02:08.910> keep<00:02:09.119> them<00:02:09.390> healthy<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.349> make

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
can keep them healthy and we can make

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.070 
can keep them healthy and we can make
them<00:02:10.679> up<00:02:10.860> much<00:02:11.039> more<00:02:11.069> conservation<00:02:11.580> value<00:02:12.150> no

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
them up much more conservation value no

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.220 
them up much more conservation value no
I<00:02:13.110> don't<00:02:13.470> think<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:13.709> sorry<00:02:14.490> 7<00:02:14.880> 11pm<00:02:15.360> I'm<00:02:16.020> think
