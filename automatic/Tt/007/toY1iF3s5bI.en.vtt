00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.120
 I'll show you the new ones 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.219
 receiver of teeth the ego ze 32 15 for 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.750
 we will now see the bmw 3 series 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.490
 times the setup menu 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.039
 we have to go to the second page 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.529
 Let's go there when we get here 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.170
 Press the top of the button or we will 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.510
 simply slide the screen easily 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.789
 move your finger to a point 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.270
 which is not a button and then drag 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.520
 So we come to the second page there 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.890
 we can press setup and come 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.520
 in a menu where we four things to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.730
 selection once have video settings 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 audio general setting still diverse 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.340
 different attitude 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.620
 Let's start with the video 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.440
 attitudes to there we can the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.230
 brightness of the display once regulate 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.449
 for the day view and once for the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.309
 night view on the second page 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.109
 Of course we can also do things 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.000
 adjust the platform at the device 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.610
 we are quite new and indeed we have one 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.380
 day menu and 1 night menu the day mini 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.450
 is characterized by the fact that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.760
 it is brighter than the night menu it is 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.159
 white so we just deposited one 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.220
 better representation in day have to go 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.659
 Let's see it then at night 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.240
 we already have the skin for the night 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.340
 view that I can be happy even 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 show in the main menu or in the radio 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.930
 the menu will be like this at night 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.850
 Look is not so easy intense 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.900
 especially for longer motorway rides in 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.020
 It's very interesting that way at night 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.329
 back to the setup menu to our video 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.570
 attitude we put here first 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.619
 the day mode again 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.229
 here we have another one 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.509
 function which is called standby there 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.210
 we can make the tft screen easy 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.070
 then show it off again 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.170
 activate 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.729
 we just press on the touchscreen 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.880
 on it and then of course, I'm back in 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.159
 device in it 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.409
 Under the motto we have different 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.520
 settings for volume so the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.590
 volume initially state volume with it 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.480
 is volume meant the set 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.350
 is when we get the vehicle or the device 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.050
 start 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.770
 here we can also do the stadium 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.140
 to adjust 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.580
 either a certain volume or 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.410
 we can just be the last 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.590
 loud we last heard 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.600
 I have the attitude for traffic 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.340
 traffic radio as to be loud 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.630
 the na'vi agree how loud his 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.370
 should and so on 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.560
 here we can still different 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.520
 adjust sources for example for radio 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.100
 usb ipod volume and of course for 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.350
 audio video we volume we have 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.210
 a small equalizer where we have the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.990
 can adjust errors from the front to 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.410
 lay back or balance from left to right 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.390
 right 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.980
 in the setup we can also do one 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.990
 Adjust levels and if we continue 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.000
 we can also go down if so 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.460
 you have an original sound system 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.430
 here also the level on and off 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.090
 adjust the device to the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.610
 soundsystem adapts in the menu item general 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.800
 Can we adjust if that 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.630
 keystrokes tizen should sound like that 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:19.730
 then it will be more like most of them 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.730
 interested in how to exhibit it 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.120
 then we have the menu item driving aids 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.520
 if we can have a parking aid 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.500
 we do this with our bmw 3s too 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.690
 optically visualize or over the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.100
 activate camera 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.620
 Now we go back to the menu 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.510
 general and under language we can 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.910
 then choose a language in that 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.930
 menu appears and a language for the 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.950
 voice control of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.450
 Handsfree among diverse 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.630
 we find different settings 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.800
 for example, that we too 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.770
 custom settings 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.860
 can save a usb-stick that is 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.350
 useful before an update 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.740
 We can then transfer our data via 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.470
 Import usb and already uses that 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.120
 gets back to our old values 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.340
 For example, we can still provide security 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.380
 to set a theft protection that 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.960
 we think superior to give us a code 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.609
 the long one when the device stolen 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.320
 should be the thief then one 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.420
 of course, do not enter this code 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.640
 has over the function 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.500
 Can we cover the device we can 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.020
 for example the bluetooth software 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.800
 update when a new phone is on 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.800
 the market is coming
