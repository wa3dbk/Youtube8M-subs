00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
bad planning the backup video camera was

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.160 
bad planning the backup video camera was
taped<00:05:43.640> to<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:43.970> top<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:44.360> for<00:05:44.540> you<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.990> main

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
taped to the top and for you the main

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.300 
taped to the top and for you the main
video<00:05:45.350> cameras<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:45.830> whole<00:05:45.890> thing<00:05:46.160> went

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
video cameras the whole thing went

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.450 
video cameras the whole thing went
crashing<00:05:46.640> down<00:05:47.260> it<00:05:48.260> sheared<00:05:48.590> off<00:05:48.740> there<00:05:49.040> the

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
crashing down it sheared off there the

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.230 
crashing down it sheared off there the
tripod<00:05:49.880> mount<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:50.800> so<00:05:51.800> we<00:05:52.060> resorted<00:05:53.060> to<00:05:53.090> using

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
tripod mount and so we resorted to using

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.600 
tripod mount and so we resorted to using
tape

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
tape

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.309 
tape
I<00:05:55.639> think<00:05:56.210> we<00:05:56.270> missed<00:05:56.509> videoing<00:05:56.900> about<00:05:57.139> two

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
I think we missed videoing about two

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.770 
I think we missed videoing about two
laps<00:05:57.530> of<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:57.860> so<00:05:58.310> Guinness<00:06:01.389> record<00:06:02.389> that's<00:06:02.599> not

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
laps of it so Guinness record that's not

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.869 
laps of it so Guinness record that's not
a<00:06:02.810> problem<00:06:03.020> because<00:06:03.259> we<00:06:06.310> so<00:06:07.310> that<00:06:07.789> was

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:07.879
