so<00:01:46.600> I<00:01:46.630> think<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.200> two<00:01:47.380> boys<00:01:47.680> are<00:01:48.250> good<00:01:48.610> match

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
so I think the two boys are good match

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.690 
so I think the two boys are good match
they<00:01:49.270> really<00:01:49.600> fit<00:01:49.900> each<00:01:50.230> other<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:51.040> good

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700
