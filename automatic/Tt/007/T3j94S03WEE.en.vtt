00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:56.640
 gardening and it's not perfect that I 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:00.240
 want to put it in general then no 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.280

 keywords garden 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.259
 have a beautiful garden 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.710
 that's for you key words what I'm you 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.020
 advise the best is to go see 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.660
 on amazon directly the books that get 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.040
 already sell in the field in your 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.250
 domain and you just take the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.470
 keywords they are on the page so there 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.240
 you will put a little bit 3 3 words 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.000
 key know that the more words you put 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.890
 keys - you will have impact on everyone 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.900
 keywords however if you put 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.700
 for example of keywords well you go 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.360
 have a lot more influence on these 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.770
 two keywords then select one 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.290
 option publication so I want to publish 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.000
 my book now there is then 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.980
 here we are offered to send a 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.630
 cover then you can click on 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.330
 look for an image to go on 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.980
 your computer to find an image 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.090
 otherwise what you do you launch the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.290
 cover creator and you go 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.840
 to be able to create your cover 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.370
 good it's not very thorough but 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.190
 here it is rather not bad for 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.510
 start it's fine then there you have 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.500
 the choice be you can choose not to 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.080
 not enable rights management 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.030
 digital and where the act iv then what 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.040
 is the difference is pretty much so 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.269
 you do not activate it well actually 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.310
 someone who will have it I was yours 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:22.769
 books to download multiple 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.600
 times per program 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.769
 amazon kdp on the other hand if you activate 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.290
 digital rights management a 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.890
 only time can not eg 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.120
 share this book with for example a 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.500
 friend for example it's his family late 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.360
 this is me I prefer not to act it 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.480
 because it's like if you buy a 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.130
 book in celebration and that you could not 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.390
 lend it a friend agree it's up to you 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.950
 to see what you prefer 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.489
 so now you click on 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.250
 search for your file 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.260
 either word or pdf or by your file 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.820
 pdf that you have done either on word or 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.820
 either on the indesign software 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.430
 So here once you clicked 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.800
 look for you go get the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.300
 file of your book you click on 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.090
 save continue here here ask me 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.450
 to take a book so where is that 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.310
 I will take 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.310
 I saw someone pay deficit up the 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:26.370
 continue with these fags so there he 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.890
 converted to kindle then as 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.240
 it's still being converted and 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.660
 well you click well here it is 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.470
 completed 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:39.330
 you click save and 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.710
 continue then put here now we 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.940
 let's just see everything that 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.150
 is compared here to the right and 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.990
 price then international rights yes 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.840
 you have all the international rights 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.850
 and here you are asked to establish a 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.500
 price then either you decide to sell 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.990
 a euro in this case you are obliged to 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.850
 put a 35% fee that is to say 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.680
 that you only earn 35% of its price 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:04.430
 of sale and you can set it to zero 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:06.570
 dollars 99 meters a comma 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.080
 and so that's what they see 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.090
 nearly 29 30 cents in France 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.490
 no it's equivalent here's 99 cents in 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.990
 France and you touch 28 cents 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.010
 for example a second point fr you 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.160
 touch 33 cents 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.430
 ok if you want a 70% fee 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.000
 you have to put it at least at 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.370
 $ 3,012 99 1 3 dollar 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.930
 so if you put your ebook at $ 3 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.610
 so you win with a fee to 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.820
 70% 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.260
 you win about 1 euro 97 ok so 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.650
 what is still very very very 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.050
 interestingly know that if you 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.370
 choose to sell your ebook on by 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.070
 example another platform 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.280
 well, just know that you're going 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.950
 win 80 % instead of 70% agree because 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.720
 that basically the tax on taxes on 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:59.370
 books on ebooks that are exchanged 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.780
 is the two roughly 20% so here 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.860
 you go down if you want to change the 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.530
 price 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.300
 on amazon.fr uncheck this box 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:11.150
 and you put for example here wanted 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:14.520
 let it be 3.3 europe he sees there ok 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.969

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.250

 book your ebook is going to be on amazon 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.099
 So, if you want to receive my 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.539
 advice 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.580
