 Wu Kequn - Monkey 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:14.420
 Word: Wu Kequn Qu: Wu Kequn 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.451
 So the carnival is so messy 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.081
 Because I dare not face 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.691
 Facing the darkness of the heart 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.641
 Facing an empty quilt 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.381
 I sing my throat and want to drive away the loneliness. 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.121
 Try to get drunk and numb all feelings 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:11.991
 But loneliness is like reincarnation over and over again. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.271
 In the end, no one can escape 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.401
 I am fooling around with the night. 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.511
 I know how small I am. 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.501
 I am no longer important, how important 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:43.451
 Dilute my boredom with alcohol, I am bored 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.961
 So carnival is so messy 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.171
 Because I dare not face 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.011
 Facing the darkness of the heart 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.961
 Facing an empty quilt 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.471
 I sing my throat and want to drive away the loneliness. 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.611
 Try to get drunk and numb all feelings 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.261
 But loneliness is like reincarnation over and over again. 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.431
 In the end, no one can escape 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.771
 I am fooling around with the night. 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.811
 I know how small I am. 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.851
 I am no longer important, how important 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.551
 Dilute my boredom with alcohol 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.161
 I am fooling around with the night. 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.181
 I want to forget, I can’t forget it. 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.211
 How important are you to me? 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:51.011
 I used to hold it, but it’s ridiculous to let me go. 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.451
 I am fooling around with the night. 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.541
 I know how small I am. 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.601
 I am no longer important, how important 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.081
 Dilute my boredom with alcohol 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.731
 I am fooling around with the night. 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.731
 I want to forget, I can’t forget it. 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.931
 How important are you to me? 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:46.031
 I used to hold it, but it’s ridiculous to let me go.
