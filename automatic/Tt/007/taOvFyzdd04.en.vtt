anyway<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.170> we'll<00:03:22.290> try<00:03:22.440> something<00:03:22.739> different

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
anyway and we'll try something different

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.740 
anyway and we'll try something different
you<00:03:23.129> can<00:03:23.250> try<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.549> just<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.420> thing<00:03:24.569> is<00:03:24.720> to

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
you can try it just the thing is to

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.289 
you can try it just the thing is to
remember<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.920> body<00:03:26.159> naturally<00:03:26.579> cycles

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
remember that the body naturally cycles

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.599 
remember that the body naturally cycles
through<00:03:27.769> 90-minute<00:03:28.769> REM<00:03:28.950> cycles<00:03:29.400> when<00:03:29.519> you

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
through 90-minute REM cycles when you

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.759 
through 90-minute REM cycles when you
sleep<00:03:29.849> so<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.090> means<00:03:30.390> if<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.079> sleep<00:03:31.319> doesn't

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
sleep so that means if you sleep doesn't

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.580 
sleep so that means if you sleep doesn't
