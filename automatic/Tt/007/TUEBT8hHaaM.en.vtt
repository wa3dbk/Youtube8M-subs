00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.010 

right<00:00:49.820> maybe<00:00:50.820> better<00:00:51.000> stood<00:00:51.600> up<00:00:51.750> yeah

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.020 

well<00:00:56.770> that<00:00:56.920> flipped<00:00:57.220> over<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.610> other<00:00:57.790> way<00:00:57.970> so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
well that flipped over the other way so

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.240 
well that flipped over the other way so
the<00:00:58.390> wheels<00:00:58.840> are<00:00:59.110> at<00:00:59.200> the<00:00:59.290> top<00:00:59.530> lot<00:00:59.890> of<00:01:00.070> things

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
the wheels are at the top lot of things

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.520 
the wheels are at the top lot of things
but<00:01:00.490> there's<00:01:01.390> all<00:01:01.570> kind<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.810> twisting<00:01:02.410> into

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
but there's all kind of twisting into

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:12.660 
but there's all kind of twisting into
the<00:01:02.860> involved

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.359 

had<00:01:13.670> more<00:01:13.880> operations<00:01:14.509> to<00:01:14.810> get<00:01:15.220> all<00:01:16.220> right

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
had more operations to get all right

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:27.870 
had more operations to get all right
that's<00:01:16.759> okay

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.990

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
going to have this car for much longer

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.430 
going to have this car for much longer
I'm<00:04:05.940> probably<00:04:06.090> going<00:04:06.300> to<00:04:06.360> be<00:04:06.420> getting<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.750> car

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
I'm probably going to be getting a car

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.920 
I'm probably going to be getting a car
the<00:04:07.590> bigger<00:04:07.800> poot<00:04:08.040> so<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:09.480> know<00:04:09.600> I'll<00:04:09.720> be<00:04:09.750> a

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
the bigger poot so you know I'll be a

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:19.699 
the bigger poot so you know I'll be a
maybe<00:04:10.710> struggling<00:04:11.250> for<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.460> little<00:04:11.700> bit<00:04:11.850> but

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.420 

you<00:04:20.130> know<00:04:20.340> I<00:04:21.620> think<00:04:22.620> I'll<00:04:22.860> just<00:04:22.889> have<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.250> start

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
you know I think I'll just have to start

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:36.820 
you know I think I'll just have to start
walking<00:04:23.610> everywhere

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.409 

valuable<00:04:37.729> time<00:04:38.060> maybe<00:04:38.659> I<00:04:39.229> did<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:39.830> differently

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
valuable time maybe I did it differently

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:54.110 
valuable time maybe I did it differently
no<00:04:41.750> course<00:04:42.319> not

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:14.540 

is<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.139> double<00:04:55.320> unique<00:04:55.980> yeah<00:04:56.880> yeah

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.450 

and<00:05:15.550> then<00:05:15.670> we've<00:05:15.790> still<00:05:15.910> got<00:05:16.210> some<00:05:16.240> room<00:05:16.660> I

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
and then we've still got some room I

stomach<00:05:21.160> fit<00:05:21.400> yeah<00:05:22.300> in<00:05:23.050> which<00:05:23.260> place<00:05:23.470> would

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
stomach fit yeah in which place would

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.610 
stomach fit yeah in which place would
probably<00:05:24.280> be

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.510 

we<00:05:27.000> deployed<00:05:28.169> so<00:05:29.169> this<00:05:29.740> is<00:05:29.919> what<00:05:30.100> I<00:05:30.130> would<00:05:30.250> want
