00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.880
 podlagivaniya because a lot there 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:23.270
 I shoved into frames and therefore will 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:31.729
 little podlagivaet so move on to 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:34.789
 our day itself say with ours this 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.090
 we have a stand like this 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:44.329
 such signs and inscriptions are simple 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:47.270
 we will diesel vegas right here with us 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.810
 you see the road but I will make my 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:57.159
 the city and so the road starts here at 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:03.469
 us park 5 style night places for cars 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:08.030
 for 4 for affairs of course I just said 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:09.860
 I do so further here we go itself 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.490
 column 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.100
 above we have a big inscription lukoil and 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:22.100
 varnish of Belarus 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:28.170
 so what do we do next here we see that 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:32.880
 we are such speakers here for example here 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:37.470
 we serve us written guests and that's not 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:43.800
 i mean make these hoses and so 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:47.280
 I will break with such a decorative type 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.170
 hose over here we have a gun 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:56.990
 to insert the machine to direct it 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:00.930
 everything is the same here 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.850
 so that we have a little fire 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.360
 will be ours to immediately take the sand and 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.060
 fall asleep carefree and put out the fire 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.340
 everything is the same here with only this 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.570
 flashlights went wrong but it 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.560
 fixed cope and as i said 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.140
 I will do more 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.650
 instead of the earth here this one is stone 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.910
 blocks 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.560
 so further now we go to the very 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:33.209
 patient flag on the moon what because 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.580
 flying teeth to believe in each other 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:41.459

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:03.799
