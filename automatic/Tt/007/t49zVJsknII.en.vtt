recording genius this was also kind of

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.540 
recording genius this was also kind of
his<00:00:21.390> idea<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.990> obviously<00:00:22.980> we<00:00:23.130> needed<00:00:23.400> two

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
his idea and obviously we needed two

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.779 
his idea and obviously we needed two
people<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.029> kind<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.539> make<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.720> work<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.609> did

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
people to kind of make it work so we did

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.580 
people to kind of make it work so we did
this<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.480> seven<00:00:27.810> days<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.140> fact<00:00:28.320> less

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
this in just seven days in fact less

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.910 
this in just seven days in fact less
than<00:00:28.800> seven<00:00:29.070> days<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.960> well<00:00:30.960> basically<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.710> is

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
than seven days and well basically it is

than seven days and well basically it is
a<00:00:31.949> drum<00:00:32.369> sequencer<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> ipad<00:00:33.540> i<00:00:33.750> guess

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
a drum sequencer for the ipad i guess

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200 
a drum sequencer for the ipad i guess
you<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.410> tell<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.649> right<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.579> would<00:00:36.180> you

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
we're ok now I have this set 120 we'll

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.400 
we're ok now I have this set 120 we'll
go<00:01:28.780> slow<00:01:29.020> that<00:01:29.200> down<00:01:29.230> actually<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:30.040> start<00:01:30.310> with

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
go slow that down actually to start with

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.320 
go slow that down actually to start with
100<00:01:32.410> BPM<00:01:33.010> keep<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.490> nice<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.670> slow<00:01:34.000> nice<00:01:34.270> and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
100 BPM keep it nice and slow nice and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:47.760 
100 BPM keep it nice and slow nice and
steady<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:34.810> here<00:01:34.960> we<00:01:35.050> go<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.880> bad<00:01:46.060> eh<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:47.560> then

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
steady so here we go not bad eh now then

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.680 
steady so here we go not bad eh now then
let's<00:01:48.010> see<00:01:48.250> what<00:01:48.670> else<00:01:48.700> we<00:01:49.000> can<00:01:49.090> just<00:01:49.270> open

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
let's see what else we can just open

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.600 
let's see what else we can just open
tempo<00:01:50.050> now<00:01:50.590> we<00:01:50.650> haven't<00:01:51.070> quite<00:01:51.160> figured<00:01:51.400> out<00:01:51.550> a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
tempo now we haven't quite figured out a

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.880 
tempo now we haven't quite figured out a
way<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.790> up<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.270> tempo<00:01:52.560> while<00:01:53.560> it's<00:01:53.770> still

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
way to up the tempo while it's still

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.770 
way to up the tempo while it's still
playing<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:54.190> you<00:01:54.310> have<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.580> stop<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.030> restart

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
playing so you have to stop and restart

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.590 
playing so you have to stop and restart
but<00:01:56.200> we'll<00:01:56.620> get<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:56.860> working<00:01:57.390> here<00:01:58.390> we<00:01:58.479> go

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
but we'll get that working here we go

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
but we'll get that working here we go
faster<00:01:59.080> version<00:02:11.250> not<00:02:12.250> bad<00:02:12.400> eh<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.500> might

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
faster version not bad eh so you might

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.710 
faster version not bad eh so you might
pick<00:02:14.830> up<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.160> looks<00:02:15.370> great<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.820> we<00:02:16.390> think<00:02:16.600> it

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
pick up that looks great and we think it

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.900 
pick up that looks great and we think it
is<00:02:16.810> Breslow<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.680> new<00:02:17.980> stuff<00:02:18.190> coming<00:02:18.220> belt<00:02:18.670> for

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
is Breslow the new stuff coming belt for

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.580 
is Breslow the new stuff coming belt for
example<00:02:19.600> right<00:02:19.750> now<00:02:19.780> we<00:02:19.990> only<00:02:20.020> have<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.320> one

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
example right now we only have a one

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.560 
example right now we only have a one
drum<00:02:20.890> kit<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.820> can<00:02:21.940> see<00:02:22.030> we<00:02:22.150> have<00:02:22.180> no

preferences at all obviously we wanted

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.250 
preferences at all obviously we wanted
to<00:02:25.989> get<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.200> out<00:02:26.320> within<00:02:26.530> 7<00:02:26.739> days<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.430> we<00:02:28.260> took

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
to get this out within 7 days so we took

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.050 
to get this out within 7 days so we took
the<00:02:29.380> decision<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.800> make<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.250> kind<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.820> very

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the decision to make it kind of a very

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.509 
the decision to make it kind of a very
simple<00:02:31.450> drum<00:02:31.660> sequencer<00:02:31.840> but<00:02:32.470> coming<00:02:33.340> in

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
simple drum sequencer but coming in

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.380 
simple drum sequencer but coming in
future<00:02:34.150> versions<00:02:34.300> are<00:02:35.170> things<00:02:35.590> like

future versions are things like

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.300 
future versions are things like

volume control but we can also give you
bill<00:03:16.810> te<00:03:17.010> obviously<00:03:18.010> wants<00:03:18.160> it's<00:03:18.519> not

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
bill te obviously wants it's not

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.910 
bill te obviously wants it's not
implemented<00:03:19.480> but<00:03:19.570> if<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.780> hold<00:03:20.200> down<00:03:20.290> over<00:03:20.680> a

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
implemented but if you hold down over a

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.780 
implemented but if you hold down over a
drum<00:03:21.310> icon<00:03:21.750> like<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:24.130> will<00:03:24.280> probably<00:03:24.519> get

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
drum icon like so you will probably get

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.490 
drum icon like so you will probably get
we<00:03:25.239> haven't<00:03:25.420> quite<00:03:25.510> decided<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.109> best<00:03:26.139> way<00:03:26.380> to

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
we haven't quite decided the best way to

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.900 
we haven't quite decided the best way to
implement<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:27.040> probably<00:03:27.280> go<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.489> popover

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
implement but probably go to a popover

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.090 
implement but probably go to a popover
which<00:03:28.540> will<00:03:28.720> let<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.930> choose<00:03:29.139> even<00:03:29.560> mute<00:03:29.799> so

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
which will let you choose even mute so

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.930 
which will let you choose even mute so
you<00:03:30.190> can<00:03:30.310> actually<00:03:30.430> mute

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
you can actually mute

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.700 
you can actually mute
say<00:03:31.660> for<00:03:31.810> example<00:03:31.840> were<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.320> get<00:03:32.440> rid<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.620> this

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
say for example were to get rid of this

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.020 
say for example were to get rid of this
track<00:03:32.980> here<00:03:33.190> we<00:03:33.340> actually<00:03:33.640> move<00:03:33.850> that

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
track here we actually move that

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.320 
track here we actually move that
entirely<00:03:34.390> with<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.260> nice<00:03:35.410> can<00:03:35.680> afraid<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:37.180> can

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
entirely with a nice can afraid you can

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.870 
entirely with a nice can afraid you can
solo<00:03:37.630> it's<00:03:37.900> over<00:03:38.200> everything<00:03:38.590> else<00:03:38.830> is<00:03:39.130> me<00:03:39.760> to

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
solo it's over everything else is me to

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.960 
solo it's over everything else is me to
depart<00:03:40.120> from<00:03:40.210> this<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:41.350> can<00:03:41.560> clear<00:03:41.830> it

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
depart from this and you can clear it

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.280 
depart from this and you can clear it
also<00:03:42.970> by<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.210> way<00:03:43.240> we<00:03:43.420> can<00:03:43.600> afford<00:03:43.840> well<00:03:44.020> let's

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
also by the way we can afford well let's

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.960 
also by the way we can afford well let's
have<00:03:44.410> some<00:03:44.620> fun<00:03:44.800> with<00:03:44.980> Vivid<00:03:45.310> shake<00:03:45.520> gestures

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
have some fun with Vivid shake gestures

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.610 
have some fun with Vivid shake gestures
so<00:03:46.360> you'll<00:03:46.480> bear<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.750> shake<00:03:46.990> to<00:03:47.230> clear<00:03:47.440> the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
so you'll bear to shake to clear the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.160 
so you'll bear to shake to clear the
whole<00:03:47.860> thing<00:03:48.220> like<00:03:48.760> a<00:03:49.000> picture<00:03:49.630> sketch<00:03:49.960> I

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
whole thing like a picture sketch I

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.750 
whole thing like a picture sketch I
can't<00:03:50.830> demonstrate<00:03:50.980> right<00:03:51.400> right<00:03:51.580> now

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
can't demonstrate right right now

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.220 
can't demonstrate right right now

we had a bit of fun getting the actual

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
now we using accelerometer data to work

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.090 
now we using accelerometer data to work
this<00:03:59.260> but<00:03:59.710> it<00:03:59.950> works<00:04:00.370> fine<00:04:01.830> that's<00:04:02.830> it<00:04:02.920> what
