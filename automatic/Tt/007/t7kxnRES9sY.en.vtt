00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.780 
let's just see exactly how long it is
starting<00:05:58.290> from<00:05:58.440> the<00:05:58.590> very<00:05:58.800> end<00:05:59.070> of<00:05:59.190> it<00:05:59.310> all<00:05:59.520> the

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
starting from the very end of it all the

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.790 
starting from the very end of it all the
way<00:05:59.910> to<00:05:59.970> its<00:06:00.270> head<00:06:00.690> first<00:06:01.350> let's<00:06:01.560> make<00:06:01.650> sure

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
way to its head first let's make sure

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:10.060 
way to its head first let's make sure
it's<00:06:01.980> completely<00:06:02.430> straight<00:06:05.990> alright<00:06:06.990> so<00:06:07.230> I

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:17.330 

believe<00:06:11.070> it's<00:06:11.400> about<00:06:14.030> it's<00:06:15.030> at<00:06:15.830> four<00:06:16.830> feet<00:06:17.130> and

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
believe it's about it's at four feet and

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.330 
believe it's about it's at four feet and
the<00:06:17.400> force<00:06:17.730> I<00:06:17.970> think<00:06:18.030> it<00:06:18.840> stopped<00:06:19.260> at<00:06:19.410> about<00:06:19.620> 52

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
the force I think it stopped at about 52

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.040 
the force I think it stopped at about 52
inches<00:06:21.320> so<00:06:22.320> I'm<00:06:22.590> a<00:06:22.920> parent<00:06:23.760> I<00:06:23.940> guess<00:06:24.330> this<00:06:24.540> um<00:06:24.780> I

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
inches so I'm a parent I guess this um I

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.500 
inches so I'm a parent I guess this um I
guess<00:06:25.620> lice<00:06:25.860> is<00:06:26.010> that<00:06:26.130> that<00:06:26.280> may<00:06:26.940> be<00:06:27.000> foreign

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
guess lice is that that may be foreign

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.830 
guess lice is that that may be foreign
