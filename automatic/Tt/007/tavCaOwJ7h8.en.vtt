 andreas the day of the premiere a new top 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.370
 5 of the best in 9 series that have been 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.139
 done to this day for those 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.630
 people who do not have knowledge of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.460
 what is an nm series is a mod that you 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.500
 change accomplish game tricks in this 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.449
 case of the game san andreas by ones 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.270
 many better for this we will need 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.670
 a good pc depending on the nb series 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.439
 that we want as there are in 9 series of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.390
 high means and low resources 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.550
 depending on repeat of the computer 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.470
 that we have and today I bring you 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.759
 the category of high means for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.320
 those people who have a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.760
 computer with a good card 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.070
 graph so let's start 5 in the post 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.050
 number 5 we have this 9 series that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 I particularly like this 9 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.129
 series were also one of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.200
 the first ones that came out and that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.879
 they changed the radical aspect of the game 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.829
 of the graphics and all that for a few 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.430
 many better this must be silenced 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.010
 call xa diagonal under direct 1.3 beta 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.270
 so his name should be this and how 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.390
 I said was one of the first 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.979
 they left and that until now 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.450
 some people not to say many what 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.369
 continue to use because 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.820
 It must be that it is truly worth the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.219
 worth using it and let's say this one is very 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.409
 well I have a diet with this 9 series 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.299
 when I bought this computer that should 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.100
 to be is was the first one that I downloaded and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.560
 light on the computer to see how I 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.750
 ran since the rb6 had always 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.479
 dear but obviously for my card 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.819
 graphic I did not run this 9 series and I 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.950
 with this now I'm running very well for that 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.569
 is ranked number 5 because they were 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.310
 one of the first and because it is very 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.110
 good to the present for that very reason 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.500
 is at number 5 so 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.420
 let's move to position number 4 workgroup in 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.569
 the fourth place we have this should be 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.399
 called nv 7 pointed to the end that came out 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.500
 about three months ago or 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.509
 less if you look at the gameplay I know 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.220
 that is not so let's say surprising as 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.200
 the previous one is not as good as the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.090
 earlier I know it's not so good but 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.280
 what this 9 series has is that it is 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.049
 Compatible with Sanz has two versions 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.539
 no shorts or erase as much as 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.479
 multiplayer as lonely for that very reason 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.920
 they are in position number 4 since a 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.079
 comparison of others in 9 series of 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.390
 high means or high resources are not 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.460
 compatible with sonia that you look 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.650
 blue floor blue textures all 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.690
 transparent and this 9 series is 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.610
 compatible with being fully compatible 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.920
 that's why he won the position of a 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.200
 new 4 since it is compatible with sam and 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.459
 Looking at it well is not that ugly lnm series 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.260
 so we make the third place 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.910
 and in the third place we have this 9 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.740
 series that particularly like the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.150
 I like it a lot since it was one 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.320
 of the first ones that I tried 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.270
 when I bought this computer I 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.030
 download the high resources and be 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.250
 in series was the one that I liked the most this 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.110
 means up and down black edges 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.910
 this effect I do not remember what it's called 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.010
 but it is very good also in the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.870
 file save well in two folders with 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.370
 two different effects of two 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.890
 honestly they are very good 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.800
 for that reason he has the position number 3 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.630
 since it has that effect of 2 and like 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.280
 He has what I can not explain here 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.080
 saying the effect but you too 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.269
 the gameplay and honestly it's very 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.269
 well that's why he is at number 3 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.450
 2 we are already in the home number 2 and this 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.720
 place it takes the nb series called 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.220
 bcr 9 honestly this 9 series is the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.930
 that I liked the most is the one that most 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.360
 like to the present truthfully 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.980
 is very good this 9 series brings the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.960
 effect as well as the previous one 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.140
 the effect of the black edges above and 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.180
 down a dog effect let's say simple and 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.490
 It also brings the reflection effect very 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.620
 good honestly it's very good to be 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.410
 of my series that's why it's in the 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.300
 position number 2 and we would have the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.890
 position number 1 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.340
 chan chan chan 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.680
 a good friends we are finally in the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.780
 position number one and this position will 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.090
 the series nm called platinum 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.740
 series 2 honestly this 9 series is 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.330
 the best that has been made public since 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.040
 there are many better ones but they are private 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.530
 honestly this must be me and I 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.970
 loved it I do not take it out of the game at all 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.280
 I do not take it out at all because honestly 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.070
 this 9 series is very good as well 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.020
 brings effect 2 and also brings another 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.510
 different effect style 2 in the 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.310
 rar file and also brings as a 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.590
 file with the burj effect in case you 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.540
 you just want to install ale it must be is at 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.459
 same also finally brings what 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.160
 It is still a texture for cars 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.840
 for you to install and this texture what 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.910
 that gives you the effect is like 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.100
 they were wet or as if they were 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.800
 Under rain, it's really good 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.450
 this must be and is complete by all 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.270
