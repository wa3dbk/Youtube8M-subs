you got to get comfortable I'm only
doing<00:00:15.379> three<00:00:16.379> things<00:00:16.560> three<00:00:17.310> different

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
doing three things three different

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.220 
doing three things three different
things<00:00:17.880> right<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:18.119> either<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.930> right

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
though okay so that's just the four-note

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.620 
though okay so that's just the four-note
grouping<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:29.880> other<00:00:30.000> thing<00:00:30.240> you're<00:00:30.359> doing<00:00:30.390> is

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630

have<00:00:35.730> your<00:00:35.760> three<00:00:36.149> note<00:00:36.360> grouping<00:00:36.809> which

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
have your three note grouping which

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:51.020 
have your three note grouping which
could<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:44.090> right<00:00:45.090> left<00:00:45.120> left<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:50.030> of

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
could be right right left left right of

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.220 
could be right right left left right of
course<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> same<00:00:51.780> thing<00:00:52.079> with

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
course you can do the same thing with

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:01.600 
course you can do the same thing with
your<00:00:52.320> force

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.799 

alright<00:01:02.610> so<00:01:02.790> I<00:01:02.820> love<00:01:03.120> doing<00:01:03.329> things<00:01:03.629> in

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
alright so I love doing things in

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.210 
alright so I love doing things in
patterns<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> way<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.769> would<00:01:04.979> practice

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
patterns so the way I would practice

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.390 
patterns so the way I would practice
that<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:06.440> when<00:01:07.440> I<00:01:07.470> was<00:01:07.619> first<00:01:07.800> learning<00:01:08.010> just

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that is when I was first learning just

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.280 
that is when I was first learning just
to<00:01:08.550> put<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:08.940> my<00:01:09.060> doubles<00:01:09.420> faster<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.930> my<00:01:09.960> kick

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
to put get my doubles faster on my kick

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:21.440 
to put get my doubles faster on my kick
I<00:01:10.470> would<00:01:10.590> practice<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> lot<00:01:20.270> worse<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
I would practice this a lot worse you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.560 
I would practice this a lot worse you
can<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> left<00:01:21.990> right

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:54.830 

you<00:01:28.570> can<00:01:28.780> alternate<00:01:29.259> right<00:01:29.560> left<00:01:29.860> left<00:01:29.979> right

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.030 

alright<00:01:55.840> then<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:56.050> got<00:01:56.170> your<00:01:56.200> triplets<00:01:56.740> and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
alright then you got your triplets and

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.160 
alright then you got your triplets and
you<00:01:57.400> work<00:01:57.610> those<00:01:57.850> your<00:01:58.210> groups<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:58.720> three<00:01:58.930> with

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
you work those your groups of three with

00:01:59.170 --> 00:03:28.360 
you work those your groups of three with
your<00:01:59.290> right<00:01:59.470> level

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.230 

alright<00:03:29.390> once<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.480> got<00:03:30.690> them<00:03:30.810> going<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.940> next

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
alright once you got them going the next

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.820 
alright once you got them going the next
step<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.540> don't<00:03:33.660> have<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.810> click<00:03:34.080> on<00:03:34.110> me<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.620> you

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
step I don't have a click on me but you

00:03:34.830 --> 00:04:27.929 
step I don't have a click on me but you
put<00:03:35.010> on<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.160> click<00:03:35.490> and<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:35.940> start<00:03:36.210> work

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:27.939 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.179 

and<00:04:28.939> other<00:04:29.720> this<00:04:29.960> obviously<00:04:30.470> those<00:04:30.620> are<00:04:30.650> 16

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:31.189 
and other this obviously those are 16

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:33.279 
and other this obviously those are 16
but<00:04:31.520> then<00:04:31.639> you<00:04:31.729> want<00:04:31.909> to<00:04:32.000> when<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.870> get<00:04:33.020> fast

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
but then you want to when you get fast
