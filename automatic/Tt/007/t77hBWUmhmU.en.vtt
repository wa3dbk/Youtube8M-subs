00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
of the plane which I find really really

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.680 
of the plane which I find really really
because<00:02:59.790> it's<00:03:00.030> kind<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.750> very<00:03:01.140> small<00:03:02.690> I

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.880 
because it's kind of very small I
believe<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.830> it's<00:03:04.980> called<00:03:05.220> Kangaroo<00:03:05.640> Island
