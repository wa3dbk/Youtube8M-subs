00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.230
 Hello such as community fords 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.140
 will know da is already in evidence 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.070
 with the night maps it takes 2004 by 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.200
 the moment they have made themselves known 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.660
 preliminary images of what it would look like 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.370
 taste the night mode the community of 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.410
 banfield is waiting for this precious 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.750
 way since add-ons such as 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.210
 internal flares infrared sights 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.489
 incendiary grenades explosions and 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.640
 many more things will give an environment of 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.530
 excellent battle for the time being 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.809
 catches that have come out show the 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.930
 tank interface the flares of the 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.400
 helicopters and some other things more 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.409
 It really is excellent because as you 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.839
 commented there are devices that normally 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.570
 they do not have an effective use in my opinion 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.820
 the infrared sights the guitars and 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.979
 the flares are add-ons that are not 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.720
 are being exploited to their maximum and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.030
 that now with these maps if it will be 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.200
 necessary the use of these tools 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.180
 the members of the community are very 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.340
 excited to see this mode in all 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.380
 the maps but you still do not know to 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.570
 true science in what way it will be 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.940
 implemented if by means of a simple 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.409
 configuration or if it will be taken as a 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.479
 separate map 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.100
 I thank the user and his tics for 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.390
 pass me in the configuration that was used 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.280
 in the event they had in the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.259
 European community the users that 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.049
 they used this configuration they were west and 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.929
 two scouts meant deÃ¡n and with phishing 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.359
 dolce jack franks and other members of the 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.770
 community of vados food I leave with you 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.599
 the link in the description of the most 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.759
 relevant to the departure of the 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:48.560
 members and aforementioned playing in 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.880
 a map with these characteristics will 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.920
 makes you feel in a very 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.479
 different to play like now you can 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.880
 seeing is difficult since it is really 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.799
 dark and if you do not carry a flashlight 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.560
 you will simply be stuck with all 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.209
 obstacle class 43 we had the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.459
 opportunity to see night maps and 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.259
 they were excellent now it's turn of the 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.030
 2004 where the scenarios are more 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.979
 showy and with the technology of force 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.730
 bay 3 the scenarios can reach 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.650
 look excellent in this night mode 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.959
 this is a preliminary look and not 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.489
 official oil but nevertheless it is 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.810
 a way of being able to verify that the 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.860
 night maps will undoubtedly be 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.390
 funny 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.489
 only touch-ups like lighting are missing 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.200
 shadows and some others that create us a 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.000
 more friendly environment to us as 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.980
 users I hope you liked to see a 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.540
 little taste of the night mode this 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.250
 so they have an idea of how it is that 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.560
 the map would come to be seen in the year that 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.110
 comes without doubt the effects of fog 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.849
 lighting were my favorites if you 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.040
 liked the video a like and share with 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.840
 the community would be luxury gives a 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.329
 look at my inner material and if you
