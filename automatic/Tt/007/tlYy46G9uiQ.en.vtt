00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
things that it was really really hard to

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.780 
things that it was really really hard to
find<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.170> figured<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.770> there<00:01:56.579> are<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> few

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
find so I figured that there are a few

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.209 
find so I figured that there are a few
things<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.240> know<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.530> figured<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
things that I know and so I figured I

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.459 
things that I know and so I figured I
would<00:01:59.399> share<00:01:59.579> them<00:01:59.820> not<00:02:00.299> only<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.079> had

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
would share them not only that but I had

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.490 
would share them not only that but I had
some<00:02:02.340> other<00:02:02.490> artists<00:02:02.820> who<00:02:02.909> know<00:02:03.119> me<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.540> asked

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
some other artists who know me and asked

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.350 
some other artists who know me and asked
me<00:02:04.560> certain<00:02:05.130> questions<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.090> help

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
me certain questions like can you help

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.719 
me certain questions like can you help
me<00:02:06.479> draw<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> hand<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> figured<00:02:08.280> well<00:02:08.550> let

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
me draw a hand and so I figured well let

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.339 
me draw a hand and so I figured well let
me<00:02:08.819> make<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> video<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.959> reason<00:02:10.170> why<00:02:10.259> my

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
me make a video so the reason why my

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.610 
me make a video so the reason why my
videos<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:11.039> seem<00:02:11.400> very<00:02:12.209> unpolished

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
videos is seem very unpolished

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.750 
videos is seem very unpolished
it's<00:02:13.830> because<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.099> don't<00:02:14.250> want<00:02:14.400> them<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.640> be

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it's because I don't want them to be

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.479 
it's because I don't want them to be
polished<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.330> want<00:02:15.599> them<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.769> sounds<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.280> I'm

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
polished I want them it sounds like I'm

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.720 
polished I want them it sounds like I'm
explaining<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.440> hopefully<00:02:20.280> as

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
explaining it to you as in hopefully as

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.869 
explaining it to you as in hopefully as
if<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.120> sitting<00:02:21.390> right<00:02:21.540> next<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
that's kind of that's kind of how I set

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.040 
that's kind of that's kind of how I set
everything<00:02:26.459> up<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.420> could<00:02:27.690> probably<00:02:27.780> do

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
everything up so I could probably do

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.259 
everything up so I could probably do
some<00:02:28.230> fancy<00:02:28.590> cuts<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.160> put<00:02:29.459> some<00:02:29.640> music<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:30.090> on
