all right today we're going to put all
this<00:00:04.710> together<00:00:04.980> on<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.549> crank<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.089> get<00:00:06.210> the

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
this together on the crank and get the

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.709 
this together on the crank and get the
upper<00:00:06.839> gears<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.350> there<00:00:07.560> for<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.919> cam<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.120> for

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
upper gears on there for the cam and for

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.450 
upper gears on there for the cam and for
the<00:00:10.340> distributor<00:00:11.340> I've<00:00:12.059> already<00:00:12.300> got<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:13.460> one

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
the distributor I've already got the one

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.890 
the distributor I've already got the one
of<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.670> main<00:00:14.849> bearings<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.509> there

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
of the main bearings in there

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.019 
of the main bearings in there
the<00:00:16.080> fourth<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.980> might<00:00:17.640> be<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.880> third

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the fourth one might be the third

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.810 
the fourth one might be the third
actually<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.750> you'll<00:00:19.560> notice<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.980> put<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> tab

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
actually and you'll notice I put the tab

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.939 
actually and you'll notice I put the tab
at<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.060> bottom<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:22.140> we've<00:00:22.260> got<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> hidden

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
at the bottom so we've got the hidden

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.970 
at the bottom so we've got the hidden
billion<00:00:23.369> at<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.490> bottom<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:25.529> two<00:00:25.680> gears

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
billion at the bottom and the two gears

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.429 
billion at the bottom and the two gears
unfortunately<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.789> only<00:00:26.910> be<00:00:27.090> put<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.449> after

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
unfortunately can only be put on after

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.500 
unfortunately can only be put on after
being<00:00:28.650> heated<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.099> if<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.060> try<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> put

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
being heated up if you just try to put

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.930 
being heated up if you just try to put
them<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.689> right<00:00:30.750> now<00:00:31.109> they<00:00:31.320> will<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> you

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
them on right now they will just so you

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.660 
them on right now they will just so you
use<00:00:33.270> them<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:33.590> and<00:00:34.590> typically<00:00:35.100> they<00:00:35.250> drop<00:00:35.489> on

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
use them up and typically they drop on

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.650 
use them up and typically they drop on
real<00:00:35.940> good<00:00:36.120> pay<00:00:37.020> attention<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> two<00:00:38.660> dots

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
real good pay attention to the two dots

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.180 
real good pay attention to the two dots
on<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> top<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.410> gear<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.890> them

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
on the top of the gear so you have them

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.220 
on the top of the gear so you have them
facing<00:00:41.550> upward<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.750> them<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.079> wrong

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
facing upward have them on the wrong

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.799 
facing upward have them on the wrong
side<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.420> take<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
side so what I do is I just take the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.569 
side so what I do is I just take the
gear<00:00:46.050> put<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.780> stove<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.250> also<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
gear put it on the stove I also have a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.850 
gear put it on the stove I also have a
some<00:00:51.480> welding<00:00:51.840> gloves<00:00:51.960> here<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.590> burn

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
some welding gloves here so don't burn

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.630 
some welding gloves here so don't burn
myself<00:00:53.010> when<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.489> do<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:55.219> this<00:00:56.219> might<00:00:56.430> be

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
myself when I do this and this might be

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.990 
myself when I do this and this might be
a<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.850> more<00:00:57.719> time<00:00:57.989> consuming<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:59.000> we'll

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
a little more time consuming but we'll

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.930 
a little more time consuming but we'll
get<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> taken<00:01:01.079> care<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.770> use<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.940> heat

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
get it taken care of you can use a heat

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700 
get it taken care of you can use a heat
pad<00:01:03.239> or<00:01:03.510> anything<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.960> gets<00:01:04.049> up<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.470> around

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
pad or anything that gets up to around

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.670 
pad or anything that gets up to around
to<00:01:05.010> 300<00:01:05.580> degrees<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.320> you'll<00:01:07.320> need<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.619> for

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
to 300 degrees and you'll need that for

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.740 
to 300 degrees and you'll need that for
two<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.250> gears<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:10.369> is<00:01:11.750> for

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
two of the gears this one here is for

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.969 
two of the gears this one here is for
the<00:01:13.020> cam<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.860> here

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
the cam and here

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.090 
the cam and here
and<00:01:16.159> we'll<00:01:16.670> let<00:01:16.759> it<00:01:16.880> get<00:01:17.030> hot<00:01:17.770> they'll<00:01:18.770> start

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
and we'll let it get hot they'll start

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.820 
and we'll let it get hot they'll start
smoking<00:01:19.580> a<00:01:19.640> little<00:01:19.700> bit<00:01:19.970> when<00:01:20.119> it's<00:01:20.270> ready<00:01:20.479> and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
smoking a little bit when it's ready and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.590 
smoking a little bit when it's ready and
then<00:01:21.830> we'll<00:01:21.979> cook<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.909> on<00:01:22.939> there<00:01:23.270> once<00:01:23.420> it's

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
then we'll cook that on there once it's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.870 
then we'll cook that on there once it's
on<00:01:23.750> it's<00:01:23.990> on<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:24.590> if<00:01:25.100> they<00:01:25.250> get<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.369> crust<00:01:25.610> off

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
on it's on so if they get a crust off

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.570 
on it's on so if they get a crust off
they<00:01:26.149> don't<00:01:26.680> mess<00:01:27.680> around<00:01:27.830> once<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.340> get<00:01:28.490> it

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
they don't mess around once you get it

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.370 
they don't mess around once you get it
on<00:01:28.670> there<00:01:28.939> because<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:29.750> know<00:01:29.869> want<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.200> take

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
on there because you know want to take

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.219 
on there because you know want to take
cooled<00:01:30.619> down<00:01:30.799> pretty<00:01:31.040> quick<00:01:31.899> you<00:01:32.899> don't<00:01:32.930> want

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
cooled down pretty quick you don't want

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.430 
cooled down pretty quick you don't want
to<00:01:33.320> get<00:01:33.470> stuck<00:01:33.799> halfway<00:01:34.039> down<00:01:35.110> or<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.259> got<00:01:36.350> to

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
to get stuck halfway down or you got to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.010 
to get stuck halfway down or you got to
go<00:01:36.560> back<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.420> machine<00:01:38.420> shop<00:01:38.600> again<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:38.960> get

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
go back to the machine shop again to get

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.359 
go back to the machine shop again to get
it<00:01:39.140> pressed<00:01:39.350> off<00:01:39.560> unless<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:39.950> have<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.159> really

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
it pressed off unless you have a really

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.630 
it pressed off unless you have a really
good<00:01:40.520> press<00:01:41.259> so

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.110 

just<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.360> smidge<00:01:46.690> here

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.880 

usually<00:01:52.810> you'll<00:01:52.900> see<00:01:53.050> a<00:01:53.080> couple<00:01:53.260> wisps<00:01:53.770> of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
usually you'll see a couple wisps of

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.390 
usually you'll see a couple wisps of
smoke<00:01:53.950> off<00:01:54.430> that<00:01:54.670> when<00:01:54.790> it's<00:01:54.940> ready

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
smoke off that when it's ready

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.800 
smoke off that when it's ready
this<00:01:57.400> is<00:01:57.580> May<00:01:57.790> good<00:01:57.970> opportunity<00:01:58.480> to<00:01:58.540> clean

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
this is May good opportunity to clean

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.340 
this is May good opportunity to clean
the<00:01:59.550> stove<00:02:00.550> when<00:02:00.820> I'm<00:02:00.910> done

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
the stove when I'm done

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.709 
the stove when I'm done
after<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.500> year<00:02:04.250> goes<00:02:04.460> on<00:02:04.609> you'll<00:02:05.210> see<00:02:05.270> me<00:02:05.539> put

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
to have the block line board so always

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.800 
to have the block line board so always
have<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.829> stuff<00:02:37.040> checked<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.670> thought<00:02:38.599> it<00:02:38.720> was

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
have that stuff checked I thought it was

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.069 
have that stuff checked I thought it was
already<00:02:39.140> lying<00:02:39.349> board<00:02:39.650> but<00:02:39.950> whoever<00:02:40.519> did<00:02:40.700> it

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
already lying board but whoever did it

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.569 
already lying board but whoever did it
well<00:02:42.079> probably<00:02:42.650> wasn't<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.099> line<00:02:43.280> Bors

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
well probably wasn't the line Bors

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.280 
well probably wasn't the line Bors
problem<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:44.299> was<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.540> person<00:02:44.840> who<00:02:44.900> used<00:02:45.170> it

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
problem it was the person who used it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.770 
problem it was the person who used it
and<00:02:45.410> abused<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.829> engine<00:02:46.130> before<00:02:46.250> me<00:02:46.780> probably

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
and abused the engine before me probably

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.789
