00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.630
 more precisely with its ultimate impetus we all

 know this awesome skill which 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.289
 makes a lot of damage 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.180
 but with one not hit conditions the farther 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.430
 the enemy is away from us the more damage 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.380
 we will apply precisely on the basis of this 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.230
 Information I will show you one way 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.750
 causing even more damage for this 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.579

 maximum damage firstly to us 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.770
 naturally you need to be on 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.719
 maximum distance from the enemy and in the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.510
 second we should just push 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.280
 enemy force stuff in this way 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.350
 thanks mkb who won't give us 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.570
 miss and force staff who 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.730
 will push the enemy in turn increase 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.550
 the distance between you we will plot 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.379
 huge cart of damage to the enemy this 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.210
 best way to use 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.780
 when the enemy is running away with a little 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.780
 amount of health 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.630
 I know everything and have always been afraid and afraid 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.790
 Black Hall enigma damn out of the forest 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.060
 forged into the crowd and put your nasty 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.050
 mating as not ripe persimmon clouds 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.790
 actual black hole can be knocked down 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.330
 only in the case when in a team and 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.220
 silent sex and bastan but for enigma 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.470
 holders of these abilities is 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.840
 the main goal and often such 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.580
 heroes fall into a black hole i think 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.409
 many know that black hole besides 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.170
 Silence of the camp or Hex 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.300
 also knocks off with a leg mesh for example or 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.399
 Amber But the fact is that there is such a forest 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.619
 wonderful mob like a troll which 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.440
 there is no less remarkable skill ansa 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.119
 the mesh that beats back the bacillum seemed 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.920
 would black hall not bend bkb knock down 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.530
 impossible well and re-enters the game 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.840
 the troll beats backall even through BKB 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.759
 from here we can conclude one of 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.710
 most effective counter-peaks against 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.429
 Enigma will become such characters as 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.560
 enchantress than foot doom nubik 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.660
 perhaps we shall also assign here and of course 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.390
 do not forget about the dominator them too 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.759
 you can lure troll we all know 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.100
 how nasty is nicks biting for your and 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.130
 without that fiery ass from vendetta then 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.250
 became mana burn dagon fish all right 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.870
 the enemy is killed farts are on fire but there is no nix 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.519
 on top of all this has 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.780
 ability to destroy unattended 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.570
 wallowing things 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.720
 while being vendetta without leaving 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.720
 her 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.129
 one of the most useful dota skills 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.769
 is a shield abadonna 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.310
 but he is not perfect let's say you are all the same 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.920
 nix 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.200
 you have a little hp and you run away from abbadona 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.569
 hanging on the possession of a cheat that is about to 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.239
 will explode along with your ass killing 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.609
 you can avoid it just 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.030
 using inviz shield abbadona not 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.010
 inflicts damage to invisible enemies 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.480
 I think enough for today hope that my 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.180
 advice at least someone will help 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.180
 well, I had a chance to see you bye
