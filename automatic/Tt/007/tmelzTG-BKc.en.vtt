Ball for coverage and signal beam really

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.550 
Ball for coverage and signal beam really
that's<00:01:32.880> kind<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.299> though<00:01:33.509> Jolteon<00:01:34.290> is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that's kind of it though Jolteon is

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.010 
that's kind of it though Jolteon is
limited<00:01:35.100> by<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.790> amount<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.360> coverage<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.840> has

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
limited by the amount of coverage it has

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.990 
limited by the amount of coverage it has
but<00:01:37.320> overall<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> special<00:01:38.100> attacker<00:01:38.369> this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
but overall as a special attacker this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
but overall as a special attacker this
is<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.329> how<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> likes<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.200> run<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.799> can

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
is like how it likes to run and you can

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.100 
is like how it likes to run and you can
get<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.340> lot<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.640> good<00:01:41.909> usage<00:01:42.360> out<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.930> in

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
get a lot of good usage out of it in

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.649 
get a lot of good usage out of it in
this<00:01:43.470> way<00:01:43.740> what<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.490> also<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.000> Jolteon<00:01:45.450> is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
this way what you also see on Jolteon is

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.200 
this way what you also see on Jolteon is
maybe<00:01:45.869> even<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.170> focus<00:01:46.380> sash<00:01:46.770> now<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.759> Jolteon

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
maybe even a focus sash now this Jolteon

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.030 
maybe even a focus sash now this Jolteon
set<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.659> more<00:01:48.960> doubles<00:01:49.350> oriented<00:01:49.770> but<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
set is more doubles oriented but the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.560 
set is more doubles oriented but the
idea<00:01:50.280> stays<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.729> same<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.450> use

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
idea stays the same that you can use

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.800 
idea stays the same that you can use
focus<00:01:51.960> sash<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.740> essentially<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.399> in

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
focus sash with essentially this in

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.450 
focus sash with essentially this in
singles<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.680> double<00:01:56.070> hit<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.399> you

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
singles to get that double hit that you

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.700 
singles to get that double hit that you

these could all ko if they're super

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
these could all ko if they're super

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
effective having that focus ash lets you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.370 
effective having that focus ash lets you
make<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:02.820> those<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.119> get<00:02:03.270> Kos<00:02:03.659> or<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:04.170> more

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
make up for those to get Kos or get more

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.260 
make up for those to get Kos or get more
than<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.619> one<00:02:04.979> ko<00:02:05.189> off<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:05.909> coverage

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
than just one ko off of your coverage

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.700 
than just one ko off of your coverage
and<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.659> lock<00:02:06.899> your<00:02:07.049> down<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.530> choice

effects<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.060> idea<00:02:09.360> doubles<00:02:09.869> can

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
effects but in this idea doubles can

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.809 
effects but in this idea doubles can
work<00:02:10.170> very<00:02:10.379> well<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:10.890> well<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.610> that

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
work very well as well but you have that

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.290 
work very well as well but you have that

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
Ball I just kind of thrown out there

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.670 
Ball I just kind of thrown out there
because<00:02:29.280> Jolteon<00:02:30.180> special<00:02:31.110> coverage<00:02:31.440> isn't

because Jolteon special coverage isn't

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.200 
because Jolteon special coverage isn't
that<00:02:31.920> great<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.550> have<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.760> hidden<00:02:33.000> power

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
hidden power ice or fire could be a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
really good thing to have and on top of

really good thing to have and on top of
that<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:40.020> just<00:02:40.050> need<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.380> talk<00:02:40.500> about<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:41.010> volt

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
that we just need to talk about the volt

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.800 
that we just need to talk about the volt
absorb<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.760> going<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.330> only<00:02:42.540> nature

you want on Jolteon quick feet doesn't

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.160 
you want on Jolteon quick feet doesn't
really<00:02:44.940> make<00:02:45.120> sense<00:02:45.150> because<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.750> already<00:02:45.930> has

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
really make sense because it already has

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.500 
really make sense because it already has
so<00:02:46.410> much<00:02:46.470> speed<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:47.460> it<00:02:48.000> really<00:02:48.300> doesn't

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
so much speed that it really doesn't

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.510 
so much speed that it really doesn't
even<00:02:48.810> allow<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.320> play<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.710> modest<00:02:50.160> nature

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
even allow you to play the modest nature

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.760 
even allow you to play the modest nature
too<00:02:50.700> well<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:51.540> that's<00:02:52.380> how<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.590> use

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
too well so just that's how you use

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.350 
too well so just that's how you use
Jolteon<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.640> going<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.060> an<00:02:54.210> all-out
