messiaen<00:04:27.070> I<00:04:27.220> think<00:04:27.370> that's<00:04:27.520> a<00:04:27.580> good<00:04:27.670> trade<00:04:27.910> and

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
messiaen I think that's a good trade and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.830 
messiaen I think that's a good trade and
so<00:04:29.530> they<00:04:29.680> both<00:04:29.860> start<00:04:30.220> with<00:04:30.280> one<00:04:31.150> bar<00:04:31.360> versus

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
so they both start with one bar versus

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.820 
so they both start with one bar versus
three<00:04:31.990> bars<00:04:32.200> it's<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.470> really<00:04:32.620> good<00:04:32.770> position

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
three bars it's a really good position
