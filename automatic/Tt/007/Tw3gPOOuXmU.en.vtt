00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
piece that rotates and presses and then

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.899 
piece that rotates and presses and then
they<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.500> strainer<00:01:38.070> which<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.520> presses

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
up against also when getting out the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
up against also when getting out the
additional<00:01:43.079> juice<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.189> pushing<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.939> pulp

additional juice and pushing the pulp

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.840 
additional juice and pushing the pulp
through<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.650> juicer<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.579> they're<00:01:47.729> just

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
through the juicer so they're just

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.170 
through the juicer so they're just
slides<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.229> piece<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.970> kind<00:01:50.970> of

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
slides in there so piece it's a kind of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.850 
slides in there so piece it's a kind of
groove<00:01:51.930> set<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.640> particular<00:01:54.860> shape

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
groove set for this particular shape

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.200 
groove set for this particular shape
that<00:01:56.729> locks<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.420> into<00:01:57.750> place<00:01:58.970> so<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.060> just

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
that locks that into place so you just

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.300 
that locks that into place so you just
slide<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.470> then<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
slide that in like that and then of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.590 
slide that in like that and then of
course<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:03.180> top<00:02:03.950> where<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.070> grooves

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
course the top where this grooves

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.779 
course the top where this grooves
and<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.810> just<00:02:07.990> turn<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.530> left<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.369> like

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
and you just turn to the left and like

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.120 
and you just turn to the left and like
it<00:02:10.000> okay<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:11.050> then<00:02:11.260> here's<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.560> little<00:02:11.770> tower

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
the pulp club so the switches in the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.590 
the pulp club so the switches in the
back<00:02:33.910> here<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.480> just<00:02:34.810> turn<00:02:35.020> this<00:02:35.140> on<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:36.600> you

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
back here you just turn this on and you

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.810 
back here you just turn this on and you
can<00:02:37.630> sometimes<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.739> bend<00:02:39.010> my<00:02:39.100> wheatgrass<00:02:39.519> in

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
can sometimes I bend my wheatgrass in

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
can sometimes I bend my wheatgrass in
order<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.209> get<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.260> press<00:02:42.010> tighter<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:43.660> you

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
order to get it to press tighter but you

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.870 
order to get it to press tighter but you
really<00:02:44.140> don't<00:02:44.470> need<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.950> do<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:45.610> that's

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
really don't need to do that and that's

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.930 
really don't need to do that and that's
probably<00:02:46.180> not<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.600> good<00:02:46.720> idea<00:02:47.100> honestly<00:02:48.100> just

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
probably not a good idea honestly just

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.960 
probably not a good idea honestly just
feed<00:02:49.239> it<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.260> juicer<00:02:51.069> straight<00:02:51.459> and

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
feed it in to the juicer straight and

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.660 
feed it in to the juicer straight and
the<00:02:52.690> juice<00:02:52.989> are<00:02:53.200> pretty<00:02:53.410> much<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:53.980> it's

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
the juice are pretty much what it's

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.620 
the juice are pretty much what it's
supposed<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.209> do<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:57.310> know<00:02:57.459> here<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.850> is<00:02:58.030> going

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
supposed to do you know here it is going

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.240 
supposed to do you know here it is going
through<00:02:58.930> there<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.140> then<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.680> see<00:02:59.920> all<00:03:00.040> the

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
through there and then you see all the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.840 
through there and then you see all the
juice<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:01.540> press<00:03:01.840> she's<00:03:02.459> spitting<00:03:03.459> out<00:03:03.580> at<00:03:03.730> the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
juice we press she's spitting out at the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.670 
juice we press she's spitting out at the
bottom<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.640> we're<00:03:06.940> going<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.620> add<00:03:08.620> a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
bottom and so we're going to add a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.180 
bottom and so we're going to add a
little<00:03:09.100> bit<00:03:09.220> more<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.820> here's<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.450> up<00:03:13.660> also

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
little bit more and here's it up also

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
coming out of the front piece as it's

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.540 
coming out of the front piece as it's
being<00:03:19.030> pressed<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.780> strained

here as you can see this is a lot more

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.370 
here as you can see this is a lot more
dry<00:05:22.230> the<00:05:23.230> second<00:05:23.590> time<00:05:23.740> around

dry the second time around

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.310 
dry the second time around
I<00:05:24.610> generally<00:05:25.610> do<00:05:25.820> this<00:05:26.030> about<00:05:26.390> three<00:05:27.020> times

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
I generally do this about three times

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.300
