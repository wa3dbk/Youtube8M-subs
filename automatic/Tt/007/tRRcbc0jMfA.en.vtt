00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
much time I spent about an hour a day

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.620 
much time I spent about an hour a day
straightening<00:04:00.190> my<00:04:00.310> hair<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.000> then<00:04:01.480> it

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
just it damages it a lot it's very dry

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.810 
just it damages it a lot it's very dry
and<00:04:04.330> just<00:04:04.660> stole<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:05.890> have<00:04:06.070> so<00:04:06.340> many<00:04:06.459> split

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.820 
chemically straightened cutting it would
be<00:04:15.160> her<00:04:15.280> only<00:04:15.519> option<00:04:16.230> but<00:04:17.230> Tameka<00:04:17.470> says<00:04:17.799> a
