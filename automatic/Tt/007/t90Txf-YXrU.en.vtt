 to know it and in fact this inter has not 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.329
 I made but rather another person 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.160
 which is precisely called hicks raptor in 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.300

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.920

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.450

 anyway call to talk ciancio 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.010
 bandiamo starts immediately by telling you that if 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.220
 you want to buy that tv memories of 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.680
 switch from firm reliable myelosis i 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.239
 what did you guys see after the intro 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.860
 you saw that I bought the first one 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.610
 player of this series if not 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.799
 I'm wrong 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.119
 and which boys player I decided to 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.299
 buy as the first player of the 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.880
 series axis rtg reina what guys is one 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.940
 lassini is the Peruvian left wing of the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.200
 salzburg that has a bronze rating 61 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.810
 which costs 700 credits and 91 speeds 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.510
 divided into 93 acceleration and 90 of 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.100
 agility and equilibrium has nothing to do with it 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.350
 subdivided however I wanted to tell you some 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.000
 statistics and these two in this 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.860
 episode I will show you two games in the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.780
 which are really so many goals 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.540
 that's why I didn't want to show 3 e 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.820
 in which I made a piece of the ata 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.369
 scary fashion but now I will go away to 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.690
 explain everything well as you see when 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.130
 I found an opponent who had one 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.659
 that pretty crap team 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.640
 own initial if not with some 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.770
 extra player and I say but you know 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.140
 tranche we can also make up 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.299
 but a strange thing is that I would be 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.580
 went on 3 to 1 at the end of half time but 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.650
 I said is no is no and no we are not 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.140
 soft we can farce then oms 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.330
 appeasement and how you can as you can 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.920
 well see was a massacre in the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.170
 second time there is the ancient that I did 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.580
 a recovery from 3 to 1 to 5 and then mi 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.189
 it also seemed a pretty alive thing 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.269
 and then guys what I've just seen or for 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:22.129
 given the challenge, I believe it will be worth either 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.480
 I don't know the challenge anyway 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.549
 one of the most important challenges of the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.460
 English league indeed we have 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.830
 just seen liverpool manchester city 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.480
 the boys my mom what a game then 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.770
 I also wanted to show you the thing or 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.970
 better to let me notice something if you 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.650
 you haven't seen it yet 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.150
 what is the difference between the championship 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.100
 inter to the English league in my opinion 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.010
 that if in the English league one 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.930
 team goes on 10 says madonna we are 1 a 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.210
 0 but no good it's no we have to 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.920
 bring us minimum on 2 to 0 so yes 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.730
 continues to continue to attack 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.590
 more goals possible 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.450
 instead what is the mentality of dogs 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.580
 of the other championships but above all of 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.350
 that Italian 1 to 0 but we are 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.420
 jokingly we must fear this 1 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.260
 to 0 and we close in defense and so do not 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.200
 more goals are scored 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.910
 so in my opinion this is an aspect 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.560
 negative of our league 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.390
 however the first game of a chart 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.920
 53 and that the player I go to get 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.930
 goal to take another there is the 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.850
 Salzburg offensive midfielder 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.640
 because in fact I decided to do the 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.040
 offensive department of the team of of 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.780
 do it the most similar and or better to do it 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.740
 of salzburg of bronze one thing 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.600
 quite ambiguous 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.720
 in fact, like a wing, they are being taken as a woman 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.640
 as I took lazard, yes, yes 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.450
 guys are n't being because it's not 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.180
 lazard but lazzaro e ragazzi is the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.010
 savior no lazard is a beast is 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.860
 phenomenal but I would have expected it so 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.510
 strong because because boys is a bronze 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.350
 is a bronze offensive midfielder 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.120
 with 81 speed but above all 4 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.220
 skill stars and for me and a bronze e 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.560
 a bronze with four stars is almost the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.090
 top indeed will be very strong in use 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.680
 rojas has this second game 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.460
 in fact as a second game he finds a 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.530
 opponent who had a team 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.050
 quite scarce and I will go to spread 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.120
 I will also have the only one of the most beautiful goals 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.980
 but considering the team that was 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.960
 using I will make one of my most goals 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.210
 more beautiful that you will go to see it anyway 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.370
 however, he also had a very short time 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.920
 another thing to say I wanted to tell you so much 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.960
 that after he made the video it is 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.060
 depopulated the app called app nana e 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.980
 in my wire group will have or banna ho type 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.140
 had to talk like 20 people because 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.670
 everyone kept saying the boys 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.310
 these things I decided to do in Milan 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.230
 do something like write a comment 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.420
 your code glides like this if there is someone 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.400
 which needs 2,100 anna to score 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.200
 oh my god i don't know if you saw it that way 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.020
 anyway I told you that if anyone is there 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.690
 which needs 2,500 points 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.520
 what does it use your code and if there 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.229
 takes vidal 2,500 points to you 2,500 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.940
 the other to the crossbar used 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.160
 Here we review the goal 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.660
 my mom and if you want I also do it 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.900
 for the accounts so maybe you wanted 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.370
 you want you can help me too and 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.190
 obviously you don't have to do it 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.169
 if you don't want don't do it I recommend it 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.840
 and anyway even this game would end 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.909
 I win 40 so we are nobody enough 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.039
 very good positive not even one 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.050
 defeat and a draw anyway after 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.669
 I say this game but you have to buy 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.470
 another player only I don't have 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.849
 found a good active bronze of the 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.460
 salzburg in fact I gave myself to the 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.889
 silvers I bought alan and not boys 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.229
 I know if you know alan real football 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.710
 marrying to define it we did 28 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:25.560
 goal in 28 games really has a score 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.180
 a store a store you really know a 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.000
 relationship is a games played and goals 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.530
 phenomenal however said this super 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.449
 in the video you enjoyed who urges the 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.340
 it will be a good gas because this is precisely 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.599
 square series even if one speaks to the 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.669
 end there is no mention of a vacation, but 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.680
 temple and at least of the divided country e 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.060
 that's where the component greetings a 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.060
 palace in bubble video transition
