weathering<00:00:10.280> mostly<00:00:11.280> it's<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.730> copper<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
weathering mostly it's in the copper and

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.210 
weathering mostly it's in the copper and
the<00:00:12.599> finger<00:00:13.230> tips<00:00:13.910> hopefully<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:19.189> show<00:00:20.189> off

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the finger tips hopefully I can show off

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.940 
the finger tips hopefully I can show off
some<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.880> coloring

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.120 

now<00:00:28.520> those<00:00:28.730> colors<00:00:29.420> are<00:00:29.750> all<00:00:30.130> naturally

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
now those colors are all naturally

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.420 
now those colors are all naturally
created<00:00:31.730> with<00:00:31.989> heat<00:00:32.989> so<00:00:33.830> I<00:00:33.860> don't<00:00:34.130> use<00:00:34.250> any

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
created with heat so I don't use any

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.870 
created with heat so I don't use any
chemicals<00:00:35.090> like<00:00:36.050> patinas<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:36.770> you<00:00:37.760> know

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
chemicals like patinas and you know

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.700 
chemicals like patinas and you know
paints<00:00:38.510> or<00:00:38.660> anything<00:00:38.900> like<00:00:39.170> that<00:00:39.230> it's<00:00:39.530> all

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
paints or anything like that it's all

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.290 
paints or anything like that it's all
just<00:00:40.460> natural<00:00:40.550> reaction<00:00:41.450> of<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.690> copper<00:00:42.080> to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
just natural reaction of the copper to

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.970 
just natural reaction of the copper to
specific<00:00:44.300> heating<00:00:44.809> method<00:00:47.890> there's<00:00:48.890> the

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
specific heating method there's the

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.840 
specific heating method there's the
copper<00:00:49.430> fingers<00:00:49.930> in<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:50.989> backplate<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:52.730> the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
copper fingers in the backplate and the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.780 
copper fingers in the backplate and the
skull<00:00:53.150> of<00:00:53.180> has<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:54.260> p210<00:00:54.890> replicas<00:00:55.489> from

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
skull of has the p210 replicas from

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:25.750 
skull of has the p210 replicas from
Chris

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
you got to have p210 replicas on it at

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.890 
you got to have p210 replicas on it at
least<00:01:48.380> in<00:01:48.560> my<00:01:48.680> opinion<00:01:49.210> they're<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:50.450> close<00:01:50.720> to
