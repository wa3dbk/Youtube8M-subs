00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.980
 knight always specialized in rendering 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.050
 tributes to boots that have footwear 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.029
 special players 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.590
 during special moments and in this 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.090
 occasion a new line of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.220
 boots in honor of the world that has 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.140
 played the player who until very 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 little was the emblem of nike ronaldo 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.370
 nazario of the Brazilian player in this 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.620
 occasion the first model of boots is in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.930
 Honor to the World Cup of 98 and the first 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.430
 mercurial that was the first the first 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.430
 special boot for fast players 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.730
 besides the inspiration of colors this 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.530
 we see it in the characteristic lines 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.380
 that was wearing that boot in the area 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.200
 lateral and also in the template we 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.030
 explain a little bit the moments that 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.740
 have inspired this boot the player who 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.840
 innovation has led him to lead 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.300
 that this boot has the design and one of 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.640
 the secrets of the player or the boot 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.920
 during that time if we talk about 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.049
 the shell is a boot that all 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.549
 you know the materials the housing what 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.659
 who seeks to smile maximum lightness and 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.909
 which is a boot designed to enhance 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.380
 to the maximum the player's speed by 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.939
 both the material that this jean use 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.100
 a synthetic material that as we have 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.750
 said in a crowd 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.490
 is is the same one that uses knife to 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.170
 manufacture its high-end values ​​the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.759
 way that contact boot ball always 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.130
 it's going to be very natural since there are two 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.180
 identical elements plus this is the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.640
 completion that the small ones have 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.350
 dimples that is an inspiration picked up 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.729
 of the golf balls that have those 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.440
 veils so that when they fly to maximum 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.479
 speed do not receive any turbulence 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.490
 therefore, as your ship is designed to 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.229
 play is fast and they want so much to 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.940
 run like hitting the ball that the 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.380
 boot is as stable as possible 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.210
 they put these little grooves that also 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.430
 they're going to give us a good grip too 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.170
 the ball when we contact the salaz 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.759
 entrance vane like all boots 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.770
 looking for maximum speed has to 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.940
 be very stable do not want to separate 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.190
 to nowhere to clean of 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.369
 hitting gossip and it is very important 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.259
 know that it has the ending act the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.729
 All condition control is a finish for 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.319
 the area of ​​the housing that what has 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.600
 allow is that when the ball is 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.150
 wet or the boot is wet contact 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.860
 among them there exists no grit 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.930
 that does not slip and therefore we lose 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.340
 control over the ball passed to 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.780
 talk to the housing maybe it's the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.459
 element that gives less importance 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.660
 to the boot the only important thing is that 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.340
 like all the maximum speed boots 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.600
 we are interested in the player being the most 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.370
 possible stuck to the ground of the game 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.769
 the more we rise 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.629
 more unstable we will be and therefore also 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.879
 from a very thin plate we find ourselves 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.190
 with an especially thin template 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.019
 we can see that the profile is minimal and 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.930
 in addition it is even micro-perforated for 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.489
 that the best is not supported is the most 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.489
 been and as close to the ground as possible 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.600
 the last important element of the 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.890
 Steam improvement is the sole 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.870
 although the materials the casing what 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.700
 intended to give maximum lightness as is 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.870
 a boot to go at full speed the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.630
 sole that we have to contribute is 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.130
 traction and reactivity let's explain 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.170
 what part or what element does each 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.700
 one of these things the reactivity is going 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.350
 to bring this plate we have in color 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.790
 gray that is fiberglass is a 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.560
 very stable material in such a way that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.560
 in any lateral support we will have 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.790
 the perfect perfect support and at the same time 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.990
 It is a very reactive material 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.850
 this means that after each support 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.320
 in the city of glass it tends always to 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.970
 Regain your initial position of such 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.830
 way we're going to be prepared to 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.680
 the next support spending the minimum 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.900
 energy this in terms of reactivity 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.190
 and in terms of traction, the key is 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.840
 the tacos the special arrangement of 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.030
 tacos that always characterizes the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.489
 steam mix are tacos in triad that 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.800
 as we can see it has three edges of 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.030
 pull another way than on each 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.620
 of these supports we will always have 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.630
 traction whatever the direction on 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.890
 that we run a central taco that is 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.660
 which will provide stability in 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.489
 torn and braked and as a curiosity 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.290
 we have in the toe area also 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.520
 some small roughness and this is 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.110
 because players when they go to 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.280
 maximum speed usually pull 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.470
 about the envelope 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.850
 the toe is the first area that has 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.170
 contact with the ground 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.610
 therefore nike has wanted to reinforce this 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.140
 area for the player to have traction 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.140
 even in the most aggressive footsteps 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.660
 as it happens in all the brands besides 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.130
 of the high- end model that squeezes 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.989
 all the technology that can bring 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.270
 brand also take two models a range 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.380
 half and one lower the idea of ​​these 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.730
 models is to keep all 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.500
 properties of the high-end world is 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.669
 say a boot that brings speed to 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.260
 player or good that take advantage for the 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.270
 speed that generates that has a good 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.620
 traction but always with a reduction 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.440
 of materials to make them more 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.970
 economic and at the same time more durable if 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.830
 we talk about the gamut range model 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.290
 medium to fast model we are 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.639
 with which the housing is very similar has 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.770
 practically the same dimples that 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.020
 they have high-end model that if 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.240
 we lose the technology act we no longer have 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.830
 this treatment so that the contact 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.169
 between the ball and the low boot are 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.810
 wet are perfect other 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.250
 feature that it has is the attraction 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.660
 of the sole so having the same 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.190
 properties that the sole of the model of 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.169
 high end we can see that it is in 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.180
 our tickets the central taco of 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.100
 support but this time what 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.690
 we lose is the fiber plate of the 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.940
 Fiberglass plates is a sole 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.270
 traditional that have the same 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.070
 material that the profile of it 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.050
 and if we talk about the range model 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.510
 low we can see that it is not so 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.160
 marked the books of the casing since 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.110
 the material is different like throwing a 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.610
 little bit heavier and thicker but we 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.230
 will get much more 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.360
 duration is a lot more material 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.090
 resistant to different uses or the 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.100
 use in more more aggressive fields if we 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.780
 let's see the area of ​​the sole we see 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.850
 that also keeps some tacos with 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.950
 triads the central pilot taco already 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.960
 we lose all the long plates of the 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.850
 sole to provide reactivity and also 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.860
 as curiosity we see that in the area of 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.270
 heel we have a second row of tacos 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.040
 and this is because with these boots 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.050
 it is usually played on land 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.790
 harder so we need some 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.770
 how many more supports to distribute better 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.010
 the weight between each of the tacos of the 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.010
 zone
