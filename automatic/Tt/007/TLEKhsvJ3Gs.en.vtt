you know you can Vic just pick a curved
stick<00:00:23.699> off<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> floor<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.359> you've<00:00:24.510> got<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
stick off the floor and you've got a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.089 
stick off the floor and you've got a
rabbet<00:00:25.050> stick<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.160> certain<00:00:26.880> tribes<00:00:27.890> well<00:00:28.890> all

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
rabbet stick but certain tribes well all

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.980 
rabbet stick but certain tribes well all
tribes<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.640> use<00:00:29.849> these<00:00:30.090> throughout<00:00:30.779> history

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
tribes that use these throughout history

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.920 
tribes that use these throughout history
and<00:00:31.460> often<00:00:32.460> carve<00:00:32.969> them<00:00:33.180> down<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.630> make<00:00:33.780> them

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
and often carve them down to make them

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.840 
and often carve them down to make them
more<00:00:34.079> aerodynamic<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.219> they<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.579> greater

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
more aerodynamic so they can get greater

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.990 
more aerodynamic so they can get greater
distance<00:00:36.390> especially<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.980> open<00:00:38.219> grasslands

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
distance especially in open grasslands

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.790 
distance especially in open grasslands
where<00:00:39.300> they're<00:00:39.450> trying<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.780> hunt<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.620> things

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
where they're trying to hunt for things

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.060 
where they're trying to hunt for things
like<00:00:40.890> rabbits<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:42.000> know<00:00:43.070> land-dwelling

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
like rabbits and you know land-dwelling

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.510 
like rabbits and you know land-dwelling
rip<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.059> mammals<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.750> things<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.520> so

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
rip the mammals and things like that so

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.450 
rip the mammals and things like that so
this<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.390> piece<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.829> i've

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
this is just a piece of you that i've

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.389 
this is just a piece of you that i've
used<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> very<00:00:52.469> hard<00:00:53.100> wood

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
used to make this it's a very hard wood

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.420 
used to make this it's a very hard wood
very<00:00:54.120> dense<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.930> see<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.350> em<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
very dense you can see the em the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.029 
very dense you can see the em the
heartwood<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> middle<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:58.890> it's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
heartwood in the middle so you know it's

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.740 
heartwood in the middle so you know it's
going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> withstand<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.699> lot<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.879> impact<00:01:00.300> which

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
going to withstand a lot of impact which

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.420 
going to withstand a lot of impact which
it<00:01:01.350> has<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it has to do because this is a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.570 
it has to do because this is a
blunt-force<00:01:02.879> trama<00:01:03.629> weapon<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.369> know

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
blunt-force trama weapon so you know

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.550 
blunt-force trama weapon so you know
it's<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> need<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> deliver<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:07.110> hard

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
it's going to need to deliver some hard

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.940 
it's going to need to deliver some hard
hits<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.970> often<00:01:09.380> make<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.820> top<00:01:12.680> half<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
hits you often make the the top half a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.480 
hits you often make the the top half a
lot<00:01:14.330> weightier<00:01:15.330> than<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.290> end<00:01:16.530> I've

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
lot weightier than the this end I've

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.490 
lot weightier than the this end I've
carved<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.970> down<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> handle<00:01:19.259> part

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
carved it down so that the handle part

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.679 
carved it down so that the handle part
is<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> lot<00:01:19.979> sort<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> thinner<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.240> smaller

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
is a lot sort of thinner and smaller

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.850 
is a lot sort of thinner and smaller
whereas<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> tops<00:01:22.460> still<00:01:23.460> quite<00:01:23.700> chunky<00:01:24.860> it's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
whereas the tops still quite chunky it's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
whereas the tops still quite chunky it's
trying<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:26.970> get<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> bit<00:01:28.200> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
trying them you know get that a bit of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.090 
trying them you know get that a bit of
extra<00:01:28.560> distance<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.220> force<00:01:30.799> so<00:01:31.799> yeah<00:01:31.950> I'm

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
extra distance and force so yeah I'm

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.999 
extra distance and force so yeah I'm
just<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.490> set<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.299> few<00:01:33.450> targets<00:01:34.009> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
just going to set up a few targets and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
just going to set up a few targets and
I'll<00:01:35.250> show<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.030> what<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.329> throwing<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
I'll show you what it's like throwing it

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.920 
I'll show you what it's like throwing it
so<00:01:37.860> I've<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.100> done<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.430> poor<00:01:38.729> start<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> few

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
so I've now done this poor start a few

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.980 
so I've now done this poor start a few
practice<00:01:40.350> shots<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.570> hopefully<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.689> alright

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
practice shots so hopefully it's alright

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.800 
practice shots so hopefully it's alright
but<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.950> far<00:01:44.189> as<00:01:44.299> self-reliance<00:01:45.299> tool-making

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
but as far as self-reliance tool-making

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.810 
but as far as self-reliance tool-making
out<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.409> bush<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.890> know<00:01:46.920> this

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
out in the bush you know this

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.160 
out in the bush you know this
and<00:01:49.520> if<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.850> find<00:01:51.060> pretty<00:01:51.600> much<00:01:51.750> perfect

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and if you can find pretty much perfect

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.800 
and if you can find pretty much perfect
stick<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.620> may<00:01:52.920> only<00:01:53.159> need<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.490> little<00:01:54.210> sharp

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
stick you may only need a little sharp

stick you may only need a little sharp
rock<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:56.070> maybe<00:01:56.280> cut<00:01:56.580> a<00:01:56.610> few<00:01:56.940> things<00:01:57.120> down<00:01:57.390> but

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
rock to maybe cut a few things down but

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.620 
rock to maybe cut a few things down but
you<00:01:58.320> know<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.650> knife<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.250> you've<00:01:59.400> got<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> very

set a piece of piece of wood up knees
that's<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.720> target<00:02:19.230> say<00:02:20.190> it's<00:02:20.340> about<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.700> size

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
I'd say and then maybe similar to a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.229 
I'd say and then maybe similar to a
rabbit<00:02:29.390> it's<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.450> decent<00:02:30.810> target<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:33.030> I'll<00:02:33.120> just
