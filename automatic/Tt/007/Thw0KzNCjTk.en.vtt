00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
a spot where it's not going to be useful

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
a spot where it's not going to be useful
to<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.280> meaning<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> apple<00:01:51.090> logo<00:01:51.119> there<00:01:52.110> are

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
some league logos right now and it seems

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.880 
some league logos right now and it seems
that<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.390> was<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.750> designed<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.320> glow<00:01:55.590> either

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
that it was not designed to glow either

so no hot links from the iphone except

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.100 
so no hot links from the iphone except
for<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.850> fact<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.180> it's<00:02:00.390> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:00.960> big

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
for the fact that it's going to be big

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.440 
for the fact that it's going to be big
no<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.009> device<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.520> not<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.180> be

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
no one device that is not going to be

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
big but that could prove to make some

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.429 
big but that could prove to make some

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
we've already seen in the leaks which

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.970 
we've already seen in the leaks which
means<00:02:34.570> it<00:02:34.750> will<00:02:34.840> look<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.080> lot<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.410> an<00:02:35.590> iPhone

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
means it will look a lot like an iPhone

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.970 
means it will look a lot like an iPhone
yeah<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.030> apparently<00:02:37.720> there<00:02:38.200> will<00:02:38.350> be<00:02:38.470> a<00:02:38.500> 64

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
yeah and apparently there will be a 64

yeah and apparently there will be a 64
gig<00:02:39.010> variant<00:02:39.580> which<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.060> interesting<00:02:40.600> judging

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
gig variant which is interesting judging

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.870 
gig variant which is interesting judging
by<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.260> fact<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.710> there<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.190> no<00:02:42.460> expandable

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
by the fact that there is no expandable

by the fact that there is no expandable
storage<00:02:43.060> on<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.510> device<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.960> seems<00:02:44.170> and

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
storage on this device it seems and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.950 
storage on this device it seems and
