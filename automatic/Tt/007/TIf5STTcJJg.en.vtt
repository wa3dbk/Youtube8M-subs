nothing<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.680> really<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.850> prop<00:00:24.380> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.929 
nothing in it really just a prop and
sadly<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.980> doesn't<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.550> written<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.789> the

sadly it doesn't have it written on the
bond<00:00:27.890> but<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.949> thought<00:00:29.160> if<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.400> built<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.820> stand

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
bond but I thought if I built a stand

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.470 
bond but I thought if I built a stand
that<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.960> could<00:00:31.140> stand<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> shelf<00:00:32.270> it<00:00:33.270> can

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
that I could stand up on a shelf it can

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.810

right I got a another piece of scrap
board<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:15.150> lay<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.700> clamp

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
board to lay this on so that I can clamp

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.050 
board to lay this on so that I can clamp
it<00:01:18.150> well<00:01:18.299> from<00:01:18.509> both<00:01:18.689> sides<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.670> I'm<00:01:20.850> just

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
it well from both sides and I'm just

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:32.790 
it well from both sides and I'm just
gonna<00:01:22.130> put<00:01:23.130> some<00:01:23.159> glue<00:01:23.490> on

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.490 

take<00:01:33.800> too<00:01:34.010> much

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:02:04.390 

and<00:01:36.590> just<00:01:38.020> clamp<00:01:39.020> these<00:01:39.350> two<00:01:39.710> together

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.770 

I<00:02:04.490> have<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.180> be

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
I have to be

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:19.750 
I have to be
is<00:02:07.200> actually<00:02:07.429> perfect<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.580> suppose<00:02:18.230> now<00:02:19.230> that's

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
is actually perfect I suppose now that's

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.170 
is actually perfect I suppose now that's
blues<00:02:20.760> done<00:02:21.030> drying<00:02:21.650> that's<00:02:22.650> time<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.130> sand<00:02:23.940> it

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
blues done drying that's time to sand it

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.949 
blues done drying that's time to sand it
smooth<00:02:25.580> saying<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.760> your<00:02:27.090> smoothness<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
smooth saying that your smoothness and

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.920 
smooth saying that your smoothness and
that<00:02:28.200> extra<00:02:28.560> glue<00:02:28.709> off<00:02:29.030> got<00:02:30.030> my<00:02:30.239> little<00:02:30.420> black

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
that extra glue off got my little black

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.300 
that extra glue off got my little black
and<00:02:31.170> dig<00:02:31.290> around<00:02:31.440> sander<00:02:32.130> with<00:02:32.420> 80<00:02:33.420> grit<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
and dig around sander with 80 grit and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:52.069 
and dig around sander with 80 grit and
here<00:02:35.489> we<00:02:35.580> go

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.750 

so<00:02:53.079> that's<00:02:53.230> nice<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.010> smooth<00:02:54.310> all<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.700> way

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
so that's nice and smooth all the way

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.599 
so that's nice and smooth all the way
around<00:02:55.859> or<00:02:56.859> at<00:02:56.950> least<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.709> edges<00:03:00.129> are<00:03:00.310> smooth

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
around or at least the edges are smooth

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:01.319 
around or at least the edges are smooth
to<00:03:00.819> each<00:03:00.969> other

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
to each other

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:26.930 
to each other
switch<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.200> 240<00:03:02.890> M<00:03:03.930> over<00:03:04.930> it's<00:03:05.049> more

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.290 

now<00:03:27.940> that's<00:03:28.180> all<00:03:28.420> sanded<00:03:29.320> smooth<00:03:30.060> my<00:03:31.060> glue

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
now that's all sanded smooth my glue

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.000 
now that's all sanded smooth my glue
this<00:03:31.540> little<00:03:31.870> piece<00:03:32.050> on<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.350> bottom<00:03:32.710> to<00:03:32.830> hold

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
back

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.070 
back
hopefully<00:04:25.460> that'll<00:04:25.670> be<00:04:26.080> sufficient<00:04:27.080> stand

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
hopefully that'll be sufficient stand

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:48.770 
hopefully that'll be sufficient stand
back

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.280 

like<00:04:49.780> using<00:04:50.260> a<00:04:50.500> lot<00:04:50.980> of<00:04:51.010> glue<00:04:52.140> because<00:04:53.140> it

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
like using a lot of glue because it

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.310 
like using a lot of glue because it
seeps<00:04:53.530> out<00:04:53.740> when<00:04:53.950> you<00:04:54.040> press<00:04:54.310> things<00:04:54.550> together

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
seeps out when you press things together

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.910 
seeps out when you press things together
and<00:04:56.320> that<00:04:57.250> will<00:04:57.490> affect<00:04:58.180> how<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:58.900> stain<00:04:59.560> looks

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
and that will affect how the stain looks

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.210 
and that will affect how the stain looks
if<00:05:00.160> you<00:05:00.250> decide<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.610> stain<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.510> will<00:05:01.630> affect

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
if you decide to stain it it will affect

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.100 
if you decide to stain it it will affect
the<00:05:03.220> clear<00:05:03.490> coat<00:05:03.760> if<00:05:04.450> you<00:05:04.630> put<00:05:04.780> a<00:05:04.810> clear<00:05:05.080> coat

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
the clear coat if you put a clear coat

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.220
