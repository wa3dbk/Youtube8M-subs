scorestreaks except from UAV so that's

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.580

why<00:02:29.730> we<00:02:29.760> took<00:02:30.000> low<00:02:30.330> profile<00:02:30.840> it's<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.290> nice

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
why we took low profile it's a nice

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.250 
why we took low profile it's a nice
combination<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.610> works<00:02:33.090> really<00:02:33.540> effectively

this<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.209> when<00:03:18.420> stock<00:03:18.780> comes<00:03:19.080> in<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.560> will<00:03:19.620> make

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
this is when stock comes in it will make

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.310 
this is when stock comes in it will make
sure<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.489> can<00:03:20.640> move<00:03:20.790> faster<00:03:21.150> while<00:03:21.989> aiming

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320
