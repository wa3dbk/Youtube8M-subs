00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.289 
completely intact now I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.909> trim<00:02:03.240> my<00:02:04.009> pork<00:02:05.009> loin<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.430> about<00:02:05.640> 1/2

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
ahead and trim my pork loin in about 1/2

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.600 
ahead and trim my pork loin in about 1/2
inch<00:02:06.689> slices<00:02:07.049> here<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.129> makes<00:02:08.399> for

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
inch slices here I think that makes for

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.089 
inch slices here I think that makes for
a<00:02:08.640> really<00:02:08.910> nice<00:02:09.239> slice<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.629> meat<00:02:10.050> if<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.860> want

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
a really nice slice of meat if you want

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.040

you could go a little bit larger
you<00:02:13.200> could<00:02:13.380> even<00:02:13.500> go<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.710> little<00:02:13.860> bit<00:02:14.040> thinner

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
you could even go a little bit thinner

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.670
