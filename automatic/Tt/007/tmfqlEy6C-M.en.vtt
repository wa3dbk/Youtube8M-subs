town the third challenge is a lot harder
than<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.369> remember<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.789> being<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.019> fucked<00:00:31.289> up

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
than I remember it being and I fucked up

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.170 
than I remember it being and I fucked up
a<00:00:31.470> lot<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.099> video<00:00:32.309> was<00:00:32.430> about<00:00:32.579> 20<00:00:32.910> minutes

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
a lot and the video was about 20 minutes

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.060 
a lot and the video was about 20 minutes
long<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.230> ran<00:00:34.410> out<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.590> hard<00:00:34.770> drive<00:00:34.950> space

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
long and I ran out of hard drive space

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920 
long and I ran out of hard drive space
so<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.399> had<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.640> cancel<00:00:35.790> recording<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.510> restart

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
so I had to cancel recording and restart

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.729 
so I had to cancel recording and restart
when<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> fortunately<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.309> game<00:00:38.430> all<00:00:38.670> Doce

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
when the fortunately the game all Doce

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.350 
when the fortunately the game all Doce
so<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> couldn't<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.280> anything<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:44.360> so

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
so I couldn't do anything about that so

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.060 
so I couldn't do anything about that so
this<00:00:45.570> time<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.410> smart<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.370> went<00:00:47.579> for<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
this time I was smart and I went for the

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.709 
this time I was smart and I went for the
TKO<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.309> three<00:00:50.489> punches<00:00:50.879> first<00:00:51.590> now<00:00:53.719> you

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
TKO and three punches first now you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.299 
TKO and three punches first now you
could<00:00:54.870> probably<00:00:55.050> already<00:00:55.350> assume<00:00:55.829> how<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
could probably already assume how you

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.150 
could probably already assume how you
TKO<00:00:56.730> them<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.090> three<00:00:57.239> punches<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.920> by

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
TKO them and three punches and that's by

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.069 
TKO them and three punches and that's by
doing<00:00:59.520> his<00:00:59.699> one<00:01:00.000> hit<00:01:00.210> knocked<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.629> many

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
doing his one hit knocked down many

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
doing his one hit knocked down many
times<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.859> countering<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> rushing

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
times which is countering the rushing

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.260 
times which is countering the rushing
measure<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:04.280> actually<00:01:05.280> found<00:01:06.030> out

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
measure now I actually found out

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.630 
measure now I actually found out
something<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.960> that's<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.470> he<00:01:08.070> does<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
something and that's that he does the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.560 
something and that's that he does the
Russian<00:01:08.939> magic<00:01:09.270> attack<00:01:09.650> after<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.950> set<00:01:11.570> number

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
Russian magic attack after a set number

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.370 
Russian magic attack after a set number
of<00:01:12.780> punches<00:01:14.030> for<00:01:15.030> instance<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.600> his

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
of punches for instance I think his

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.249 
of punches for instance I think his
first<00:01:16.590> run<00:01:16.860> he<00:01:17.040> always<00:01:17.159> does

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
first run he always does

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
first run he always does
two<00:01:19.259> jabs<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:20.610> uppercuts<00:01:21.150> when<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.659> a

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
two jabs two uppercuts when a is a

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.210 
two jabs two uppercuts when a is a
Russian<00:01:22.020> magic<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.770> sit<00:01:25.979> here

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
Russian magic so if you just sit here

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.399 
Russian magic so if you just sit here
and<00:01:26.460> actually<00:01:26.580> dodge<00:01:27.119> you'll<00:01:27.810> get<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and actually dodge you'll get the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.030 
and actually dodge you'll get the
rushing<00:01:28.710> magic<00:01:29.009> attacks<00:01:29.250> faster<00:01:30.799> now<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.860> don't

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
rushing magic attacks faster now I don't

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.300 
rushing magic attacks faster now I don't
know<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> was<00:01:32.759> about<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.600> magic<00:01:33.930> attacks

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
know what it was about the magic attacks

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.999 
know what it was about the magic attacks
but<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.520> some<00:01:35.729> reason<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.740> mean<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> could

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
but for some reason I mean I could

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.149 
but for some reason I mean I could
almost<00:01:38.189> always<00:01:39.350> reliably<00:01:40.350> hit<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.890> first

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
almost always reliably hit that first

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.270 
almost always reliably hit that first
one<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> second<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.960> third<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.470> give<00:01:44.100> me

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
one for the second and third one give me

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.600 
one for the second and third one give me
so<00:01:44.430> much<00:01:44.579> trouble<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:45.649> don't<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.189> don't<00:01:47.490> even

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
so much trouble I don't I don't even

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.210 
so much trouble I don't I don't even
know<00:01:47.790> why<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.930> watch<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.470> here<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.040> it's
