00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:14.440
 Hey, okay, leaf 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:17.060
 but then the photographer and I see that in the 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.400
 sometimes my model on the front 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.740
 it is not lit and the bottom is 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.110
 illuminated or vice versa 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.840
 Why does this happen first? 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.520
 measurement mode you are using right 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.379
 the canon she has on her menu or for 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.340
 you choose the measurement mode 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.649
 let's go there average light matrix of 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.420
 totality of the image and sends 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.089
 sufficient for light balance and 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 shadows or she will make a 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:50.149
 reading the whole picture of the whole 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.300
 your eyepiece and there will make the compensation 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.239
 necessary for everyone but sometimes you 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.429
 has a very bright background and there the 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.460
 that the camera photometer will speak 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.889
 stl will match with photoshop looks 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.280
 you have a light there in excess background 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:09.409
 It's cool in here , but I'm going. 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.200
 send a light of balance and then he 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.390
 will leave the fund as it stands is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.780
 front will stay slightly raised exposed 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.560
 and then you have to do what you compensate 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.899
 in this case for more or less than 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.960
 according to the need 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:32.390
 but weighted way it means 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.659
 Measurement priority damage works for 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.520
 the light reflected in the center of the image that 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.770
 makes object the model has a 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.579
 exposure by keeping the areas of 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.670
 shadows 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.240
 When you put in weight what goes 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.409
 to happen 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.799
 the center of your eyepiece beyond your viewfinder 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:56.270
 will be the measurement area in 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:59.810
 predominance of your camera and there 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.789
 this measurement together with the flash will 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.100
 send the light necessary for your 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.899
 model 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.670
 so that is he will ignore the excess 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.580
 of use of the fund and will illuminate 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.300
 right here at the front then when 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.490
 You're going to photograph who does not have it. 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.440
 these configurations in the case of the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.080
 is showing there now already 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.990
 in the 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.000
 weighted metering on your equipment 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:33.260
 all have it there in the canon're beyond 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.240
 the normal function of the equipment 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.550
 I have 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:47.540
 it has here a weighted and 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:54.220
 matrix metering there reading mode in 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.270
 evolutionary English and covers 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.220
 matrix and weighted 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:06.230
 You 're going into the camera menu. 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:11.060
 It closed the year there from the beginning external 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:18.770
 speedlite control flash function 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:22.150
 the chat that is not ttl 2000 have either e 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:27.770
 ttl 2 metering mode and you choose 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:31.640
 matrix, and then you will have 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.120
 a much more correct measurement in the image 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.120
 yours
