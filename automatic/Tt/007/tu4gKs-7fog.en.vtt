00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
last video we looked at the song and we

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.270 
last video we looked at the song and we
made<00:00:39.899> some<00:00:40.350> decisions<00:00:40.649> about<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.190> we're

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
made some decisions about what we're

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.470

going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> left<00:00:41.879> hand<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> we

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
going to do in the left hand and we

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.139 
going to do in the left hand and we
decided<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.550> based<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.879> chord

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
decided that based on that chord

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.180 
decided that based on that chord
sequence<00:00:45.539> we're<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> use<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.920> bounce

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

now the thing to do now is we've got to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.389 
now the thing to do now is we've got to
decide<00:00:52.469> what<00:00:52.680> we're<00:00:52.800> gonna<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> right
