of<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.840> iPad<00:01:10.229> cover<00:01:10.530> where<00:01:11.189> it'll<00:01:12.180> flip<00:01:12.420> closed

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
of an iPad cover where it'll flip closed

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
of an iPad cover where it'll flip closed
here<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.409> flip<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> open<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.939> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
here you flip it open and then it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.800 
here you flip it open and then it
becomes<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:16.080> variable<00:01:18.140> mount<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:21.450> monitor

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
becomes a variable mount the monitor

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.929 
becomes a variable mount the monitor
itself<00:01:22.520> 720p<00:01:23.960> 60<00:01:24.960> Hertz<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.250> decent<00:01:26.790> quality

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
itself 720p 60 Hertz so a decent quality

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.910 
itself 720p 60 Hertz so a decent quality
gaming<00:01:27.330> monitor<00:01:27.630> especially<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.409> consoles

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
gaming monitor especially for consoles

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.590 
gaming monitor especially for consoles
which<00:01:29.130> you're<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.850> high

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
which you're not going to get high

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.200 
which you're not going to get high
refresh<00:01:30.960> rates<00:01:31.170> anyways

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
refresh rates anyways

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.969 
refresh rates anyways
so<00:01:33.210> definitely<00:01:34.020> good<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.770> could

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
so definitely good for that you could

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.950 
so definitely good for that you could
also<00:01:35.159> use<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.909> PC<00:01:36.299> monitor<00:01:36.659> there's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
also use this as a PC monitor there's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.390 
also use this as a PC monitor there's
nothing<00:01:37.259> stopping<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.979> power<00:01:38.189> around

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
nothing stopping you can power around

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.050 
nothing stopping you can power around
with<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.700> USB<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.590> if<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.759> USB

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
with the USB and if you do that one USB

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.210 
with the USB and if you do that one USB
3<00:01:42.420> rather<00:01:42.659> than<00:01:42.840> two<00:01:43.049> USB<00:01:43.380> 2<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.860> mean<00:01:44.040> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
3 rather than two USB 2 so I mean that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.590 
3 rather than two USB 2 so I mean that
will<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.399> more<00:01:44.579> convenient<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> regard

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
will be more convenient in that regard

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.380 
will be more convenient in that regard
and<00:01:45.869> then<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:47.040> use<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:47.939> monix

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and then you can use it for monix

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.569 
and then you can use it for monix
definitely<00:01:48.840> people<00:01:49.470> want<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> put<00:01:49.950> monitors

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
definitely people want to put monitors

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.910 
definitely people want to put monitors
and<00:01:50.759> briefcases<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.390> things<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.049> you

and briefcases or things like that you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.219 
and briefcases or things like that you
get<00:01:53.159> an<00:01:53.460> easily<00:01:54.149> powered<00:01:54.540> unit<00:01:54.899> that's<00:01:55.049> not

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
get an easily powered unit that's not

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.719 
get an easily powered unit that's not
going<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> power<00:01:55.890> breaker<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.520> full

Hertz<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.040> then<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.360> decent<00:02:33.930> flip<00:02:34.080> case<00:02:34.260> it's

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
Hertz and then a decent flip case it's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.190 
Hertz and then a decent flip case it's
very<00:02:34.710> portable<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.150> said<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.630> downside

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
very portable like I said the downside

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.820 
very portable like I said the downside
is<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.070> cable<00:02:38.610> length<00:02:38.850> if<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.420> can<00:02:39.830> get

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
is the cable length if you can get

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.430 
is the cable length if you can get
longer<00:02:41.670> cables<00:02:42.150> then<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.080> thing<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
longer cables then this thing the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.090 
longer cables then this thing the
increases<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.100> usability<00:02:44.630> exponentially<00:02:46.100> so

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
increases in usability exponentially so

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.870 
increases in usability exponentially so
that's<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.209> verdict<00:02:48.570> nice<00:02:49.050> device<00:02:49.440> poor<00:02:50.430> poor

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
that's the verdict nice device poor poor

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.949 
that's the verdict nice device poor poor
choice<00:02:51.150> around<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:52.140> board<00:02:52.350> on<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.620> cables<00:02:53.010> so

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
choice around the board on the cables so

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.140 
choice around the board on the cables so
that's<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.820> thank<00:02:56.820> you<00:02:56.880> guys<00:02:57.030> for
