00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.689
 We continue with more comments after 

00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:06.549
 triumph of lion to where they believe that 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.100
 you can get in the cup Which with 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.410
 liberators and the and lumps lion is 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.970
 champion your emeralds are going to be the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.850
 champion again 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.940
 jose arzáte champion if it does not come across 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.770
 to saints that also go very well and one 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.690
 believes they only reach the quarter-finals 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.610
 because the other teams are more 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.010
 complicated andrew what do you guys think 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.289
 how far will the fia be a good 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.600
 question is where will come saints and lion 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.569
 from the round of eighth finals 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.819
 of the beeston liberators cup that is 

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:39.789
 what most leaves you satisfied today 

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:42.909
 lion rock the way they played the 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.589
 how to play realize that rafa 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:47.920
 marquez spend the years still has a 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:50.109
 important footballing ability the 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.629
 change they had in so few days 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.740
 after the game against roosters 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.190
 whites in the lion 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.560
 if they owed him something they paid him and I think that 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.110
 they owe them a wool they gave a 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.880
 round performance this team defeat him 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.510
 so he presses with what I'm 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.870
 I support this is already how I remarked 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.210
 million but we're not ready in that 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.730
 is very good since the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.380
 party I think there was a moment 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.770
 in the first late time when 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.170
 impact I think the 22 where it looked very 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.350
 dangerous flamengo but if you go to the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.510
 90 minutes the lion overcame them 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.160
 I would say extensively but if I overcome the 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.270
 flamengo is not a reality it was a 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.830
 match 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.230
 the first time was great sensational 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.940
 rhythm and everything does one thing of everything 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.320
 we knew that I read no and jumped to the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.170
 court with two possibilities of 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.620
 score to win or draw for 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.690
 classify what we never imagined 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.450
 is that I lion be three times 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.150
 in advantage in the score in maracana 10 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.710
 21 and 32 but that reflects to you that it went to 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.660
 look for the win not the draw the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.310
 knowing that if you stayed tied with 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.630
 that's very advanced but if you go to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.240
 look for the tie 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.100
 Maybe you lose and it's more feasible 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.170
 simply the lion came out as he gives 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.750
 results he read it recited to the season 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.610
 last and in the season so then 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.610
 who is the champion 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.110
 very vertical it helps to propose came out 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.630
 with great determination with much 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.980
 character to all well unemployed and good the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.320
 reward is this 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.950
 to have won and once again you have 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.830
 we finished in 12 the previous one in 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.450
 the previous one we discussed here the three that 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.430
 it's not a team that is going to come out 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.350
 defend clear the characteristics of 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.630
 this team to be an offensive team the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.490
 Local visitor wherever and so 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.220
 they played the game is a brave match 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.290
 very good you have to remember the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.790
 people here there is very bad luck because the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.709
 ball will bounce you nacho gonzález 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.930
 from the address to william de arrow there 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.560
 to remind people that today 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.430
 flamengo played in maracana with the 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.690
 obligation to win to classify 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.780
 eighth finals of the ariston 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.690
 liberators and eliminate lion and ended 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.940
 losing one some moments of 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.620
 I pressed when the score was 2 x 2 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.040
 here at the start of the part 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.890
 complementary are good players is 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.019
 maracaná is a shirt that weighs but 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.590
 at the end lion for an annotation of 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.470
 Carlos the bullpen 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.989
 would get the winning goal with what 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.390
 which lion will play from the next 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.580
 week to the round of eighth finals of 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.800
 the liberators piston for all the 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.290
 people who ask us must wait for 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.410
 that tomorrow ends raul the phase of 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.810
 groups to fully assemble the table of 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.150
 conmebol of the 10 you are dedicated and 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.030
 know who plays against who is like that 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.620
 so decide the prize of the bullying of 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.790
 follow a ball because after 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.129
 having touched the ball could have been 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.280
 stay followed continued perfectly 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.110
 same final here it seems to me that for the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.760
 round for red is to say without place 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.140
 also giving him the best boxing and for 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.280
 we maneuver or maybe not 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.410
 exactly 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.390
 and well finally you will see joy of 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.709
 gustavo matosas got on the court 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.700
 Uruguayan technician at the end of the 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.230
 match 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.970
 one by one he gave his hand he gave him a 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.709
 I hug your players 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.480
 matosas knows more things won as a player 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.060
 the liberators defending the shirt 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.730
 from peñarol dad also his dad too 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.970
 he knows perfectly what it means 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.459
 play in maracana against flamengo 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.950
 party to life itself to life to death and 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.260
 win the three points you have to put 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.850
 independently of most of the 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.150
 footballers all that was a great 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.100
 match for a goalie who is in his 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.470
 third or second season of soccer 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.800
 professional will go to play maracana 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.270
 wrong in golf and then go out in 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.830
 the second time and have a very good 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.840
 acting also speaks very well of 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.970
 william road is not what value has 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.120
 this for Mexican football a value 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.420
 important it turns us around and it makes us 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.470
 if before we were the uncomfortable guest 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.290
 comfortable already in a few years we have already deleted 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.720
 that based on quality with the equipment 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.510
 who have participated we have 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.569
 participated in the liberators cup and 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.939
 today lion 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:11.219
 he did something very important to come back in that 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:14.300
 presence I have seen in this edition in 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:17.520
 the 2014 version of the liberators 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.349
 quite coherent arbitrations not when 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.919
 they have played Mexican teams either lion 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:25.379
 or saints in his time was different 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.300
 well yes a lot in many tournaments 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:29.699
 South American and not just in your cup 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.009
 America throughout the selection so 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.409
 I was thinking that there were 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.839
 many times and I can remember you many 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:39.089
 there is no case today in the half that was 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:41.309
 very good and good are very similar to 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:43.409
 not partial to any side or to 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:45.659
 local or at least for lion obviously 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.669
 the referee was very close 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.869
 of the plays the truth very well as 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.699
 better this move that had to be 

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:53.819
 been expulsion or certain details but 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.550
 in what was important it remained and you have to 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.779
 say mark or pressure despite the 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.699
 state was full 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.959
 it was an Argentinian Argentine hitch the 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.849
 level of arbitration not what you have is 

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:05.669
 pretty good said with all due respect 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.979
 there are other countries in your arbitration is of 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.779
 very low level and this also influences 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.810
 eskorzo malísimo for example the party 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:16.290
 lion bolivar 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:18.330
 very bad very bad then but good to 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.310
 this also you have to superimpose and 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.639
 I think what's important is how 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.620
 he planted today as he never resigned 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.660
 to his style of play he always went to 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.080
 front and in the end has the reward 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:35.009
 Ivan 22 that 70 minute and something almost 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.330
 we hit the man that we did not give him 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.880
 good that won lion that good that won 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.380
 lion but starting the second half of 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.030
 Valley go now what called me the 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.560
 attention is that none of the four 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.630
 that we are here we saw a loser comes out 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.720
 or nobody thought that the lion was going to 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.789
 lose the game for their positives 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.800
 optimists and mixed, well, there they are 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:54.960
 lion and saints since they knew that 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.530
 they were going to play the 2014 edition of Cup 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.260
 liberators said let's get ready 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:04.500
 is our priority and both are 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.060
 doing very but very good more is 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.760
 I do not like him to say a maracanazo 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.009
 we like a maracanazo maracanás was the 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.470
 from uruguay brasil is like they earn us 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:15.470
 they say another this case not this case the one of 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:19.199
 Costa Rica is once 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.030
 great triumph for a certain second team 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:24.080
 Mexican in history that beats him in 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.080
 maracana flamengo 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:31.280
 221 of the america and the lions 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.280
 we return to the last word
