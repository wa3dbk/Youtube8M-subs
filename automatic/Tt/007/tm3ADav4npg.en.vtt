science may give us only half the
answers<00:04:01.110> we<00:04:01.830> bring<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.160> into<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.580> onto<00:04:02.880> the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
answers we bring it into it onto the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.670 
answers we bring it into it onto the
site<00:04:03.270> which<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.200> film<00:04:04.410> was<00:04:04.590> taken

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.390 

I've<00:04:12.680> been<00:04:13.540> intuitive<00:04:14.540> all<00:04:15.140> my<00:04:15.590> life<00:04:15.800> I<00:04:17.350> we

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
I've been intuitive all my life I we

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.800 
I've been intuitive all my life I we
crystals<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:20.290> energy<00:04:21.290> and<00:04:22.150> now<00:04:23.150> I've<00:04:23.570> just

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
crystals and energy and now I've just

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.860 
crystals and energy and now I've just
been<00:04:24.020> called<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.740> read<00:04:25.070> energy<00:04:25.460> in<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.270> forest

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870

where there was a disturbance there was

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:49.190 
where there was a disturbance there was

period world tells me it was very hot

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:41.870 
period world tells me it was very hot
outside<00:05:32.150> and<00:05:34.070> it<00:05:35.070> was<00:05:37.100> friction<00:05:40.789> whether<00:05:41.789> or
