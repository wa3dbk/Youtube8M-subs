00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 so hello today I have praise again 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.790
 remodeled inside 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:14.340
 Although this is about open 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:17.190
 number eight in the luxury version so 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.119
 as it is called by opel bobinger 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.260
 Wood handle switch and polished blade 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:27.300
 in itself a nice knife 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.369
 I thought chest is a bit 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.340
 The first thing I did was go there 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:44.370
 I went and we have the sword 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:47.719
 sanded teardrop then have that 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.840
 polished off again so you can 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.449
 no board with others for that I saw 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.829
 not thought too 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.989
 then i have my crown off here 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.940
 had bid 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:05.780
 because like bullock I have below like her 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.610
 the stainless steel is polished 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:14.570
 So this time I went and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.340
 I have it built in here 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:23.130
 one side was weird 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:26.340
 at the stainless opel is the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.000
 sprint to the housekeeper so or here 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.950
 loses strong behind like in the back 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.610
 strong carbon so I have it now 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.720
 already seen 23 times and noticed and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.070
 this then I've just always so 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.600
 ground this time I am, however, 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.299
 had it easy up and went 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.700
 environment simple and better well then have 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.040
 I polished the crown and therefore the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.130
 biological gently runs or quiet 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.130
 running 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.530
 then I have here and in bremer 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.150
 taken out material 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.180
 but this time actually less five 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.880
 finger that I'll show you why 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.770
 I have done so only once by 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.110
 the front looks good 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.470
 From the front it looks good 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.820
 and yes I say that I'll go right through 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.230
 mean that I otherwise the things 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.730
 I could sand this one 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.480
 time here more and material 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.920
 take away speak i could do it right 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.959
 was actually her almost right 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.790
 around here too 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.750
 I gave birth to the Rhinelanders 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.239
 the commandment and lowered then I have 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.940
 I do not know anything but you can see me here 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:54.090
 more material is getting the shape 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.620
 otherwise beefier and down here and 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.959
 I took that away 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.780
 the slim one is up here that could be it 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.510
 probably do not recognize 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.130
 but I also took it away up here 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.500
 not for a little bit though 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.030
 once again ground that round it 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.489
 Another bit a bit better 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:17.570
 is yes and now why I'm here 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.570
 and had ruled out 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.239
 but that she has slept well 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.880
 you can see the open open the lettering 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.299
 nice and it has another one 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.280
 advantages or that I believe 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.880
 had pushed too far 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.319
 my how bullock how is pretty much 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.840
 easy so I can do it with one 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:45.480
 turn and that this is the logo 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:50.069
 I have now a 42 a compliant 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:57.390
 a country full of no blind as no 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:59.130
 sound breakthrough is and no that it 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.100
 still 42a compliant 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.209
 you have a role and you can do it 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:11.790
 open up without problems 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:13.230
 So it runs buttery soft and of the 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.330
 Legislation here can not do anything 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:22.380
 happen still afford legal 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:25.070
 that's the knife I have today 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.070
 done tomorrow 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.050
 thought I'll tell you I'll find it 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:39.229
 actually of the form, I find beautiful 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.229
 and I 'm looking forward to the fans 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.310
 Oh, and what I forgot that 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:52.610
 then I handle this time 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.080
 inside i heard him speak first 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.940
 I have it outside with clear lacquer 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.400
 painted only with clear marks this 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.110
 I let that print and then 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.110
 I have put the whole in oil 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.890
 completely so that here in her country 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.410
 Let's get into the groove where is the 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.830
 sword in inserts come in not as 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.200
 purely 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.950
 I would have to immerse and that can 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.950
 I since I do not have the possibility 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.130
 that to the open at number 8 luxury property 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.010
 Rebuilt version 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.890
 I hope you liked it thank you 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.580
 for a look 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.580
 Until next time
