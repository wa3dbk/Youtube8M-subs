00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 it's Thursday that Algerians will be 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.710
 called to the polls to elect their 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.839
 president of the republic grandissime 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.309
 favorite is the ghost candidate to that 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.490
 that we never see abdelaziz 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.780
 Bouteflika Hello Dany Cohn Bendit 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.099
 hello thomas we've already seen some 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.570
 weird things in elections but there 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.880
 in Algeria, we are still waiting for 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.770
 vertices at eight 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.300
 it's amazing it's worthy of a movie 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.090
 marx brothers those of charlie 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.279
 chaplin or who you finally want 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.080
 imagine a candidate who does not exist 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.810
 we do not know because we saw 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.030
 yesterday a year or two years because then 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.660
 Mr. Bouteflika could appear to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.030
 television 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.660
 but since he was a victim in April 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.260
 2013 of a stroke 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.050
 he was 80 days hospitalized in paris and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.260
 since we did not see it anymore so you have 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.329
 a candidate we do not really know if he 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.960
 can still speak if he can still 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.059
 move 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.610
 we do not really know what he can 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.590
 do what he can not do and you 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.140
 have ministers wandering around by 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.260
 algeria could to defend this 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.479
 ghost candidate this zombie a little bit and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.430
 it's an incredible story and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.900
 besides you say it's the big 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.670
 favorite yes you know that things 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
 are very good at june tidying up 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.600
 present in Algeria and that in fact we can 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.420
 give you the result he'll win a 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.790
 at between 75 and 80 2% 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.820
 as is always the case in Algeria 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.619
 really it's unimaginable 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 it's unimaginable and if I 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.890
 told this story or if I did not 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.430
 a filmmaker would make this movie not exaggerate 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.750
 still 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.880
 we would not have waited denis you say 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.380
 he will win but behind Bouteflika 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.000
 who will win who pulls the strings 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.430
 since if he is absent he is not 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.259
 no longer there but it's still the same 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.930
 these are the generals they are men 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.659
 all those who took advantage of 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.700
 privatization of gas oil and 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.640
 cetera who have what they put themselves 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.250
 full pockets and guy now heads 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.439
 the country and what's amazing is 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.869
 that I have generals did not find a 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.549
 successor to Bouteflika whom he 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.930
 would preside to bring someone else they 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.450
 could have been another match but that's 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.160
 yes but he could have but visibly 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.810
 because that draws for example the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.599
 candidate against 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.220
 Bouteflika Ali Benflis It seems that 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.680
 he is the candidate of the secret services 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.599
 so you have a few generals and 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.700
 their power and you have the services 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.130
 secrets that defend I do not know who 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.099
 other power that would actually want 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.750
 get your hands on the oil manna 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.730
 and on big business 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.040
 oilies that's a little what's playing 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.319
 behind they have not found so you 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.440
 will have a mummy you will have in Algeria a 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.300
 president mummies that will not appear and this 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.280
 which is worse after you go to see the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.980
 france the european union everyone 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.630
 is going to congratulate the mummy so the mummy is going 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.090
 receive telegrams that she does not 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.830
 will not be able to read so he will see himself 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.660
 phone calls that he will not be able to 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.239
 hear and everyone will be happy 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.530
 because we will say the lie to stability 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.420
 politics in Algeria it's 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.849
 improbable dany you mentioned 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.709
 ali benflis a number one opponent 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.630
 you know it you already have it 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.360
 met what are they going to him 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.090
 in quotation marks bah listen to him that's 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.099
 a technocrat he is he is from the seraglio to 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.459
 eilat and all his life he lived he has 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.480
 been secretary general of the fln he was 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.709
 Prime Minister 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.850
 it's as Prime Minister 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.920
 by the way who had received us as 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.340
 with a delegation when I was in 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.930
 Algeria 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.970
 it's a very fine man a real a real 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.950
 technician of power then what is 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.739
 that she is and the schism she was 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.150
 really divorce with those who are 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.340
 behind Bouteflika because of all 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.950
 Bouteflika way he must not be done 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.220
 to lure he does not decide anything well I 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.670
 believe that again precisely benefits 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.639
 wanted to put his hand just a little 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.730
 limit the powers of his generals to 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.530
 these families who benefits what I have 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.060
 already said about the oil windfall and that's 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.850
 for that he was ejected 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.950
 so I think what we do not know 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.079
 is what benifis today is a 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.700
 real competitor or what that 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.730
 it's a fake hare who want 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.829
 simply credibilize an election that 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.209
 does that's all an election all but 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.950
 especially not democratic modes to 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.750
 the election that will run so 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.269
 formal Thursday alongside the so the 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.280
 results since Bouteflika will be elected
