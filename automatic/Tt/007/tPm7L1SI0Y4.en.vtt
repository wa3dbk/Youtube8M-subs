00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.440
 It's my pedalboard 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.670
 of practice is that I have at home 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.030
 he only used four pedals 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.010
 the guitar signal between here to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.320
 this tuner that is a roll together of 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.110
 55 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.320
 here is the display that is very 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.320
 sparkly 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.130
 after this forest pedal is 1 s 2 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.560
 overdrive the distortion 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.580
 what 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.260
 and how I use it is more or less in 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.660
 these on this site 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.530
 this controls 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.650
 if from the middle to the left is a 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.500
 overdrive in the middle to the right is 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.580
 a distortion and gain control 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.559
 and the tone and this is the volume the 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.559
 Distortion level 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.780
 This is a strip of digitex 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.320
 this pedal by means of your iphone ipad or 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.220
 ipod you can put different effects 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.440
 Buy pedals as distortions 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.160
 modulations there are even up to 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.130
 acoustic simulator octava dores yo 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.190
 right now I have it on this pedalboard like 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.730
 a chorus that's why blue led 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:37.200
 and the ones I do not know they are because that's what 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.200
 give the phone 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.750
 very good pedal does not work with batteries 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.200
 only with power supply and after 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.020
 this pedal that does not have as chorus 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:55.120
 we went to a digital river with delay of 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:59.230
 r 400 that led is very powerful 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.980
 and this pedal has several functions here 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.980
 they have the modes 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.420
 there are 11 modes the first 3 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.990
 they are only delay 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.920
 the next four are delay with 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.920
 reverberations 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.450
 the delay is adjusted but the reverb 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.879
 it's fixed and it's brought from the factory 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.670
 and the last four are only 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.340
 reverb and with these two it 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.610
 manipulate 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:40.480
 the type of reverb that is if he 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.790
 and the level of the device 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.790
 all this I bring it working with a 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.390
 with a power org and a 16 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.390
 for 5 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:01.549
 all this I bring it mounted 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.549
 in a pear at 30 no 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.650
 that comes with that 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.140
 backpack to be transported that is 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.090
 is 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.830
 it's very small I bring nothing else 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.830
 because I rarely move it 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.560
 and this is all
