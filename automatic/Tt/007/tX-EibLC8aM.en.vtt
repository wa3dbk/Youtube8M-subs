00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.849

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.910
 for reviving so 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.760
 So I do not have to show the whole thing 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.700
 process once 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.550

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.140
 then cut matching knife always 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.140
 go through something so that does not hang 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.410

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:22.660
 put paper on paper and of course 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:27.910
