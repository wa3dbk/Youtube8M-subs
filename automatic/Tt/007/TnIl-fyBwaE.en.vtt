layer

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
layer

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.370 
layer
sorry<00:04:18.120> it's<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.420> double<00:04:18.750> layer<00:04:18.870> flower<00:04:19.170> that's

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
a single flower there and I think the

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.460 
a single flower there and I think the
bud<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.910> one<00:04:24.150> will<00:04:24.810> open<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.230> little

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
bud and this one will open a little

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.850 
bud and this one will open a little
later<00:04:26.390> you<00:04:27.390> can<00:04:27.570> see<00:04:27.780> there's<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.080> tube<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.680> the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
later you can see there's a tube in the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.340 
later you can see there's a tube in the
tube<00:04:29.100> they<00:04:29.820> are<00:04:29.880> giving<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.780> double<00:04:31.200> layer

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
tube they are giving it the double layer

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.710 
tube they are giving it the double layer
look<00:04:31.800> but<00:04:32.610> it's<00:04:32.760> definitely<00:04:32.910> different<00:04:33.600> than

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
look but it's definitely different than

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.240 
look but it's definitely different than
the<00:04:33.870> Erica<00:04:34.170> laton<00:04:34.260> which<00:04:34.560> is<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.710> single<00:04:35.070> layer
