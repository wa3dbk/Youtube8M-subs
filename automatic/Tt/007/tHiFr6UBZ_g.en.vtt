 version that the Pernambuco Romero Britto 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.660
 made the modernist work this fame is 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.000
 difficult than it will take me a three 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.000

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.390
 computer or play ball in a chair. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.909
 wheels but today at 28 years of age the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.369
 life has gained a new sense goes around 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.970
 seven hours a day creating new 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.100
 construction 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.610
 I want to do this, look at the work. 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.250
 account the eyes do not look not talked to pity 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.750
 mark can not draw who does the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.000
 drawings so that it produces the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.290
 montages is the owner kiko as he is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.540
 perfectionist 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.840
 at first he learned a little 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.960
 The basic is after that he was creating 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.960
 It is more and more he was inventing and he 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.400
 does not allow me to help this way in this 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.980
 part created for the first time 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.750
 mark won the audience teachers 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.960
 visited the memorial of inclusion if 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.910
 to his talent I found 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.860
 creativity for those who struggled 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.710
 to get a job the discovery 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.080
 of this gift brought the eleven 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.950

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.110
 permanent exhibition as videos about the 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.910
 inclusion of persons with disabilities is a 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.220
 space that we have to open for the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.010
 community we managed to do this 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.020
 then it is a place where people can 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.030
 come show your art 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.770
 this room of senses is totally 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.590
 dark so we can not show 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.540
 Here people feel smells hear 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.790
 sounds that can cheapen walls and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.940
 objects 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.280
 the purpose of the people's room is not 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.960
 awareness of their incentives. 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.730
