00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.940
 it comes to the next video here on the 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.650
 channel to the next player as today goes 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.460
 I believe it there in shape 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.920
 cesc fábregas in the really chelsea 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.920
 version and decent price of course 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.939
 because in the bbl plays around the 570,000 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.650
 I have paid for him moment 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.970
 almost no price there was somehow crazy 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.680
 he feeds and that's why he can not 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.900
 many say just yet whether costs 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.370
 I 550 paid five games five goals 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.730
 no template high medium work 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.739
 calculates skills and report 70 41 tempo 86 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.049
 dribbling I believe from the 80-year-old 95 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.100
 pass 70 the walls 75 header so 

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:46.570
 a very solid all-rounder and look 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.769
 but sometimes in the individual is that already 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.420
 You have to be pretty horny 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.129
 if that text gives him a chance 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.659
 to have such a player to draw 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.369
 Schoppe realize we look completely 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.960
 cheap ps a credit on credit 

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:56.769
 and so on and so on and manager 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.180
 could want to protect 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.070
 I would be very happy to drop by 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.960
 one click is enough and you are ready 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.030
 Well, I need help with that 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.250
 decided to run cesc fabregas to jurassic 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.049
 all and can therefore no 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.520
 information that came out 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.840
 are like jovetic about 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.540
 hopefully edgar prib i dont know where 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.860
 the whole on tuesday but because of that 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.390
 Nevertheless, it comes as a brand because of the 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.280
 looked pretty nice and I have him 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.440
 as tom played so why simply a 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.660
 first collect the script once the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.700
 best position for him would be me 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.690
 zm as sixth a bit too little 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.550
 the pending is also a bit too 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.710
 small but eighth I think 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.600
 with his 179 tall enough also has with 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.380
 68 with quite solid strengths must be quite 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.130
 honestly say that suddenly 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.510
 a little better 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.920
 we do have it's agility though 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.300
 last spit as a sixth 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.430
 maybe not great in battles 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.550
 as the eighth for working with forward 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.659
 work with a high degree of sophistication 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.950
 I do not tell the seizure 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.690
 best but definitely win 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 a very good choice, I would times 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.590
 Of course, as tens would also say 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.940
 well suited there are but some 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.950
 mankos and I will do them now 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.810
 First of all, explain has a good one 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.070
 Tempo 170 is sufficient for a 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.900
 tens not as fast as it is 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.090
 For example, but in any case 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.830
 sufficiently unfortunately no lecture goes 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.540
 or forrester report the whole again 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.890
 Bite down rips but still goes 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.019
 that be reasonably clear because 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.360
 he is also very good at dribbling 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.920
 has no agility as I said before 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.950
 Nevertheless, his ball control extremely cool 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.740
 so that always good to the 95 areas 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.420
 I think for yourself because factory it is 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.550
 someone from his players 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.349
 lives and also in fifa he has 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.940
 a mega precise pass can be good 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.200
 flanks can pass well long 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.030
 beat short passes beat learned 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.980
 Mega Evers his financial crisis extreme 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.720
 I'll just make it fit 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.230
 monster and that fits quite well 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.310
 little fish i have now 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.690
 more likely than welcome to 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.890
 shot and school 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.120
 bit with that mayer has the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.430
 shootings at a tattoo in very very 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.140
 important and he has very high shooting power 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.120
 and this is really impact and 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.800
 He shot very good long are 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.150
 not so precise but she goes 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.769
 In any case because she is also powerful 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.940
 especially the finesse shot have 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.920
 I already people me she now yes 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.930
 also again is very very good 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.150
 however, it is not the final strength 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.319
 candle on the chandelier that's one 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.569
 be a bit of a disadvantage because 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.720
 conclusion on if there are 88 over card 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.760
 not that is not 88 definitely not 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.170
 his header, on the other hand, is pretty much in 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.870
 order so you can talk to him on each one 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.459
 case heads 75 is okay for us currently 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.890
 that's definitely enough to buy or to 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.090
 can win the hands can also that is 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.680
 as a tenth, the wave can be back 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.540
 work and so on and so on 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.590
 Everything fits, unfortunately, as I said the 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.000
 conclusion is a bit the maneuver 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.370
 ball as a counter you come for the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.329
 conclusion situation and thus can 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.250
 not so good with me 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.540
 Incidentally, I do not have a few games 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.890
 I do not have that many clips so much 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.150
 shown you because I thought that was 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.370
 Class excellent and I do not have 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.859
 more focused on completing and 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.720
 a little something positive still with him 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.859
 of course, league nations spain mountain 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.200
 henry is not doing any better than 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.640
 combination is negative but that 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.290
 Price because of the really very high 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.480
 and I think the new information has 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.950
 well not too bad values ​​too 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.540
 So there is no huge difference 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.950
 doing positive negative decent 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.380
 pace route strength and size even if it's 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.850
 It does not really work that way 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.190
 Startschuss very good excellent 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.239
 pass match proper defense values ​​so 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.560
 you can definitely one more 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.359
 sixth or eighth play good 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.130
 national league and variably applicable as 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.780
 on every position from cdm to 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.400
 Striker I would even say you can 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.350
 use with 880 would have to find that he 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.730
 Normally the finishing works 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.859
 a negative aspect as well as his 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.390
 agility skills and rico and of course 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.920
 the extremely high price because one 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.870
 full version not necessarily so much 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.340
 has worse value and clearly 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.979
 significantly cheaper in the end 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.360
 we come up with a rating of 8 5 out of 10 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.860
 for factory it may have here 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.080
 but he would find it bad 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.330
 I do not find no question but he is 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.550
 definitely not worth the price and it 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.160
 would 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.720
 I give a thumb down diagonally 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.340
 so not direct and because he was yes 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.080
 not bad but he really is 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.310
 extremely expensive and that brings the whole 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.720
 thing a bit to tip I think 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.280
 time we can relate to that 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.660
 that was better of this player than 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.580
 if so please let and pose 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.720
 pleased writes me it is 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.530
 fallen and then we'll meet 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.270
 greet again soon 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.780
 wonderful day until next time 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.780
 on pure
