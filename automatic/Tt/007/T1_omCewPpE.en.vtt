00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
big comes out with jelly bean it's a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.410 
big comes out with jelly bean it's a
little<00:04:22.810> bit<00:04:22.930> smaller<00:04:26.310> this<00:04:27.310> is<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.760> think<00:04:28.300> this

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
little bit smaller this is I think this

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.190

has a keyboard keyboard and touchscreen
your<00:04:32.200> teen<00:04:32.470> interface<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:33.730> does<00:04:34.120> I<00:04:34.330> think

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
your teen interface of this does I think

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.230 
your teen interface of this does I think
slide<00:04:35.080> up<00:04:35.110> here<00:04:35.430> keyboard<00:04:36.430> so<00:04:36.580> this<00:04:36.760> does<00:04:37.030> come

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
slide up here keyboard so this does come

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.000 
slide up here keyboard so this does come
with<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.450> keyboard<00:04:39.600> it<00:04:40.600> will<00:04:40.630> play<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.590> same

stuff web browser the same email

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.500 
stuff web browser the same email
probably<00:04:48.610> about<00:04:48.730> the<00:04:48.880> same<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:52.060> only<00:04:52.270> thing

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
probably about the same the only thing

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.170 
probably about the same the only thing
is<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.800> this<00:04:53.919> is<00:04:54.010> 3d<00:04:54.340> camera<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.970> growth<00:04:55.150> of

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
is so this is 3d camera the growth of

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:03.020 
is so this is 3d camera the growth of
mp3<00:04:56.550> both<00:04:57.750> gps<00:04:58.770> Wi-Fi<00:05:00.600> right<00:05:01.600> there<00:05:01.930> 4G<00:05:02.770> LTE

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
mp3 both gps Wi-Fi right there 4G LTE

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.659 
mp3 both gps Wi-Fi right there 4G LTE
