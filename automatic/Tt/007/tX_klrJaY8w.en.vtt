00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
going through the LPN program I was an

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.710 
going through the LPN program I was an
LPN<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.519> when<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:38.970> while<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.360> was<00:02:39.480> enrolled

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
LPN so when I was while I was enrolled

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.890 
LPN so when I was while I was enrolled
into<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> LPN<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.980> RN<00:02:41.069> program<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:42.120> was<00:02:42.569> working

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
into the LPN to RN program I was working

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.990 
into the LPN to RN program I was working
as<00:02:42.989> LPN<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.860> wasn't<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.160> stressful<00:02:44.670> as

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
as LPN so it wasn't that stressful as

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.809 
as LPN so it wasn't that stressful as
far<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.450> was<00:02:45.599> stressful<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:47.190> wasn't<00:02:47.610> as

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
far it was stressful but it wasn't as

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.170 
far it was stressful but it wasn't as
stressful<00:02:48.269> because<00:02:49.200> i<00:02:49.410> was<00:02:49.680> working<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.819> i

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
stressful because i was working so i

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.819 
stressful because i was working so i
think<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.480> stressful<00:02:51.780> part<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.170> Nursing<00:02:52.680> is

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
think the stressful part of Nursing is

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.270 
think the stressful part of Nursing is
trying<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.310> balance<00:02:53.750> working<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.040> one's<00:02:56.040> got

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
trying to balance working and one's got

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.330 
trying to balance working and one's got
the<00:02:56.400> same<00:02:56.579> time<00:02:57.680> whichever<00:02:58.680> if<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.099> already

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the same time whichever if you already

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.270 
the same time whichever if you already
are<00:02:59.760> an<00:02:59.910> LPN<00:03:00.360> are<00:03:00.599> in<00:03:00.810> school<00:03:01.079> is<00:03:01.319> really<00:03:01.620> not

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
are an LPN are in school is really not

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.970 
are an LPN are in school is really not
bad<00:03:02.519> honestly<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.360> like<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:04.620> reason<00:03:04.769> why<00:03:04.950> I

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
bad honestly it's like the reason why I

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.770 
bad honestly it's like the reason why I
became<00:03:05.160> an<00:03:05.430> elephant<00:03:05.760> before<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.060> became<00:03:06.269> an<00:03:06.420> RN

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
became an elephant before I became an RN

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.170 
became an elephant before I became an RN
is<00:03:07.190> because<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.370> wanted<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.640> make<00:03:08.849> sure<00:03:08.879> that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
is because I wanted to make sure that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.089 
is because I wanted to make sure that
nursing<00:03:09.540> was<00:03:09.660> for<00:03:09.870> me<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.049> wanted<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.590> before<00:03:10.920> I

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
nursing was for me I wanted to before I

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.460 
nursing was for me I wanted to before I
invested<00:03:11.579> my<00:03:11.610> time<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.150> my<00:03:12.269> money<00:03:12.470> into

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
invested my time and my money into

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.750 
invested my time and my money into
something<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:13.980> really<00:03:14.220> didn't<00:03:14.579> know<00:03:14.730> much

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
something that I really didn't know much

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.520 
something that I really didn't know much
of<00:03:15.109> I<00:03:16.109> wanted<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.739> go<00:03:16.859> through<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.400> 12-month<00:03:18.530> LPN
