00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.270
 winner of the prologue the triple world champion in the time trial 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.580

 15:59 andy schleck dashes 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.170
 he is very concentrated 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.110
 this is his last chance to retake compliments on alberto contador 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.770

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.439
 16h02 alberto contador will give the first laps

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.200
 the Luxembourgish created the surprise on the road of the turn by dominating his 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.930
 vis-à-vis for the moment 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.670
