00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.780 
I'm hoping that this is in focus because
I'm<00:03:06.180> holding<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.659> with<00:03:06.870> my<00:03:07.019> hand<00:03:07.790> they're

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
I'm holding this with my hand they're

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.280 
I'm holding this with my hand they're
very<00:03:09.239> pretty<00:03:11.030> so<00:03:12.030> as<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.389> can<00:03:12.510> see<00:03:12.689> the<00:03:12.840> very

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
very pretty so as you can see the very

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.920 
very pretty so as you can see the very
pigmented<00:03:13.680> they<00:03:14.189> can<00:03:14.459> be<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> little<00:03:15.090> messy<00:03:15.419> I

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
pigmented they can be a little messy I

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.559 
pigmented they can be a little messy I
think<00:03:16.409> that<00:03:16.620> naturally<00:03:17.340> matte<00:03:17.669> shadows<00:03:18.239> do

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
think that naturally matte shadows do

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.349 
think that naturally matte shadows do
have<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> bit<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.319> a<00:03:19.500> chalky<00:03:19.829> pneus<00:03:20.189> to<00:03:20.400> them<00:03:20.609> but

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
have a bit of a chalky pneus to them but

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.629 
have a bit of a chalky pneus to them but
when<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.019> was<00:03:22.259> applying<00:03:22.530> these<00:03:22.889> I<00:03:22.949> didn't<00:03:23.489> have

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
when I was applying these I didn't have

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.479 
when I was applying these I didn't have
any<00:03:23.909> fallout<00:03:24.509> at<00:03:24.720> all<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.349> that's<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.310> my

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
any fallout at all so that's just my

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.789 
any fallout at all so that's just my
personal<00:03:26.970> opinion<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.049> hope<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.530> that

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
personal opinion and I hope that that

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.399 
personal opinion and I hope that that
helps<00:03:28.859> but<00:03:29.519> they're<00:03:30.030> really<00:03:30.540> pretty<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:31.019> very

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
helps but they're really pretty it very

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.619 
helps but they're really pretty it very
pigmented<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.370> they're<00:03:32.519> all<00:03:32.699> matte<00:03:33.090> so

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
pigmented and they're all matte so

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.509 
pigmented and they're all matte so
that's<00:03:33.989> what<00:03:34.199> I<00:03:34.229> think<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.650> really<00:03:34.680> cool<00:03:35.310> about

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
that's what I think is really cool about

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.550 
that's what I think is really cool about

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
that this shade was the only shade that

to disagree I definitely think that this
is<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.739> matte<00:04:14.009> shade<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.909> doesn't<00:04:15.269> have<00:04:15.449> any

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
is a matte shade it doesn't have any

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.880 
is a matte shade it doesn't have any
shimmer<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:16.489> it's<00:04:17.030> a<00:04:17.750> really<00:04:18.080> pretty<00:04:18.470> Navy

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
shimmer to it it's a really pretty Navy

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.710 
shimmer to it it's a really pretty Navy
I<00:04:19.070> thought<00:04:19.459> it<00:04:19.580> was<00:04:19.670> going<00:04:19.790> to<00:04:19.850> be<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.000> black<00:04:20.360> but

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
I thought it was going to be a black but

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.990 
I thought it was going to be a black but
it's<00:04:20.870> actually<00:04:21.080> just<00:04:21.650> this<00:04:21.890> really<00:04:22.190> deep<00:04:22.610> Navy

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
it's actually just this really deep Navy

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.900 
it's actually just this really deep Navy
it's<00:04:23.420> gorgeous<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:25.040> consistency<00:04:25.460> of

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
it's gorgeous and the consistency of

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.510 
it's gorgeous and the consistency of
these<00:04:26.300> shadows<00:04:26.780> reminds<00:04:27.320> me<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.620> lot<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.130> the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
these shadows reminds me a lot of the

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.330 
these shadows reminds me a lot of the
lorac<00:04:29.000> Pro<00:04:29.450> palette<00:04:29.620> that<00:04:30.620> is<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.310> only

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
lorac Pro palette that is the only

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.820 
lorac Pro palette that is the only
comparison<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.450> I<00:04:32.510> can<00:04:32.780> make<00:04:33.020> because<00:04:33.320> I

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
comparison that I can make because I

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.520 
comparison that I can make because I
have<00:04:34.460> never<00:04:34.700> used<00:04:35.090> kat<00:04:35.510> von<00:04:35.720> d<00:04:35.870> I<00:04:36.080> shadows
