00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello friends from youtube I love you 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.420
 explain how they touch are Cuban 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.550
 soloist with bass and chords of two 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.309
 different ways first the most 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.590
 important is to have the clear bass the 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:18.269
 under the sun and can also be applied 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.269
 a little bit like the sauce is the following 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.460
 after giving this 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.880
 in the left hand I will do the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.980
 less 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.719
 then the idea with this hand that is the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.719
 who have the secret is the following 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.940
 do not 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.879
 and now what I'm going to do is instead of 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.309
 do in block here the three fingers 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.050
 you can do one by one 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.980
 there are two provisions with provision for 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.589
 first rope the second and is 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.379
 in the first or in the other form of 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.690
 doing it is these three fingers is running in 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.259
 an entity study that in the second 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.820
 that stays in the third and in which 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.080
 is one can also play with those two 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.380
 they are skills that go within the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380
 chord 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.329
 a little bit more serious 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.299
 and now I'm going to do another rhythm with 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.580
 they are already moving these three 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.100
 times as well moving the three fingers 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.500
 I have to get it done as if lying down 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.890
 the same as the piano does but doing it 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.570
 here on the guitar is alternating or 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.250
 joining the go with one of the three 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.920
 notes 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.140
 and generating with a half melody but 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.140
 that accompanies would be the following way 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.170
 i 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.580
 i 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.680
 this 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.590
 and the idea is to play with those two depends 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.570
 of the color of the stanza depend the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.520
 intention of the melody of the song 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.880
 as such it can not be deduced to tracks 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.340
 dynamics in the right hand ready now 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.410
 I'm going to change the agreed to the idea too 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.150
 with this is that with time one goes 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.790
 independent a little more the bass 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.120
 just explain in another video then the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.120
 idea is to make it smaller and bigger 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.360
 and 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.360
 so loose in block 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.360
 um 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.909
 ah 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.100
 ah 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.890
 and that's it 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.890
 next I will explain more with the bass
