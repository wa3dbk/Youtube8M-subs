00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
go up there to the ears and then you can

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.389 
go up there to the ears and then you can
cut<00:00:44.309> off<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> top<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.940> circle<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:47.160> eyes

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
properly done in perspective so I'll

00:04:42.380 --> 00:05:07.120 
properly done in perspective so I'll
destroy<00:04:42.680> you<00:04:42.740> another<00:04:43.039> one<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.340> show<00:04:43.490> you<00:05:06.130> try

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
another one

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.510 
another one
okay<00:05:08.630> looking<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.650> other<00:05:09.710> way<00:05:09.860> so<00:05:10.010> this<00:05:10.250> is

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
okay looking the other way so this is

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.270 
okay looking the other way so this is
two<00:05:10.849> friends<00:05:12.010> we<00:05:13.010> got<00:05:13.160> a<00:05:13.190> circle<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.800> the<00:05:15.919> ears

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
two friends we got a circle and the ears

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.070 
two friends we got a circle and the ears
okay<00:05:17.210> more<00:05:17.419> of<00:05:17.479> a<00:05:17.570> kind<00:05:17.690> of<00:05:17.780> perspective

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
okay more of a kind of perspective

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.680 
okay more of a kind of perspective
instead<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:18.950> having<00:05:19.130> this<00:05:19.970> one<00:05:20.240> has<00:05:20.419> a<00:05:20.450> kind<00:05:20.660> of

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
instead of having this one has a kind of

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.300 
instead of having this one has a kind of
a<00:05:20.780> line<00:05:20.960> down<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:21.260> middle<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:21.680> it's<00:05:21.860> equal<00:05:22.190> on

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
a line down the middle and it's equal on

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.510 
a line down the middle and it's equal on
either<00:05:22.460> side<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:23.180> have<00:05:23.960> a<00:05:24.050> curve<00:05:24.500> going<00:05:25.130> like

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
either side I have a curve going like

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.529 
either side I have a curve going like
that<00:05:25.789> so<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.150> makes<00:05:26.330> it<00:05:26.450> more

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
that so it makes it more

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.110 
that so it makes it more
three-dimensional<00:05:27.580> there's<00:05:28.580> a<00:05:28.669> line<00:05:28.849> going

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
three-dimensional there's a line going

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:40.870 
three-dimensional there's a line going
across<00:05:29.240> the<00:05:29.570> middle<00:05:36.099> that<00:05:38.320> looks<00:05:39.880> more

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
across the middle that looks more

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.240 
across the middle that looks more
correct<00:05:41.270> already<00:05:41.720> again<00:05:42.680> there's<00:05:42.919> that<00:05:43.010> kind

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
correct already again there's that kind

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.210 
correct already again there's that kind
of<00:05:43.310> body<00:05:43.880> bit<00:05:44.470> front<00:05:45.470> leg<00:05:45.710> front<00:05:46.010> leg<00:05:46.370> back<00:05:46.849> leg

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
of body bit front leg front leg back leg

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:59.100 
of body bit front leg front leg back leg
pause<00:05:56.199> poor<00:05:57.199> mark<00:05:57.470> thing<00:05:57.710> just<00:05:57.919> as<00:05:58.039> a<00:05:58.070> guide

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
pause poor mark thing just as a guide

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.159 
pause poor mark thing just as a guide
and<00:06:00.490> so<00:06:01.490> now<00:06:01.849> we<00:06:01.910> go<00:06:02.210> around<00:06:02.330> and<00:06:02.720> because

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
and so now we go around and because

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.850 
and so now we go around and because
we've<00:06:03.380> got<00:06:03.560> that<00:06:03.770> curve<00:06:05.380> coming<00:06:06.380> here<00:06:06.830> that

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
we've got that curve coming here that

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.240 
we've got that curve coming here that
kind<00:06:07.310> of<00:06:07.340> just<00:06:07.490> makes<00:06:07.729> it<00:06:07.880> look<00:06:08.710> more<00:06:09.710> correct

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
kind of just makes it look more correct

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
kind of just makes it look more correct
somehow

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
somehow

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.850 
somehow
I<00:06:11.300> think<00:06:12.050> so<00:06:12.229> anyway<00:06:13.750> do<00:06:14.750> let<00:06:14.960> me<00:06:14.990> know<00:06:15.110> if<00:06:15.680> you

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
I think so anyway do let me know if you

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.409 
I think so anyway do let me know if you
think<00:06:16.039> so<00:06:16.310> if<00:06:16.430> it's<00:06:16.610> worth<00:06:16.819> that<00:06:17.090> kind<00:06:17.300> of

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
think so if it's worth that kind of

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:44.730 
think so if it's worth that kind of
effort<00:06:17.630> to<00:06:18.669> to<00:06:19.669> do<00:06:19.819> that<00:06:20.000> extra<00:06:20.389> bit<00:06:33.849> and<00:06:34.849> what

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.649 

and<00:06:45.740> with<00:06:45.919> that<00:06:46.099> plan<00:06:46.819> there<00:06:47.120> you<00:06:47.270> could<00:06:47.479> make

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
and with that plan there you could make

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:52.180 
and with that plan there you could make
this<00:06:47.810> a<00:06:50.139> stripy<00:06:51.139> cap<00:06:51.380> thing<00:06:51.590> is<00:06:51.680> you're<00:06:51.860> gonna

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190
