garden at this time of year that much
but<00:00:18.520> just<00:00:18.550> because<00:00:18.970> you're<00:00:19.150> not<00:00:19.269> working<00:00:19.720> in

the garden it doesn't mean that your

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.099 
the garden it doesn't mean that your
garden<00:00:21.730> can't<00:00:22.000> still<00:00:22.269> be<00:00:22.390> working<00:00:22.539> for<00:00:22.960> you

I've got quite a lot of vegetables that
are<00:00:25.090> still<00:00:25.269> out<00:00:25.359> here<00:00:25.390> surviving<00:00:25.900> at<00:00:26.199> this

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
are still out here surviving at this

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.050 
are still out here surviving at this
time<00:00:26.529> of<00:00:26.679> the<00:00:26.769> year<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.130> more<00:00:27.640> that<00:00:27.789> I'm<00:00:27.880> just

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
time of the year and more that I'm just

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.359 
time of the year and more that I'm just
going<00:00:28.240> to<00:00:28.330> plant<00:00:28.599> today<00:00:29.019> and<00:00:29.380> there's<00:00:30.099> three

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
going to plant today and there's three

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.800 
going to plant today and there's three
main<00:00:30.699> reasons<00:00:30.939> that<00:00:31.269> you<00:00:31.390> want<00:00:31.539> to<00:00:31.630> try

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
main reasons that you want to try

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.010 
main reasons that you want to try
overwintering<00:00:32.529> your<00:00:32.710> veg<00:00:32.950> so<00:00:33.820> down<00:00:34.030> here<00:00:34.330> this

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
overwintering your veg so down here this

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.900 
overwintering your veg so down here this
is<00:00:35.230> probably<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.800> most<00:00:35.830> traditional<00:00:36.220> reason

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
is probably the most traditional reason

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.190 
is probably the most traditional reason
that<00:00:37.090> you<00:00:37.240> would<00:00:37.360> want<00:00:37.540> to<00:00:37.600> over<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:37.960> into

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
that you would want to over you into

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.630 
that you would want to over you into
your<00:00:38.350> veg<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.740> that's<00:00:39.010> to<00:00:39.130> have<00:00:39.250> something<00:00:39.550> to

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
your veg and that's to have something to

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.180 
your veg and that's to have something to
eat<00:00:39.760> throughout<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.390> winter<00:00:40.810> months<00:00:40.840> so<00:00:41.350> this

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
eat throughout the winter months so this

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.060 
eat throughout the winter months so this
down<00:00:42.430> here<00:00:42.760> is<00:00:43.180> kale<00:00:43.630> and<00:00:43.930> kale<00:00:44.560> is<00:00:44.770> a<00:00:44.800> very

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
down here is kale and kale is a very

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.340 
down here is kale and kale is a very
very<00:00:45.340> Hardy<00:00:45.700> vegetable<00:00:46.180> that's<00:00:46.780> very<00:00:47.080> good<00:00:47.230> to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
very Hardy vegetable that's very good to

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.500 
very Hardy vegetable that's very good to
grow<00:00:47.500> in<00:00:47.680> Scotland<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.370> it<00:00:48.940> should<00:00:49.180> survive

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
grow in Scotland and it should survive

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.600 
grow in Scotland and it should survive
the<00:00:49.780> worst<00:00:49.960> of<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.230> winter<00:00:50.350> weather<00:00:50.710> I've

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
the worst of the winter weather I've

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.760 
the worst of the winter weather I've
also<00:00:51.820> got<00:00:52.150> in<00:00:52.360> this<00:00:52.570> bed<00:00:52.810> some<00:00:53.440> purple

sprouting broccoli which isn't quite as
Hardy<00:00:56.170> but<00:00:56.350> should<00:00:56.560> survive<00:00:56.920> up<00:00:57.430> until<00:00:57.760> about

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
leaves that will also survive outside in

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.740 
leaves that will also survive outside in
the<00:01:02.290> winter<00:01:02.560> unprotected<00:01:03.340> this<00:01:04.000> one<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.420> corn

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
the winter unprotected this one is corn

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.529 
the winter unprotected this one is corn

patch of corn salad also demonstrates
block<00:01:09.939> planting<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.840> raised<00:01:11.380> beds<00:01:11.409> you<00:01:12.159> see

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
block planting in raised beds you see

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.099 
block planting in raised beds you see
how<00:01:12.490> all<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.759> plants<00:01:13.090> are<00:01:13.270> equidistant<00:01:13.719> from

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
how all the plants are equidistant from

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.789 
how all the plants are equidistant from
each<00:01:14.350> other

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
each other

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.469 
each other
the<00:01:15.310> second<00:01:15.700> reason<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:16.060> grow<00:01:16.240> vegetables

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
the second reason to grow vegetables

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.539 
the second reason to grow vegetables
over<00:01:17.079> the<00:01:17.170> winter<00:01:17.469> is<00:01:17.679> not<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:18.070> actually<00:01:18.369> eat

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
over the winter is not to actually eat

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.069 
over the winter is not to actually eat
them<00:01:18.729> through<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.210> winter<00:01:19.359> months<00:01:19.780> but<00:01:19.929> to

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
them through the winter months but to

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.660 
them through the winter months but to
have<00:01:20.259> something<00:01:20.499> to<00:01:20.679> eat<00:01:20.799> in<00:01:21.039> the<00:01:21.249> spring

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
have something to eat in the spring

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.429 
have something to eat in the spring
there's<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.509> beuried<00:01:22.840> in<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.079> garden<00:01:23.350> that's

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
there's a beuried in the garden that's

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.529 
there's a beuried in the garden that's
called<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.920> hungry<00:01:24.159> gap<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.729> that's<00:01:25.270> the

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
called the hungry gap and that's the

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.419 
called the hungry gap and that's the
sort<00:01:25.719> of<00:01:25.749> early<00:01:26.140> spring<00:01:26.320> when<00:01:26.979> you've<00:01:27.130> planted

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
sort of early spring when you've planted

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:28.709 
sort of early spring when you've planted
loads<00:01:27.789> and<00:01:27.969> loads<00:01:27.999> of<00:01:28.210> stuff<00:01:28.390> but<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.630> don't

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
loads and loads of stuff but you don't

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.169 
loads and loads of stuff but you don't
actually<00:01:29.079> have<00:01:29.409> anything<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:30.009> eat<00:01:30.189> yet<00:01:30.219> so<00:01:31.060> if

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
actually have anything to eat yet so if

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.480 
actually have anything to eat yet so if
you're<00:01:31.329> careful<00:01:31.659> and<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.079> plan<00:01:32.439> you<00:01:33.159> can<00:01:33.340> make

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
you're careful and you plan you can make

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.620 
you're careful and you plan you can make
sure<00:01:33.729> that<00:01:33.880> you've<00:01:33.999> planted<00:01:34.270> something
