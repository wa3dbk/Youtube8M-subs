 side has the little tip to draw the 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:51.340
 eyebrows and on the other side the brush 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:55.599
 whenever you try to make the color 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.969
 a lighter color than your eyebrow is fine 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.239
 similar but it's a little I want and I'm going 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:05.209
 building the eyebrow and passing it by 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.310
 where I have as danger-free areas 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.319
 and then to blur the comb of 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.450
 we 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.879
 It can also be done with a shadow 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.219
 mate let's move on then 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.889
 we are going to need a cat tongue 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:22.590
 a little arrow to blur here and another 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.019
 to apply the color closer to the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.230
 eyebrow violated a bit for that and with that 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:31.439
 we are today I am going to show you my palette of 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:34.319
 English of freedom system that I have here 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:37.139
 for worthy and some other brands 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.680
 because as it is magnetic it allows to put 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:43.620
 I'm going to take that vanilla color and what 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.290
 I'm going to put under the eyebrow arch this 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.290
 will help me to illuminate and create a base 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.969
 that's why I lower it because I want to help 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.959
 to create a base to decrease by 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.959
 all corners 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.600
 let's create the account the account 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.990
 depends a lot on how you had to 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.520
 say fallen you have the eyelid on top 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.890
 the eyelid on top you have to create the 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.910
 above it is lost when climbing the eye has 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:15.080
 served to make him not to fall 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:19.400
 rich always with a subtle matte color 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.420
 I'm going to take in this case that color that 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.480
 with a coffee 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.640
 quoted well mate this can be done with 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.170
 the bronzer or really because of the color 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.170
 what do you want 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.020
 this is to create depth and now 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.720
 let's take the shadow of the one that 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.830
 were the nights and is that as worthy 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.830
 purple burgundy with a tongue of 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:50.210
 autonomous cat and the replicas in the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.810
 eyelid work then with the same needs 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.810
 blur 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.349
 also if I wanted I could with a water 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.919
 thermal or with water lower a little the 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:06.610
 brush and this is going to make the shadow 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:09.699
 which is much more intense now I'm going to 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.550
 look for a clear color of this 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:16.810
 palette of the night and I'm going to apply it 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.120
 as illuminated and now let's go to lin 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.430
