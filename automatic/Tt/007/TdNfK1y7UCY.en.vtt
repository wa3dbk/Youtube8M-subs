mendations<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.239> actually<00:00:49.340> not

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
mendations these are actually not

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.790 
mendations these are actually not
correct<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:50.940> me<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.320> different<00:00:52.680> one

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
correct for me I have one different one

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.920 
correct for me I have one different one
and<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.309> correct<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.719> health

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and one that is correct so the health

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:05.469 
and one that is correct so the health
science<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> will<00:00:55.829> put<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.370> number<00:00:56.879> two<00:01:03.979> and

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
science one I will put in number two and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.530 
science one I will put in number two and
because<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.950> different<00:01:08.299> for<00:01:09.299> me

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
because this is this is different for me

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
because this is this is different for me
I'm<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:10.650> over<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and go to the career cluster codes and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.280 
and go to the career cluster codes and
one<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.030> mine<00:01:18.150> will<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.330> education<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
one of mine will be education and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.320 
one of mine will be education and
training<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> number<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.060> i'm<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
training with the number so i'm going to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.450 
training with the number so i'm going to
put<00:01:21.390> education<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.259> training<00:01:22.439> as<00:01:22.830> my<00:01:23.220> first

put education and training as my first

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.109 
put education and training as my first
one<00:01:24.500> because<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:25.890> my<00:01:26.070> interest<00:01:26.520> area<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
one because that's my interest area and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.670 
one because that's my interest area and
even<00:01:27.509> though<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.930> didn't<00:01:28.229> recognize<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
even though that it didn't recognize it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
even though that it didn't recognize it
in<00:01:29.009> my<00:01:29.250> career<00:01:29.549> cruising<00:01:30.030> i<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.420> still<00:01:30.600> put

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
in my career cruising i can still put

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.530 
in my career cruising i can still put
that<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.140> there<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:35.390> now<00:01:36.390> when

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that in there just like you can now when

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.999 
that in there just like you can now when
you<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.020> I've<00:01:37.170> career<00:01:37.500> cluster<00:01:37.890> number

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
you see that I've career cluster number

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.490 
you see that I've career cluster number
one<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.549> career<00:01:38.850> cluster<00:01:39.240> number<00:01:39.390> two<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.960> need

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
one in career cluster number two I need

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.440 
one in career cluster number two I need
to<00:01:40.590> code<00:01:40.829> those<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.670> I'll<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.150> career

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to code those so I'll go to the career

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.350 
to code those so I'll go to the career
cluster<00:01:42.960> codes<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.680> I'll<00:01:44.369> say<00:01:44.579> education<00:01:45.210> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
cluster codes and I'll say education and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
cluster codes and I'll say education and
training<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.259> code<00:01:46.530> 05

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
training so that's going to be code 05

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.929 
training so that's going to be code 05
and<00:01:48.560> health<00:01:49.560> services<00:01:50.360> which<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.630> number<00:01:52.259> 10

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
and health services which is number 10

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.670 
and health services which is number 10
so<00:01:53.939> I'm<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.240> put<00:01:54.450> code<00:01:54.689> 10<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.770> there<00:01:57.680> now

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so I'm going to put code 10 in there now

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.800 
so I'm going to put code 10 in there now
we<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.430> go<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.700> career<00:02:00.149> interests<00:02:00.659> and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
interested in physical education which
is<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.119> number<00:02:06.420> one<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.290> i<00:02:07.320> would<00:02:07.590> put

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.979 

physical<00:02:12.560> education<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:16.690> my<00:02:17.690> skill
