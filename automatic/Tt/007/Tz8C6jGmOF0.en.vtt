00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 our figure skating couple vanessa nolan 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.420
 were at the german cup 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.519
 There they have quite new ones 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.590
 Elements are built into your pump 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.590
 but they were successful anyway 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.060
 So we were only basdorf to the 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:26.300
 applicants open the hearts a competitive 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.030
 and yes, so our kps in the short program 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.630
 was actually pretty good 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.730
 the key elements have worked 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.440
 but can also be better but 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.840
 actually happy with our puzzle 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.130
 ran to the for was unfortunately not totally 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.450
 So completely the opposite of coffee 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.100
 so we then stop from second to 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.350
 but the third place slipped are 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.980
 we made our c cadre norm 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.500
 or that's why Russian partners 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.670
 I'll say a few are going strong 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.670
 Rostocker fall 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.790
 So we are today in Germany 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.250
 sells it were the continuation 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.740
 from the german championship 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.080
 And yes, our cafÃ© was back 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.700
 really good, actually , it was that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.600
 rest program the game of the whole season 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.680
 have gone 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.049
 44-something points actually are 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.869
 we came through faultless and today 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.560
 the pure was not so great though 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.720
 better than and supreme and so 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.730
 Overall, one can say 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.520
 two first turns fight with the Ã¶vp 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.859
 move 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.200
 but we were competing this 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.329
 so for us that was gone on 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 definitely second chance get what 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.220
 is as I said very well done 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.060
 unfortunately not like that 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.630
 yes i think so 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.430
 very confident i can always be 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.600
 if it can not get better then it is 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.560
 yes too bad but it still has to 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.910
 continue to go up so the goal 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.290
 now for the last competition because 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.940
 this buzzing would be definitely 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.940
 both competition for a fact- 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.070
 Good spots at the customer speak well 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.570
 is a matchmaker in any case the 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.630
 course we were also missing to 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.130
 a bit last season 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.670
 if you hurt a lot in the summer so there 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.560
 we have had again we outages 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.230
 and of course it's the same way 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.120
 long together and I have to be technical 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.560
 mature a bit together and also 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.690
 lips took on more mature together 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.130
 then I think you can be in the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.750
 program help more so you notice in 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.000
 The short because they last longer than then on 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.580
 end a bit before easter 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.320
 then we have work today 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.940
 another cool element tries something 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.830
 we have never tried at 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.120
 some competition has three times 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.100
 salchow and because actually exercise 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.700
 competition and we wanted everything 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.140
 tackle what we try so in training 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.540
 So everything we have tackled it but it 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.400
 not everything worked out facebook too 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.070
 always mention that for us 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.270
 last element the private otherwise 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.350
 not counted down completely 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.800
 then found reasons must 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.110
 happened 100 assurances and the 2 unfortunately 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.710
 a bit unfavorable at that time many points 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.710
 endangered quantity 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.190
 Luxembourg put the last competition of the 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.349
 season and then the season because past 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.590
 Act break I think then come 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:33.190
 also courses and become new programs 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.190
 set up and then it is not 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.110
 the sun i think 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:48.310
 which images I'm sure I'm running 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.230
 hope that a nice next year 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.690
 there is a program and then to it 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.100
 Of course new costumes because you to 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.040
 example i am now out of my cousin 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:02.020
 costumes grown out and with that 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.690
 Ultimately not only then will it be so 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.370
 black music Telekom and German railway 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.959
 Stop running too , especially when 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.610
 I'm running my third season now 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.470
 skates and they will be yes 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.750
 too soft and not so 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.230
 beneficial for the citizens where you stop 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.859
 the haslam is therefore appreciate 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.859
