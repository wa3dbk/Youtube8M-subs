00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
this side not to hold the mesh but to

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.010 
this side not to hold the mesh but to
hold<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.610> whole<00:01:18.790> frame<00:01:19.090> onto<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.479> table<00:01:19.840> so

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
a little beat down take my spreader side

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
a little beat down take my spreader side
up<00:02:00.970> down<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.330> surface<00:02:03.510> trying<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.600> make<00:02:04.750> sure

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
up down the surface trying to make sure

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.270 
up down the surface trying to make sure
that<00:02:05.140> of<00:02:05.229> course<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.619> I<00:02:05.650> don't<00:02:05.860> get<00:02:06.040> it<00:02:06.159> into

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
that of course that I don't get it into

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.100 
that of course that I don't get it into
the<00:02:06.490> image<00:02:06.729> here<00:02:06.910> we<00:02:07.000> go<00:02:07.150> I<00:02:07.360> think<00:02:07.930> it's<00:02:08.050> a

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
the image here we go I think it's a

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.300 
the image here we go I think it's a
little<00:02:08.200> bit<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.619> inside<00:02:08.740> of<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.100> frame

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310

my aerosol activator and give it a

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.699 
my aerosol activator and give it a
little<00:02:39.280> spray<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.959> as<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.200> said<00:02:41.380> that's<00:02:41.530> going

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
little spray and as I said that's going

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.259 
little spray and as I said that's going
to<00:02:41.800> take<00:02:41.950> somewhere<00:02:42.280> between<00:02:42.340> ten<00:02:43.239> and

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
to take somewhere between ten and

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.590 
to take somewhere between ten and
fifteen<00:02:43.660> seconds<00:02:44.380> okay

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
fifteen seconds okay

fifteen seconds okay
so<00:02:46.600> at<00:02:47.110> this<00:02:47.290> point<00:02:47.590> I've<00:02:48.220> now<00:02:48.400> stretched<00:02:48.880> in

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
so at this point I've now stretched in

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.970 
so at this point I've now stretched in
one<00:02:49.120> direction<00:02:49.470> I'm<00:02:50.470> going<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.650> leave<00:02:50.800> this

clamp on it over here I'm going to take

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.430 
clamp on it over here I'm going to take
this<00:02:53.980> one<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:55.630> course<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.989> can<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:56.140> use<00:02:56.320> a

this one of course you can just use a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.520 
this one of course you can just use a
c-clamp<00:02:56.950> as<00:02:57.190> well<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.540> I'm<00:02:58.989> going<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.290> clamp

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
c-clamp as well and I'm going to clamp

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.039 
c-clamp as well and I'm going to clamp
it<00:02:59.709> on<00:03:00.269> because<00:03:01.269> now<00:03:01.450> I'm<00:03:01.570> going<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.750> come<00:03:01.870> down

that I'm covering the entire surface of

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.800 
that I'm covering the entire surface of
the<00:03:31.410> frame<00:03:32.440> even<00:03:32.830> though<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.239> only<00:03:34.390> put<00:03:34.690> it

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
the frame even though if you only put it

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.640 
the frame even though if you only put it
down<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.170> middle<00:03:35.349> it<00:03:36.190> would<00:03:36.340> hold<00:03:36.489> believe<00:03:37.090> me

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
down the middle it would hold believe me

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.809 
down the middle it would hold believe me
you<00:03:38.650> also<00:03:38.830> want<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.099> make<00:03:39.250> sure<00:03:39.280> one<00:03:39.640> other

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
you also want to make sure one other

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
thing and that is that you don't glue

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.990 
thing and that is that you don't glue
yourself<00:03:42.099> to<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.640> frame<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.930> or<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.880> the

don't need it you just want to keep it
from<00:04:31.360> flipping<00:04:31.660> oh<00:04:31.840> yeah<00:04:32.490> okay<00:04:33.490> take<00:04:34.060> that

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
from flipping oh yeah okay take that

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.529 
from flipping oh yeah okay take that
drawback<00:04:37.169> lock<00:04:38.169> it<00:04:38.349> in<00:04:38.470> get<00:04:38.680> that<00:04:38.860> snap<00:04:39.539> and

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
drawback lock it in get that snap and

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.650 
drawback lock it in get that snap and
now<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:40.870> draw<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.470> draw<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:41.950> down<00:04:42.210> so<00:04:43.210> from<00:04:43.570> this

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
now I draw it draw it down so from this

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.100 
now I draw it draw it down so from this
point<00:04:43.960> we've<00:04:44.830> gotten<00:04:45.160> all<00:04:45.280> four<00:04:45.550> sides<00:04:46.110> we

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
point we've gotten all four sides we

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.110 
point we've gotten all four sides we
have<00:04:47.320> good<00:04:47.500> tension<00:04:47.710> on<00:04:48.039> our<00:04:48.190> screen<00:04:48.580> so<00:04:48.789> this

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
have good tension on our screen so this

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.839 
have good tension on our screen so this
is<00:04:49.180> going<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.360> used<00:04:49.599> when<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.229> want<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.849> reach
