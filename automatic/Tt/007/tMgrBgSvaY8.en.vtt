and it doesn't taste like real bacon
this<00:02:34.160> one<00:02:34.310> actually<00:02:34.430> looks<00:02:34.580> kind<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:34.940> like<00:02:35.060> a

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
this one actually looks kind of like a

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.300

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
hmm that piece was actually more like

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.530 
hmm that piece was actually more like
jerky<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.950> little<00:02:46.400> bit<00:02:46.520> in<00:02:46.610> meteor<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.209> chewy

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
and meaty flavor as well but again it

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.990 
and meaty flavor as well but again it
tastes<00:02:53.480> very<00:02:53.720> strongly<00:02:54.709> fake<00:02:55.340> bacon<00:02:55.670> like

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
which I'm not too happy about

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.070 
which I'm not too happy about
here's<00:02:58.190> more<00:02:58.370> fatty<00:02:58.640> piece<00:02:58.880> let's<00:02:59.120> try<00:02:59.300> that
