00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.060
 Let's talk about reinforced concrete. 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.970
 reinforced concrete is a matter of 160 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.480
 hours which is divided into two parts with 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.310
 80 today in the seventh and eighth 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.370
 respectively 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.650
 the basic disciplines necessary to 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.730
 a good base in reinforced concrete are 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.490
 physical calculation and transport phenomena 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.470
 already in the professional resistance 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.930
 materials and building materials 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:51.680
 What is reinforced concrete is a material 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.899
 the construction that has become one of 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.440
 important elements of the 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.420
 20th century concrete architecture armed 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.730
 consists of a metallic armature 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.350
 covered by concrete causing 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.109
 besides the compressive strength by 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.299
 part of the concrete also happens to 

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.369
 tensile strength 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.280
 structure that counts on 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.109
 small bumps on its surface 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.719
 and can thus be used to make 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.549
 a sturdier construction with 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.880
 increasingly curved shapes in concrete 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:27.319
 today is used in the construction of 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.049
 walls and beams in virtually everything. 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:33.350
 that more resistance is required in the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.139
 of how concrete is made 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.149
 armed after the dosage of ingredients and 

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.899
 a mixture in a plant or in the 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.060
 work 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.969
 the concrete in the form of a mixture 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.639
 and homogeneous liquid is placed in 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.490
 already in the work where they are inserted 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:52.429
 metal reinforcements having a diameter 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.249
 6 to 50 millimeters 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.679
 according to the design engineer 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:59.869
 thus forming the concrete skeleton 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.380
 after its launch and of life 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.229
 shoring the concrete is glazed 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.840
 so that it fills all the spaces as well 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.840
 that harden the same is ready 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.260
 this was the work of the discipline of 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.260
 reinforced concrete
