00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
and the extreme cold but that's not

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.780 
and the extreme cold but that's not
really<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> concern<00:02:30.909> for<00:02:31.239> me<00:02:32.159> so<00:02:33.159> once<00:02:33.340> I<00:02:33.489> clip

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
really a concern for me so once I clip

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.589 
really a concern for me so once I clip
this<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.180> here

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
this on here

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.640 
this on here
I<00:02:34.629> simply<00:02:35.230> insert<00:02:35.709> my<00:02:35.920> support<00:02:36.340> wire<00:02:37.560> into<00:02:38.560> the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
I simply insert my support wire into the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.369 
I simply insert my support wire into the
Whammy<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.480> see<00:02:43.629> my<00:02:44.019> snare

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
Whammy like so and you can see my snare

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:51.960 
Whammy like so and you can see my snare
is<00:02:45.510> supported<00:02:49.829> so<00:02:50.829> that<00:02:50.859> I<00:02:51.069> get<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.489> loop<00:02:51.669> size

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
is supported so that I get the loop size

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.349 
is supported so that I get the loop size
how<00:02:52.419> I<00:02:52.450> want<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.609> and<00:02:54.609> you<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:54.939> see<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:58.299> just

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
how I want it and you can see that just

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.539 
how I want it and you can see that just
the<00:02:58.959> support<00:02:59.349> wire<00:02:59.530> just<00:02:59.829> fits<00:03:00.099> right<00:03:00.189> in<00:03:00.459> the

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
the support wire just fits right in the

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.589 
the support wire just fits right in the
Whammy<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:02.200> adjust<00:03:02.620> your<00:03:02.739> loop<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.510> then<00:03:04.510> at

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
Whammy you adjust your loop and then at

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.129 
Whammy you adjust your loop and then at
this<00:03:04.720> point<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.439> can<00:03:05.950> bend<00:03:06.220> this<00:03:06.629> to<00:03:07.629> any<00:03:07.840> height

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
this point I can bend this to any height

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:14.780 
this point I can bend this to any height
any<00:03:08.950> shape<00:03:09.340> any<00:03:09.669> depth<00:03:10.439> that<00:03:11.439> I<00:03:11.470> want<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.840> is

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
any shape any depth that I want that is

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.960 
any shape any depth that I want that is
about<00:03:15.790> as<00:03:16.000> fast<00:03:16.449> and<00:03:16.829> simple<00:03:17.829> a<00:03:18.040> system<00:03:18.699> that<00:03:18.879> I

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
about as fast and simple a system that I

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.289 
about as fast and simple a system that I
found<00:03:19.949> so<00:03:20.949> I<00:03:20.979> literally<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.819> set<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.060> beaver

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
found so I literally to set a beaver

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.509 
found so I literally to set a beaver
snare<00:03:22.690> can<00:03:22.989> go<00:03:23.109> out<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.680> drive<00:03:23.919> that<00:03:24.129> pole<00:03:24.370> in

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
snare can go out and drive that pole in

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.960 
snare can go out and drive that pole in
the<00:03:24.609> mud<00:03:24.790> clip<00:03:25.479> a<00:03:25.510> snare<00:03:25.870> on<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.229> and<00:03:26.970> insert

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
the mud clip a snare on it and insert

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.979 
the mud clip a snare on it and insert
the<00:03:28.269> support<00:03:28.989> collar<00:03:29.199> into<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:30.370> Whammy<00:03:30.579> and

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
the support collar into the Whammy and

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.869 
the support collar into the Whammy and
put<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.079> exactly<00:03:32.229> where<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:32.979> want<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.430> half<00:03:33.669> in

wire<00:03:46.620> like<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:48.239> snare<00:03:49.239> will<00:03:49.419> close<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:50.319> see

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
wire like that snare will close you see

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.280 
wire like that snare will close you see
it's<00:03:50.739> closing<00:03:51.069> around<00:03:51.489> my<00:03:51.639> wrist<00:03:51.909> and<00:03:52.209> then<00:03:53.169> at

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
it's closing around my wrist and then at

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.839 
it's closing around my wrist and then at
this<00:03:53.409> point<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.889> Beavers<00:03:54.220> just<00:03:54.519> swimming

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
this point the Beavers just swimming

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.789 
this point the Beavers just swimming
around<00:03:54.939> in<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.329> water<00:03:55.479> and<00:03:55.810> every<00:03:56.470> time<00:03:56.650> he

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
around in the water and every time he

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.939 
around in the water and every time he
pulls<00:03:57.449> he's<00:03:58.449> not<00:03:58.659> gonna<00:03:58.780> break<00:03:59.019> that<00:03:59.079> pole<00:03:59.500> but

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
pulls he's not gonna break that pole but

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:02.189 
pulls he's not gonna break that pole but
he's<00:04:00.069> gonna<00:04:00.189> shove<00:04:00.549> it<00:04:00.699> deeper<00:04:01.389> into<00:04:02.109> the

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
he's gonna shove it deeper into the

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.929 
he's gonna shove it deeper into the
ground<00:04:04.290> there's<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.409> second<00:04:05.829> way<00:04:05.979> that<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:06.790> can

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
ground there's a second way that you can

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.659 
ground there's a second way that you can
use<00:04:07.199> the<00:04:08.199> plain<00:04:08.889> pole<00:04:09.189> to<00:04:10.180> as<00:04:10.449> a<00:04:11.139> support<00:04:11.709> and

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
use the plain pole to as a support and

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.580 
use the plain pole to as a support and
this<00:04:12.909> is<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.209> one<00:04:13.329> that<00:04:13.449> I<00:04:13.509> showed<00:04:14.109> on<00:04:14.169> another

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
this is the one that I showed on another

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.219 
this is the one that I showed on another
video<00:04:14.889> about<00:04:15.310> using<00:04:15.909> the<00:04:15.970> Muskrat<00:04:16.389> trap<00:04:16.900> clips

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
video about using the Muskrat trap clips

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.339 
video about using the Muskrat trap clips
and<00:04:17.500> same<00:04:18.190> exact<00:04:18.519> pole<00:04:18.840> now<00:04:19.840> on<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.139> one

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
and same exact pole now on this one

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.600 
and same exact pole now on this one
you'll<00:04:21.070> see<00:04:21.279> that<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.430> have<00:04:21.609> one<00:04:21.639> hole<00:04:22.090> drilled

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
you'll see that I have one hole drilled

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.710 
you'll see that I have one hole drilled
right<00:04:24.610> here

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
right here

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.770 
right here
all<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:25.930> those<00:04:26.110> I've<00:04:26.440> inserted<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.010> wire<00:04:27.780> it

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
all of those I've inserted the wire it

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.360 
all of those I've inserted the wire it
comes<00:04:29.050> down<00:04:29.290> and<00:04:29.410> I've<00:04:29.500> wrapped<00:04:29.830> it<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.070> couple

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
comes down and I've wrapped it a couple

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.960 
comes down and I've wrapped it a couple
of<00:04:30.460> wraps<00:04:30.640> around<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.120> pole<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:32.970> then

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
of wraps around the pole and then

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.150 
of wraps around the pole and then
there's<00:04:34.240> my<00:04:34.450> support<00:04:34.870> wire<00:04:35.050> which<00:04:35.740> would<00:04:35.950> hold

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
there's my support wire which would hold

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.780 
there's my support wire which would hold
the<00:04:36.310> Whammy<00:04:36.660> just<00:04:37.660> like<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:37.960> showed<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:38.410> and

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
the Whammy just like I showed you and

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.200 
the Whammy just like I showed you and
it's<00:04:39.790> this<00:04:40.000> multiple<00:04:40.660> wraps<00:04:41.820> that<00:04:42.820> hold<00:04:43.030> this

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
it's this multiple wraps that hold this

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.110 
it's this multiple wraps that hold this
wire<00:04:43.450> into<00:04:43.810> place<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:45.550> there<00:04:45.700> are<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:45.820> number<00:04:45.850> of

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
wire into place so there are a number of

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.570 
wire into place so there are a number of
ways<00:04:46.390> that<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:47.500> can<00:04:47.710> use<00:04:47.950> that<00:04:48.190> and<00:04:48.400> hope

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
ways that you can use that and hope

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.910 
ways that you can use that and hope
that's<00:04:49.570> easily<00:04:49.840> visible<00:04:51.360> but<00:04:52.360> that<00:04:52.540> is<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.930> 14

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
that's easily visible but that is a 14

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.680 
that's easily visible but that is a 14
