00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:08.719
 hello good afternoon friends from youtube 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 good in this video this in this other 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.430
 video I present to you 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.029
 out there how to repair a 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:27.210
 source a television source 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:29.060
 panasonic model 720 g 112 chassis a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.940
 md 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.380
 of 275 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:40.670
 includes the famous regulator there 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:43.580
 str 58 0 41 and already as you will know 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.610
 this regulator to this has given many 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.520
 problems out there and good to me in this 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.770
 I had to repair this TV and 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.000
 Well, it really did give me some work 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:59.420
 repair it over there because I consulted in 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.200
 some forums and the question is that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.330
 accumulate a lot of data out there 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.530
 and then now I want to introduce you there 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.810
 all the procedure I did here 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.119
 well out there this 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.920
 the problem is that I do not do many times 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.670
 we find that it does not regulate the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.200
 other voltage has to give us the fence 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.680
 of 130 volts out there we have to measure 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:32.770
 this voltage around here near east 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 809 filter is 809 there is where we 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.690
 has to give voltage out there this one 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.510
 many times we find that the 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.310
 avalanche diode is shorted out there 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.830
 the horizontal output is also in 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.710
 short and good many times it does not regulate 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.160
 really good, because this one here presented 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.070
 out there the procedure well then I 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.360
 here 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.890
 I connect here a little 60 watts 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.630
 Well, I told you beforehand 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.110
 that you have to change some filters that 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:09.420
 they are there near the source 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:12.750
 The s 815 filter with the value of 47 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.190
 micro farewell to 50 volts and another 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.040
 small filter s 820 10 micro far 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.900
 goodbye to 63 volts these two little ones 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.450
 filters you have to change them because 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.990
 regularly sometimes they measure well and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.540
 because already working they start there 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.020
 put some faults that do not regulate that 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.680
 regulator str 50 and 80 41 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.830
 out there and measure some diodes too 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.980
 some resistors that go 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.410
 out there near the really good str 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.290
 and there and after all 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.260
 we have done that we disconnected the 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.230
 horizontal output not in case given that 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.450
 do not regulate out there be good do not go to 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.340
 damage the transistor and instead of the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.300
 transistor with we place it there a 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:07.260
 little for the infoca for the how I have it 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.540
 me here a little 60 watts for 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.540
 here and already also in parallel 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.550
 we place the multimeter we place 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.740
 previously the last parallel item 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.460
 together with the focus 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:24.990
 with about capacitor or good 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.520
 there with him in parallel with the 0 809 the 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.400
 filter that is the one that filters us the time 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.230
 more and good and after we have 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.340
 everything connected 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:39.510
 we give out there power has us out there 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.239
 that remain voltage for today we see that 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.540
 it turned on the focus there gives us the 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.790
 multimeter is not dialing 129.5 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.549
 volts out there means that you are 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.050
 regulating our source there 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:56.080
 we pay again and we see that this one 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.810
 Over there 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.890
 and the focus is turned off and multimeter 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:06.940
 it tells us 0 volts we learn again 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:10.000
 the power gives us 129.5 the fire on 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.800
 and we pay again there and we see 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.330
 that goes out 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:20.320
 the focus is already the relay and this disconnects 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:23.410
 the main source towards the ethereal 58 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.950
 0 41 but here the important thing is first 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.950
 before 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.290
 out there connect the development 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.860
 horizontal check that the source is 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.230
 working is not delivering 130 votes 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.310
 but as I told you previously 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:45.169
 of two filters carry about 750 and 80 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:49.430
 41 one more worth of 47 micro farah 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:53.510
 goddess 50 volts and the other is s 820 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.980
 10 micro farah gave 63 volts s of 10 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.440
 you can put it to 100 volts too 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.800
 and well this one I 've already seen out there in 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.690
 other forums that have given much much 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.750
 can this regulator if they are 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:11.650
 originals if they are pirates there are not many 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.600
 Sometimes we walk around looking for 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.440
 other side not when in fact of times 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.690
 what 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.480
 we have problems with filters or 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.060
 some leaky diode or some 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.160
 resistance that is open to it 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.620
 after all that is there we have 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.620
 proved that he is adjusting it and 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.380
 only us 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.820
 we have to disconnect out there 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.830
 multimeter and focus and already join with 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.220
 place by the transistor has come out 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.949
 horizontal solder it and try it and no longer 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.990
 you have to give us no problem right 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:49.229
 Well, I hope that this video will 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.870
 has served out there somewhere in 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:55.800
 repairs to this TV 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:58.020
 20 inches mark panasonic x well 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.590
 I hope you leave your comments and 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.590
 thank you
