minerals<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.800> some<00:02:30.190> rocks<00:02:30.610> when<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.420> stress

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
minerals and some rocks when you stress

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.449 
minerals and some rocks when you stress
them<00:02:32.320> in<00:02:32.560> other<00:02:32.740> words<00:02:32.890> when<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.100> put<00:02:33.250> them<00:02:33.370> in

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
there a lot of pressure him and they

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
there a lot of pressure him and they
can't<00:02:34.780> handle<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.140> pressure<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.440> they

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
can't handle the pressure and they

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.680 
can't handle the pressure and they
suddenly<00:02:35.800> break<00:02:36.250> some<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.180> them<00:02:37.300> will<00:02:37.450> release

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
suddenly break some of them will release

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.850 
suddenly break some of them will release
electricity<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.570> does<00:02:41.410> anyone<00:02:41.620> have

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
electricity and that is does anyone have

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.250 
electricity and that is does anyone have
like<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> barbecue<00:02:42.910> starter<00:02:43.780> where<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.110> just

click and every each time you push the
button<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.459> one<00:02:48.610> little<00:02:48.850> click<00:02:49.060> there's<00:02:49.780> a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
button is one little click there's a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.810 
button is one little click there's a
little<00:02:50.140> piece<00:02:50.320> of<00:02:50.350> quartz<00:02:50.890> inside<00:02:51.100> there<00:02:51.640> and

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
little piece of quartz inside there and

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.759 
little piece of quartz inside there and
the<00:02:51.880> quartz<00:02:52.180> get<00:02:52.330> stressed<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.380> releases

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
the quartz get stressed and it releases

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.380 
the quartz get stressed and it releases
electricity<00:02:54.459> every<00:02:54.700> time<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:55.000> press<00:02:55.209> the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
electricity every time you press the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.930 
electricity every time you press the
button<00:02:55.920> that's<00:02:56.920> kind<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.310> what's<00:02:57.459> happening

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
button that's kind of what's happening

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.670 
button that's kind of what's happening
here<00:02:58.300> but<00:02:58.780> what's<00:02:58.959> happening<00:02:59.320> here<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.530> not

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
here but what's happening here is not

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.810 
here but what's happening here is not
electricity<00:03:00.250> because<00:03:00.489> you're<00:03:00.580> not<00:03:00.670> getting

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
electricity because you're not getting

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.030 
electricity because you're not getting
shots<00:03:01.209> what<00:03:02.019> it's<00:03:02.140> doing<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:02.530> its<00:03:02.739> releasing

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
shots what it's doing is its releasing

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.009 
shots what it's doing is its releasing
lights<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:03.970> it's<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.209> same<00:03:04.390> thing<00:03:04.720> when<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
lights but it's the same thing when the

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.720 
lights but it's the same thing when the
minerals<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.470> are<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:05.739> your<00:03:06.160> wintergreen

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
minerals that are in your wintergreen

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.090 
minerals that are in your wintergreen
lifesavers<00:03:07.080> break<00:03:08.080> when<00:03:08.800> they<00:03:08.890> break

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
lifesavers break when they break

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.970 
lifesavers break when they break
suddenly<00:03:09.760> under<00:03:10.510> pressure<00:03:10.840> they<00:03:11.380> release<00:03:11.769> the

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
suddenly under pressure they release the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.580 
suddenly under pressure they release the
light<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.330> only<00:03:13.570> works<00:03:13.989> for<00:03:14.140> wintergreen

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
light and it only works for wintergreen

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.870 
light and it only works for wintergreen
lifesavers<00:03:14.739> so<00:03:15.340> if<00:03:15.430> you've<00:03:15.549> got<00:03:15.700> like<00:03:15.820> a

lifesavers so if you've got like a

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.520 
lifesavers so if you've got like a
spearmint<00:03:16.330> one<00:03:16.450> at<00:03:16.570> home<00:03:16.720> or<00:03:16.959> another<00:03:17.290> white

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
spearmint one at home or another white

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.410 
spearmint one at home or another white
lifesaver<00:03:18.160> it's<00:03:18.580> not<00:03:18.730> gonna<00:03:18.880> work<00:03:19.030> it's<00:03:19.239> only

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
lifesaver it's not gonna work it's only

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.630 
lifesaver it's not gonna work it's only
wintergreen<00:03:20.049> it's<00:03:20.709> really<00:03:21.040> neat<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.310> can<00:03:21.430> try

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
wintergreen it's really neat you can try

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.039 
wintergreen it's really neat you can try
it<00:03:21.700> yourself<00:03:21.820> if<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.390> go<00:03:22.540> into<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.840> bathroom

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
and face the mirror this is one reason

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.479 
and face the mirror this is one reason
why<00:03:31.630> sometimes<00:03:32.080> right<00:03:32.769> before<00:03:33.130> an<00:03:33.370> earthquake

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
why sometimes right before an earthquake

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.550 
why sometimes right before an earthquake
or<00:03:34.480> during<00:03:34.930> an<00:03:35.049> earthquake

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
sometimes people there's a sudden surge

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.729 
sometimes people there's a sudden surge
in<00:03:39.370> UFO<00:03:40.120> reports<00:03:40.630> because<00:03:41.140> people<00:03:41.560> see

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
in UFO reports because people see

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.350 
in UFO reports because people see
strange<00:03:42.100> lights<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.730> sometimes<00:03:43.120> they<00:03:43.209> see

the lights hovering stuff like that and
these<00:03:45.250> are<00:03:45.310> lights<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.910> are<00:03:46.030> actually

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
these are lights that are actually

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.670 
these are lights that are actually
emitted<00:03:46.750> by<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.370> by<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.430> stress<00:03:48.790> minnows
