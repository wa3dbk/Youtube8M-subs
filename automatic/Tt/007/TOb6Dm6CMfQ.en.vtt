this<00:00:44.760> track<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.620> isn't<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.920> difficult<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
this track really isn't that difficult I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.639 
this track really isn't that difficult I
don't<00:00:48.300> think<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.379> level<00:00:49.530> 6<00:00:49.649> really<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.670> I

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
don't think it's a level 6 really but I

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.930 
don't think it's a level 6 really but I
don't<00:00:52.649> really<00:00:52.739> feel<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.010> arguing<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.730> much

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
don't really feel like arguing that much

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.150 
don't really feel like arguing that much
so<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.230> put<00:00:55.469> level<00:00:55.739> 6<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
so I'm just gonna put level 6 in the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.979 
so I'm just gonna put level 6 in the
title<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.300> make<00:00:57.570> your<00:00:57.690> own<00:00:57.840> opinion

title and you can make your own opinion

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.580 
title and you can make your own opinion
on<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.660> keep<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.780> mind<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.050> did<00:01:01.260> spend<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
on what it is keep in mind I did spend a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.170 
on what it is keep in mind I did spend a
lot<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.770> time<00:01:02.010> passing<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.520> track<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.969> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
lot of time passing this track it it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.660 
lot of time passing this track it it
wasn't<00:01:03.480> easy<00:01:03.600> by<00:01:04.049> any<00:01:04.080> means<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.040> don't

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
wasn't easy by any means but I don't

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.969 
wasn't easy by any means but I don't
think<00:01:05.790> his<00:01:05.939> level<00:01:06.210> 6<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.710> way<00:01:07.950> easier

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
think his level 6 this was way easier

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.260 
think his level 6 this was way easier
than<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.760> human<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:10.590> know<00:01:10.710> there's<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
than in human so you know there's that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.190 
than in human so you know there's that
so<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.510> first<00:01:12.630> thing<00:01:12.810> I'm<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.080> talk

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
so the first thing I'm going to talk

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.109 
so the first thing I'm going to talk
about<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.010> tournament<00:01:14.490> my<00:01:14.670> tournament

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
about is the tournament my tournament

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.910 
about is the tournament my tournament
that<00:01:15.450> didn't<00:01:15.840> get<00:01:15.930> finished<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.380> why<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that didn't get finished and why it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.679 
that didn't get finished and why it
didn't<00:01:17.189> get<00:01:17.280> finished<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:20.119> if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.420> don't

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
didn't get finished so it if you don't

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.160 
didn't get finished so it if you don't
know<00:01:22.040> two<00:01:23.040> matches<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.970> were<00:01:24.119> played<00:01:25.040> didn't

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
know two matches that were played didn't

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.870 
know two matches that were played didn't
work<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.409> very<00:01:28.680> well<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.280> guess<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> good

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
work out very well I guess it's a good

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.690 
work out very well I guess it's a good
way<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> saying<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:31.320> had<00:01:31.439> two<00:01:31.860> people<00:01:32.250> two

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
way of saying it we had two people two

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.800 
way of saying it we had two people two
different<00:01:32.850> people<00:01:33.210> two<00:01:33.329> different<00:01:33.630> times

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
different people two different times

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.929 
different people two different times
quit<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> middle<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.520> match<00:01:35.670> because

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
quit in the middle of a match because

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.850 
quit in the middle of a match because
they<00:01:36.030> weren't<00:01:36.299> happy<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> track<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.619> was

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
they weren't happy with the track it was

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.130 
they weren't happy with the track it was
picked<00:01:38.549> yes<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.439> first<00:01:40.470> time<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:40.979> happened

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
picked yes so the first time it happened

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.859 
picked yes so the first time it happened
the<00:01:43.140> track<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.680> picked<00:01:43.920> by<00:01:44.700> me<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.659> wasn't

and<00:01:48.110> they<00:01:49.110> didn't<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.560> until<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.549> told<00:01:50.729> them

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and they didn't know until I told them

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.069 
and they didn't know until I told them
and<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.420> practiced<00:01:51.840> me<00:01:52.079> they<00:01:52.439> played<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.860> and

reason that this wasn't too big a video

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.929 
reason that this wasn't too big a video
because<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.770> realized<00:02:02.430> okay<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.909> a

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
know had them both agree on the track

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.940 
know had them both agree on the track
and<00:02:06.689> all<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.560> fair<00:02:07.890> I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and all that and it's not really fair I

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.300 
and all that and it's not really fair I
guess<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.720> weary<00:02:10.050> picked<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.679> track

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
guess you know so weary picked the track

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.980 
guess you know so weary picked the track
and<00:02:11.700> he<00:02:12.120> actually<00:02:12.270> ended<00:02:12.540> up

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
and he actually ended up

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.200 
and he actually ended up
and<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.260> we're<00:02:13.710> giving<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> guy<00:02:14.430> one<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> lead

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
and but we're giving the guy one a lead

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.380 
and but we're giving the guy one a lead
the<00:02:16.080> guy<00:02:16.200> ended<00:02:16.410> up<00:02:16.530> coming<00:02:16.710> back<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:19.070> winning

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
the guy ended up coming back and winning

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.380 
the guy ended up coming back and winning
because<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.570> track<00:02:21.810> change<00:02:22.110> most<00:02:22.650> likely

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
because of the track change most likely

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.210 
because of the track change most likely
so<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.960> sparked<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> bunch<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.740> controversy

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
so that sparked a bunch of controversy

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.150 
so that sparked a bunch of controversy
already<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.030> then<00:02:27.800> later<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.100> the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
already so then later on in the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.380 
already so then later on in the
tournament<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:31.140> same<00:02:31.440> guy<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.610> had<00:02:33.210> the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
tournament the same guy that had the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.430 
tournament the same guy that had the
track<00:02:33.660> switched<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.350> him<00:02:35.690> was<00:02:36.690> playing

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
track switched on him was playing

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.830 
track switched on him was playing
against<00:02:37.710> myself<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.520> we<00:02:38.820> had<00:02:39.000> both<00:02:39.210> agreed<00:02:39.630> on

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
against myself and we had both agreed on

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.590 
against myself and we had both agreed on
the<00:02:39.960> track<00:02:40.200> 100%<00:02:41.160> we<00:02:41.490> talked<00:02:41.820> about<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:42.360> we

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
the track 100% we talked about it and we

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.810 
the track 100% we talked about it and we
agreed<00:02:42.960> and<00:02:44.480> about<00:02:46.460> seventy<00:02:47.460> five<00:02:47.490> percent

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
agreed and about seventy five percent

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.690 
agreed and about seventy five percent
maybe<00:02:48.090> more<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.720> way<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.110> track<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.700> was

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
maybe more of the way to the track I was

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.140 
maybe more of the way to the track I was
really<00:02:51.210> far<00:02:51.420> ahead<00:02:51.980> like<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:53.820> not<00:02:54.000> have

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
really far ahead like you know not have

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.860 
really far ahead like you know not have
been<00:02:54.240> possible<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:55.230> come<00:02:55.440> back<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:56.660> he<00:02:57.660> ended

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
been possible to come back and he ended

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.640 
been possible to come back and he ended
up<00:02:58.020> quitting<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:59.270> this<00:03:00.270> was<00:03:00.600> when<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.050> was<00:03:01.320> not

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
up quitting and this was when I was not

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.450 
up quitting and this was when I was not
happy<00:03:02.070> at<00:03:02.370> all<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.810> had<00:03:04.110> to<00:03:04.410> basically<00:03:04.590> I

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
happy at all so I had to basically I

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.900 
happy at all so I had to basically I
basically<00:03:05.880> forfeited<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.080> way<00:03:07.260> like<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.370> just

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
basically forfeited in a way like I just

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.640 
basically forfeited in a way like I just
kind<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.210> let<00:03:09.360> him<00:03:09.420> have<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.660> because<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.530> was

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
kind of let him have it because I was

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.580 
kind of let him have it because I was
over<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:12.570> was<00:03:12.840> gonna<00:03:12.990> continue<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
over it and I was gonna continue the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.370 
over it and I was gonna continue the
tournament<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.250> wasn't<00:03:14.640> over<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.380> then

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
tournament it wasn't over and then

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.870 
tournament it wasn't over and then
something<00:03:16.770> else<00:03:16.830> happened<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.520> then<00:03:17.730> this

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
something else happened and then this

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.410 
something else happened and then this
was<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.090> last<00:03:18.300> drop<00:03:19.040> basically<00:03:20.420> people

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
was the last drop basically people

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.620 
was the last drop basically people
played<00:03:21.840> their<00:03:22.050> match<00:03:22.550> without<00:03:23.550> telling<00:03:24.480> me

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
played their match without telling me

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.350 
played their match without telling me
which<00:03:25.380> isn't<00:03:26.190> too<00:03:26.520> big<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.850> deal<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.090> itself

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
which isn't too big of a deal in itself

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.910 
which isn't too big of a deal in itself
but<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.780> reason<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.140> was<00:03:28.230> such<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.560> big<00:03:28.770> deal

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
but the reason it was such a big deal

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.880 
but the reason it was such a big deal
was<00:03:29.130> because<00:03:29.460> they<00:03:30.030> played<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.450> match<00:03:30.890> just

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
was because they played the match just

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.060 
was because they played the match just
assuming<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.110> other<00:03:34.290> guy<00:03:34.530> was<00:03:34.560> gonna

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
assuming that the other guy was gonna

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.180 
assuming that the other guy was gonna
lose<00:03:35.780> because<00:03:36.780> they<00:03:37.080> they<00:03:37.560> basically<00:03:37.830> plan

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
lose because they they basically plan

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.330 
lose because they they basically plan
around<00:03:38.430> ahead<00:03:38.850> they<00:03:39.740> counted<00:03:40.740> someone<00:03:41.220> out

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
around ahead they counted someone out

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.160 
around ahead they counted someone out
and<00:03:41.910> just<00:03:42.060> assumed<00:03:42.390> okay<00:03:42.600> I'm<00:03:42.690> gonna<00:03:42.840> beat<00:03:43.050> him

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
and just assumed okay I'm gonna beat him

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.510 
and just assumed okay I'm gonna beat him
we<00:03:43.350> may<00:03:43.530> as<00:03:43.590> well<00:03:43.650> play<00:03:43.860> our<00:03:44.040> match<00:03:44.190> against

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
we may as well play our match against

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.730 
we may as well play our match against
each<00:03:44.610> other<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.030> after<00:03:45.960> that<00:03:46.050> that<00:03:46.620> was<00:03:46.680> it

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
each other and after that that was it

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.500 
each other and after that that was it

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.460 
so this time I want to get it you know
how<00:04:41.150> subjective<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:41.870> really<00:04:42.080> is

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
how subjective it really is

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.960 
how subjective it really is
so<00:04:42.860> obviously<00:04:43.340> it's<00:04:43.640> one<00:04:43.730> of<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.880> most

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
so obviously it's one of the most

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.220 
so obviously it's one of the most
subjective<00:04:44.180> things<00:04:44.600> you<00:04:44.750> could<00:04:44.900> talk<00:04:45.050> about

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
subjective things you could talk about

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.250 
subjective things you could talk about
right<00:04:45.830> bye<00:04:46.550> guys<00:04:46.730> this<00:04:47.390> is<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.570> good<00:04:47.900> example

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
right bye guys this is a good example

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.570 
right bye guys this is a good example
right<00:04:48.290> here<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.530> think<00:04:48.650> this<00:04:49.040> is<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.160> little<00:04:49.280> five

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
right here I think this is a little five

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.610 
right here I think this is a little five
where's<00:04:50.210> everyone<00:04:50.630> else<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:51.440> world

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
where's everyone else the world

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.400 
where's everyone else the world
apparently<00:04:52.010> thinks<00:04:52.220> it's<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.430> six<00:04:52.670> so<00:04:53.600> now

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.100 

there's<00:04:57.410> this<00:04:57.530> thing<00:04:57.980> made<00:04:58.730> by<00:04:58.760> redlynx<00:04:59.690> that

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
there's this thing made by redlynx that

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.850 
there's this thing made by redlynx that
is<00:05:00.410> uh<00:05:01.810> supposed<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.870> be<00:05:02.960> the<00:05:03.080> new<00:05:03.320> way<00:05:03.830> of

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
is uh supposed to be the new way of

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.700 
is uh supposed to be the new way of
determining<00:05:04.280> new<00:05:04.580> levels<00:05:05.000> when<00:05:05.210> it's<00:05:05.360> done

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
determining new levels when it's done

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.290 
determining new levels when it's done
okay<00:05:06.710> so<00:05:06.740> what<00:05:07.070> it<00:05:07.190> is<00:05:07.310> is<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:07.640> basically<00:05:07.760> takes

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
okay so what it is is it basically takes

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.170 
okay so what it is is it basically takes
playtime<00:05:08.930> time<00:05:09.290> outs<00:05:09.560> who's<00:05:10.220> played<00:05:10.550> it<00:05:10.760> who's

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
playtime time outs who's played it who's

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.120 
playtime time outs who's played it who's
passed<00:05:11.419> it<00:05:11.690> and<00:05:11.900> it<00:05:12.410> takes<00:05:12.590> all<00:05:12.770> these<00:05:12.919> stats

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
passed it and it takes all these stats

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.130 
passed it and it takes all these stats
in<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.520> then<00:05:13.700> that's<00:05:14.000> what<00:05:14.390> determines<00:05:14.540> level

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
in it then that's what determines level

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.140 
in it then that's what determines level
now<00:05:15.740> people<00:05:15.980> are<00:05:16.070> saying<00:05:16.310> this<00:05:16.580> will<00:05:16.790> this

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
now people are saying this will this

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.800 
now people are saying this will this
will<00:05:17.210> work<00:05:17.450> great

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
will work great

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.860 
will work great
once<00:05:18.500> it's<00:05:18.950> you<00:05:19.460> know<00:05:19.550> 100%<00:05:20.120> good<00:05:20.570> and<00:05:20.750> it's

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
once it's you know 100% good and it's

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.560 
once it's you know 100% good and it's
all<00:05:21.050> it's<00:05:21.950> all<00:05:22.130> worked<00:05:22.550> out<00:05:22.640> right<00:05:22.700> now<00:05:22.970> it's<00:05:23.510> a

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
all it's all worked out right now it's a

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.670 
all it's all worked out right now it's a
big<00:05:23.720> mess<00:05:23.900> but<00:05:24.080> they're<00:05:24.230> saying<00:05:24.380> it<00:05:24.500> could

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
big mess but they're saying it could

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.040 
big mess but they're saying it could
work<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:25.040> they<00:05:26.030> really<00:05:26.330> do<00:05:26.450> believe<00:05:26.720> it<00:05:26.870> will

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
work and they really do believe it will

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.320 
work and they really do believe it will
work<00:05:27.080> now<00:05:27.919> the<00:05:28.430> reason<00:05:28.700> I<00:05:28.820> say<00:05:29.030> this<00:05:29.060> is

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
work now the reason I say this is

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.290 
work now the reason I say this is
 is<00:05:29.930> because<00:05:31.000> there's<00:05:32.000> so<00:05:32.180> many

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
 is because there's so many

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.670 
 is because there's so many
different<00:05:32.419> factors<00:05:32.810> that<00:05:33.050> go<00:05:33.229> in<00:05:33.470> to

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
different factors that go in to

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.180 
different factors that go in to
determining<00:05:34.550> it<00:05:34.669> like<00:05:34.880> okay<00:05:35.810> so<00:05:35.890> sure<00:05:36.890> maybe

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
determining it like okay so sure maybe

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.190 
determining it like okay so sure maybe
my<00:05:37.430> playtime<00:05:38.180> is<00:05:38.390> wampa<00:05:38.690> who's<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:39.020> say<00:05:39.169> I

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
my playtime is wampa who's to say I

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.440 
my playtime is wampa who's to say I
wasn't<00:05:39.530> afk<00:05:40.070> who's<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.610> say<00:05:40.820> for<00:05:41.270> whatever

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
wasn't afk who's to say for whatever

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.300 
wasn't afk who's to say for whatever
reason<00:05:41.870> I<00:05:41.960> wasn't<00:05:42.320> trying<00:05:42.560> or<00:05:42.860> whatever<00:05:43.130> that

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
reason I wasn't trying or whatever that

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.030 
reason I wasn't trying or whatever that
it's<00:05:43.520> it's<00:05:44.240> a<00:05:44.330> flawed<00:05:44.600> system<00:05:44.900> completely<00:05:45.680> so

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
it's it's a flawed system completely so

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.320 
it's it's a flawed system completely so
am<00:05:49.040> I<00:05:49.160> going<00:05:49.370> to<00:05:49.550> another<00:05:49.790> commentary<00:05:50.150> but

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
am I going to another commentary but

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.510 
am I going to another commentary but
that<00:05:50.540> this<00:05:50.840> is<00:05:51.020> not<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.410> way<00:05:51.560> to<00:05:51.860> judgment<00:05:52.460> in

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
that this is not the way to judgment in

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.280 
that this is not the way to judgment in
two<00:05:52.640> levels<00:05:52.940> if<00:05:53.090> people<00:05:53.510> really<00:05:53.960> start<00:05:54.229> using

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
two levels if people really start using

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.270 
two levels if people really start using
this<00:05:55.690> that's<00:05:56.690> that's<00:05:57.229> just<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:57.590> way<00:05:57.770> it<00:05:57.919> is<00:05:57.979> I

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
this that's that's just the way it is I

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.250 
this that's that's just the way it is I
guess<00:05:58.520> I'm<00:05:59.090> gonna<00:05:59.240> have<00:05:59.330> to<00:05:59.450> live<00:05:59.750> with<00:05:59.870> it<00:06:00.050> but

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260

should be a general like the the point
for<00:06:19.160> ninja<00:06:19.370> level<00:06:19.580> is<00:06:19.640> like<00:06:19.729> okay<00:06:20.030> this<00:06:20.180> is<00:06:20.330> a

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
for ninja level is like okay this is a

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.700 
for ninja level is like okay this is a
level<00:06:20.690> three<00:06:20.930> I'm<00:06:21.110> not<00:06:21.290> gonna<00:06:21.440> play<00:06:21.590> this

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
level three I'm not gonna play this

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.950 
level three I'm not gonna play this
because<00:06:21.890> I<00:06:21.979> can't<00:06:22.250> pass<00:06:22.430> level<00:06:22.790> threes<00:06:23.030> you

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
because I can't pass level threes you

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.400 
because I can't pass level threes you
know<00:06:24.080> or<00:06:24.620> like<00:06:25.130> but<00:06:25.820> all<00:06:26.330> but<00:06:26.510> I<00:06:26.690> swear<00:06:27.110> it<00:06:27.290> to

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
know or like but all but I swear it to

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.490 
know or like but all but I swear it to
four<00:06:27.680> you<00:06:28.370> know<00:06:28.460> I<00:06:28.490> it<00:06:29.210> must<00:06:29.390> be<00:06:29.600> it<00:06:29.690> for<00:06:29.900> it<00:06:30.050> so

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
four you know I it must be it for it so

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.900 
four you know I it must be it for it so
okay<00:06:31.400> so<00:06:31.930> it's<00:06:32.930> a<00:06:32.990> four<00:06:33.289> to<00:06:33.500> you<00:06:33.800> I<00:06:34.130> guess<00:06:34.490> it's

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
okay so it's a four to you I guess it's

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.120 
okay so it's a four to you I guess it's
because<00:06:35.180> it's<00:06:35.419> too<00:06:35.479> subjective<00:06:35.750> too

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
because it's too subjective too

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.800 
because it's too subjective too
you<00:06:38.130> know<00:06:38.250> pinpoint<00:06:38.760> exactly<00:06:38.820> at<00:06:39.570> the<00:06:39.660> same

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
you know pinpoint exactly at the same

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.159 
you know pinpoint exactly at the same
time<00:06:40.080> we<00:06:40.380> can't<00:06:40.650> have<00:06:40.949> a<00:06:41.460> stats<00:06:42.419> page<00:06:42.750> because

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
time we can't have a stats page because

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.100 
time we can't have a stats page because
there's<00:06:43.320> too<00:06:43.410> many<00:06:43.500> variables<00:06:44.040> to<00:06:44.070> go<00:06:44.220> in<00:06:44.400> and

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
there's too many variables to go in and

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.330 
there's too many variables to go in and
