00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.410
 caviar house and manure which is a 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.260
 flagship of luxury gastronomy 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.530
 this way of business is to start 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.129
 with your father who manages rebels who 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.980
 were designed lebanese in copenhagen and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.230
 who was a forerunner of 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.879
 the import of cavia in europe 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 did you learn from him 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.350
 the job yes yes to feathers then have no 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.320
 only he took me but he gave me 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.629
 passion for caviar at the age of 4 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.670
 years ago he started to make me taste the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.680
 case well and then like that in products 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.390
 salted kids be they love you 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.400
 be test 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.920
 I loved it and it never stopped 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.680
 how did you go from one 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.869
 patient for the caviar to become 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.409
 entrepreneur is there marketing 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.080
 of his good it is necessary to know that during 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.940
 all my adolescence I wanted to be 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.549
 pianist 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.759
 I spent two hours a day showed 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.540
 on the piano and I'm coming I was 18 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.710
 or 19 when 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.020
 when suddenly I had a 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.550
 opportunity to be in a group of 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.920
 music but I had to have my 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.060
 own piano a big piano back so 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.830
 I went to my father ly 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.920
 I need to buy his piano at 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.990
 tail the other said to me you're going to work 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.680
 and there I very quickly understood that 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.780
 maybe if I had one so I was so 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.479
 it was easier to buy the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.890
 piano that if I had a piano this would 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.620
 very difficult to buy kvh 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.690
 what is success can the 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.430
 business success for me that's 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.070
 to be is to have the vision of what 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.660
 will happen tomorrow because in a 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.700
 company you have a number 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.400
 of people who live who are working and who 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 depends and for me the success of a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.350
 companies is to be able to ensure 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.990
 these people including myself and my 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.640
 associates one to come 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.430
 so I've never been interested in 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.989
 by the kind of company that is there 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.090
 for one year two years three years four years 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.489
 I always think I October 15 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.709
 20 30 years ahead and elsewhere pico 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.200
 became fish breeder 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.580
 Sturgeons have to make caviar 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.560
 takes ten years for sturgeon to do 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.530
 coffee has everything we do 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.300
 today we'll see that in ten years and 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.650
 in five years we will do something 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.390
 we'll see in fifteen or twenty years 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.280
 so it's very long term 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.590
 the real success of companies is the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.790
 companies that manage to cope with 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.450
 tomorrow's vision what is always 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.450
 very difficult 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.180
 you also knew claude nobs the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.560
 founders of montreux jazz 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.540
 did this meeting take you 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.820
 brought something for your 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.320
 career but also is what you have 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.400
 learned something personally from 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.629
 it 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.000
 oh yes I learned a lot about deÃ»le and 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.530
 claude first when I met them 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.420
 I thought I was the only one who 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.849
 I had met and nothing 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.950
 our foot in me someone who loves the 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.290
 food and music at the same time 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.120
 is we met in an airplane 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.620
 between geneva and zurich and we were all 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.599
 both en route for the same round of 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.590
 you what's funny I did not know 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.829
 it was claude nobs who was next to 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.859
 me 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.019
 yet when I was 14 years old I had the 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.239
 picture of close up in my room 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.859
 because he was the one who was 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.730
 the instigator of this moment we others 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.690
 deposit and it had fascinated me at school 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.200
 but he taught me a lot because 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.840
 is claude was a man who for 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.430
 nothing is fixed 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.109
 so everything can change and everything can 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.540
 develop and I always found very 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.980
 interesting from him he had a way 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.299
 to take risks that little 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.409
 entrepreneurs could do for him 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.150
 it was never a risk it was 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.090
 always at the opportunity that's what 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.069
 you have plans for the future in 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.750
 your business clearly puts so in 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.600
 the music 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.950
 already the fact that I am 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.040
 I teamed up with Claude Nobs 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.160
 concrete montreux jazz coffee is a 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.440
 jump I made in music with 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.630
 him because I found this signboard 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.070
 this mark this festival I find it 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:32.510
 quite exceptional so with good 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.460
 obviously it's just at the beginning 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.630
 even if it's been 50 years since 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.070
 do what we do I always find 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.780
 that we are at the beginning of this conflict in 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.680
 doing it and that now we can 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.680
 go much further 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.840
