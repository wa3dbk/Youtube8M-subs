is you can get creative in your
defensive<00:01:32.909> front<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.240> find<00:01:33.509> ways<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.960> put<00:01:34.140> him

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
defensive front and find ways to put him

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.170 
defensive front and find ways to put him
in<00:01:34.619> position<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.310> successful<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.000> think

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
in position to be successful and I think

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.270 
in position to be successful and I think
that's<00:01:36.420> why<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.990> took<00:01:37.200> him<00:01:37.409> some<00:01:37.920> say<00:01:38.070> he's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that's why they took him some say he's

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.160 
that's why they took him some say he's
maybe<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.640> 3-technique<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.390> feel<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.689> way<00:01:40.020> he's

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
maybe a 3-technique I feel that way he's

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.810 
maybe a 3-technique I feel that way he's
a<00:01:40.200> better<00:01:40.439> 3-technique<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.579> can't

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
a better 3-technique but you can't

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.179 
a better 3-technique but you can't
ignore<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.630> places<00:01:43.079> guy<00:01:43.259> made<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.829> Missouri

Jets<00:02:58.440> now<00:02:59.440> what<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.620> didn't<00:02:59.950> like<00:02:59.980> about<00:03:00.100> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
Jets now what I didn't like about the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.190 
Jets now what I didn't like about the
Jets<00:03:00.730> draft<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.060> felt<00:03:01.269> this<00:03:01.420> though<00:03:01.600> new<00:03:01.870> GM

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
Jets draft I felt this though new GM

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.110 
Jets draft I felt this though new GM
John<00:03:02.500> Idzik<00:03:02.950> didn't<00:03:03.250> address<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.519> real<00:03:03.820> issue

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
John Idzik didn't address a real issue

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.790 
John Idzik didn't address a real issue
with<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.450> offense<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.019> that's<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.350> lack<00:03:05.620> of

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
with the offense and that's the lack of

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.560 
with the offense and that's the lack of
playmakers<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.820> flanks<00:03:07.180> they<00:03:07.269> have<00:03:07.450> to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
playmakers on the flanks they have to

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.479 
playmakers on the flanks they have to
get<00:03:07.720> better<00:03:07.900> at<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.560> receiver<00:03:08.890> position<00:03:09.010> at

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
get better at the receiver position at

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.860 
get better at the receiver position at
the<00:03:09.610> tight<00:03:09.820> end<00:03:09.970> position<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.480> quite

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
the tight end position and quite

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.810 
the tight end position and quite
honestly<00:03:10.900> at<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.680> running<00:03:12.010> back<00:03:12.160> position<00:03:12.190> I

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
honestly at the running back position I

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.550 
honestly at the running back position I
know<00:03:13.060> they<00:03:13.269> bring<00:03:13.420> over<00:03:13.720> Chris<00:03:13.930> Ivory<00:03:14.170> but

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
know they bring over Chris Ivory but

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.380 
know they bring over Chris Ivory but
he's<00:03:14.709> a<00:03:14.739> guy<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.250> hasn't<00:03:15.640> proven<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.269> be

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
he's a guy that hasn't proven to be

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.670 
he's a guy that hasn't proven to be
healthy<00:03:16.780> throughout<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.260> course<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.560> a

16-game<00:03:18.250> season<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:18.880> they<00:03:19.269> need<00:03:19.450> an<00:03:19.540> upgrade

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
16-game season so they need an upgrade

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.199 
16-game season so they need an upgrade

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
can be versatile in his approach and he

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.069 
can be versatile in his approach and he
reminds<00:03:42.100> me<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.250> lot<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.430> LaRon<00:03:42.880> Landry<00:03:42.910> in<00:03:43.570> his

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
reminds me a lot of LaRon Landry in his

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.780 
reminds me a lot of LaRon Landry in his
ability<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.680> play<00:03:44.860> either<00:03:45.100> closer<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.700> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
ability to play either closer to the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.370 
ability to play either closer to the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
line of scrimmage or even on the back

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.050 
line of scrimmage or even on the back
end<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.709> can<00:03:47.890> match<00:03:48.040> up<00:03:48.220> well<00:03:48.400> versus<00:03:48.850> tight

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
end and can match up well versus tight

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.090 
end and can match up well versus tight
end<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.480> bill<00:03:49.989> as<00:03:50.140> though<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.680> just<00:03:50.920> got

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
end so I bill as though to just got

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.830 
end so I bill as though to just got
themselves<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.519> steal<00:03:51.730> with<00:03:51.910> this<00:03:52.090> guy<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.510> it

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
themselves to steal with this guy and it

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.569 
themselves to steal with this guy and it
wouldn't<00:03:53.140> surprise<00:03:53.260> me<00:03:53.530> later<00:03:54.010> on<00:03:54.250> in<00:03:54.489> the

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
wouldn't surprise me later on in the

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.819 
wouldn't surprise me later on in the
season<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:55.360> may<00:03:55.540> see<00:03:55.600> him<00:03:55.930> starting<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.650> think

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
season you may see him starting I think

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.650 
season you may see him starting I think
he<00:03:56.980> has<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.430> type<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.730> talent<00:03:58.030> from<00:03:58.239> day<00:03:58.450> one

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
he has that type of talent from day one

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.660 
he has that type of talent from day one
and<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.620> Jets<00:03:59.829> were<00:03:59.920> able<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.190> get<00:04:00.280> some<00:04:00.459> sound

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670
