you're gonna pop it and turn your hand

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.569 
you're gonna pop it and turn your hand
sideways<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:45.260> follow<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.709> handle<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
knife is gonna fall with gravity as it

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.479 
knife is gonna fall with gravity as it
spins<00:02:49.010> when<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.120> gets<00:02:50.269> who<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.840> know<00:02:51.489> the

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
spins when it gets who you know the

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.729 
spins when it gets who you know the
lowest<00:02:52.910> point<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:54.260> nadir<00:02:54.620> if<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.430> will<00:02:56.739> grab

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
lowest point the nadir if you will grab

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.670 
lowest point the nadir if you will grab
it<00:02:57.890> catch<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.510> bring<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.599> back<00:02:59.720> up<00:02:59.900> all<00:03:00.560> right

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
it catch it bring it back up all right

it catch it bring it back up all right
there<00:03:00.859> you<00:03:00.889> go<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:01.280> that's<00:03:01.400> that's<00:03:02.030> how<00:03:02.239> you

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
there you go so that's that's how you

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.379 
there you go so that's that's how you
get<00:03:02.450> into<00:03:02.660> false<00:03:02.870> fan<00:03:03.109> or<00:03:03.609> ghost<00:03:04.609> roll<00:03:04.910> maybe

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
get into false fan or ghost roll maybe

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.490 
get into false fan or ghost roll maybe
ha<00:03:06.079> no<00:03:07.269> nomenclatures<00:03:08.269> not<00:03:08.480> my<00:03:08.690> strong<00:03:09.470> suit

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
ha no nomenclatures not my strong suit

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.089 
ha no nomenclatures not my strong suit
alright<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.669> all<00:03:11.660> right<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.019> now<00:03:12.349> beyond<00:03:12.980> that

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
alright and all right so now beyond that

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.610 
alright and all right so now beyond that
I'm<00:03:13.669> just<00:03:13.910> what<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.239> this<00:03:14.419> one<00:03:14.630> trainer

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
I'm just what so this one trainer

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.559 
I'm just what so this one trainer
because<00:03:15.859> it<00:03:18.099> high<00:03:19.099> gravity<00:03:19.639> on<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.239> trainer

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
because it high gravity on the trainer

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.870 
because it high gravity on the trainer
it's<00:03:21.139> very<00:03:21.349> high<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:22.069> might<00:03:22.370> just<00:03:22.400> be<00:03:22.730> this

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
it's very high it might just be this

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.210 
it's very high it might just be this
area<00:03:23.299> this<00:03:23.540> whole<00:03:23.750> camera<00:03:24.139> might<00:03:24.470> just<00:03:24.680> be

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
area this whole camera might just be

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.849 
area this whole camera might just be
very<00:03:25.459> high<00:03:25.730> high<00:03:26.299> gravity<00:03:26.599> area<00:03:27.079> all<00:03:27.500> right<00:03:27.620> so

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
very high high gravity area all right so

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.440 
very high high gravity area all right so
anyway<00:03:28.599> I'm<00:03:29.599> telling<00:03:30.169> you<00:03:30.290> right<00:03:30.919> so<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.819> go

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
that will it should look like it's

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.860 
that will it should look like it's
impossible<00:04:26.880> all<00:04:27.880> right<00:04:28.000> we<00:04:28.210> may<00:04:28.390> go<00:04:28.600> with<00:04:28.780> the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
impossible all right we may go with the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.810 
impossible all right we may go with the
impossible<00:04:29.110> because<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:30.070> was<00:04:30.220> visually

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
impossible because that was visually

cool<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:36.070> know<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:38.710> floor<00:04:39.040> likes<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.520> the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
cool I know the the floor likes it the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.880 
cool I know the the floor likes it the
floor<00:04:40.120> like<00:04:40.300> this<00:04:40.330> move<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.840> lot<00:04:40.960> all<00:04:41.590> right<00:04:41.680> so

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
floor like this move a lot all right so
