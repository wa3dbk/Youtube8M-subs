controls same depressing than a button

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.840 
controls same depressing than a button
which<00:02:42.750> makes<00:02:42.990> no<00:02:43.050> sense<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:44.310> um<00:02:44.490> yeah<00:02:44.700> i'll

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
which makes no sense but um yeah i'll

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.490 
which makes no sense but um yeah i'll
talk<00:02:45.060> about<00:02:45.090> outside<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.990> know<00:02:46.110> can't

things<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.530> think<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.890> needs<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
things like that I think it needs to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.190 
things like that I think it needs to
evolve<00:02:50.580> with<00:02:50.940> things<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.480> know<00:02:51.510> voice
