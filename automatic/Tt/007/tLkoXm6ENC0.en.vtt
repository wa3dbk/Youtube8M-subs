the socket affinity is 68 now instead of

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
health in the head and sockets I get

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.959 
health in the head and sockets I get
more<00:01:59.529> help<00:01:59.679> from<00:01:59.859> the<00:02:00.039> mod<00:02:00.219> than<00:02:00.609> I<00:02:00.729> do<00:02:00.789> from

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
more help from the mod than I do from

more help from the mod than I do from
stock<00:02:01.329> affinity<00:02:01.749> so<00:02:02.200> this<00:02:02.380> way<00:02:02.560> I<00:02:02.590> actually

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
stock affinity so this way I actually

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.559 
stock affinity so this way I actually
benefit<00:02:03.520> more<00:02:03.700> from<00:02:03.759> this<00:02:04.029> using<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.359> mod

time I use that it prevents damage and I

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.950 
time I use that it prevents damage and I

also get a small hill from it so it's

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.010 
also get a small hill from it so it's
just<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.140> really<00:05:08.170> really<00:05:08.560> good<00:05:08.770> mod<00:05:08.980> to<00:05:09.130> use<00:05:09.370> and

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020
