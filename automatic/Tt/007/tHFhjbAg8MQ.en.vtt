00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:03.799 
okay this is going to be a short video

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.900 
okay this is going to be a short video
illustrating<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.009> differences<00:00:05.549> between

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
illustrating the differences between

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.270 
illustrating the differences between
worn<00:00:06.720> engine<00:00:07.140> mounts<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.710> transmission

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
worn engine mounts and transmission

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.070 
worn engine mounts and transmission
mounts<00:00:08.550> versus<00:00:09.030> new<00:00:09.240> engine<00:00:09.660> mounts<00:00:09.929> and

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
mounts versus new engine mounts and

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.810 
mounts versus new engine mounts and
transmission<00:00:10.679> mounts<00:00:11.360> this<00:00:12.360> car<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.820> new

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
transmission mounts this car is the new

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.099 
transmission mounts this car is the new
300<00:00:15.509> SD<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.820> it<00:00:17.820> needs<00:00:18.090> engine<00:00:18.570> mounts<00:00:18.900> and

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
300 SD and it needs engine mounts and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.170 
300 SD and it needs engine mounts and
possibly<00:00:19.529> transmission<00:00:20.100> though<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:21.119> I'm

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
possibly transmission though so I'm

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.370 
possibly transmission though so I'm
going<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.330> go<00:00:21.420> ahead<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.689> start<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:21.990> up<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
going to go ahead and start it up and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.650 
going to go ahead and start it up and
let<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.769> hear<00:00:23.130> what<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.910> sounds<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.539> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
let you hear what it sounds like in the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.470 
let you hear what it sounds like in the
cabin<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.380> I'm<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.710> go<00:00:25.800> over<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
cabin and then I'm going to go over to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.870 
cabin and then I'm going to go over to
the<00:00:27.480> other<00:00:27.840> 300<00:00:28.560> SD<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.130> I've<00:00:29.429> had<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
the other 300 SD that I've had for a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.720 
the other 300 SD that I've had for a
couple<00:00:29.910> years<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:31.260> start<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.769> up<00:00:31.980> which<00:00:32.219> has

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
couple years and start that up which has

00:00:32.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
couple years and start that up which has
new<00:00:33.120> motor<00:00:33.420> mounts<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.960> transmission

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:02:21.539 

the<00:01:26.750> car<00:01:26.990> with<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.229> new<00:01:27.350> mounts

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:39.540 

see<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:22.700> difference

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.250 

so<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.150> started<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.600> tell<00:02:40.780> if<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.990> car<00:02:41.140> was

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
so I started to tell if the car was

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:52.550 
so I started to tell if the car was
running<00:02:41.470> or<00:02:41.620> not

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:09.589 

it's<00:02:53.560> running

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.860 

there<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.260> go<00:03:10.379> there's<00:03:10.620> your<00:03:10.680> difference<00:03:11.870> not

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
there you go there's your difference not

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.899 
there you go there's your difference not
hard<00:03:13.049> to<00:03:13.170> change<00:03:13.409> you<00:03:14.340> can<00:03:14.459> make<00:03:14.609> a<00:03:14.639> huge

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
hard to change you can make a huge

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.359 
hard to change you can make a huge
difference
