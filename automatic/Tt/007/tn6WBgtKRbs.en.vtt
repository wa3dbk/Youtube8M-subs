00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:10.050
 so video review dedicated kit 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.570
 falcon surveillance video oh namely 104 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.590
 whale 104 becket cottage 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.320
 what it says glue puppet 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.170
 wonderful store citylink he 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.689
 It is the first 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.160
 gypsum when unpacking about everything at once 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.210
 I want to say quite carefully 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:38.190
 enough for the founder that we have the world 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.239
 the first thing that surprised me more was that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.950
 inside two very long cables for 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:50.910
 camera and length if you believe the stickers 30 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.879
 meters 30 meters is something that is not 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.969
 positioned in the description ie this 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.280
 was such a pleasant moment that me 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.830
 very surprised means second 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:11.130
 cable shorter there are mixed about 18 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:14.810
 meters that we still inside and still we 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.950
 power adapter inside 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.009
 respectively 1 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:26.159
 mom is four dad power supply apparently he 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.759
 implies something that goes to the camera 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:35.750
 because only half ampere 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.750
 2 amps per lamberet with consumption 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.470
 documentation set with trotsky 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.470
 user manual 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:54.140
 4 boxes each of which is located 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:02:02.420
 the camera say well enough 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:08.780
 sealed but just boxes 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.780
 the camera itself is pretty and white 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:19.890
 camera matching bayonet 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.940
 video connector and try 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.459
 this is not done not seen 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:33.140
 for its fixing the quantities of pieces with three 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:44.790
 screw on the keys to adjust the camera 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:48.660
 tharks separately in a separate suitcase that 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.690
 in general adds such value 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.200
 external trouble for any 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:00.450
 installation die leute case 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.350
 cardboard by the registrar so what 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.940
 in this case 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:09.720
 in this case is very well packed himself 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:13.010
 recorder and a separate box with 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.010
 personal belongings for him 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.140
 Registrar I took 4 channel saved 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.510
 I began to say 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.150
 bring me no more at just 4 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.250
 cameras that are bundled go 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.250
 the recorder is packed 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.250
 also 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.980
 but 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.170
 description of what's on the front panel on 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.510
 the back panel in general you can find 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.000
 like all the manufacturer's website 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.910
 corresponds because there is basicity 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.640
 a little bit at the outputs means there is hd 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:51.930
 go exactly hdmi 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.400
 there are video audios 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.370
 winning connector if you will 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:06.810
 use a completely ancient monitor there 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:11.920
 2 usb connector, we actually 345 and outputs 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:20.470
 alarm alarm and format now what have 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:26.910
 we are in a box with a reason how to fill 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:33.160
 manufacturer inside mouse without wheels 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.560
 remote control without batteries in 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.400
 Included are batteries of type three and then 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.430
 there is a glorify called mizinchikovye 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.880
 battery pack no photo of them 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:52.290
 rings of happiness and unfortunately the most 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:54.610
 output adapter box 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:05:00.370
 respectively registrars which are 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:02.860
 stuck in the clip here wires well 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.160
 the power supply itself is also two 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:11.230
 ampere with 2 amps out here 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.540
 In general, what is inside this box right away 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.600
 I want to say that the registrar himself 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:21.669
 goes without hard inside that is hard need 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.669
 buying separately effects can be 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:27.310
 if I have the mood and strength 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.650
 how from everything managed to connect that end up 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.980
 it took to set up thanks for 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.980
 Attention
