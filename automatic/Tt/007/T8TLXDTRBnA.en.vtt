going to substitute up on his switch

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.030 
going to substitute up on his switch
he's<00:03:21.959> already<00:03:22.139> seeing<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.560> because<00:03:22.769> he<00:03:22.859> saw

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
he's already seeing that because he saw

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.430 
he's already seeing that because he saw
my<00:03:23.160> leftovers<00:03:23.579> recovery<00:03:24.109> so<00:03:25.109> he's<00:03:25.260> going<00:03:25.380> to

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
my leftovers recovery so he's going to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.050 
my leftovers recovery so he's going to
go<00:03:25.560> into<00:03:25.680> his<00:03:25.889> own<00:03:26.040> sizzle<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.609> I<00:03:26.700> figure<00:03:26.910> okay

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
go into his own sizzle and I figure okay

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.460 
go into his own sizzle and I figure okay
well<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.690> program<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.230> get<00:03:28.350> some

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
well this is a program to get some

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.930 
well this is a program to get some
massive<00:03:28.739> amounts<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:28.980> damage<00:03:29.160> on<00:03:29.459> his<00:03:29.639> sis<00:03:29.790> or

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
massive amounts of damage on his sis or

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.509 
massive amounts of damage on his sis or
so<00:03:30.900> he's<00:03:31.500> just<00:03:31.560> gonna<00:03:31.739> go<00:03:31.889> for<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.100> safe<00:03:32.280> full<00:03:32.459> of

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
so he's just gonna go for a safe full of

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.000 
so he's just gonna go for a safe full of
punch<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.090> try<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.690> break<00:03:34.079> my<00:03:34.260> sub<00:03:34.470> obviously

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
punch to try and break my sub obviously

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.400 
punch to try and break my sub obviously
which<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.280> does<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.790> I'm<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:36.900> gonna<00:03:37.019> fire

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
which it does and I'm just gonna fire

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.020 
which it does and I'm just gonna fire
off<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.590> close-combat<00:03:38.069> that<00:03:38.400> does<00:03:38.609> do<00:03:38.819> about

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
off a close-combat that does do about

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.970 
off a close-combat that does do about
two-thirds<00:03:39.510> damage<00:03:39.989> so<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.440> will<00:03:40.680> take<00:03:40.950> him

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
two-thirds damage so that will take him

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.920 
two-thirds damage so that will take him
out<00:03:41.220> next<00:03:41.489> turn<00:03:41.670> but<00:03:41.940> because<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.900> a

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
out next turn but because I have a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.479 
out next turn but because I have a
defense<00:03:43.319> trap<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.739> don't<00:03:43.889> really<00:03:44.099> want<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.310> stay

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
defense trap I don't really want to stay

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.789 
defense trap I don't really want to stay
in<00:03:44.519> here<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.000> possibly<00:03:45.200> risk<00:03:46.200> dying<00:03:46.590> for

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
in here and possibly risk dying for

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.819 
in here and possibly risk dying for
movable<00:03:47.340> punch<00:03:47.549> which<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.849> will<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:49.680> I'm<00:03:49.799> going

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
movable punch which I will so I'm going

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.110 
movable punch which I will so I'm going

umbreon switch which is exactly what

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.390 
umbreon switch which is exactly what
happens<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.350> right<00:04:01.710> here<00:04:01.740> i'm<00:04:02.070> not<00:04:02.220> going<00:04:02.370> to

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
happens and right here i'm not going to

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
sub up trying to do anything although it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.570 
sub up trying to do anything although it
probably<00:04:04.320> could<00:04:04.770> have<00:04:04.800> summed<00:04:05.160> up<00:04:05.280> because

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
probably could have summed up because

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.180 
probably could have summed up because
it's<00:04:05.730> payback<00:04:05.990> did<00:04:06.990> like<00:04:07.200> 30<00:04:07.500> damage<00:04:07.770> to<00:04:08.040> me

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
it's payback did like 30 damage to me

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.560 
it's payback did like 30 damage to me
and<00:04:08.400> i<00:04:08.670> probably<00:04:08.940> could<00:04:09.240> have<00:04:09.270> you<00:04:09.450> know

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
and i probably could have you know

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.940 
and i probably could have you know
taking<00:04:09.900> that<00:04:10.080> i<00:04:10.140> just<00:04:10.260> wanted<00:04:10.620> to<00:04:10.680> get<00:04:10.800> this

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
taking that i just wanted to get this

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.650 
taking that i just wanted to get this
thing<00:04:11.160> out<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.550> way<00:04:11.700> as<00:04:11.880> fast<00:04:12.030> i<00:04:12.300> possibly

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
thing out of the way as fast i possibly

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.480 
thing out of the way as fast i possibly
could<00:04:12.900> but<00:04:13.890> looking<00:04:14.070> back<00:04:14.100> when<00:04:14.370> it's

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
could but looking back when it's

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.740 
could but looking back when it's
something<00:04:14.700> up<00:04:14.910> there<00:04:15.090> would<00:04:15.300> have<00:04:15.390> been<00:04:15.450> the

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
something up there would have been the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.740 
something up there would have been the
better<00:04:15.900> play<00:04:17.060> so<00:04:18.060> right<00:04:18.299> here<00:04:18.480> he's<00:04:18.570> going<00:04:18.690> to

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
better play so right here he's going to

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.050 
better play so right here he's going to
go<00:04:18.840> into<00:04:18.959> his<00:04:19.140> raikou<00:04:19.560> i<00:04:19.859> figured<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:20.880> i

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
go into his raikou i figured that i

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.120 
go into his raikou i figured that i
probably<00:04:21.600> don't<00:04:22.230> want<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.590> say<00:04:22.800> it<00:04:22.890> again

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
probably don't want to say it again

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.380 
probably don't want to say it again
because<00:04:23.280> i<00:04:23.400> have<00:04:23.520> defense<00:04:23.850> dropped<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.330> i'd

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
because i have defense dropped and i'd

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.820 
because i have defense dropped and i'd
like<00:04:24.420> to<00:04:24.660> save<00:04:24.840> heracross<00:04:25.260> possibly<00:04:25.650> for

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
like to save heracross possibly for

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.440 
like to save heracross possibly for
later<00:04:26.010> so<00:04:26.520> i'm<00:04:26.580> going<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.760> go<00:04:26.820> into<00:04:27.060> reuniclus

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
later so i'm going to go into reuniclus

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.630 
later so i'm going to go into reuniclus
which<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.960> know<00:04:28.020> can<00:04:28.470> take<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.920> thunderbolt<00:04:29.520> or

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
which I know can take a thunderbolt or

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.780 
which I know can take a thunderbolt or
two<00:04:30.380> so<00:04:31.380> if<00:04:31.440> he<00:04:31.530> actually<00:04:31.650> shows<00:04:32.040> up<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.700> I'm

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
two so if he actually shows up and I'm

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.440 
two so if he actually shows up and I'm
kind<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.060> fearing<00:04:33.390> that<00:04:33.419> he<00:04:33.570> has<00:04:33.750> calm<00:04:34.110> mind

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
kind of fearing that he has calm mind

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.159 
kind of fearing that he has calm mind
but<00:04:36.450> he<00:04:36.540> just<00:04:36.660> goes<00:04:36.840> right<00:04:36.990> for<00:04:37.110> the

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
but he just goes right for the
