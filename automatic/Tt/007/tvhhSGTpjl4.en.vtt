because<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.200> almost<00:01:46.409> looks<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.710> straight

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
because it almost looks like straight

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.730 
because it almost looks like straight
stiff<00:01:47.820> Barbie<00:01:48.180> hair<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.600> even<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.470> curl

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
stiff Barbie hair I think even if I curl

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.380 
stiff Barbie hair I think even if I curl
it<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.009> whatever<00:01:50.159> there's<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:51.030> kind<00:01:51.299> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it or whatever there's just this kind of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.219 
it or whatever there's just this kind of
sheen<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.119> think<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.570> very

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
sheen on it that I think is not very

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.859 
sheen on it that I think is not very
natural<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:55.740> you're<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.100> natural<00:01:56.969> against<00:01:57.689> my

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
natural if you're not natural against my

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.410 
natural if you're not natural against my
hair<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.590> might<00:01:58.799> work<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.270> other<00:02:00.270> people

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
hair so it might work for other people

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.069 
hair so it might work for other people
but<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.439> what<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.829> liked<00:02:02.399> about<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:03.360> brand<00:02:03.869> is

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
but so what I liked about this brand is

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.200 
but so what I liked about this brand is
that<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.250> crazy<00:02:05.610> sealed

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
that it's not like this crazy sealed

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.749 
that it's not like this crazy sealed
like<00:02:06.509> shiny<00:02:07.200> coated<00:02:07.710> kind<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.069> hair<00:02:08.250> which<00:02:08.520> I

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
like shiny coated kind of hair which I

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.400 
like shiny coated kind of hair which I
liked<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.239> think<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.629> texture<00:02:10.020> blends<00:02:10.259> in

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
liked and I think the texture blends in

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.969 
liked and I think the texture blends in
perfectly

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
perfectly

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.339 
perfectly
so<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.239> another<00:02:12.450> thing<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.870> liked<00:02:13.110> so

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
so that is another thing that I liked so

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.880 
so that is another thing that I liked so
the<00:02:14.190> color<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.489> got<00:02:14.819> is<00:02:14.879> this<00:02:15.360> six<00:02:15.810> one<00:02:16.319> three

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the color I got is this six one three

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.640 
the color I got is this six one three
and<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.080> think<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.470> their

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
and it's like I think one of their

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.220 
and it's like I think one of their
lightest<00:02:20.129> ones<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.700> think<00:02:20.910> they<00:02:21.090> have<00:02:21.269> but<00:02:22.050> more

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
lightest ones I think they have but more

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.140 
lightest ones I think they have but more
like<00:02:22.379> ashy<00:02:22.590> blonde<00:02:22.890> not<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.580> bleach

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
like ashy blonde not like a bleach

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.330 
like ashy blonde not like a bleach
launder<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.650> thought<00:02:25.830> I'd<00:02:25.980> share<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.220> with

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
launder and I thought I'd share it with

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.220 
launder and I thought I'd share it with
you<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:26.879> I'm<00:02:27.000> not<00:02:27.060> wearing<00:02:27.390> any<00:02:27.569> extensions<00:02:28.050> in

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
you so I'm not wearing any extensions in

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.640 
you so I'm not wearing any extensions in
right<00:02:28.530> now<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.950> will<00:02:29.550> just<00:02:29.580> put<00:02:29.940> them<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.650> real

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
right now I will just put them on real

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:46.380 
right now I will just put them on real
quickly<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.340> then<00:02:33.180> I'll<00:02:33.769> just<00:02:34.769> sure

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.430 

a<00:02:46.480> lot<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.440> times<00:02:47.740> I<00:02:48.010> do<00:02:48.310> need<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.640> tone<00:02:49.390> or<00:02:49.780> just

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
a lot of times I do need to tone or just

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.380 
a lot of times I do need to tone or just
tent<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.950> little<00:02:51.220> bit<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.090> completely

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
tent a little bit so it can completely

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.510 
tent a little bit so it can completely
match<00:02:52.750> my<00:02:52.990> hair<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.380> blonde<00:02:54.010> can<00:02:54.250> be<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> little

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
match my hair and blonde can be a little

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.449 
match my hair and blonde can be a little
difficult<00:02:54.790> but<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.810> think<00:02:55.900> these<00:02:56.459> actually

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
difficult but I think these actually

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.059 
difficult but I think these actually
blend<00:02:57.670> pretty<00:02:58.030> well<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:59.140> eventually<00:02:59.740> say

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
blend pretty well and eventually say

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.190 
blend pretty well and eventually say
maybe<00:03:00.250> in<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.580> fall<00:03:01.030> or<00:03:01.060> winter<00:03:01.390> if<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.020> go<00:03:02.170> a

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
maybe in the fall or winter if I go a

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.230 
maybe in the fall or winter if I go a
little<00:03:02.350> bit<00:03:02.620> warmer<00:03:03.280> or<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.520> little<00:03:03.730> bit<00:03:03.820> darker

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
little bit warmer or a little bit darker

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.900 
little bit warmer or a little bit darker
about<00:03:05.050> probably<00:03:05.440> gently<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.280> know<00:03:06.400> add<00:03:06.640> a

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
about probably gently you know add a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.020 
about probably gently you know add a
toner<00:03:07.150> just<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:08.700> absolutely<00:03:09.700> have<00:03:09.910> it

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
toner just to absolutely have it

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.370 
toner just to absolutely have it
completely<00:03:10.660> 100%<00:03:11.350> match<00:03:12.190> my<00:03:12.459> hair<00:03:12.670> but<00:03:13.380> anyway

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
completely 100% match my hair but anyway

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.630 
completely 100% match my hair but anyway
so<00:03:14.440> this<00:03:14.830> is<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.390> result

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
so this is the result

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.070 
so this is the result
back

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.070 

and<00:03:24.080> I<00:03:24.290> think<00:03:24.350> they're<00:03:25.330> full<00:03:26.330> enough<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.900> give

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
and I think they're full enough to give

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.770 
and I think they're full enough to give
you<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.230> good<00:03:27.610> like<00:03:28.610> balance<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.270> my<00:03:29.360> hair<00:03:29.570> like

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
thickness and like I said the texture is

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.590 
thickness and like I said the texture is
pretty<00:03:32.810> amazing<00:03:33.050> so<00:03:33.710> and<00:03:33.980> because<00:03:34.850> it's<00:03:35.120> 100%

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
pretty amazing so and because it's 100%

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.570 
pretty amazing so and because it's 100%
