the movie just I think if I hadn't read
the<00:03:31.770> book<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.250> would<00:03:32.400> probably<00:03:32.550> enjoy<00:03:32.850> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
the book I would probably enjoy the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.340 
the book I would probably enjoy the
movie<00:03:33.360> because<00:03:33.630> it's<00:03:33.750> just<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.959> chick<00:03:34.140> flick

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
movie because it's just a chick flick

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.260 
movie because it's just a chick flick
and<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.830> do<00:03:34.890> enjoy<00:03:35.130> chick<00:03:35.430> flicks<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.880> feel<00:03:36.120> like

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
and I do enjoy chick flicks it feel like

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.860 
and I do enjoy chick flicks it feel like
they<00:03:36.390> deviated<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.440> much<00:03:38.430> from<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.540> plot<00:03:39.840> of

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870
