00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.100
 and still 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.480
 I think the character is not one more time 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.340
 making me up to you 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.810
 now I will do weight training for you 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.019
 here an external battery that a break from 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.239
 20m to this battery is for you 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.309
 load your proposed devices in the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.170
 For example, if you are traveling on a 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.620
 which will be the case 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.790
 a long trip is this battery that can 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.270
 help a lot 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.770
 is that of a researcher and I saw that 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.100
 some models and this model that was 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.680
 appeared to be the strongest and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.890
 is 20 mm, but this power 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.390
 nominal is not the actual power 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.090
 and it 's but from what I understood there other 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.659
 people who bought and if this battery 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.200
 who could carry a tablet by 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:21.689
 example iphone mobile phone and 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:22.950
 android galaxy but the 335 times delay 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.959
 a little bit right? 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.509
 I saw that to fully charge can 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:30.090
 take up to eight hours 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.689
 but you can use the cool is that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.950
 you can use your device already 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.049
 connected to the battery 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.609
 So I'll do boxing here just to 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.630
 show you what's next 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:45.599
 I bought in that store that is called to 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.859
 guy who has a guarantee zinha from the 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:52.200
 car will need this he comes to talk 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.380
 you can see protected by plastic 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.390
 bubble 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.079
 in white color ac in the box we have 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.590
 here is a non -led indicator 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.060
 works has USB output of a skin 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.649
 two points on the flashlight 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.459
 you can charge two devices to the 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:18.110
 The same time has production is protection for 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:22.190
 circuit is protection before 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.099
 launch is fast loading of which I do not know 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.269
 which means I do not know that there is 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:32.540
 I never saw that the acronym that is battery 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.870
 green on the drums in day with 11 th day 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.769
 11 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.720
 so with the environment and here 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.599
 let's see who is the face of this bug 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.170
 Battery here how cool and okay 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:48.049
 cool have great size to know inside 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.989
 of the box box on the plus side here comes 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.349
 the warranty manual has a path 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:03:00.340
 a lot of cool that is a way out 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:03.170
 which probably for ipad but to that 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.810
 but do not have until day on your taste of 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.690
 android how do you know to get out of here 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.329
 samsung devices and another one that 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:21.920
 I do not know they did not have this connection 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:25.940
 that 's very cool, it 's very cute 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.850
 business and even a doctor here seems 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.170
 flash a power button then 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.319
 I do not think it 's a led with much 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:45.680
 quality well finished here the ability to 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:47.840
 20 mm his connection to roots and you 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.209
 can fall into any usb port ne 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.549
 and has two outputs one output from sbt 5 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.120
 last leg an usb output of two 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.720
 others while it is excuse 5 volts 2.1 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.650
 foot to equal if positive is very cool 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.599
 ends in the palm of the hand 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.670
 I 'll get the cell phone here as 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.120
 reference 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.110
 z max 22 as staff that already accompanies 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.030
 the videos know I know there is bigger than 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.769
 practically the size of the screen of your 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.579
 cell phone 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:26.039
 only that much thicker it has a thickness 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:31.410
 greater here is a usa to load 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:36.500
 so you plug in if it rains which cable 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:39.510
 that connects there is that same thing 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.460
 connect this car here and so on 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.190
 computer it will load and here it 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.510
 an LED indicator here this time 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.240
 button until the button here because senna 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.099
 you have already shown that you have the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.789
 a car with two chopsticks 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:59.160
 It is not yet fully filled very 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:04.380
 cool, I do not know why this is so 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:08.030
 it is necessary to discuss flash lite is to give a 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.030
 antenna but how does no one 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:20.699
 even up and there are two quick taps 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:23.490
 in this button I 'm going to take my fight 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:26.370
 Let's work for you too. 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:31.530
 is off to avoid two taps 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:34.380
 quick on that button on the little screen that you found 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.139
 something's something 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.660
 turned off beauty so this is it here is 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:44.470
 node also here to carry around 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:49.060
 now I will rule beauty 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:52.540
 so here's how you can see focused on 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:55.600
 loading it here very cool tablet 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.600
 here I quite liked the product looks 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.460
 of high quality and finish is well 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.220
 Beautiful will match everything I use 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:09.100
 because I like white devices 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:11.500
 as you can see that combines 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.790
 quite finished with devices 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.460
 in sound and such 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.160
 Very cool, I'm happy with this thing. 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.140
 that is not so is vague when 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.610
 I was going to watch the product load 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.110
 he see how it works 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.580
 any doubt if it is in relation to 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.100
 this product may ask that in the 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.170
 As far as possible I answer to you 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:33.300
 Beauty is all there to watch. 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:33.300
 video the law until the next was
