kind of poke it and if none of the rub

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.690 
kind of poke it and if none of the rub
comes<00:02:21.170> off<00:02:21.410> on<00:02:21.560> your<00:02:21.680> finger<00:02:22.040> youth<00:02:22.340> that

means you form your crust at that point
you<00:02:24.800> can<00:02:25.040> wrap<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.280> that's<00:02:25.640> joining<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.060> good

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
you can wrap it that's joining a good

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.170 
you can wrap it that's joining a good
point<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.570> wrap<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.670> conversely<00:02:28.670> when<00:02:28.970> I'm

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.320 
point to wrap it conversely when I'm
cooking<00:02:29.570> at<00:02:29.990> 325<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:32.300> point<00:02:32.600> might<00:02:32.780> come<00:02:33.140> in

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
cooking at 325 that point might come in

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.260 
cooking at 325 that point might come in
two<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.510> half<00:02:35.690> or<00:02:35.870> three<00:02:36.080> hours<00:02:36.910> but<00:02:37.910> you

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
two and a half or three hours but you

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.700 
two and a half or three hours but you
know<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.540> determinant<00:02:39.080> factor<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.470> still

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
know the determinant factor is still

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.340 
know the determinant factor is still
when<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.310> touch<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:41.030> my<00:02:41.060> finger<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.840> no

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
when I touch it with my finger and no

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.340 
when I touch it with my finger and no
rope<00:02:42.620> comes<00:02:43.010> off<00:02:43.600> that's<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.750> point<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.170> wrap

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
rope comes off that's the point to wrap

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.720 
rope comes off that's the point to wrap
it<00:02:45.560> because<00:02:45.740> you're<00:02:46.040> not<00:02:46.190> going<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.430> take<00:02:46.580> too

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
it because you're not going to take too

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.610 
it because you're not going to take too
much<00:02:46.850> more<00:02:47.090> smoke<00:02:47.360> after<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:47.840> so<00:02:48.350> go<00:02:48.530> ahead

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
much more smoke after that so go ahead

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.850 
much more smoke after that so go ahead
and<00:02:48.770> wrap<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.510> after<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.750> base<00:02:51.440> what<00:02:51.710> I<00:02:51.740> you

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
and wrap it after that base what I you

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.950 
and wrap it after that base what I you
do<00:02:52.070> is<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.400> take<00:02:52.640> an<00:02:52.850> ice<00:02:53.000> pick<00:02:53.270> some<00:02:53.510> people<00:02:53.780> you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
do is I take an ice pick some people you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.020 
do is I take an ice pick some people you
you<00:02:54.140> usually<00:02:54.350> I'll<00:02:54.650> get<00:02:54.830> thermal<00:02:55.250> pins<00:02:55.520> and

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
you usually I'll get thermal pins and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.580 
you usually I'll get thermal pins and
your<00:02:56.300> mavericks<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:56.900> all<00:02:56.990> the<00:02:57.080> kind<00:02:57.260> of<00:02:57.320> stuff

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
your mavericks and all the kind of stuff

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.140 
your mavericks and all the kind of stuff
and<00:02:59.200> 195<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> good<00:03:00.920> general<00:03:01.490> temperature<00:03:02.030> to

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
and 195 is a good general temperature to

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.110 
and 195 is a good general temperature to
start<00:03:02.390> checking<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.960> but<00:03:03.710> what<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.340> do<00:03:04.490> is<00:03:04.940> I

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
start checking in but what I do is I

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.050 
start checking in but what I do is I
poke<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.950> when<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.610> speaker

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
poke it and when that I speaker

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.330 
poke it and when that I speaker
thermapen<00:03:08.780> whatever<00:03:09.140> goes<00:03:09.440> in<00:03:09.470> with

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
thermapen whatever goes in with

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.250 
thermapen whatever goes in with
absolutely<00:03:10.820> no<00:03:11.150> resistance<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:11.870> mean<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.230> just

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
absolutely no resistance I mean it just

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.800 
absolutely no resistance I mean it just
slides<00:03:12.739> in<00:03:13.070> like<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.610> hot<00:03:13.910> knife<00:03:13.940> through<00:03:14.450> cold

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
slides in like a hot knife through cold

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.680 
slides in like a hot knife through cold
butter<00:03:15.340> that's<00:03:16.340> when<00:03:16.640> your<00:03:16.820> tender<00:03:17.239> that's

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
butter that's when your tender that's

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.030 
butter that's when your tender that's
when<00:03:17.959> you<00:03:18.080> want<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.350> take<00:03:18.530> your<00:03:18.709> me<00:03:18.860> now<00:03:18.980> to

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
when you want to take your me now to

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.440 
when you want to take your me now to
smoke<00:03:19.340> around<00:03:19.489> not<00:03:19.760> before<00:03:21.940> just<00:03:22.940> poke<00:03:23.120> it

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
smoke around not before just poke it

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.260 
smoke around not before just poke it
it's<00:03:23.780> all<00:03:24.050> by<00:03:24.290> feel<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.830> so<00:03:25.760> for<00:03:25.910> me<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.090> say

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
it's all by feel and so for me to say

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.890 
it's all by feel and so for me to say
it's<00:03:26.480> at<00:03:26.690> 195<00:03:27.410> or<00:03:27.890> after<00:03:28.190> four<00:03:28.430> hours<00:03:28.900> it's

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
it's at 195 or after four hours it's

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.949 
it's at 195 or after four hours it's
just<00:03:30.230> not<00:03:30.320> true<00:03:30.709> that<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.030> myth<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.540> has

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
just not true that is a myth that has

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.310 
just not true that is a myth that has
been<00:03:33.230> debunked<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:33.950> mean<00:03:34.160> just<00:03:35.090> it's<00:03:35.720> really<00:03:35.810> my

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
been debunked I mean just it's really my

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.920 
been debunked I mean just it's really my
field<00:03:36.650> just<00:03:36.860> poked<00:03:37.160> me<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.790> see<00:03:38.360> if<00:03:38.570> your

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
field just poked me and see if your

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.710 
field just poked me and see if your
probe<00:03:39.230> slides<00:03:39.680> empties<00:03:40.300> so<00:03:41.300> there<00:03:41.570> you<00:03:41.600> have

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
probe slides empties so there you have

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.070 
probe slides empties so there you have
it<00:03:42.250> feel<00:03:43.250> as<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:44.120> real<00:03:44.480> determinant

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
it feel as the the real determinant

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.010 
it feel as the the real determinant
factor<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.770> when<00:03:46.760> your<00:03:47.150> pork<00:03:47.450> butt<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:47.810> going

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
factor and when your pork butt is going

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.199 
factor and when your pork butt is going
