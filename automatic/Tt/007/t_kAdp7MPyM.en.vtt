you<00:00:43.239> know<00:00:43.360> it<00:00:43.629> was<00:00:43.720> a<00:00:43.750> little<00:00:43.840> bit<00:00:44.110> unrealistic

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
you know it was a little bit unrealistic

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.619 
you know it was a little bit unrealistic
at<00:00:44.860> times<00:00:45.100> with<00:00:45.340> me<00:00:45.489> fighting<00:00:45.879> Chara<00:00:46.180> at<00:00:46.449> one

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
at times with me fighting Chara at one

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.990 
at times with me fighting Chara at one
point<00:00:46.870> and<00:00:47.379> him<00:00:47.980> punching<00:00:48.580> me<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:48.760> me

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.580 
point and him punching me and me
actually<00:00:49.180> getting<00:00:49.570> up<00:00:49.840> I<00:00:50.020> don't<00:00:50.379> think<00:00:50.559> that

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
actually getting up I don't think that

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.069 
actually getting up I don't think that
was<00:00:50.829> very<00:00:50.860> realistic<00:00:51.579> but<00:00:51.790> other<00:00:52.300> than<00:00:52.570> that<00:00:52.629> I

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
was very realistic but other than that I

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.260 
was very realistic but other than that I

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.250 
skate and the way they hint the way they
shoot<00:00:57.340> it's<00:00:58.030> very<00:00:58.270> authentic<00:00:58.539> to<00:00:59.110> those

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
do you go with a strict like the roster

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.090 
do you go with a strict like the roster
as<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:12.340> is<00:01:12.490> in<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.820> NHL<00:01:13.149> right<00:01:13.330> now<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:14.619> pretty

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
as it is in the NHL right now I'm pretty

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.100 
as it is in the NHL right now I'm pretty
just<00:01:15.460> original<00:01:16.030> i<00:01:16.119> don't<00:01:16.509> think<00:01:16.690> i<00:01:16.780> would<00:01:16.840> put

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
just original i don't think i would put

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.639 
just original i don't think i would put
them<00:01:17.259> on<00:01:17.410> on<00:01:17.770> my<00:01:17.979> team<00:01:18.250> yet<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:18.550> I<00:01:18.729> think<00:01:19.090> that

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
them on on my team yet I I think that

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.820 
them on on my team yet I I think that
you<00:01:20.649> know<00:01:20.800> if<00:01:21.009> we<00:01:21.849> are<00:01:22.030> lucky<00:01:22.750> one<00:01:23.080> day<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:23.470> make

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
you know if we are lucky one day to make

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.740 
you know if we are lucky one day to make
like<00:01:24.099> an<00:01:24.280> all-star<00:01:24.700> team<00:01:24.940> or<00:01:25.209> something<00:01:25.539> and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
like an all-star team or something and

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.320 
like an all-star team or something and
that<00:01:25.899> would<00:01:26.050> be<00:01:26.140> pretty<00:01:26.319> cool<00:01:26.440> but<00:01:26.920> I<00:01:27.270> think<00:01:28.270> I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
that would be pretty cool but I think I

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.999 
that would be pretty cool but I think I
just<00:01:28.360> keep<00:01:28.690> it<00:01:28.810> pretty<00:01:28.990> original<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:29.800> just

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
just keep it pretty original and just

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.850 
just keep it pretty original and just
maybe<00:01:30.729> we'll<00:01:31.000> do<00:01:31.149> haves<00:01:31.869> versus<00:01:32.229> Bruins<00:01:32.649> then

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
maybe we'll do haves versus Bruins then

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.070 
maybe we'll do haves versus Bruins then
I'll<00:01:32.950> play<00:01:33.160> Malcolm<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.940> he'll<00:01:34.569> play<00:01:34.780> goalie

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080
