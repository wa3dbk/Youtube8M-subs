00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.410
 at 120 meters high the air of the 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.480
 Mexico City is still breathable to 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.429
 despite the dense layer of pollutants 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.740
 that comes to form in the mornings and 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.599
 the afternoons in the atmosphere is the view 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.210
 of the largest city in the world since 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.120
 a balloon but it's not a balloon 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.740
 it is not a red or blue balloon is the globe 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.830
 of the second section of the forest of 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.830
 chapultepec 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.930
 its dimensions are so big that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.810
 It has the width of a gray whale 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.090
 approximately 25 meters in diameter and 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.760
 It is filled with 6000 cubic meters of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.250
 helium gas what makes it rise is the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.780
 the world's largest balloon of its kind in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.820
 the designed layette 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.949
 octagonal and covered with a mesh for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.559
 greater security for travelers 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.480
 up to 30 people but everything depends on 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.630
 weight and the speed of the winds that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.180
 beech in the city 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.370
 ascending to 120 meters takes 3 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.590
 minutes although the balloon is designed 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.570
 to reach 200 meters the 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.540
 permission that the company has only 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.280
 allows that height during the climb on 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.530
 traveler can feel the pressure of the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.030
 height the climate change in the air and 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.640
 the different strength of the currents 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.710
 of the wind once above can be 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.900
 drop the protection bars located 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.940
 to the front to be able to contemplate one of 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.270
 the most impressive views of the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.270
 city 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840
 from there you see the official residence of 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.299
 the pines all the forest of chapultepec 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.789
 and the whole city as well as their 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.100
 impressive constructions the tower 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.259
 greater the world trade center bullfighting 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.760
 four roads the pemex tower and the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.040
 Latin American tower 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.530
 the wind hits the face and sometimes 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.510
 moves the balloon a few meters in spite of 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.520
 that has a steel cable that anchors it 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.740
 to the takeoff area because it's not a 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.120
 flight as such through the city the 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.490
 passenger safety is 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.170
 guaranteed a computer controls of 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.750
 automatically rise and fall 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.910
 measures the weight that the balloon loads and 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.830
 speed of the winds as a company 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.810
 that our balloon has helium the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.150
 quantity of what has charge of 16 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.330
 tons but nothing else the globe is 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.040
 when the weigh 4 tons cable 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.250
 medium has an approximate resistance 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.020
 of 40 tons we have several measures 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.120
 of safety if I do not get to light 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.710
 we won an emergency plant and 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.780
 our engine will fail we have 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.090
 a test assistant at hand 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.490
 releasing the helium we need a lot to 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.170
 reach 120 meters buoy can be 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.650
 let go of the internal handrail so that 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.989
 they can flip 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.790
 Four minutes dishes to contemplate the 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.129
 immensity of the city initiates the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.409
 Descent is slow and almost imperceptible 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.959
 what minutes before it looked smaller 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.269
 begins to charge its real dimensions 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.640
 the lake the games of the park and the fair 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.460
 of Chapultepec as well as the people who 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.530
 They hope to get on the next flight 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.510

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.990
 three minutes you're back on the ground 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.060
 firm soft landing 16 resistant 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.250
 plastic rubbers located on the floor of 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.430
 the basket cushions the arrival at 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.430
 floor 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.400
 Monday to Sunday for this balloon 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.690
 nine in the morning to six in the evening or 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.360
 until the intensity of the winds 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:17.030
 allow it the price of admission is 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.030
