folks jay-z and Ava's fort here today in

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.039 
folks jay-z and Ava's fort here today in
a<00:00:03.010> 2013<00:00:03.790> explorer<00:00:04.240> to<00:00:04.359> demonstrate<00:00:04.899> the

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:05.049 
a 2013 explorer to demonstrate the

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.929 
a 2013 explorer to demonstrate the
lane-keeping<00:00:05.410> system<00:00:06.009> so<00:00:06.609> you<00:00:06.759> have<00:00:06.910> a

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
lane-keeping system so you have a

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.259 
lane-keeping system so you have a
forward<00:00:07.930> facing<00:00:08.140> camera<00:00:08.620> that<00:00:09.429> reads<00:00:09.790> the

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:10.269 
forward facing camera that reads the

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.940 
forward facing camera that reads the
lines<00:00:10.480> on<00:00:10.750> the<00:00:10.870> road<00:00:11.080> so<00:00:11.349> that<00:00:11.379> if<00:00:11.530> you<00:00:11.620> drift

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
lines on the road so that if you drift

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.009 
lines on the road so that if you drift
you<00:00:12.219> get<00:00:12.400> an<00:00:12.519> alert<00:00:12.759> or<00:00:13.000> even<00:00:13.240> aid<00:00:13.480> to<00:00:13.750> steer

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
you get an alert or even aid to steer

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.980 
you get an alert or even aid to steer
back<00:00:14.259> in<00:00:14.559> so<00:00:15.280> this<00:00:15.459> system<00:00:15.879> is<00:00:16.150> defaulted<00:00:16.840> off

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
back in so this system is defaulted off

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.840 
back in so this system is defaulted off
when<00:00:17.199> the<00:00:17.289> car<00:00:17.470> started<00:00:17.949> it's<00:00:18.100> turned<00:00:18.369> on<00:00:18.580> by

you<00:00:46.690> can<00:00:46.870> change<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.260> sensitivity<00:00:47.789> mean<00:00:48.789> how

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
you can change the sensitivity mean how

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.389 
you can change the sensitivity mean how
quickly<00:00:49.570> hit<00:00:49.899> intervenes<00:00:50.350> whether<00:00:51.190> you

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
quickly hit intervenes whether you

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.709 
quickly hit intervenes whether you
actually<00:00:51.489> have<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.820> pick<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.149> line<00:00:52.329> or<00:00:52.510> just

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
actually have to pick the line or just

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.660 
actually have to pick the line or just
get<00:00:52.870> close<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:53.469> you<00:00:53.920> can<00:00:53.949> also<00:00:54.190> change<00:00:54.520> the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
get close and you can also change the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.000 
get close and you can also change the
intensity<00:00:55.210> of<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.649> vibration<00:00:56.649> in<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.770> wheel

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
intensity of the vibration in the wheel

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.889 
intensity of the vibration in the wheel
I'm<00:00:57.430> going<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.699> go<00:00:57.789> with<00:00:57.910> normal<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:58.750> now<00:00:58.870> that

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
I'm going to go with normal so now that

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.689 
I'm going to go with normal so now that
were<00:00:59.079> turned<00:00:59.320> on<00:00:59.469> we're<00:01:00.280> going<00:01:00.399> to<00:01:00.519> go<00:01:00.579> ahead

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
were turned on we're going to go ahead

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.939 
were turned on we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:00.850> pull<00:01:01.120> out<00:01:01.149> on<00:01:01.480> Telegraph<00:01:02.079> if<00:01:02.440> traffic

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
and pull out on Telegraph if traffic

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.030 
and pull out on Telegraph if traffic
will<00:01:03.070> allow<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:04.230> so<00:01:05.230> we<00:01:05.350> can<00:01:05.470> see<00:01:05.710> what<00:01:05.920> the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
will allow it so we can see what the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.380 
will allow it so we can see what the
guidelines<00:01:06.220> are<00:01:06.550> going<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:06.730> do<00:01:06.820> because<00:01:07.000> once

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
guidelines are going to do because once

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.240 
guidelines are going to do because once
we're<00:01:07.600> moving<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.260> we're<00:01:08.410> inside<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.890> lines

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
we're moving and we're inside the lines

to show green and as soon as I start to
drift<00:01:14.170> off<00:01:14.350> center<00:01:14.830> they're<00:01:15.010> going<00:01:15.160> to<00:01:15.220> go

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
drift off center they're going to go

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.090 
drift off center they're going to go
back<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:15.580> gray<00:01:15.940> once<00:01:16.660> I<00:01:16.810> hit<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.200> line<00:01:17.500> they're

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
back to gray once I hit a line they're

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.320 
back to gray once I hit a line they're
going<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.250> turn<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.610> read<00:01:18.850> it's<00:01:19.120> going<00:01:19.270> to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
going to turn to read it's going to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.000 
going to turn to read it's going to
vibrate<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.870> wheel<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:20.380> in<00:01:20.470> this<00:01:20.590> case<00:01:20.800> it's

vibrate the wheel and in this case it's

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.440 
vibrate the wheel and in this case it's
actually<00:01:21.280> going<00:01:21.370> to<00:01:21.460> bring<00:01:21.640> the<00:01:21.760> car<00:01:21.970> back<00:01:22.000> to
