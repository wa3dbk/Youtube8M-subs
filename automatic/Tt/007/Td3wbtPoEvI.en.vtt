here but it's one of the different
currents<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.560> I've<00:01:55.770> got<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.840> peat<00:01:57.840> moss

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
currents and I've got that peat moss

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.109 
currents and I've got that peat moss
down<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> bottoms<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.549> make<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> look<00:01:59.939> like

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
down at the bottoms to make it look like

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.679 
down at the bottoms to make it look like
the<00:02:00.240> branches<00:02:00.659> are<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.590> growing

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
the branches are actually like growing

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.180 
the branches are actually like growing
and<00:02:03.890> I've<00:02:04.890> got<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.310> mega<00:02:06.049> plant<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:08.069> that's

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and I've got this mega plant and that's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.650 
and I've got this mega plant and that's
an<00:02:08.399> exoteric<00:02:08.729> -<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:09.899> those<00:02:11.390> poison<00:02:12.390> dart

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
an exoteric - it's for those poison dart

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.340 
an exoteric - it's for those poison dart
frog

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
frog

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.870 
frog
so<00:02:13.410> they<00:02:13.530> can<00:02:13.680> lay<00:02:13.800> their<00:02:14.010> eggs<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.460> bottom

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
so they can lay their eggs in the bottom

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.590 
so they can lay their eggs in the bottom
of<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:17.610> know<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:18.090> thought<00:02:18.330> that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
of it but you know I just thought that

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.090 
of it but you know I just thought that
it<00:02:18.810> looked<00:02:18.840> really<00:02:19.260> good<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.040> just

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
it looked really good in here so I just

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.270 
it looked really good in here so I just
leave<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:20.700> here<00:02:21.320> but<00:02:22.320> all<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.710> branches

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
leave it in here but all the branches

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.160 
leave it in here but all the branches
are<00:02:24.140> they're<00:02:25.140> all<00:02:25.670> clean<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.700> good<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.540> I've

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
are they're all clean and good and I've

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.410 
are they're all clean and good and I've
washed<00:02:28.740> them<00:02:28.980> all<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.400> time<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:30.090> they<00:02:30.210> never

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
washed them all the time so they never

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.670 
washed them all the time so they never
covered<00:02:31.230> them<00:02:31.550> through<00:02:32.550> Uptown<00:02:33.030> matter<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:34.200> I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
covered them through Uptown matter and I

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.760 
covered them through Uptown matter and I
just<00:02:34.950> bought<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.520> background<00:02:36.200> today<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.650> just

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
just bought that background today I just

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:48.700 
just bought that background today I just
ordered<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:44.870> Vinson<00:02:46.160> 36<00:02:47.160> by<00:02:47.370> 24<00:02:48.180> and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
ordered it and it's Vinson 36 by 24 and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.420 
ordered it and it's Vinson 36 by 24 and
I<00:02:49.710> cut<00:02:50.580> an<00:02:50.790> inch<00:02:51.450> off<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.130> gives

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
I cut an inch off of it so that gives

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.050 
I cut an inch off of it so that gives
you<00:02:53.670> an<00:02:53.970> idea<00:02:54.210> for<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.020> size<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.670> mean<00:02:56.850> it's

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
you an idea for the size but I mean it's

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.730 
you an idea for the size but I mean it's
a<00:02:57.150> relatively<00:02:57.900> big<00:02:58.230> tank

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
a relatively big tank

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.700 
a relatively big tank
this<00:02:59.220> shouldn't<00:02:59.610> house<00:02:59.970> him<00:03:00.330> for<00:03:00.630> his<00:03:01.500> entire

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
this shouldn't house him for his entire

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.970 
this shouldn't house him for his entire
life<00:03:02.750> because<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.900> mean<00:03:04.050> I'm<00:03:04.290> not<00:03:04.530> gonna<00:03:04.680> breed

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
life because I mean I'm not gonna breed

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.070 
life because I mean I'm not gonna breed
him<00:03:05.280> or<00:03:05.460> anything<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:06.090> have<00:03:06.240> no<00:03:06.450> interest<00:03:06.840> in

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
him or anything I have no interest in

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.880 
him or anything I have no interest in
him<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.470> actually<00:03:08.000> just<00:03:09.000> like<00:03:09.780> him<00:03:10.170> for<00:03:10.560> him<00:03:10.710> I

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
him I actually just like him for him I

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.580 
him I actually just like him for him I
don't<00:03:11.090> need<00:03:12.090> any<00:03:12.330> money<00:03:12.690> out<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.990> him<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:13.380> think

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
don't need any money out of him I think

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.430 
don't need any money out of him I think
he's<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.830> great<00:03:14.670> pet<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.930> don't<00:03:16.230> see<00:03:16.350> the

my favorite so far

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.290 
my favorite so far
jungle<00:03:55.680> bedding<00:03:56.100> that<00:03:56.130> I've<00:03:56.400> seen<00:03:56.670> all<00:03:57.090> the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
jungle bedding that I've seen all the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.070 
jungle bedding that I've seen all the
other<00:03:57.450> stuff<00:03:57.960> just<00:03:57.990> looks<00:03:58.320> like<00:04:00.080> cypress

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
other stuff just looks like cypress

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.830 
other stuff just looks like cypress
mulch<00:04:01.350> like<00:04:01.830> that<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.550> you'd<00:04:02.730> get<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.660> like

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
mulch like that that you'd get it like

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.290 
mulch like that that you'd get it like
Menards<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.740> I<00:04:05.190> don't<00:04:05.370> like<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.820> look<00:04:06.090> I

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
Menards and I don't like that look I

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.940 
Menards and I don't like that look I
like<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.870> for<00:04:07.490> these<00:04:08.490> abort<00:04:09.060> aims<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:10.920> I

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
like this for these abort aims and so I

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.030 
like this for these abort aims and so I
try<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.280> use<00:04:11.520> that<00:04:11.730> mostly<00:04:12.120> but<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.140> mean<00:04:13.890> I've

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
try to use that mostly but I mean I've

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.980 
try to use that mostly but I mean I've
only<00:04:14.220> got<00:04:14.460> like<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.730> little<00:04:14.880> bit<00:04:15.150> laughs<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.810> so

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
only got like a little bit laughs and so

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.030 
only got like a little bit laughs and so
I<00:04:16.320> don't<00:04:16.950> know<00:04:17.070> what<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.280> want<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.609> with<00:04:17.790> it

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
I don't know what I want to do with it

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.630 
I don't know what I want to do with it
but<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.600> think<00:04:21.600> it's<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:22.049> pretty<00:04:22.650> good<00:04:22.770> tank<00:04:23.250> so

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
but I think it's a pretty good tank so

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.910 
but I think it's a pretty good tank so
maybe<00:04:24.210> next<00:04:24.479> time<00:04:24.810> I<00:04:24.960> clean<00:04:25.200> it

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
maybe next time I clean it

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.330 
maybe next time I clean it
I'll<00:04:25.980> do<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.280> video<00:04:26.550> on<00:04:26.940> how<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.710> on<00:04:28.710> how<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:28.980> set

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
I'll do a video on how to on how I set

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
tank and no underneath this big thing

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.620 
tank and no underneath this big thing
right<00:05:09.840> here<00:05:10.140> it's<00:05:10.530> on<00:05:10.710> table<00:05:11.340> it's<00:05:11.600> actually<00:05:12.600> a

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
right here it's on table it's actually a

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.520 
right here it's on table it's actually a
cage<00:05:13.160> so<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:15.060> heat<00:05:15.330> lamps<00:05:15.720> are<00:05:15.930> on<00:05:16.020> this<00:05:16.230> side

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
cage so the heat lamps are on this side

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.120 
cage so the heat lamps are on this side
so<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.220> bottom<00:05:17.670> is<00:05:17.850> heated<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:19.110> so<00:05:19.440> it's<00:05:19.590> like

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
so the bottom is heated and so it's like

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.510 
so the bottom is heated and so it's like
having<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.640> heat<00:05:21.000> map<00:05:21.210> they're<00:05:21.920> 250<00:05:22.920> watt<00:05:23.070> bulbs

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
having a heat map they're 250 watt bulbs

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.100 
having a heat map they're 250 watt bulbs
underneath<00:05:23.910> there<00:05:24.150> so<00:05:24.480> that's<00:05:24.630> keeping<00:05:25.020> the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
underneath there so that's keeping the

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.700 
underneath there so that's keeping the
bottom<00:05:25.500> warm<00:05:25.710> and<00:05:26.520> so<00:05:27.030> it's<00:05:27.720> warm<00:05:28.080> throughout

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
bottom warm and so it's warm throughout

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.750 
bottom warm and so it's warm throughout
the<00:05:28.800> whole<00:05:29.190> tank

how<00:07:00.910> slow<00:07:01.300> he's<00:07:01.509> going<00:07:01.900> for<00:07:02.110> uh<00:07:03.960> how<00:07:04.960> long<00:07:05.229> I've

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
how slow he's going for uh how long I've

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.100 
how slow he's going for uh how long I've
had<00:07:05.680> him<00:07:05.910> but<00:07:06.910> I<00:07:06.940> mean<00:07:07.150> I<00:07:07.330> give<00:07:07.509> him<00:07:07.630> probably

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
had him but I mean I give him probably

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.740 
had him but I mean I give him probably
like<00:07:08.470> four<00:07:09.160> dozen<00:07:09.520> crickets<00:07:09.910> a<00:07:10.000> week<00:07:10.180> and<00:07:10.539> I
