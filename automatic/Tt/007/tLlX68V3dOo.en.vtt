00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.850 
know that in the winter water coming
into<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.030> house<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> lot<00:01:48.840> colder<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.680> with

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
into the house is a lot colder and with

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.219 
into the house is a lot colder and with
a<00:01:49.890> combination<00:01:50.340> boiler<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.360> means<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
a combination boiler this means that the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.710 
a combination boiler this means that the
boiler<00:01:52.590> has<00:01:52.770> more<00:01:53.070> work<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.420> order

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
boiler has more work to do and in order

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
boiler has more work to do and in order
to<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.619> slows<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.369> flow<00:01:56.579> rate<00:01:56.850> down

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
to do that it slows the flow rate down

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.510 
to do that it slows the flow rate down
so<00:01:57.630> people<00:01:58.020> often<00:01:58.170> say<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> winter

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
so people often say that in the winter

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.190 
so people often say that in the winter
they<00:01:59.640> get<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> slower<00:02:00.149> flow<00:02:00.360> rate<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
they get a slower flow rate but in the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.649 
they get a slower flow rate but in the
summer<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.770> fine<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> thermal

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
summer it's fine so what the thermal

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.929 
summer it's fine so what the thermal
store<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.110> doing<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.560> preheating<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.670> water

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
store is doing is preheating that water

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.749 
store is doing is preheating that water
as<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.659> goes<00:02:06.689> into<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.680> boiler<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.489> effect

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
as it goes into the boiler and in effect

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.600 
as it goes into the boiler and in effect
is<00:02:09.030> making<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.569> summer<00:02:09.929> all<00:02:10.319> year<00:02:10.379> round<00:02:10.830> what

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
is making it summer all year round what

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.830 
is making it summer all year round what
a<00:02:11.670> good<00:02:11.849> idea

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
a good idea

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.330 
a good idea
if<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.230> want<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.500> get<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.620> clearer<00:02:13.980> idea<00:02:14.099> of

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
if you want to get a clearer idea of

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.160 
if you want to get a clearer idea of
exactly<00:02:14.819> how<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.390> done<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:15.989> watch

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
exactly how this is done you can watch

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.949 
exactly how this is done you can watch
the<00:02:16.380> Installer<00:02:16.860> section<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.489> this<00:02:17.580> DVD<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.900> if

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
the Installer section of this DVD but if

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.360 
the Installer section of this DVD but if
all<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.260> want<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.680> make<00:02:19.920> sure<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.130> your

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
all you want is to make sure that your

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.120 
all you want is to make sure that your
boiler<00:02:20.670> install<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.330> choosing<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.810> most

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
boiler install is choosing the most

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.620 
boiler install is choosing the most
energy-efficient<00:02:23.130> solution<00:02:23.640> for<00:02:23.849> your<00:02:23.940> needs

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
energy-efficient solution for your needs

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.900 
energy-efficient solution for your needs
then<00:02:24.930> hopefully<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.800> DVD<00:02:26.489> would<00:02:26.760> have

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
then hopefully this DVD would have

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
reassured you whatever happens to fuel

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.990 
reassured you whatever happens to fuel
prices<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.870> future<00:02:31.550> without<00:02:32.550> for<00:02:32.760> flow

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
prices in the future without for flow

prices in the future without for flow
smart<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.720> can<00:02:33.900> be<00:02:33.930> sure<00:02:34.349> that<00:02:34.680> your<00:02:35.130> system

smart you can be sure that your system
is<00:02:35.880> giving<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.840> best<00:02:37.140> possible<00:02:37.769> return
