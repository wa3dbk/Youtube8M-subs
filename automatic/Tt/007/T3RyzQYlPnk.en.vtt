00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.680
 it only concerns us not all 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.920
 only concerns farmers 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.900
 scientists experts the most resource 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.550
 most important and most important extraordinary 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.550
 that we have is under our feet 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.630
 his 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.610
 the living body an extraordinary body 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.590
 I live that supplies to us 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.870
 lots of benefits every night when 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.430
 let's have dinner on our plate 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.610
 what I had in the fridge comes from 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.550
 soil 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.420
 gives us the food provides us with clean water 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.320
 It is the largest of the deposit 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.790
 carbon 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.440
 30 percent of the biodiversity of 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.110
 this planet is under our feet 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.490
 at the moment when the soil comes 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.850
 cemented is altered comes 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.600
 all this is polluted 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.690
 for us 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.030
 disappears in an instant 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.520
 the soil does not regenerate the soil is one 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:15.000
 simply non-renewable resource 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.000
 to redo 25 cm it takes 500 years 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.250
 his is the most important resource that 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.900
 we have 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.050
 paradoxically, even the least 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.820
 protected in Italy every second 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.060
 passes 8 square meters come 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 concreted 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.860
 what is underneath is the title of this 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.110
 book in the book you also try a 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.720
 unveiling process in the sense of 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.850
 explain what's under the continuous 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.170
 soil consumption two chapters are 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.150
 dedicated to the soil 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.380
 what is the soil is the first chapter 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.030
 second chapter 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.610
 what can happen if you only come 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.780
 consummate the other two chapters 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.490
 tell why it continues to 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.380
 to consume soil in this country 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.630
 the last chapter instead a chapter that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.580
 puts the eye out like out 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.650
 in addition to seeing in other European countries 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.479
 and we discover that they are very worn 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.640
 ahead they have already reacted to the consumption of 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.929
 soil 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.819
 the soil and probably few 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.950
 defend soils for that few 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.280
 they know the beauty of his 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.830
 the idea is we learn to understand that soils 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.270
 they are beautiful and this will help us to 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.270
 defend them better 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.040
 with this book we want to try 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.270
 restart our ability to 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.860
 recover and take care of the sound 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.800
 because if we recover in care of 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.920
 we are surely men 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.920
 best
