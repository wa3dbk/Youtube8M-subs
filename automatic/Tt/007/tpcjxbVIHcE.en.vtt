00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.880
 ah 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.829
 hello very good everyone i'm r like 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.239
 Cement Guides Battlefield 3 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.949
 this time analyzing a little rifle 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.449
 known but that thanks to its potential 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.100
 in this game his way gone growing 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.890
 little by little we go with the aek and 971 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.079
 the aek to 971 is a possible Russian assault 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.539
 designed to the 80's account 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.239
 with a chalice of 545 millimeters and a 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.710
 30 bullet magazine but no doubt what 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.930
 most amazing about this weapon is how well 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.370
 optimized that is the cadence since a 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.120
 despite having a cadence of 900 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.920
 shots per minute 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.710
 retains accuracy in a way 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.360
 excellent the weight of this 33 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.239
 kilograms and we can use all three 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.520
 shooting modes available good now 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.309
 we go with the guide in more than fitex 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.680
 971 we will have it once we get 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.300
 60,000 points on the jump ridge more 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.430
 well in half so we will not have to 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.110
 playing a lot to unlock it is a 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.090
 rifle that looks pretty pretty 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.590
 something more than a very high science and a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.480
 accuracy that is not proportional to your 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.280
 cadence giving it an excellent improvement 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.410
 we will have to focus more on the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.960
 short range just like what happened with the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.330
 f2008 more since the slow cadence we 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.580
 We help well in these environments will 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.520
 see the studs 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.830
 in the damage in the decade has 18 cases 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.890
 25% damage to about 8 meters and going down 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.320
 progressively they are 18 4% about 50 meters 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.270
 in the good precision if we have in 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.980
 account the great lack is quite 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.000
 good but strong pullback to the 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.980
 left can be something 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.900
 uncomfortable in short distances do not we 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.920
 will bother at all but in long no 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.530
 it is advisable to shoot 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.180
 automatic so in my opinion it 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.820
 it takes a 7 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.170
 in cancer good up to about 60 meters 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.640
 does not lower the damage to the extreme anymore 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.770
 low but hit in long distances 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.510
 it's quite complicated along with the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.520
 grace of 580 meters parapet 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.290
 second somewhat lower than the average of 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.660
 rest of possible jump that now by 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.110
 just over 600 meters per second is 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.820
 A) Yes 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.380
 remember that it is an assault rifle if 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.060
 we are precise and we shoot in bursts 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.160
 we should not have it more serious 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.430
 so that's why I think he deserves a 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.410
 closing and finally in cadence with 900 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.540
 shots per minute deserves a 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.920
 perfect 10 we went to the best 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.920
 combination of accessories turn it off 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.420
 as the first accessory the iron mine 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.680
 it can work well 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.720
 jackson position entered the combat 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.670
 close instead if we have all three 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.990
 because a low magnification view does not 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.720
 it will be quite the organization of 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.280
 objectives the look freezes 3,4 also 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.010
 They can work well when we 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.110
 we focus on long distances 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.909
 the second accessory no doubt the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.069
 grip clearer why not read 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.019
 you with the hilt we will reduce 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.640
 the horizontal recoil so that 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.829
 we will reduce the annoying detour to 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.510
 the left that I had besides there's 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.860
 another accessory better since the kind of 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.260
 It is recommended for rifles 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.390
 precision light machine guns 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.709
 and the third good accessory the 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.569
 silencer can work very well in 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.430
 the close combat is to reduce our 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.870
 damage and scope although it will also increase 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.030
 our precision and we will come out in the 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.620
 mini enemy map but if we are going to play 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.629
 in more open environments or we use a 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.310
 assault rifle for its versatility the 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.019
 heavy cannon can work pretty 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.019
 better by helping us a lot with long 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.610
 distances that is where we suffered 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.940
 our muffler selection or there's 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.940
 a heavy 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.560
 The recommended specification is 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.540
 ammunition so that the bullets do not end 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.500
 so fast with the aek we will empty the 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.500
 loaders in a sigh 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.660
 we're finishing so we're going with 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.760
 the conclusion 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.920
 in effectiveness the aek has a 9 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.480
 works very well with assault rifle 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.370
 if we are skilled we will manage to dominate 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.900
 also the long distances of form 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.200
 that will be destroyer in the vicinity and 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.660
 useful remoteness 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.280
 in versatility 18 since it serves a little 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.170
 of everything but more than anything in distances 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.580
 close as I said before if 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.960
 we manage to master it we will manage 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.660
 for the map really well 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.460
 in adaptation has a 7 is easy to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.840
 use when we move to commuter but 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.970
 once we get away it will be complicated 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.590
 learning to master it would be something similar 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.940
 to tame a wild animal 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.980
 we have to try to dominate the beast 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.870
 although it is complicated 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.930
 the effort will be worth it 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.930
 I assure 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.410
 in design to be a possible use what 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.960
 recalls the classic model of the 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.530
 Ak-47 is not innovative but its beauty 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.780
 resides in its simplicity so 18 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.520
 and finally in popularity has a 7 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.139
 since his great cadence encourages him to use it 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.030
 for people who do not have the 2000 f 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.410
 or fame and this becomes a 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.240
 true substitute conditions 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.110
 they can overcome these two 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.750
 mentioned 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.850
 good the middle note is a 9 really 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.550
 you can crush your enemies with 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.200
 this piece piece voted for next 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.720
 guide you will have before the channel 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.720
 rk begins a greeting and until next time
