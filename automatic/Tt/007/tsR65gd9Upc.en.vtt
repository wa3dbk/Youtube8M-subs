00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:02.630
 I'm glad that 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.630
 so that no text has proved useful but our problem 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.550

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.029
 Yen found the kids 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.029
 seems to have been played as if they have fallen into the river 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.650

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.930
 even if the roof 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.930

 and where are you from 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.290

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.290
 Rusty the Hour 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.780
 Klaus still speechless 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.940
 we know the most unusual 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 what's going on 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.740
 I'm not sure what to say 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.620
 Just stay calm and think like that 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.979
 I have good ones 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.339

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.339

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.819

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.609

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.609

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.689
 and ever and the bad news 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.819

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.819
 Found a tooth 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.099
 hiding in the bloody guest of a woman 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.699
 to stay calm 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.729
 I think the only reason why Klaus Nieke forget about life 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:11.729
 at Idaho Illinois tilted to protect her 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.709

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.650

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.740
 the investigators come 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.740
 Katharina Otte can support 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.370

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.319
 so hamlet villagers attacked 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.719
 brought the jail 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.719

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.120

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.249
 the dentist stuck it out of his chest 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:25.529

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.610

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.349
