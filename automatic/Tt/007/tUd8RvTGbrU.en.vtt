in<00:00:05.140> this<00:00:05.380> tutorial<00:00:05.560> we'll<00:00:06.280> take<00:00:06.550> a<00:00:06.580> look<00:00:06.820> at

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:06.970 
in this tutorial we'll take a look at

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.840 
in this tutorial we'll take a look at
how<00:00:07.060> to<00:00:07.120> create<00:00:07.330> mixes<00:00:07.930> on<00:00:08.080> the<00:00:08.170> editor<00:00:08.850> begin

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:09.850 
how to create mixes on the editor begin

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.730 
how to create mixes on the editor begin
by<00:00:10.030> selecting<00:00:10.270> what<00:00:10.750> tracks<00:00:11.050> to<00:00:11.290> start<00:00:11.559> mixing

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
by selecting what tracks to start mixing

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.280 
by selecting what tracks to start mixing
and<00:00:12.160> then<00:00:12.730> simply<00:00:13.180> drag<00:00:13.480> and<00:00:13.690> drop<00:00:13.750> into<00:00:14.200> the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
and then simply drag and drop into the

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.950 
and then simply drag and drop into the
mixed<00:00:14.620> list<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:16.120> now<00:00:16.330> see<00:00:16.570> the<00:00:16.600> tracks

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
mixed list you now see the tracks

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.470 
mixed list you now see the tracks
visualized<00:00:17.620> as<00:00:17.890> detailed<00:00:18.430> waveforms<00:00:19.090> up<00:00:19.270> here

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
visualized as detailed waveforms up here

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.470 
visualized as detailed waveforms up here
you<00:00:20.470> can<00:00:20.650> also<00:00:20.800> drag<00:00:21.280> and<00:00:21.520> drop<00:00:21.700> straight<00:00:22.090> into

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
you can also drag and drop straight into

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.560 
you can also drag and drop straight into
the<00:00:22.600> waveform<00:00:22.840> view<00:00:23.410> area<00:00:23.710> like<00:00:23.920> this<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
the waveform view area like this to

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.270 
the waveform view area like this to
change<00:00:28.870> the<00:00:29.080> order<00:00:29.350> of<00:00:29.470> the<00:00:29.560> tracks<00:00:29.800> within

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.280 
change the order of the tracks within

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.700 
change the order of the tracks within
the<00:00:30.400> mix<00:00:30.640> either<00:00:31.330> drag<00:00:31.810> and<00:00:31.840> drop<00:00:32.230> in<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.500> list

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
the mix either drag and drop in the list

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.580 
the mix either drag and drop in the list
area<00:00:33.100> or<00:00:33.280> in<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.489> waveform<00:00:33.730> view<00:00:34.390> area

in this case we're lowering the BPM to
127<00:01:24.550> to<00:01:24.850> match<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.240> other<00:01:25.330> track<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:29.710> a
