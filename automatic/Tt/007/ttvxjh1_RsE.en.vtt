the<00:00:43.379> least<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.460> Pierce's<00:00:45.000> server

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
the least so this is Pierce's server

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.569 
the least so this is Pierce's server
which<00:00:45.600> he<00:00:46.500> has<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> lot<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> stuff<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> I

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
which he has a lot of stuff in it I

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.490 
which he has a lot of stuff in it I
always<00:00:47.820> delete<00:00:48.180> peers<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.510> well<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:49.110> today<00:00:49.350> he

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
always delete peers as well but today he

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
always delete peers as well but today he
spent<00:00:49.739> about<00:00:49.890> eight<00:00:50.190> hours<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.700> won't<00:00:51.120> do
