00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.650
 hello dear as the 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.080
 National holidays I'll teach you how to do 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.080
 these colorful non-alcoholic drinks 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.869
 one night before we need to do the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.810
 skies for this we put water in two 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.240
 containers about two cups in 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.610
 each one 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.640
 we still do not put powders to do 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.579
 red water can be strawberry or jamaica 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.010
 cherry and you cherry 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.859
 and the other we put powder to do 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.859
 water green lemon or green apple 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.340
 we empty it into a container to make 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.340
 ice 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.570
 and in the center we left some with water 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.670
 simple 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.610
 you can put a little dye on it if 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.950
 you want a more intense shade of green 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.570
 as I did not have I put a dash of 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.080
 lemon jelly to each square 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.979
 We put them to freeze from 4 to 6 hours or 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.979
 all night 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.000
 for the first drink we will use a glass 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.000
 high 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.620
 the colored ice cubes and a 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.170
 gingerbread soda 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.090
 in containers we put the ice according to 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.780
 its color 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.600
 and also the simple water ice 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.530
 in the glass we put ice down 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.119
 green 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.119
 2 simple water 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.920
 and one red 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:57.600
 then we put the soda carefully 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.600
 little by little so that it does not spread 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.520
 and that's how easy we have a drink 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.640
 delicious and with the colors of the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.640
 flag 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.720
 for the next drink we will use a 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.330
 Shortest glass homemade lemonade or 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:24.590
 grenadine syrup packet 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.620
 mineral water and in the greens 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.599
 in the glass we pour half of lemonade 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.599
 and half of mineral water 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:39.500
 we put a trickle of grenadine 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.500
 and two or three skies of lemon 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.500
