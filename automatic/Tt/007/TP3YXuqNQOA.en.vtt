in the back to strat pickups right here

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.269 
in the back to strat pickups right here
got<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> 5-way<00:00:23.789> switch<00:00:24.320> volume<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.740> tone<00:00:25.980> and

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279

the<00:00:27.150> cool<00:00:27.420> local<00:00:28.380> contour<00:00:29.039> control<00:00:29.580> right

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the cool local contour control right

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.240 
the cool local contour control right
here<00:00:30.269> which<00:00:30.840> basically<00:00:31.199> dials<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.859> some<00:00:32.070> lower

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
here which basically dials in some lower

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.430 
here which basically dials in some lower
mids<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.759> makes<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.120> little<00:00:33.270> chunkier<00:00:33.780> so

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
let's give it a listen I take the low

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.650 
let's give it a listen I take the low
contour<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.370> control<00:00:41.730> all<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> way<00:00:42.210> out<00:00:42.390> right

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
contour of control all the way out right

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.410 
contour of control all the way out right
now<00:00:46.190> playing<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> clean<00:00:47.520> sound<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.030> little<00:00:48.270> bit

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
you can hear that low contour really

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:44.490 
you can hear that low contour really
adds<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.940> lot

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
Smart's got a lot of tones in it I

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.650 
Smart's got a lot of tones in it I
really<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.520> back<00:04:13.730> pickup<00:04:14.150> with<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.480> low

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
really like the back pickup with the low

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:29.800 
really like the back pickup with the low
contour<00:04:15.170> up

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
between the pickup's and the low contour

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.430 
between the pickup's and the low contour
there's<00:06:00.990> at<00:06:01.140> least<00:06:01.170> 10<00:06:01.980> cool<00:06:02.460> sounds<00:06:03.090> in<00:06:03.210> there
