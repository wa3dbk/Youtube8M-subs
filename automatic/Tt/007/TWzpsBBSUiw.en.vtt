face and the Joel muscles etc so the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.939 
face and the Joel muscles etc so the
external<00:00:20.760> carotid<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:22.740> greater

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
external carotid and of greater

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.250 
external carotid and of greater
importance<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.519> us<00:00:23.640> here<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.420> internal

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
importance to us here the internal

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.170 
importance to us here the internal
carotid<00:00:25.470> which<00:00:26.189> will<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.490> go<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> brain

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
carotid which will then go to the brain

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.630 
carotid which will then go to the brain
so<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> common<00:00:28.050> carotid<00:00:28.349> will<00:00:29.039> split<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.490> make

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
so the common carotid will split to make

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.970 
so the common carotid will split to make
an<00:00:29.760> external<00:00:30.210> carotid<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> face<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
an external carotid to the face and the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.740 
an external carotid to the face and the
internal<00:00:32.520> carotid<00:00:32.730> which<00:00:33.120> will<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:33.450> pass

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
internal carotid which will then pass

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.799 
internal carotid which will then pass
through<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.550> carotid<00:00:35.820> canal<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.630> the

were studied the way of identifying a
cervical<00:01:00.899> vertebra<00:01:01.230> was<00:01:01.410> noted<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.760> hole

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
cervical vertebra was noted as the hole

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.560 
cervical vertebra was noted as the hole
which<00:01:03.899> occurs<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.650> transverse<00:01:05.570> process

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
which occurs in the transverse process

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.020 
which occurs in the transverse process
of<00:01:06.780> these<00:01:07.049> neck<00:01:07.590> vertebrae<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.400> transverse

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
of these neck vertebrae the transverse

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.320 
of these neck vertebrae the transverse
foramen<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:10.260> reason<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> hole<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
foramen the reason for the hole in the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.789 
foramen the reason for the hole in the
transverse<00:01:12.720> process<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> reason<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.710> this

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
transverse process the reason for this

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 
transverse process the reason for this
transverse<00:01:14.280> foramen<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
transverse foramen is because there is a

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.980 
transverse foramen is because there is a
vertebral<00:01:16.710> artery<00:01:17.670> which<00:01:18.330> passes<00:01:18.960> through

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
vertebral artery which passes through

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.120 
vertebral artery which passes through
the<00:01:19.770> transverse<00:01:20.340> foramina<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.950> neck

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the transverse foramina of the neck

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.179 
the transverse foramina of the neck
vertebra<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.360> an<00:01:24.509> alternate<00:01:25.229> route<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.799> get

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
vertebra so an alternate route to get

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.620 
vertebra so an alternate route to get
blood<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> brain<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:28.020> from<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
blood to the brain is to go from the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.359 
blood to the brain is to go from the
subclavian<00:01:30.630> artery<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.040> its<00:01:32.189> first

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
subclavian artery to one of its first

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.700 
subclavian artery to one of its first
branches<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> vertebral<00:01:33.479> artery<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
branches the vertebral artery the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.819 
branches the vertebral artery the
vertebral<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.340> passes<00:01:35.909> through<00:01:36.829> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
vertebral then passes through the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.350 
vertebral then passes through the
transverse<00:01:38.430> foramina<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
transverse foramina of the of the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.440 
transverse foramina of the of the
cervical<00:01:42.890> vertebra<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.970> as<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> goes

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
cervical vertebra and then as it goes

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.910 
cervical vertebra and then as it goes
through<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.869> foramen<00:01:46.350> magnum<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:48.649> left<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
through the foramen magnum the left and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.230 
through the foramen magnum the left and
right<00:01:50.280> vertebral<00:01:51.270> arteries<00:01:52.200> fuse<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.880> become

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
right vertebral arteries fuse to become

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.679 
right vertebral arteries fuse to become
one<00:01:54.630> single<00:01:55.170> artery<00:01:55.560> known<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.149> basilar

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
one single artery known as the basilar

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.010 
one single artery known as the basilar
so<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.799> left<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.610> vertebral<00:02:00.509> arteries

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
so the left and right vertebral arteries

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.999 
so the left and right vertebral arteries
will<00:02:01.200> fuse<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:02.189> become<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.000> basilar<00:02:03.540> artery

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
will fuse to become the basilar artery

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.819 
will fuse to become the basilar artery

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
where there are alternate routes of

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.420 
where there are alternate routes of
blood<00:02:38.250> flow<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:39.300> a<00:02:39.630> body<00:02:40.260> part<00:02:40.680> which<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.310> an

one<00:02:48.240> of<00:02:48.510> these<00:02:49.350> vessels<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.820> we<00:02:51.570> see<00:02:51.810> an

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
one of these vessels and here we see an

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.210 
one of these vessels and here we see an
anastomosis<00:02:52.440> in<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.550> brain<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:55.220> vertebral

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
anastomosis in the brain the vertebral

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.480 
anastomosis in the brain the vertebral
arteries<00:02:56.790> form<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.770> basilar<00:02:58.770> artery<00:02:59.190> which

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
arteries form the basilar artery which

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.960 
arteries form the basilar artery which
is<00:02:59.670> here<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.980> internal<00:03:02.760> carotid

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
is here and the internal carotid

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.370 
is here and the internal carotid
arteries<00:03:03.870> enter<00:03:04.380> here<00:03:05.000> these<00:03:06.000> then<00:03:06.720> form<00:03:07.230> a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
arteries enter here these then form a

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.280 
arteries enter here these then form a
circle<00:03:08.250> known<00:03:08.850> as<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> cerebral<00:03:09.630> arterial

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
circle known as the cerebral arterial

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.380 
circle known as the cerebral arterial
circle<00:03:10.740> formerly<00:03:11.340> more<00:03:11.550> commonly<00:03:11.910> called<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
circle formerly more commonly called the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.580 
circle formerly more commonly called the
Circle<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.959> Willis

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
Circle of Willis

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.460 
Circle of Willis
so<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.610> cerebral<00:03:14.970> arterial<00:03:15.630> circle<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.200> an

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
so this cerebral arterial circle is an

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.090 
so this cerebral arterial circle is an
anastomosis<00:03:17.360> formed<00:03:18.360> when<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.260> internal

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
anastomosis formed when the internal

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.800 
anastomosis formed when the internal
carotid<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:22.140> basilar<00:03:22.970> artery<00:03:23.970> from<00:03:24.690> the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
carotid and the basilar artery from the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.670 
carotid and the basilar artery from the
vertebral<00:03:25.110> fuse<00:03:26.040> their<00:03:26.700> blood<00:03:27.360> supply<00:03:27.680> now

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
vertebral fuse their blood supply now

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.590 
vertebral fuse their blood supply now
there<00:03:29.070> are<00:03:29.190> connections<00:03:29.730> between<00:03:30.090> these

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
there are connections between these

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.229 
there are connections between these
called<00:03:31.050> communicating<00:03:31.800> arteries<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.850> there

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
called communicating arteries so there

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.210 
called communicating arteries so there
is<00:03:33.360> an<00:03:33.510> anterior<00:03:34.019> communicating<00:03:34.440> artery

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
is an anterior communicating artery

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.530 
is an anterior communicating artery
which<00:03:36.060> fuses<00:03:37.640> these<00:03:38.640> blood<00:03:38.940> vessels<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.420> two

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
which fuses these blood vessels the two

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.330 
which fuses these blood vessels the two
internal<00:03:39.840> carotid<00:03:40.260> here<00:03:40.470> on<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.709> anterior

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.370 
internal carotid here on the anterior
side<00:03:41.610> and<00:03:41.940> then<00:03:42.510> there<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> posterior

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
side and then there is a posterior

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.590 
side and then there is a posterior
communicating<00:03:43.769> artery<00:03:44.580> connecting<00:03:45.480> the

interior internal carotid to the basilar
here<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.049> here<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.190> circle<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.850> completed

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360
