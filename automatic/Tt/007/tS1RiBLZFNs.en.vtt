hollow bit right here is going to get

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.650 
hollow bit right here is going to get
scuffed<00:03:00.600> up<00:03:00.810> pretty<00:03:01.110> quickly<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:03.300> see<00:03:03.540> these

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
scuffed up pretty quickly you see these

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.330

these<00:03:06.660> are<00:03:06.720> all<00:03:07.250> micro<00:03:08.250> like<00:03:09.980> fractures<00:03:10.980> if<00:03:11.220> i

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
these are all micro like fractures if i

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.090 
these are all micro like fractures if i
can<00:03:11.550> call<00:03:11.730> them<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:11.910> way<00:03:12.300> in<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:13.050> foam<00:03:13.350> okay

can call them that way in the foam okay

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.710 
can call them that way in the foam okay
because<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.760> rubber<00:03:15.000> that's<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.480> phone
