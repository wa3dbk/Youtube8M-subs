okay<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.079> is<00:00:01.199> part<00:00:01.469> two<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:01.949> my<00:00:02.340> piston

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
okay this is part two of my piston

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.510 
okay this is part two of my piston
memory<00:00:03.330> tape<00:00:03.589> tutorial<00:00:04.589> this<00:00:05.160> has<00:00:05.370> some

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
memory tape tutorial this has some

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.940 
memory tape tutorial this has some
additional<00:00:06.200> information<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.799> might

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
additional information that you might

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.299 
additional information that you might
find<00:00:08.870> helpful<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.320> was<00:00:10.469> stuff<00:00:10.830> i<00:00:10.950> was<00:00:11.099> unaware

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
find helpful it was stuff i was unaware

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.879 
find helpful it was stuff i was unaware
off<00:00:11.610> at<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.880> first<00:00:12.410> when<00:00:13.410> i<00:00:13.440> did<00:00:13.620> my<00:00:13.710> first

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
off at the first when i did my first

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.960 
off at the first when i did my first
video<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.690> i<00:00:15.690> built<00:00:15.990> these<00:00:16.170> two<00:00:16.970> demonstration

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
video so i built these two demonstration

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.540 
video so i built these two demonstration
rigs<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.480> they're<00:00:18.960> identical<00:00:19.529> almost<00:00:20.279> at<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
rigs and they're identical almost at the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.359 
rigs and they're identical almost at the
moment<00:00:20.880> they've<00:00:21.660> got<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> same<00:00:22.170> nine<00:00:22.830> blocks

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
moment they've got the same nine blocks

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.060 
moment they've got the same nine blocks
in<00:00:23.670> there<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.449> see<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.930> only<00:00:25.710> difference

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
in there you can see the only difference

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.580 
in there you can see the only difference
is<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.400> clock<00:00:26.849> here<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.570> clock<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.140> wired

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
is this clock here this clock is wired

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.819 
is this clock here this clock is wired
to<00:00:29.720> go<00:00:30.890> counterclockwise<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:33.180> clock

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
to go counterclockwise and this clock

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.160 
to go counterclockwise and this clock
will<00:00:34.829> go<00:00:35.010> clockwise<00:00:35.600> you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.989> see

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
will go clockwise you can see if you see

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.690 
will go clockwise you can see if you see
them<00:00:37.260> next<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> each<00:00:37.590> other<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.430> see<00:00:38.670> that

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
them next to each other you can see that

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.090 
them next to each other you can see that
they're<00:00:39.260> mirror<00:00:40.260> image<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.680> each<00:00:40.800> other<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
they're mirror image of each other and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.369 
they're mirror image of each other and
so<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.309> associated<00:00:44.940> Pistons<00:00:45.480> will<00:00:45.809> also<00:00:46.110> fire

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
so the associated Pistons will also fire

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560 
so the associated Pistons will also fire
in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> opposite<00:00:47.010> order<00:00:47.160> now<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.550> tape<00:00:47.910> both

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
in the opposite order now the tape both

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.130 
in the opposite order now the tape both
tapes<00:00:48.870> will<00:00:49.110> still<00:00:50.629> spin<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.809> same

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
tapes will still spin in the same

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.930 
tapes will still spin in the same
direction<00:00:53.329> but<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.510> slightly<00:00:55.289> different

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
direction but with slightly different

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.250 
direction but with slightly different
behaviors<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.600> I'll<00:00:57.809> show<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.140> right

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
behaviors and as I'll show you right

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.149 
behaviors and as I'll show you right
here<00:00:58.320> each<00:00:59.309> one<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.760> on<00:01:01.820> okay<00:01:03.320> so<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.799> see

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
here each one is on okay so you can see

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.970 
here each one is on okay so you can see
this<00:01:05.700> one

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.850 

has<00:01:10.980> a<00:01:11.010> pretty<00:01:11.250> quick<00:01:12.020> rotation<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.650> one's

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
has a pretty quick rotation this one's

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
has a pretty quick rotation this one's
going<00:01:14.040> much<00:01:14.310> slower<00:01:15.470> because<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.880> because

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
going much slower because it because

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.930 
going much slower because it because
it's<00:01:18.060> firing<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> reverse<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:20.550> Pistons

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
it's firing in the reverse the Pistons

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.400 
it's firing in the reverse the Pistons
are<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> reverse<00:01:21.540> order<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.200> this

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
are going in the reverse order to this

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.280 
are going in the reverse order to this
one<00:01:23.120> it<00:01:24.120> has<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.510> all<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.660> way<00:01:24.750> around<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
one it has to go all the way around to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.500 
one it has to go all the way around to
get<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.550> it<00:01:26.670> needs<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.300> fire

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
get to the one that it needs to to fire

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.470 
get to the one that it needs to to fire
it<00:01:28.160> so<00:01:29.160> this<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.520> actually<00:01:29.610> moving<00:01:30.120> much

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
it so this one is actually moving much

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.150 
it so this one is actually moving much
slower<00:01:30.650> now<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.700> try<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.060> add<00:01:34.160> an

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
slower now with this one I try to add an

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.080 
slower now with this one I try to add an
additional<00:01:35.640> block<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.420> pushes<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.870> out

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
additional block it just pushes it out

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.120 
additional block it just pushes it out
every<00:01:39.090> time<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.510> piston<00:01:39.900> fires<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.590> every

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
every time the piston fires it's every

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.859 
every time the piston fires it's every
time<00:01:41.280> any<00:01:41.460> piston<00:01:41.850> fires<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:42.630> it's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
time any piston fires on this one it's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.969 
time any piston fires on this one it's
pushing<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.320> block<00:01:44.030> there's<00:01:45.030> no<00:01:45.500> room<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> add

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
pushing a block there's no room to add

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.160 
pushing a block there's no room to add
additional<00:01:47.400> blocks<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.900> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.050> see

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
additional blocks this one you can see

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.460 
additional blocks this one you can see
there<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.430> every<00:01:51.300> piston<00:01:51.660> fires<00:01:51.900> once<00:01:53.360> on

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
there are it every piston fires once on

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.900 
there are it every piston fires once on
an<00:01:55.470> empty<00:01:55.700> space<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.860> if<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.100> know<00:01:59.280> when<00:01:59.729> it's

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
an empty space so if you know when it's

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.940 
an empty space so if you know when it's
going<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.330> an<00:02:00.479> empty<00:02:00.630> space<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.770> can

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
going to have an empty space you can

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.070 
going to have an empty space you can
toss<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.610> another<00:02:02.880> block<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.810> one<00:02:03.960> now

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
toss in another block so this one now

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:13.270 
toss in another block so this one now
has<00:02:04.290> ten<00:02:04.890> bucks<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.510> can<00:02:06.660> do<00:02:06.750> again

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.100 

so<00:02:14.060> now<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.180> one's<00:02:14.480> got<00:02:14.660> 11<00:02:15.140> blocks<00:02:17.050> okay<00:02:18.050> so

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
so now that one's got 11 blocks okay so

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.840 
so now that one's got 11 blocks okay so
that<00:02:18.440> I<00:02:18.470> mean<00:02:18.709> this<00:02:19.010> one<00:02:19.220> will<00:02:19.400> follow<00:02:19.610> the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
that I mean this one will follow the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.880 
that I mean this one will follow the
same<00:02:20.030> pattern<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.600> my<00:02:20.750> last<00:02:22.000> video<00:02:23.000> did<00:02:23.890> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
same pattern is my last video did to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.100 
same pattern is my last video did to
this<00:02:25.100> blocks

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.150 

another<00:02:30.100> thing<00:02:30.960> in<00:02:31.960> regards<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.500> speeding<00:02:33.010> it

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
another thing in regards to speeding it

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.760 
another thing in regards to speeding it
up<00:02:35.280> if<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.700> said<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.800> crosslink<00:02:39.490> he's<00:02:39.730> like<00:02:40.210> my

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
up if I said if I crosslink he's like my

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.510 
up if I said if I crosslink he's like my
previous<00:02:41.770> video<00:02:43.020> even<00:02:44.020> though<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:45.070> won't<00:02:45.340> let

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
previous video even though it won't let

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.340 
previous video even though it won't let
me<00:02:45.580> add<00:02:45.850> additional<00:02:46.120> blocks<00:02:46.480> at<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.870> moment

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
me add additional blocks at the moment

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.240 
me add additional blocks at the moment
if<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.280> cross<00:02:48.610> linked<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.030> give<00:02:49.240> well<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.920> that

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
if I cross linked to give well and that

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.480 
if I cross linked to give well and that
will<00:02:52.210> affect<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:54.190> timing<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:55.000> tape

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
will affect the the timing of that tape

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.790 
will affect the the timing of that tape
similarly<00:02:57.490> to<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.810> previous<00:02:59.230> video<00:03:01.800> but

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
similarly to the previous video but

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.550 
similarly to the previous video but
another<00:03:03.160> thing<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.850> came<00:03:04.090> across<00:03:04.240> was<00:03:05.050> it's

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
another thing I came across was it's

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.760 
another thing I came across was it's
possible<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.340> stick<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:07.090> second<00:03:07.959> block<00:03:08.200> in<00:03:08.440> here

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
possible to stick a second block in here

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.280 
possible to stick a second block in here
and<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.160> has<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.000> same<00:03:10.209> behavior<00:03:10.780> as<00:03:10.810> if<00:03:11.140> I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
and it has the same behavior as if I

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.850 
and it has the same behavior as if I
cross-linked<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:14.050> opposite<00:03:14.470> corners

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
cross-linked the to the opposite corners

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.160 
cross-linked the to the opposite corners
I<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:17.200> have<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.590> get<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.890> in<00:03:18.070> like<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.170> then

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
I just have to get it in like that then

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.120 
I just have to get it in like that then
you<00:03:20.200> can<00:03:20.320> see<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:21.010> each<00:03:22.650> corner<00:03:23.650> the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
you can see that it each corner the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.710 
you can see that it each corner the
opposite<00:03:24.520> corners<00:03:24.850> are<00:03:24.970> firing<00:03:25.330> at<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.510> same

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
opposite corners are firing at the same

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.880 
opposite corners are firing at the same
time<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:26.770> it's<00:03:26.920> twice<00:03:27.160> as<00:03:27.190> fast<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:29.590> can<00:03:29.770> now

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
time so it's twice as fast you can now

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.040 
time so it's twice as fast you can now
see<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.160> that's<00:03:30.820> firing<00:03:31.150> on<00:03:31.480> some<00:03:31.660> empty

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
see that that's firing on some empty

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.479 
see that that's firing on some empty
spaces<00:03:32.860> which<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.459> can

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
spaces which you can

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.580 
spaces which you can
she's<00:03:35.489> quick<00:03:35.760> enough

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.920 

it<00:03:38.830> was<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:40.720> can<00:03:40.870> stick<00:03:41.140> in<00:03:41.290> more<00:03:41.500> blocks

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.699 

he's<00:03:46.319> one

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
he's one

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.520 
he's one
this<00:03:48.709> lets<00:03:48.920> all<00:03:49.099> you<00:03:49.310> can<00:03:50.110> stick<00:03:51.110> in<00:03:51.260> on<00:03:51.409> that

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
this lets all you can stick in on that

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.390 
this lets all you can stick in on that
so<00:03:52.069> this<00:03:52.220> will<00:03:52.340> let<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.549> add<00:03:52.700> one<00:03:52.909> extra<00:03:53.269> block

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
so this will let you add one extra block

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.800 
so this will let you add one extra block
one<00:03:55.400> downside<00:03:55.670> of<00:03:56.060> doing<00:03:56.090> it<00:03:56.390> this<00:03:56.569> way<00:03:56.629> is

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
one downside of doing it this way is

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.350 
one downside of doing it this way is
actually<00:03:57.709> physically<00:03:58.640> cross-linking

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
actually physically cross-linking

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.130 
actually physically cross-linking
lawyers<00:03:59.870> is<00:04:00.580> you<00:04:01.580> can't<00:04:02.060> easily<00:04:02.390> turn<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:02.959> off

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
lawyers is you can't easily turn it off

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.080 
lawyers is you can't easily turn it off
and<00:04:03.170> on<00:04:03.680> if<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:03.950> try<00:04:04.129> to<00:04:04.160> turn<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.459> off<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.970> will

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
and on if you try to turn it off it will

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.020 
and on if you try to turn it off it will
break<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:05.569> clock<00:04:05.900> right<00:04:06.560> here<00:04:06.799> when<00:04:07.730> I<00:04:07.819> turn

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
break the clock right here when I turn

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.970 
break the clock right here when I turn
it<00:04:08.150> off<00:04:08.299> it<00:04:09.670> pushes<00:04:10.670> out<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:12.230> space<00:04:12.680> right

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
it off it pushes out that space right

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.890 
it off it pushes out that space right
there<00:04:14.019> which<00:04:15.019> actually<00:04:15.850> got<00:04:16.850> rid<00:04:17.030> of<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.299> there

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
there which actually got rid of a there

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.890 
there which actually got rid of a there
is<00:04:18.079> a<00:04:19.720> repeater<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:22.210> of<00:04:23.210> course<00:04:23.419> it<00:04:23.570> kicked

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
is a repeater and of course it kicked

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.900 
is a repeater and of course it kicked
out<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.229> extra<00:04:24.560> block<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:25.010> you<00:04:25.130> needed<00:04:25.460> so

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
out that extra block that you needed so

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.529 
out that extra block that you needed so
that<00:04:25.940> if<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:26.510> turn<00:04:27.229> it<00:04:27.350> back<00:04:27.470> on<00:04:27.650> again<00:04:28.539> you

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
that if you turn it back on again you

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:35.100 
that if you turn it back on again you
have<00:04:29.810> to

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.650 

it<00:04:36.110> snapped<00:04:36.440> up<00:04:36.910> if<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:38.030> turn<00:04:38.240> it<00:04:38.330> back<00:04:38.449> on

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
it snapped up if you turn it back on

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.290 
it snapped up if you turn it back on
again<00:04:38.720> you've<00:04:39.169> got<00:04:39.199> to<00:04:39.410> stick<00:04:40.220> this<00:04:40.340> block

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.900 

stone

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
stone

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.930 

and<00:04:46.450> I<00:04:46.920> turned<00:04:47.920> it<00:04:48.040> off<00:04:48.100> it<00:04:48.310> also<00:04:48.550> proved<00:04:48.850> it

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
and I turned it off it also proved it

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.720 
and I turned it off it also proved it
out<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.300> extra<00:04:49.600> projects<00:04:50.230> so<00:04:50.470> that<00:04:50.500> it<00:04:50.740> much

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
out that extra projects so that it much

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.260 
out that extra projects so that it much
less<00:04:51.970> stable<00:04:52.930> I'm<00:04:53.710> using<00:04:54.250> multiple<00:04:54.790> blocks<00:04:55.060> in

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
less stable I'm using multiple blocks in

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.070 
less stable I'm using multiple blocks in
the<00:04:55.300> clock<00:04:55.600> but<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:55.990> is<00:04:56.140> possible<00:04:57.240> um<00:04:58.240> okay

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
the clock but it is possible um okay

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.230 
the clock but it is possible um okay
well<00:04:59.410> I<00:04:59.620> hope<00:04:59.710> that<00:04:59.950> was<00:05:00.010> a<00:05:00.400> little<00:05:00.820> bit<00:05:01.030> more

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
well I hope that was a little bit more

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.470 
well I hope that was a little bit more
informative<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:03.930> happy<00:05:04.930> building
