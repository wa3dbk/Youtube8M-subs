00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.370
 A new model is on the Cubic of the day of a little Osuke last week's wearable day of the Elmo 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.210
 When it is said Toka not out Toka out I mean that a later also the other months 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.929
 So I received a little sample from Mr. Elmo. 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:20.020
 Cubic ms 1 is a nice package 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:26.200
 I will score in what I can see the other from the horror out of me good package 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:30.610
 There quite obvious you and I are a form say the model number is there a Elmo cubic ms 1 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:34.090
 Masu true to is this I actual size I send this package life-size 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:38.650
 Yes this is a real 2 but it also has a lens cap 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.010
 But it is glad the lucky lens cap wearing and left the lens cap 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.510
 Because I carry it 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.809
 After all it is safe when there is a lens cap, but with other manufacturers lens cap a 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.229
 The model before Law was the same, but 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.710
 Lens protector It is why this is also standing 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:58.129
 When you side-by-side but you will find a rival of a certain professional at sea 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.030
 It may not be the same as Oishi 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:06.840
 Oishi is a wish or about the same 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.210
 I think it is a waterproof case here-go professional certain professional waterproof type the number of the other at all than 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.390
 It will be tiny 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.810
 Although it is waterproof by ma alone, it is waterproof only with this waterproof case, but it is ipx 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.829
 The fact that 4 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.979
 Out and it will put a splash in life waterproof Is water 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:29.390
 It would be like it would be fine if it would just rain 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.320
 Well I have now has become correspondingly buttons and serve as very easy to use Here is the power button 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.500
 Pottotto 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.630
 Yes 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.090
 I'm going to be one time, and if you wait for a while with this, that wi-fi button here 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.260
 Cormorant even do it, but it pressed not there is a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.030
 I have been waiting for a while 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.310
 I think that maybe the sound sounds, but how long do you start wi-fi ? 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.300
 yeah 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.230
 Quite take Anea 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:58.070
 It is wifi start now It is practical speed though 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.680
 Yes you can see properly with the app on your smartphone 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.800
 But this I 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.270
 Too much Kedomo displays to follow perfectly the movement of now I camera Kedomo you have to follow now 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.500
 I think time is a lag table 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:15.610
 This is it 6 will enter and Poti 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:21.130
 Yes 6 entered and when recording is entered 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:26.380
 Matters I'm hoping now that a smooth stream won't come 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.810
 As this is also used another street without Kano remote control and I Well smartphone you want to request an improvement 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.930
 It's a recording button because you become here and you look here 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.630
 Raised dot Yes 6 will begin potch 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:40.070
 It's a recording stop and the sound is 11 different, I just say it's peppy 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:45.290
 It is a button of the photos you are a child different from others this Yes cheese 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:50.270
 Speaking of a camera whose operation can be understood by the difference in sound, it's a tripod, but one by one conversion mount 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:54.740
 The range which is thought to put on a tripod from the beginning which is not required 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.620
 It 's nice to be able to add a few minutes The interface is also accessible right away 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.180
 More than this 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:04.519
 usb and micro sd card then micro hdmi 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:12.540
 lo This super wide lens which is characteristic of previous products 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:15.610
 This l is also ms 1 which boasts the largest angle in the wearable camera that is 185 degrees 185 degrees 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.500
 The next time I will show you the live-action data 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.500
 I would like to look forward to it again
