00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.749 
let's actually take a look at this so
inside<00:01:40.259> here<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:41.130> looks<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.579> you've<00:01:41.729> got

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
inside here it looks like you've got

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.719 
inside here it looks like you've got
your<00:01:42.090> USB<00:01:42.299> charging<00:01:42.869> cable<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:44.640> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
your USB charging cable that is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.030 
your USB charging cable that is
connected<00:01:45.020> but<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.200> undo<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.680> strap

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
connected but just undo this strap

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.010 
connected but just undo this strap
because<00:01:47.430> there<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> single<00:01:48.600> jack<00:01:48.810> cable

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
because there is a single jack cable

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.170 
because there is a single jack cable
here<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.979> I'm<00:01:50.070> wondering<00:01:50.310> what<00:01:50.640> all<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.000> is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.749 
here so I'm wondering what all that is
about<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.530> see<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.100> connect<00:01:53.430> two

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
about so as you can see you connect two

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.719 
about so as you can see you connect two
mini<00:01:54.000> USB<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> speaker<00:01:55.500> which<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:56.430> fees

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
mini USB to the speaker which then fees

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.270 
mini USB to the speaker which then fees
to<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> USB<00:01:57.450> charging<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.290> then<00:01:58.770> also<00:01:59.040> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
to the USB charging and then also to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.490 
to the USB charging and then also to
your<00:01:59.579> Jack<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.329> basically<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.110> play<00:02:01.350> in

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
your Jack so basically you can play in

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.130 
your Jack so basically you can play in
charge<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.729> connect<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> your<00:02:03.210> smartphone<00:02:03.479> or

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
charge and connect to your smartphone or

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.859 
charge and connect to your smartphone or
3.5<00:02:04.770> jack<00:02:05.009> device<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.490> any<00:02:05.549> time<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.240> so

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
3.5 jack device at any time you like so

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.119 
3.5 jack device at any time you like so
that's<00:02:06.990> pretty<00:02:07.200> cool

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that's pretty cool

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.190 
that's pretty cool
so<00:02:08.729> let's<00:02:08.879> actually<00:02:09.030> take<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.360> look<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
so let's actually take a look at the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.809 
so let's actually take a look at the
actual<00:02:10.410> manual<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.099> as<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.400> see<00:02:11.459> please

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
do read this before you get started this

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.680 
do read this before you get started this
will<00:02:13.410> just

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
will just

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.420 
will just
we<00:02:13.840> had<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:13.990> charge<00:02:14.320> of<00:02:14.560> speaker<00:02:14.890> safely<00:02:15.310> and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
we had a charge of speaker safely and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.000 
we had a charge of speaker safely and
also<00:02:15.640> package<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.150> up<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.650> then<00:02:17.650> actually

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
also package it up and then actually

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.400 
also package it up and then actually
let's<00:02:18.160> get<00:02:18.310> into<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.580> box<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.290> going

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
let's get into the box so this is going

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.020 
let's get into the box so this is going
to<00:02:20.470> be<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.590> little<00:02:20.800> bit<00:02:20.980> tricky<00:02:21.340> I'm<00:02:21.460> assuming

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
to be a little bit tricky I'm assuming

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.300 
to be a little bit tricky I'm assuming
so<00:02:22.750> let's<00:02:22.990> just<00:02:23.170> put<00:02:23.440> out<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:23.770> speaker<00:02:24.130> from

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
so let's just put out this speaker from

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.360 
so let's just put out this speaker from
the<00:02:24.430> middle<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.590> comes<00:02:26.800> in<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:26.980> really

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
the middle so it comes in this really

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.820 
the middle so it comes in this really
awkward<00:02:27.580> little<00:02:28.240> cardboard<00:02:28.780> box<00:02:29.050> let's<00:02:29.680> put

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
awkward little cardboard box let's put

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.340 
awkward little cardboard box let's put
that<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.190> one<00:02:30.370> side<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.420> here<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.810> guys<00:02:31.840> here

look at the speaker first of all with

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.430 
look at the speaker first of all with
the<00:02:39.160> actual<00:02:39.490> capsule<00:02:39.970> down<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.600> kits<00:02:41.260> down

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
logo power button that actually just

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.730 
logo power button that actually just
tried<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.810> press<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:44.680> really

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
tried to press this is it's really

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.800 
tried to press this is it's really
really<00:02:45.190> hard<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.700> press<00:02:46.030> but<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:46.330> does<00:02:46.480> click

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
really hard to press but it does click

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.690 
really hard to press but it does click
in<00:02:46.960> eventually<00:02:47.260> then<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.100> have<00:02:48.250> your<00:02:48.340> plus

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
in eventually then you have your plus

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.540 
in eventually then you have your plus
and<00:02:48.940> minus<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.540> volume<00:02:49.930> buttons<00:02:50.320> on<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:51.280> side

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
and minus of volume buttons on this side

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.600 
and minus of volume buttons on this side
and<00:02:51.820> obviously<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.270> side<00:02:52.740> on<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.950> back<00:02:54.220> I'm

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
and obviously this side on the back I'm

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.370 
and obviously this side on the back I'm
not<00:02:54.820> sure<00:02:55.060> what<00:02:55.240> this<00:02:55.420> isn't<00:02:55.600> here<00:02:55.900> maybe<00:02:56.110> just

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
not sure what this isn't here maybe just

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.500 
not sure what this isn't here maybe just
like<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.620> speaker<00:02:56.890> or<00:02:57.010> little<00:02:57.280> subwoofer<00:02:57.520> on

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
like a speaker or little subwoofer on

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.450 
like a speaker or little subwoofer on
the<00:02:58.660> bottom<00:02:58.960> you<00:02:59.050> have<00:02:59.110> your<00:02:59.410> cable<00:02:59.710> coiled

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
the bottom you have your cable coiled

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.400 
the bottom you have your cable coiled
around<00:03:00.790> here<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.750> looks<00:03:01.990> like<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.260> can

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
around here so looks like you can

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.310 
around here so looks like you can
potentially<00:03:02.800> plug<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.490> of<00:03:03.820> cable<00:03:04.780> directly<00:03:04.990> to

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
potentially plug in of cable directly to

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.460 
potentially plug in of cable directly to
the<00:03:05.560> speaker<00:03:05.920> which<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.070> cool<00:03:07.020> on<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.320> back

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
the speaker which is cool on the back

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.070 
the speaker which is cool on the back
here<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:08.740> do<00:03:09.010> have<00:03:09.040> your<00:03:09.400> USB<00:03:09.670> mini<00:03:10.510> USB<00:03:10.690> for

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
here you do have your USB mini USB for

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.720 
here you do have your USB mini USB for
charging<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.620> then<00:03:11.680> also<00:03:11.830> an<00:03:12.100> LED<00:03:12.280> power

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
charging and then also an LED power

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.640 
charging and then also an LED power
light<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.720> will<00:03:13.810> indicate<00:03:14.170> whether<00:03:14.470> the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
light that will indicate whether the

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.720 
light that will indicate whether the
powers<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.160> or<00:03:15.310> off

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
powers on or off

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.699 
powers on or off
so<00:03:16.180> let's<00:03:16.360> now<00:03:16.540> actually<00:03:16.900> show<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.140> how<00:03:17.530> you

so let's now actually show you how you

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.800 
so let's now actually show you how you
release<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.370> capsule<00:03:18.640> so<00:03:19.420> all<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.660> have<00:03:19.780> to

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
do guys is turn the top to the left this

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.580 
do guys is turn the top to the left this
will<00:03:22.030> release<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.420> capsule<00:03:22.660> as<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.260> can<00:03:23.410> see

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
on top so it'll go up and down to allow

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.650 
on top so it'll go up and down to allow
the<00:03:26.140> base<00:03:26.739> control<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:28.090> be<00:03:28.180> interesting<00:03:28.570> to

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
the base control so be interesting to
