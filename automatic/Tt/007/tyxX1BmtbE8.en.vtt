couple of years is a smaller amounts of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.930 
couple of years is a smaller amounts of
fruit<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.890> anticipate<00:00:44.129> getting<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
warning to get the full flavor then you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.680 
warning to get the full flavor then you
have<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> harvest<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.820> right<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.510> picked

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
have to harvest it right if it's picked

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.910 
have to harvest it right if it's picked
unripe<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.170> not<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.530> achieve<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
unripe is not going to achieve the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.560 
unripe is not going to achieve the
flavor<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.460> need<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:51.059> green

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
flavor that it need you have green

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
flavor that it need you have green
berries<00:00:51.600> obviously<00:00:52.350> aren't<00:00:52.680> aren't<00:00:52.949> ready

yeah<00:01:01.890> every<00:01:02.699> variety<00:01:02.820> has<00:01:03.239> its<00:01:03.449> own<00:01:03.570> distinct

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
yeah every variety has its own distinct

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.880 
yeah every variety has its own distinct
flavor<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.470> try<00:01:04.860> them<00:01:04.920> absolutely<00:01:06.200> hmm<00:01:07.200> how<00:01:07.830> do

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you take care of them how often do they

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719 
you take care of them how often do they
have<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.110> watered<00:01:10.530> well<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.520> two

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
have to be watered well we have two

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.550 
have to be watered well we have two
types<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.150> irrigation<00:01:12.780> systems<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.350> when

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
types of irrigation systems here when

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.660 
types of irrigation systems here when
you<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.189> sprinkler<00:01:14.640> irrigation

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
you see is the sprinkler irrigation

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
you see is the sprinkler irrigation
that's<00:01:15.390> simply<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:15.900> frost<00:01:16.110> control<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> in

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that's simply for frost control in a in

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.280 
that's simply for frost control in a in
the<00:01:17.520> early<00:01:17.790> spring<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.360> second<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.080> most

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the early spring the second in the most

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
the early spring the second in the most
important<00:01:19.740> way<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.979> irrigate<00:01:20.580> these<00:01:20.880> plants

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
important way we irrigate these plants

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.580 
important way we irrigate these plants
is<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> daily<00:01:21.720> basis<00:01:22.170> through<00:01:22.350> drip

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
is on a daily basis through drip

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.230 
is on a daily basis through drip
irrigation<00:01:23.009> underneath<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> mulch<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
irrigation underneath the mulch that you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.330 
irrigation underneath the mulch that you
see<00:01:24.450> here<00:01:24.659> yeah<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.560> that's<00:01:25.890> our<00:01:26.100> primary

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
see here yeah so that's our primary

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.330 
see here yeah so that's our primary
source<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.560> supplying<00:01:28.560> nutrients<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
source of of supplying nutrients and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.880 
source of of supplying nutrients and
water<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> plants<00:01:30.150> through<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.450> system

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
water to the plants through that system

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.350 
water to the plants through that system
during<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.189> process<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.729> growing<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.210> you're

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
during the process of growing it you're

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.450 
during the process of growing it you're
feeding<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.810> nutritionally<00:01:34.590> you're<00:01:35.159> pruning

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
feeding it nutritionally you're pruning

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.929 
feeding it nutritionally you're pruning
