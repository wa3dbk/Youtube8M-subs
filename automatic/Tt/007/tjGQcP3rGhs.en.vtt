00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.310
 a few months ago a year ago two years ago 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.410
 details that we had not seen at the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.329
 first reading 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.070
 for a lot of reasons because that's it 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.329
 we were not at the same level in our 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.120
 evolution because we did not do 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.980
 watch out for everyone at that time etc and 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.050

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.520
 resume sowing their books in your 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.320
 library for reasons totally 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.629
 different so take the book in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.570
 your library and take a few 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.989
 seconds with the in your hands for 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.219
 ask the question what is the person 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.950
 in all the people I know 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.560
 who have benefited the most from solid 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.450
 who is the person reading this 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.010
 book might have a solution to these 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.860
 problems 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.120
 something method to accomplish 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.870
 just go see his person 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:17.270

 good crying because you hope that 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.700
 maybe this book will have the same impact 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.360
