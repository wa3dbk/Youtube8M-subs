00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
new keymod system as you can see this

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.949 
new keymod system as you can see this
has<00:03:02.310> no<00:03:02.549> picatinny<00:03:03.030> rails<00:03:03.299> on<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.450> side<00:03:03.540> or

supposedly<00:03:07.590> just<00:03:08.549> for<00:03:08.879> light<00:03:09.480> purposes<00:03:10.109> you

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
supposedly just for light purposes you

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.949 
supposedly just for light purposes you
can<00:03:11.220> add<00:03:11.489> picatinny<00:03:12.030> rails<00:03:12.239> on<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.569> if<00:03:12.810> you

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
can add picatinny rails on this if you

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.640 
can add picatinny rails on this if you
want<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.290> add<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> 45<00:03:14.129> degree<00:03:14.250> angle<00:03:14.430> or<00:03:15.650> 90

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
want to add a 45 degree angle or 90

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.369 
want to add a 45 degree angle or 90
however<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.280> want<00:03:17.549> it<00:03:17.690> this<00:03:18.690> does<00:03:18.989> fit<00:03:19.230> the

um<00:03:26.549> as<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.660> can<00:03:27.720> see<00:03:27.900> on<00:03:28.079> here<00:03:28.379> I<00:03:28.560> did<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> little

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
um as you can see on here I did a little

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.460 
um as you can see on here I did a little
paracord<00:03:30.120> mod<00:03:30.299> just<00:03:30.629> for<00:03:30.840> grip<00:03:31.019> purposes

one<00:04:58.039> just<00:04:58.639> for<00:04:59.350> just<00:05:00.350> to<00:05:00.440> not<00:05:00.800> mess<00:05:01.009> with<00:05:01.220> it

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
one just for just to not mess with it

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.450 
one just for just to not mess with it
because<00:05:01.639> it's<00:05:01.789> shooting<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:02.210> well<00:05:02.449> um

anything<00:05:04.460> else<00:05:04.669> for<00:05:04.850> internals<00:05:05.330> I<00:05:05.539> don't

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
anything else for internals I don't

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.810 
anything else for internals I don't
think<00:05:05.990> that's<00:05:06.139> that's<00:05:06.500> pretty<00:05:06.650> much<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.070> it's

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
think that's that's pretty much it it's

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.279 
think that's that's pretty much it it's

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
you're looking at almost like 410 400

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.029 
you're looking at almost like 410 400
FPS<00:05:16.250> with<00:05:16.520> 0.20<00:05:16.820> x'<00:05:17.599> but<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.590> don't<00:05:18.770> really<00:05:18.949> run

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039
