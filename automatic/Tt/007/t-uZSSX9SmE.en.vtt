00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:02.860
 if you 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.700
 we are talking to you 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.400
 the owner of that restaurant 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.349
 imagine this situation 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.889
 eight-thirty at night the moral family goes out to eat at a restaurant 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.169
 Italian 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.640
 they sit down and ask for a plate of spaghetti bolognese a pizza 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.560
 Daisy flower 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.529
 and a glass of warm milk 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.759
 spend 45 minutes and the food does not appear 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.599
 the father of the enraged family calls the manager and claims 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.780
 he will quickly enter kitchen to see what happens with the food and he is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.460
 with 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.680
 mamma mia 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.110
 all doing administrative work 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.590
 the kitchen helpers sending with purchase orders 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.550
 the neighbors taking accounts and elche on the phone with a provider who 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.890
 accident could not arrive in time with the pasta in the area 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.690
 it is a family 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.450
 that seems unusual 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.120
 U.S. too 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.790
 this is why I have arrived chefs buy 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.680

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.629

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.399
 supply management in an easy centralized manner and with 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.560
 applications that will allow you to pause time 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.940
 and 10 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.220
 for example 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.620
 when was the last time you share the prices of your suppliers 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.850
 with those of the competition 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.979
 the chef against you have the possibility 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.250
 to see all the provider options that there are 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.950

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.670
 because we know that the most important thing in a restaurant is the quality of the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.600
 service 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.100
 With chefs, you will forget the procedures before the time to be 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.659
 with your clients, look for new dishes and even relax a little, that's why the 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.079
 Chef buys tenth pie pastry these patients
