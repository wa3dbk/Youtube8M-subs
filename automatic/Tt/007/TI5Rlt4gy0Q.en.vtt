00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.220 

I've<00:00:05.880> been<00:00:06.150> fishing<00:00:06.360> for<00:00:06.690> most<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.080> my<00:00:07.110> life

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
I've been fishing for most of my life

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.530 
I've been fishing for most of my life
I've<00:00:08.069> learned<00:00:08.309> over<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.700> years<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:09.180> a<00:00:09.210> big

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
I've learned over the years that a big

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.270 
I've learned over the years that a big
issue<00:00:09.570> for<00:00:09.930> fishermen<00:00:10.500> has<00:00:10.680> always<00:00:10.860> been<00:00:11.100> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
issue for fishermen has always been the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.670 
issue for fishermen has always been the
fact<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.760> even<00:00:12.180> the<00:00:12.480> best<00:00:12.780> tied<00:00:13.080> knots<00:00:13.380> can

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
fact that even the best tied knots can

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.490 
fact that even the best tied knots can
fail<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.280> all<00:00:15.180> knots<00:00:15.450> put<00:00:15.900> stress<00:00:16.200> on<00:00:16.380> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
fail and all knots put stress on the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.519 
fail and all knots put stress on the
line<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:17.310> lose<00:00:17.550> expensive<00:00:18.270> lures<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.779> most

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
line we lose expensive lures and most

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.339 
line we lose expensive lures and most
importantly<00:00:20.040> we<00:00:20.610> lose<00:00:20.820> fish<00:00:21.150> as<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.450> product

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
importantly we lose fish as a product

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.679 
importantly we lose fish as a product
developer<00:00:22.770> I<00:00:22.950> realized<00:00:23.400> there's<00:00:23.970> got<00:00:24.419> to<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.599> a

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
developer I realized there's got to be a

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.749 
developer I realized there's got to be a
better<00:00:24.900> way<00:00:25.169> we<00:00:25.890> assembled<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.400> team<00:00:26.579> of

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
better way we assembled a team of

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.909 
better way we assembled a team of
experts<00:00:27.210> from<00:00:27.300> across<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.230> country<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
experts from across the country to

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.550 
experts from across the country to
create<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.399> better<00:00:29.700> knot<00:00:29.970> what<00:00:30.750> we<00:00:30.899> realized<00:00:31.320> is

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
create a better knot what we realized is

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.340 
create a better knot what we realized is
there<00:00:32.340> isn't<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.730> better<00:00:32.850> knot<00:00:33.149> what<00:00:33.809> we<00:00:34.020> needed

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
there isn't a better knot what we needed

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.680 
there isn't a better knot what we needed
to<00:00:34.470> do<00:00:34.590> was<00:00:34.770> eliminate<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.670> entirely<00:00:36.270> our

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
to do was eliminate the not entirely our

to do was eliminate the not entirely our
team<00:00:37.500> developed<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:38.010> solution<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.580> was<00:00:38.670> quick

easy and most importantly worked without

we<00:00:46.350> know<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.710> knots<00:00:46.920> are<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> weak<00:00:47.580> point<00:00:47.880> of

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
we know that knots are the weak point of

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.270 
we know that knots are the weak point of
a<00:00:48.510> lure<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:48.930> hook<00:00:49.140> tied<00:00:49.380> on<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> line<00:00:49.770> this

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
a lure or hook tied on a line this

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.980 
a lure or hook tied on a line this
eliminates<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.820> weak<00:00:51.090> point<00:00:51.360> makes<00:00:51.900> it

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
eliminates that weak point makes it

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.140 
eliminates that weak point makes it
incredibly<00:00:52.170> easy<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.830> that<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.370> if<00:00:53.790> you're

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
incredibly easy to do that so if you're

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.850 
incredibly easy to do that so if you're
not<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.450> good<00:00:54.660> knot<00:00:54.870> tire<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.410> some<00:00:55.530> reason
