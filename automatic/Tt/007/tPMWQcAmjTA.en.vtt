00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.400
 issues and ask these questions in a way 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.410
 quiet 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.260
 I hope that's okay, so let's go 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.090
 begin with the characterization of disease 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.709
 right because it is a super characterization 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.580
 important that has appeared several times 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.209
 no enem 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:48.860
 good disease is any escape from your well 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.170
 physical and mental well-being are 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.380
 physically I already saw in the chat that had 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.930
 someone who fell and grated every cone 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.530
 It's not that personal, it was just there. 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.320
 typing then you are sick is not normal 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.790
 mentally for sure several of you 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.650
 For that I was reading there. 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.820
 mental problems like me or 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.269
 socially also look i do not have 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.130
 friends, I do not have friends too. 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.720
 social problem is also an illness 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.420
 the diseases they are classified as 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.310
 various ways help me here goes by 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:34.329
 example can be classified in 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:34.329
 epidemics and pandemics and endemics 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.660
 epidemic 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.239
 the epidemic is an outbreak, people are 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.269
 but it is a local outbreak 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.260
 for example I passed the application well 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.870
 for iphone that now torrico even with 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.950
 the iphone has an iphone in sets too 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.430
 iphone 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.870
 oh, there's something like that and I downloaded one that 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.630
 It's ralf grandson 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.910
 then take a look is the finep that in this 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.630
 application it shows what the 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.329
 occurrences of diseases of high 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.940
 epidemics near you and around the 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.890
 application when it will open simpam reads here 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.980
 in rio de janeiro which is where it is already 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.789
 had ten deaths per h1n1 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.630
 this month the h1n1 swine flu 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.940
 ten deaths this month so it's risky and 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.140
 to paint an epidemic of h1n1 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.300
 the epidemic that injured a local outbreak 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.200
 pandemic is with this global viral outbreak 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.330
 is not it 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:41.260
 when the outbreak goes beyond the limits 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.260
 local and turned continental the global
