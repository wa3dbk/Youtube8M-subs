00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:41.890
 in the shadow of the look 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.440

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.190
 [Music] 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.190
 of eyes 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.150
 I can see 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.829
 what is 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.829
 to you 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.470

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.000
 7 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.000

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.850
 george this 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.720
 I can see 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.720
 the way 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.520
 to you 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.159
 Tell me, it's because I already know. 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.520

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.439
 [Music] 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.900
 [Applause] 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:45.370
 the rest i already know neither theta thing 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.370
 to count 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.500
 Tell me 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.140
 know 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.140
 It's so much of a beach coin. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.350
 from me 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.630
 restart 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.100
 i 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.100
 [Laughter] 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.720
 That's when I was connected. 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.580
 I'm a sea â€‹â€‹and today I won the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.360
 simplicity of the song says to me in 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.010
 malta band 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.610
 I'm going to use this guitar here that is the eagle. 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.290
 is 663 gets the briefcase simplified to us 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:39.680
 will use only one beat to play the song 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:42.160
 whole and the chords here the biggest sun is 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.160
 bigger 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.069
 the largest in itself smaller 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.360
 and smaller 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.590
 now I will only introduce soon play 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.950
 I'll show you the video later 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.950
 come on 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.280
 I'll play the rhythm once and slowly 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.280
 soon after I will teach 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.310
 once again 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.770
 Good, we'll start riding alone. 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.770
 higher will play three beats down 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.110
 We'll play one down then. 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.110
 top 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.290
 soon this is the rhythm that we will 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.690
 use to play the entire song in 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.520
 practically every chord and will be 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.360
 played once just like the intro 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.360
 like this 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.470
 [Music] 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.630
 the detail here as you just saw 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 that's bigger 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.110
 the last chord sequence gives us will 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.000
 play only once down and will give 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.900
 pause before starting the first 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.790
 part 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.470
 in the first part we will follow 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.110
 playing the same chords that we 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.040
 not a different way but rhythm is the 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.780
 same 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.970
 just be careful not the biggest you have not 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.560
 end of the second and fourth version 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:37.660
 people play the rhythm twice 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:40.280
 Look you're in the 'shadow' of the look 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.230
 to save 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.230
 but it was better this way 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.610
 in the shadow 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.070
 look 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.480
 et 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:58.579
 count nothing else besides 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.579
 [Music] 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.159
 today after the first part without the 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.229
 prior and fran the chorus but as I said 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:07.689
 the chords are the same in a rhythm 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.280
 also at the same time just stay connected 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:10.930
 to keep up with the cipher is here 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.449
 not to miss the breaks that 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.129
 happen in a few minutes and can 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.900
 follow with me also in the beginning of 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:19.000
 class where the music plays full beauty 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.889
 This is it for watching more classes and 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.810
 to learn more music just enter the 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.030
 future any doubt leave a 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.469
 comment here for a hug and 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.469
 until the next you 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:39.320
 Are you taking the look? 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.320
 yea
