beside the last 10 because his call was

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.780 
beside the last 10 because his call was
a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.890> his<00:01:38.130> video<00:01:38.400> proof<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.670> was

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
a little bit light and in the end I just

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.840 
a little bit light and in the end I just
get<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.770> verses<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.340> thirty<00:01:41.670> five

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
