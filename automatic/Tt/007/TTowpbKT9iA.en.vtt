00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.120

 san francisco california how to 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.600
 It is customary that the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.210
 news from the big brand 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.439
 manzanita so let's review what we 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.439
 they left the boys of cupertino 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.150
 one of the biggest novelties of the 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.009
 conference was to register a package of 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.770
 applications that will allow the 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.140
 users perform medical diagnostics 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.570
 by means of the sensors of the iphone 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.090
 It should be noted that any information 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.629
 doctor who registers by means of this 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.300
 system will be in privacy script 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.550
 well this script for purposes 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.620
 scientists will be available in the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.440
 open source roles 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.260
 but in the meantime we can go 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.039
 enjoying 5 development apps the one 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.560
 breast cancer diabetes parkinson asthma and 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.750
 cardiovascular diseases 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.100
 the medical part was undoubtedly one of the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.650
 most important announcements in the morning 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.560
 let's now with the devices the 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.740
 new and ultra thin macbook took away 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.800
 Much of the attention with 13.1 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.020
 millimeters thick and its almost 900 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.960
 grams of weight this new computer 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.480
 laptop virtually displaced the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.570
 woman who was also 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.030
 updated so that it does not suffer so much but 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.720
 Come up with a laptop so thin as 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.760
 new macbook who would like to read 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.340
 this brand new product will fit 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.220
 perfectly for the workers and 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.770
 students who take their field to all 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.470
 sides since now they will not have to 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.020
 break your back carrying a lot of weight 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.600
 and is that I follow its lightness and its cute 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.710
 retina screen they really stole the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.570
 show but not everything was positive the background 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.700
 that many have considered as a 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.820
 risky bet and is that this 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.979
 device only has a usb port 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.920
 thaksin that will be used to charge 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.080
 connect other usb etc 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.760
 so you will need various 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.970
 adapters depending on the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.080
 connectivity that we want to achieve one 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.930
 definitely a controversial decision 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.660
 that already has irascible detractors like 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.450
 enthusiastic advocates is to say what 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.209
 normal when it comes to support 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.300
 in short this new version of macbooks 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.920
 will go on the market for a price of one thousand 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.920
 299 dollars you cheer up 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.489
 We now make the most anticipated product 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.440
 of the conference the water watch another 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.510
 gadget that has also divided into those 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.060
 technological bits 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.420
 so this war ball will allow you to answer 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.180
 mails messages and even calls from the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.340
 same device since it transcribes what 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.170
 that dictates and so you can choose between 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.090
 send a written message an audio 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.580
 but since the theme of the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.739
 sport this gadget also you 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.319
 will notify when you have spent a lot of time 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.049
 without exercising and when you're 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.170
 practicing some physical activity 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.959
 will measure your heart rate 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.319
 It is also integrated with city ​​and 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.569
 apple pay there are three models that you can 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.959
 choose according to your style and your pocket 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.360
 Of course, the graphic model pointed 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.380
 watch sport made of aluminum that 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.959
 will cost from $ 349 the model 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.260

 $ 549 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.700
 and finally the editing support made of 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.489
 gold with prices of up to 17 thousand dollars 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.620
 and that points to a very specific niche 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.840
 of luxury products 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.360
 the controversy not only focuses on the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.120
 high prices but also to the short 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.489
 battery life 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.379
 18 and the fact that beyond their 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.140
 attractive designs 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.260
 they do not differ and also from others 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.600
 smart watch market 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.750

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.639
 Latin America 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.440

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.500
 last keynote of the brand of the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.900
