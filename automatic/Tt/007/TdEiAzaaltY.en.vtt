00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
one of the more interesting levels for

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.509 
one of the more interesting levels for
last<00:00:09.360> gravity<00:00:10.320> man<00:00:10.349> stage<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.010> one<00:00:11.219> where<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
last gravity man stage is one where the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.220 
last gravity man stage is one where the
designers<00:00:12.059> did<00:00:12.330> try<00:00:12.660> something<00:00:13.139> completely

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
designers did try something completely

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.250 
designers did try something completely
new<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.070> unlike<00:00:14.790> wave<00:00:15.059> man's<00:00:15.389> jet<00:00:15.719> bird<00:00:15.960> right

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
new and unlike wave man's jet bird right

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.990 
new and unlike wave man's jet bird right
this<00:00:16.770> one<00:00:16.949> makes<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> pretty<00:00:17.670> good

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
this one makes for a pretty good

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.540 
this one makes for a pretty good
experience<00:00:18.630> I'd<00:00:18.840> say<00:00:18.869> let's<00:00:19.590> hop<00:00:19.859> or<00:00:20.070> fall

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
experience I'd say let's hop or fall

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:30.529 
experience I'd say let's hop or fall
right<00:00:21.060> into<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:28.760> first<00:00:29.760> things<00:00:30.060> first<00:00:30.150> I

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
right into it first things first I

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.269 
right into it first things first I
really<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.410> music<00:00:31.800> here<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.070> fits

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
really do like the music here it fits

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.240 
really do like the music here it fits
the<00:00:32.489> stage<00:00:32.730> extremely<00:00:33.329> well<00:00:33.649> those<00:00:34.649> guys<00:00:34.920> here

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
the stage extremely well those guys here

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.100 
the stage extremely well those guys here
will<00:00:35.399> only<00:00:35.550> fire<00:00:35.969> when<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.329> get<00:00:36.450> nearer<00:00:36.719> making

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
will only fire when we get nearer making

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840 
will only fire when we get nearer making
them<00:00:37.230> some<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.469> useless<00:00:38.129> most<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> time

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
them some of useless most of the time

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.670 
them some of useless most of the time
but<00:00:39.360> they're<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> good<00:00:39.840> target<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.290> Power

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
but they're a good target for Power

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.970 
but they're a good target for Power
Stone<00:00:41.040> showing<00:00:41.489> off<00:00:42.050> power<00:00:43.050> stone<00:00:43.350> will<00:00:43.620> fire

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
Stone showing off power stone will fire

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.670 
Stone showing off power stone will fire
out<00:00:44.219> those<00:00:44.460> three<00:00:44.640> rotating<00:00:45.239> stones<00:00:45.719> which

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
out those three rotating stones which

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
out those three rotating stones which
deal<00:00:47.039> absolutely<00:00:47.760> no<00:00:47.940> damage<00:00:48.329> I've<00:00:48.570> yet<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
deal absolutely no damage I've yet to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.810 
deal absolutely no damage I've yet to
find<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.440> single<00:00:49.649> enemy<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> game<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
find a single enemy in the game that is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.229 
find a single enemy in the game that is
actually<00:00:51.239> week<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.780> them<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.640> mostly<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
actually week to them so it's mostly a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.869 
actually week to them so it's mostly a
very<00:00:54.750> very<00:00:55.050> tedious<00:00:55.320> affair<00:00:55.620> even<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.610> can

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
very very tedious affair even if you can

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
very very tedious affair even if you can
like<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.390> screen<00:00:57.629> hit<00:00:57.840> enemies<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
like on this screen hit enemies that you

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.950 
like on this screen hit enemies that you
wouldn't<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.829> able<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.160> otherwise<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.719> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
wouldn't be able to otherwise you can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.959 
wouldn't be able to otherwise you can
mitigate<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.649> bit<00:01:01.890> by<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.460> into<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> menu

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
mitigate it a bit by going into the menu

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.660 
mitigate it a bit by going into the menu
switching<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.780> power<00:01:03.960> stone<00:01:04.320> but<00:01:04.670> it's

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
switching out of power stone but it's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.820 
switching out of power stone but it's
just<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.180> tedious<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.320> never<00:01:07.560> ever

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
just so tedious and it's never ever

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.920 
just so tedious and it's never ever
birthed<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.850> weapon<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.299> more<00:01:09.510> likely<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
birthed it this weapon is more likely to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.710 
birthed it this weapon is more likely to
hurt<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.439> than<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.070> any<00:01:11.220> good

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
hurt you than to do you any good

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.910 
hurt you than to do you any good
unrelated<00:01:12.720> note<00:01:12.900> those<00:01:13.200> guys<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.710> actually

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
unrelated note those guys are actually

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.249 
unrelated note those guys are actually
not<00:01:14.520> weak<00:01:14.729> against<00:01:15.150> anything<00:01:15.630> they<00:01:15.810> resisted

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
not weak against anything they resisted

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.649 
not weak against anything they resisted
the<00:01:16.380> gyro<00:01:16.740> blade<00:01:16.950> which<00:01:17.130> usually<00:01:17.340> will<00:01:17.790> would

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the gyro blade which usually will would

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.620 
the gyro blade which usually will would
a<00:01:18.689> deal<00:01:19.200> 3<00:01:19.710> by<00:01:20.060> HP<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.090> damage<00:01:21.290> but<00:01:22.290> whoa<00:01:23.630> there

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
a deal 3 by HP of damage but whoa there

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
a deal 3 by HP of damage but whoa there
is<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> gravity<00:01:25.229> giving<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.619> effect<00:01:25.890> kind<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
is a gravity giving in effect kind of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.010 
is a gravity giving in effect kind of
fitting<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.909> stage<00:01:27.210> theme<00:01:27.509> maybe<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
fitting with the stage theme maybe of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.530 
fitting with the stage theme maybe of
course<00:01:28.049> obviously<00:01:28.670> but<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.299> well

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
course obviously but it's really well

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.880 
course obviously but it's really well
executed<00:01:30.900> because<00:01:31.470> yeah<00:01:32.189> those<00:01:33.890> switching

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
executed because yeah those switching

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.630 
executed because yeah those switching
here<00:01:35.100> works<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.630> looks<00:01:37.250> except<00:01:38.250> when<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
here works it just looks except when the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.370 
here works it just looks except when the
enemies<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.180> confused<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:41.130> happens

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
enemies get confused a bit it happens

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.440 
enemies get confused a bit it happens
so<00:01:43.070> yeah<00:01:43.219> this<00:01:43.369> is<00:01:43.549> really<00:01:43.729> crystallized

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
so yeah this is really crystallized

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.630 
so yeah this is really crystallized
chance<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.110> shine<00:01:45.289> because<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:46.009> enemies<00:01:46.399> here

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
chance to shine because the enemies here

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.179 
chance to shine because the enemies here
are<00:01:46.820> not<00:01:47.090> resistant<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.170> unlike<00:01:48.920> most

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
are not resistant to it unlike most

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.550 
are not resistant to it unlike most
other<00:01:49.520> special<00:01:50.090> events<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:50.509> year<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:51.259> have<00:01:51.409> to

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
other special events in year you have to

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.850 
other special events in year you have to
push<00:01:51.710> upwards<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.579> slide<00:01:52.820> on<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.149> ceiling<00:01:53.539> a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
push upwards to slide on the ceiling a

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.330 
push upwards to slide on the ceiling a
nice<00:01:54.860> touch<00:01:56.439> one<00:01:57.439> of<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.649> few<00:01:57.890> nice<00:01:58.070> touches

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
nice touch one of the few nice touches

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.370 
nice touch one of the few nice touches
here<00:01:58.579> because<00:01:58.850> Allah<00:01:59.090> when<00:01:59.270> that<00:01:59.539> it's<00:01:59.810> not

here because Allah when that it's not
very<00:02:00.799> well<00:02:01.130> implemented<00:02:01.610> every<00:02:02.569> other<00:02:02.720> thing

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
very well implemented every other thing

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.889 
very well implemented every other thing
but<00:02:03.470> mega<00:02:03.770> man<00:02:04.039> has<00:02:04.250> its<00:02:04.399> own<00:02:04.610> gravity<00:02:05.240> has<00:02:05.720> the

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
but mega man has its own gravity has the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.499 
but mega man has its own gravity has the
normal<00:02:06.289> gravity<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:06.740> yeah<00:02:07.280> our<00:02:07.880> weapon

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
normal gravity so yeah our weapon

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.410 
normal gravity so yeah our weapon
pickups<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.530> such<00:02:09.769> will<00:02:10.039> still<00:02:10.429> fall<00:02:10.700> down<00:02:11.030> so

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
pickups and such will still fall down so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.380 
pickups and such will still fall down so
it's<00:02:12.080> not<00:02:12.230> it's<00:02:12.800> not<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.190> best<00:02:13.430> thing<00:02:13.610> but<00:02:14.120> for

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
it's not it's not the best thing but for

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.190 
it's not it's not the best thing but for
megaman<00:02:15.019> 5<00:02:15.290> it's<00:02:15.950> really<00:02:16.220> nice<00:02:16.959> so<00:02:17.959> yeah<00:02:18.049> this

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
megaman 5 it's really nice so yeah this

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.140 
megaman 5 it's really nice so yeah this
was<00:02:18.410> crystallized<00:02:18.980> time<00:02:19.280> in<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.519> light<00:02:19.700> as

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
was crystallized time in the light as

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.930 
was crystallized time in the light as
said<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.620> really<00:02:21.980> good<00:02:22.190> if<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.580> can

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
said it is really good if you can

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.539 
said it is really good if you can
rapid-fire<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:23.780> against<00:02:24.200> enemies<00:02:24.620> because

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
rapid-fire it against enemies because

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.030 
rapid-fire it against enemies because
well<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.480> does<00:02:26.930> steal<00:02:27.230> two<00:02:27.410> lines<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.769> damage

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
well it does steal two lines of damage

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.729 
well it does steal two lines of damage
just<00:02:28.190> like<00:02:28.459> napalm<00:02:28.910> bomb<00:02:29.319> just<00:02:30.319> make<00:02:30.500> sure<00:02:30.530> you

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
just like napalm bomb just make sure you

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.420 
just like napalm bomb just make sure you
do<00:02:30.950> not<00:02:30.980> miss<00:02:31.130> however<00:02:31.849> that<00:02:32.060> would<00:02:32.269> be<00:02:33.400> not<00:02:34.400> a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
do not miss however that would be not a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.699 
do not miss however that would be not a
good<00:02:34.640> idea<00:02:34.760> because<00:02:35.720> then<00:02:36.140> you'd<00:02:36.290> have<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.590> go

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
good idea because then you'd have to go

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.289 
good idea because then you'd have to go
in<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.980> Start<00:02:37.220> screen<00:02:37.280> again<00:02:37.730> until<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.120> can

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
in the Start screen again until you can

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.839 
in the Start screen again until you can
do<00:02:38.420> anything<00:02:39.069> yeah<00:02:40.069> or<00:02:40.489> wait<00:02:41.450> like<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.849> still

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
do anything yeah or wait like that still

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.370 
do anything yeah or wait like that still
terrible<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:45.340> like<00:02:46.340> napalm<00:02:46.670> bombs<00:02:47.290> whereas<00:02:48.290> you

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
terrible I like napalm bombs whereas you

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.940 
terrible I like napalm bombs whereas you
can<00:02:48.590> at<00:02:48.709> least<00:02:48.739> 5<00:02:49.130> 30<00:02:50.500> myself<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.620> still<00:02:51.799> is

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
can at least 5 30 myself and still is

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.880 
can at least 5 30 myself and still is
charged<00:02:52.220> kick<00:02:52.430> for<00:02:52.609> many<00:02:52.790> situations<00:02:53.890> because

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
charged kick for many situations because

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.979 
charged kick for many situations because
you<00:02:55.040> can<00:02:55.220> just<00:02:55.250> say<00:02:56.000> waiting<00:02:56.450> I'm<00:02:56.630> going

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
you can just say waiting I'm going

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.210 
you can just say waiting I'm going

now for the fun of it lets you super

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.090 
now for the fun of it lets you super
errors<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.639> weapons<00:03:01.970> it's<00:03:02.870> not<00:03:03.049> too<00:03:03.500> bad<00:03:03.530> news

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
errors and weapons it's not too bad news

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.270 
errors and weapons it's not too bad news
of<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.370> time<00:03:04.579> actually<00:03:05.109> whoops<00:03:06.109> but<00:03:07.069> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
of the time actually whoops but the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.309 
of the time actually whoops but the
gravity<00:03:07.730> gimmick<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.329> completely<00:03:08.900> as<00:03:09.049> it's

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
gravity gimmick is completely as it's

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.960 
gravity gimmick is completely as it's
completely<00:03:09.799> unaffected<00:03:10.190> by<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.519> gravity

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
completely unaffected by the gravity

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.080 
completely unaffected by the gravity
gimmick<00:03:11.269> however<00:03:12.170> do<00:03:12.530> ice<00:03:12.769> fire<00:03:13.160> like<00:03:13.850> napalm

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
gimmick however do ice fire like napalm

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.890 
gimmick however do ice fire like napalm
bombs<00:03:14.359> do<00:03:14.959> I<00:03:14.989> spy<00:03:15.530> our<00:03:15.739> last<00:03:15.980> letter<00:03:16.310> here<00:03:16.900> well

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
bombs do I spy our last letter here well

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.040 
bombs do I spy our last letter here well
yes<00:03:18.260> indeed

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
yes indeed

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.890 
yes indeed
also<00:03:20.770> resisting<00:03:21.220> as<00:03:21.340> napalm<00:03:21.670> bombs<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.150> for

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
also resisting as napalm bombs and for

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.710 
also resisting as napalm bombs and for
our<00:03:23.050> efforts<00:03:23.530> we<00:03:23.710> get<00:03:23.890> beat<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.760> robotic<00:03:25.480> bird

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
our efforts we get beat a robotic bird

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.240 
our efforts we get beat a robotic bird
friend<00:03:26.220> now<00:03:27.220> what<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.790> speech<00:03:28.060> do<00:03:28.330> well<00:03:29.250> bird

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
friend now what the speech do well bird

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.880 
friend now what the speech do well bird
is<00:03:30.280> things<00:03:31.030> just<00:03:31.750> look<00:03:31.900> at<00:03:32.020> that<00:03:32.080> will

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
is things just look at that will

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.860 
is things just look at that will
automatically<00:03:33.430> go<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.790> enemies<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:34.510> kill

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
automatically go to enemies and kill

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.700 
automatically go to enemies and kill
them<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.730> haven't<00:03:36.730> yet<00:03:37.060> decided<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.960> haven't<00:03:38.560> yet

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
them I haven't yet decided I haven't yet

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.460 
them I haven't yet decided I haven't yet
tried<00:03:38.980> out<00:03:39.340> beat<00:03:39.670> too<00:03:39.940> much<00:03:40.120> because<00:03:40.420> well<00:03:41.260> you

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
tried out beat too much because well you

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.110 
tried out beat too much because well you
will<00:03:41.800> always<00:03:42.100> get<00:03:42.280> him<00:03:42.430> in<00:03:42.520> this<00:03:42.610> last<00:03:42.850> level

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
will always get him in this last level

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.750 
will always get him in this last level
obviously<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.710> have<00:03:44.950> no<00:03:45.130> idea<00:03:45.280> what<00:03:45.610> he's

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
obviously so I have no idea what he's

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.730 
obviously so I have no idea what he's
actually<00:03:46.000> really<00:03:46.660> good<00:03:46.960> against<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.590> what

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
actually really good against and what

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.400 
actually really good against and what
not<00:03:47.980> however<00:03:48.700> he<00:03:49.240> is<00:03:49.270> actually<00:03:49.840> good<00:03:50.050> against

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
not however he is actually good against

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.520 
not however he is actually good against
a<00:03:50.500> lot<00:03:50.710> of<00:03:50.740> things<00:03:51.480> it's<00:03:52.480> kind<00:03:52.720> of<00:03:52.840> cheap<00:03:53.140> maybe

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
a lot of things it's kind of cheap maybe

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.100 
a lot of things it's kind of cheap maybe
but<00:03:54.130> can<00:03:54.460> be<00:03:54.610> alive<00:03:54.850> savings<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.570> situations

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
but can be alive savings and situations

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.290 
but can be alive savings and situations
I<00:03:56.320> however<00:03:56.950> will<00:03:57.310> not<00:03:57.370> using<00:03:58.000> too<00:03:58.150> much

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
I however will not using too much

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.960 
I however will not using too much
because<00:03:58.570> well<00:03:58.960> there<00:03:59.560> is<00:03:59.680> not<00:03:59.890> much<00:04:00.520> subtlety

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
because well there is not much subtlety

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.170 
because well there is not much subtlety
to<00:04:01.300> using<00:04:01.990> beat<00:04:02.200> I<00:04:02.410> think<00:04:02.830> and<00:04:03.040> also<00:04:03.520> you<00:04:03.820> might

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
to using beat I think and also you might

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.840 
to using beat I think and also you might
want<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.630> save<00:04:04.840> out<00:04:05.080> on<00:04:05.290> his<00:04:05.410> energy<00:04:05.890> in<00:04:06.610> the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
want to save out on his energy in the

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.300 
want to save out on his energy in the
following<00:04:07.210> stages<00:04:07.570> because<00:04:07.900> he<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:08.740> a<00:04:09.040> good

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
following stages because he is a good
