00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.740
 when you hear that you say it must 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.570
 to be and spa 10 years old or wrong then 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.470
 you also need to know how each year 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.450
 in spring 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.580
 there is a new wave of exposure 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.470
 which is sweeping the institutions 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.759
 cultural and awakened 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.160
 Parisian among others then you go 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.950
 see there an excerpt from an exhibition 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.689
 novel had never seen one like that on 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.099
 this painter there seems to me it's a 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.750
 troll in France no that's what she 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.060
 will make a big splash and she was 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.010
 long-awaited because velvet in 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.539
 France of this magnitude there we had 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.340
 not seen why because already 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.350
 Velazquez canvas painters 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.780
 there are very few in France even 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.690
 luff does not have so what can not 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.769
 die so he pricked everything prado who 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.359
 everything he did not have stung sting but 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.010
 but the cherry and Spanish at the same 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.050
 time it is legitimate anyway that this 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.460
 smartphone and other music the 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.260
 more here it is his self-portrait 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.820
 that she then education she needed that 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.109
 the prado 10 to the big palace ben here it is 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.120
 you lend works they have 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.559
 picked up the most beautiful works and 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.300
 most famous of velazquez 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.490
 there is not this famous painting that we have 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.350
 all seen in the history books the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.250
 menines with this dress like that this 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.020
 Infanta of Spain 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.790
 so characteristic of the painting of 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.190
 Velasquez this Baroque painter of 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.960
 the spain of the seventeenth century then painter 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.520
 Baroque Baroque comes a little bit 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.080
 later we will say that velasquez is 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.060
 a precursor and suddenly he had a 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.680
 little bit of flair he felt the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.270
 mobility and it was for the time 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.730
 extremely modern which inspired 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.960
 all the painters 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.180
 adada from all others 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.010
 generations the court is the painter of 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.240
 the race the painter of the king philippe iv 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.950
 and all his family so 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.550
 actually he's going to paint the big ones 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.140
 of this world 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.760
 he is a great portraitist and especially 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.190
 which will also leave us outside 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.440
 of an absolutely incredible color 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.150
 of a physical ddd treatment of 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.500
 totally crazy portrait what will 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.420
 as thin me what I find it 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.930
 pretty vague is that there is a detail for 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.060
 the costumes who we are he makes a 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.010
 great archival work on recipes 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.350
 the seventeenth- century spain that inspired 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.670
 even cinema is what we are 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.270
 tells in this exhibition at large 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.270
 Palace in London 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.030
 the story of Velasquez is the story 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.240
 of a painter who became courtiers 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.350
 so the beginning of his painting is rife in 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.360
 the streets of seville is a world 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.030
 popular it's a poor world what a 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.440
 direct world in brutal but velasquez is going 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.690
 quickly belonged to 123 become the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.690
 king's painter the world he will know 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.540
 will be a world of puck will be a world of 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.470
 riches will be a world of power what 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.270
 that annoys us is a world without 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.740
 Default Stepless® without both 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.330
 hours on the contrary but this ugliness 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.520
 velasquez valid exceeded because 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.720
 this ugliness is not the end in itself the 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.720
 end in itself is the glory of the Habsburgs 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.400
 spain of the seventeenth century carpets 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.360
 eminently religious nevertheless the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.010
 religious painting will not be the object 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.800
 velasquez is first of all 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.450
 portraitist of philippe iv it is a 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.230
 genius artist so the little that touches 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.670
 of religious painting 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.870
 it makes it a masterpiece and it's 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.880
 true for other genres he does not paint 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.260
 that two landscapes and two landscapes 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.640
 that he tries to come two of the most 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.690
 beautiful landscapes of the history of the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.690
 painting all times combined 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.520
 what makes velasquez and his works 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.020
 especially close to us this is the 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.760
 ability to write them into the 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.130
 present to conjugate his vision of the world 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.010
 in the present to make us the concrete the 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.709
 real the truth is a jug that this 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.510
 either 1,1 whether it's a king we breathe 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.980
 the same air as what makes that since 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.660
 400 years of modern time 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.880
 bar and modern to the eighth century to 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.500
 goyal modern paris 19th century led to 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.970
 20th this app that looks modern 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.560
 it's been four centuries this painter 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.190
 modern and that's the magic of 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.190
 velazquez and stockings 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.030
 Bella Sky is a painter of harmonies 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.770
 that is, he will not do 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.440
 react the colors together he goes the 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.640
 to tune and create a cost vibration 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.740
 of painting that has fascinated 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.490
 Impressionist 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.350
 it's a painter who has a relationship 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.160
 extremely sensitive to color and 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.360
 as peaceful 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.770
 he does not seek violence 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.770
 not looking for chromatic conflict 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.829
 when we think of velasquez 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.080
 we have images that are very 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.419
 quickly and the most obvious image 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.460
 it's the image of the infanta mario rythm 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.900
 it's the heroine of the meninels it's been a 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.699
 model that must have counted for 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.630
 velasquez our little world 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.610
 associated had the comfortable appearance 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.110
 there is a mainstream film that has 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.789
 a lot marked is the madness of 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.710
 magnitudes which is a film that is kneaded 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.660
 references to the world velasquez well 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.460
 and because many are the visitors 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.050
 who will arrive here by leaving the 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.320
 discovery of Spain from the leaf of 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.320

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.050
