00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
cool but uh yeah I mean this is a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
cool but uh yeah I mean this is a
nuclear<00:01:17.700> gameplay<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.450> pretty<00:01:18.750> good

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
nuclear gameplay so it is pretty good

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.399 
nuclear gameplay so it is pretty good

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
but the way I get it is just it's very

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.890 
but the way I get it is just it's very
unorthodox<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.850> me<00:01:23.909> i'm<00:01:24.060> using<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.869> know

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
nuclear's with unsilenced weapons are

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.380 
nuclear's with unsilenced weapons are
much<00:01:38.340> harder<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
much harder and this is actually a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.560 
much harder and this is actually a
five-piece<00:01:42.390> fucking<00:01:43.110> beast<00:01:43.829> clip<00:01:44.340> mana<00:01:44.790> one

stock it has a laser sight and fast mags

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.109 
stock it has a laser sight and fast mags
which<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.200> an<00:02:07.409> assault<00:02:07.619> rifle<00:02:07.740> I'm<00:02:08.610> not<00:02:08.879> saying

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
which on an assault rifle I'm not saying

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.969 
which on an assault rifle I'm not saying
it's<00:02:09.270> bad<00:02:09.390> I'm<00:02:09.840> not<00:02:09.989> saying<00:02:10.110> it's<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.349> bad<00:02:10.379> class

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
it's bad I'm not saying it's a bad class

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.530 
it's bad I'm not saying it's a bad class
setups<00:02:11.310> obviously<00:02:11.700> i<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.790> pretty<00:02:12.120> goddamn

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
setups obviously i do pretty goddamn

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.790 
setups obviously i do pretty goddamn
well<00:02:12.750> with<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.989> still

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
well with it still

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.220 
well with it still
and<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.100> think<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.690> laser<00:02:15.690> sight<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
and I do think the laser sight on the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.650 
and I do think the laser sight on the
m27<00:02:16.860> specifically<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.820> pretty<00:02:18.060> good<00:02:18.240> because

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
m27 specifically is pretty good because

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.570 
m27 specifically is pretty good because
you<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.080> doesn't<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.710> ton<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.160> recoil

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
you know it doesn't have a ton of recoil

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.000 
you know it doesn't have a ton of recoil
and<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.940> shoots<00:02:21.120> pretty<00:02:21.330> fast<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:21.830> it's<00:02:22.830> not

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
and it shoots pretty fast so it's not

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.770 
and it shoots pretty fast so it's not
bad<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:23.580> it's<00:02:23.640> definitely<00:02:23.970> never<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.330> class<00:02:24.600> I

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
bad but it's definitely never a class I

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.720 
bad but it's definitely never a class I
would<00:02:24.840> make<00:02:25.110> ever<00:02:25.500> like<00:02:26.010> even<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.520> fool<00:02:26.700> around

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
would make ever like even to fool around

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.130 
would make ever like even to fool around
I<00:02:27.120> probably<00:02:27.300> would<00:02:27.480> never<00:02:27.540> make<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.870> class<00:02:28.110> like

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
I probably would never make a class like

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.560 
I probably would never make a class like
this<00:02:28.350> if<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:29.280> don't<00:02:29.400> have<00:02:29.520> stock<00:02:29.820> or<00:02:30.090> quick

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
this if you don't have stock or quick

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.260 
this if you don't have stock or quick
draw<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.080> or<00:02:31.680> quick<00:02:31.950> draw<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.370> your<00:02:32.820> assault

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
draw and or quick draw on your assault

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.780 
draw and or quick draw on your assault
rifles<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.840> you're<00:02:34.530> trying<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.860> rush<00:02:35.070> it's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
rifles and you're trying to rush it's

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.130 
rifles and you're trying to rush it's
generally<00:02:36.150> not<00:02:36.180> gonna<00:02:36.450> go<00:02:36.570> very<00:02:36.600> well<00:02:36.810> it's

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
generally not gonna go very well it's

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.670 
generally not gonna go very well it's
just<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.770> not<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:40.200> game<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.530> did

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
just this is not but in this game it did

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.810 
just this is not but in this game it did
which<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:40.860> why<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.100> thought<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.370> was<00:02:41.460> kind<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.730> a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
which is why I thought it was kind of a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.760 
which is why I thought it was kind of a
more<00:02:41.970> impressive<00:02:42.180> gameplay<00:02:42.690> also<00:02:43.440> was<00:02:43.590> pretty

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
more impressive gameplay also was pretty

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.130 
more impressive gameplay also was pretty
fast<00:02:44.040> nuclear<00:02:44.700> I'm<00:02:45.270> already<00:02:45.480> out<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.750> 25

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
fast nuclear I'm already out of 25

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.020 
fast nuclear I'm already out of 25
killstreak<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.920> makea<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.640> less<00:02:47.850> three

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
killstreak and makea like less three

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.760 
killstreak and makea like less three
minutes<00:02:48.270> in<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.420> game<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:49.530> is<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> pretty

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
minutes in the game so that is a pretty

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.870 
minutes in the game so that is a pretty
aggressive<00:02:49.890> gameplay<00:02:50.460> but<00:02:51.440> yeah<00:02:52.880> that's

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
aggressive gameplay but yeah that's

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.370 
aggressive gameplay but yeah that's
pretty<00:02:54.090> much<00:02:54.210> that's<00:02:54.930> pretty<00:02:55.050> much<00:02:55.170> what<00:02:55.350> I

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
pretty much that's pretty much what I

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.890 
pretty much that's pretty much what I

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
hardpoint I've had quite a few of these

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.250 
hardpoint I've had quite a few of these
gameplays<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:09.000> been<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.150> hard<00:03:09.390> point<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.750> love

gameplays have been a hard point I love
the<00:03:10.470> game<00:03:10.650> type<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.160> think<00:03:11.400> it's<00:03:11.520> just

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
the game type I think it's just

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.260 
the game type I think it's just
phenomenal<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:14.250> don't<00:03:14.520> really<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.880> mean<00:03:15.150> like

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
phenomenal you don't really I mean like

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.850 
phenomenal you don't really I mean like
playing<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.750> objective<00:03:15.870> isn't<00:03:16.350> super

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
playing the objective isn't super

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.620 
playing the objective isn't super
difficult<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.460> if<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.700> have<00:03:17.940> teammates<00:03:18.390> who

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
difficult so if you have teammates who

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.940 
difficult so if you have teammates who
generally<00:03:18.959> don't<00:03:19.200> play<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.530> objective<00:03:19.920> you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
generally don't play the objective you

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.979 
generally don't play the objective you
know<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.790> get<00:03:20.940> 200<00:03:21.090> points<00:03:21.330> for<00:03:21.570> jumping<00:03:21.900> on

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
know you get 200 points for jumping on

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.240 
know you get 200 points for jumping on
it<00:03:22.020> so<00:03:22.290> there's<00:03:22.440> obviously<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.830> huge<00:03:23.010> incentive

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
it so there's obviously a huge incentive

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.240 
it so there's obviously a huge incentive
and<00:03:23.880> I<00:03:24.810> don't<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.380> just<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.680> think<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:25.950> easier

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
and I don't I just I think it's easier

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.680 
and I don't I just I think it's easier
to<00:03:26.580> play<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.790> objective<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:27.239> game<00:03:27.480> which

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
to play the objective in this game which

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.960 
to play the objective in this game which
lures<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.230> lot<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.590> people<00:03:28.890> into<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.370> just

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
lures a lot of people into it and just

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.940 
lures a lot of people into it and just
generally<00:03:30.570> makes<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.900> game<00:03:31.050> a<00:03:31.230> lot<00:03:31.500> more<00:03:31.739> fun

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
generally makes the game a lot more fun

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.729 
generally makes the game a lot more fun
I<00:03:32.370> think<00:03:33.120> other<00:03:33.300> than<00:03:33.390> war<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.050> mean<00:03:34.260> war<00:03:34.500> in

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
I think other than war I mean war in

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.370 
I think other than war I mean war in
black<00:03:34.950> ops<00:03:35.130> 2<00:03:35.280> again<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.850> got<00:03:36.030> super<00:03:36.810> rewarded

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
for playing the objective and it was

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.290 
for playing the objective and it was
just<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.140> really<00:03:40.260> fun<00:03:40.380> game<00:03:40.680> type<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.880> love

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
and I just gotta hope Infinity Ward

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.729 
and I just gotta hope Infinity Ward
follows<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.930> trend<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.260> mean<00:03:52.410> with<00:03:52.530> modern

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
follows the trend I mean with modern

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.440 
follows the trend I mean with modern

warfare 3 they did give you a little bit

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.020 
warfare 3 they did give you a little bit
you<00:03:54.690> know<00:03:54.720> they<00:03:54.930> gave<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.170> a<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:56.610> equivalent

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
you know they gave you a the equivalent

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.430 
you know they gave you a the equivalent
of<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.209> kill<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.660> know<00:03:57.780> if<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.930> capped<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.230> flag

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
of a kill you know if you capped a flag

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.020 
of a kill you know if you capped a flag
or<00:03:58.560> something<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.010> hopefully<00:03:59.610> they<00:03:59.700> keep<00:03:59.880> that

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
or something so hopefully they keep that

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.490 
or something so hopefully they keep that
