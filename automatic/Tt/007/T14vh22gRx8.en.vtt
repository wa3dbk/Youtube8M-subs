00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
are the easiest easiest way to do it you

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.730 
are the easiest easiest way to do it you
can<00:01:28.509> upgrade<00:01:28.659> them<00:01:29.020> if<00:01:29.079> you<00:01:29.200> want<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.469> don't

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
matter it's just to get your synthesize

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.420 
matter it's just to get your synthesize
ability<00:01:32.799> there's<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:33.399> lot<00:01:33.640> of<00:01:33.820> other<00:01:34.000> items<00:01:34.270> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
ability there's a lot of other items to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
just keep an eye over on your passive

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.330 
just keep an eye over on your passive
abilities<00:01:38.170> on<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.380> right<00:01:38.680> and<00:01:39.039> you'll<00:01:39.280> see

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
abilities on the right and you'll see

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.149 
abilities on the right and you'll see
you<00:01:39.880> know<00:01:40.140> you'll<00:01:41.140> see<00:01:41.320> little<00:01:41.500> symbols<00:01:41.979> like

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
you know you'll see little symbols like

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.380 
you know you'll see little symbols like
this<00:01:42.340> at<00:01:42.609> the<00:01:42.700> center<00:01:43.030> thoughts

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
this at the center thoughts

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.649 
this at the center thoughts
synthesized<00:01:44.170> ability<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.390> that's<00:01:46.390> how<00:01:46.600> you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
synthesized ability and that's how you

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.080 
synthesized ability and that's how you
get<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.170> random<00:01:47.619> instant<00:01:48.070> chain<00:01:48.340> now<00:01:48.579> it<00:01:48.880> does

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
get the random instant chain now it does

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.200 
get the random instant chain now it does
not<00:01:49.270> work<00:01:49.509> all<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.960> time<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:51.310> works<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.729> handful

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
not work all the time it works a handful

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.840 
not work all the time it works a handful
of<00:01:52.270> times<00:01:53.009> we'll<00:01:54.009> see<00:01:54.039> if<00:01:54.249> we<00:01:54.369> get<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.609> to<00:01:54.640> work

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
of times we'll see if we get it to work

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.450 
of times we'll see if we get it to work
right<00:01:54.880> here

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
but that's how you did an instant chain

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.740 
but that's how you did an instant chain
if<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.800> have<00:04:39.919> any<00:04:40.069> questions<00:04:40.580> there's<00:04:41.419> plenty

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
stuff but that's how you do the instant

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.330 
stuff but that's how you do the instant
chain
