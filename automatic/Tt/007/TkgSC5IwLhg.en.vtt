just<00:00:54.090> lighting<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.629> bowl

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.890 

of<00:01:00.079> Boswell's<00:01:01.079> best

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:14.060 

this<00:01:07.900> is<00:01:08.049> probably

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.529 

honestly<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.000> probably<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.420> best

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
honestly this is probably the best

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.660 
honestly this is probably the best
aromatics<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.140> ever<00:01:16.289> had<00:01:17.719> very<00:01:18.719> strong

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
aromatics have ever had very strong

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.480 
aromatics have ever had very strong
words<00:01:22.820> but<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:25.079> think<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.979> probably<00:01:26.219> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
words but it's I think it's probably the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.100 
words but it's I think it's probably the
truth<00:01:29.840> it's<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.679> it's<00:01:31.979> flavored

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
truth it's it's but it's it's flavored

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.429 
truth it's it's but it's it's flavored
with<00:01:34.110> vanilla<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.399> vanilla<00:01:35.789> flavoring

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
with vanilla that it's vanilla flavoring

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.880 
with vanilla that it's vanilla flavoring
it's<00:01:37.439> just<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.679> standard<00:01:38.039> Cavendish<00:01:38.520> blend

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
it's just a standard Cavendish blend

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.169 
it's just a standard Cavendish blend
standard<00:01:40.890> aromatic<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.819> those<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
standard aromatic for those of you that

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:51.850

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
the only thing that's kind of catching

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.350 
the only thing that's kind of catching
me<00:02:06.209> off<00:02:06.239> guard<00:02:07.910> which<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.030> don't<00:02:09.090> know<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.269> this

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
me off guard which I don't know if this

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.180 
me off guard which I don't know if this
is<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.509> me<00:02:09.780> or<00:02:09.929> not<00:02:10.019> but<00:02:10.319> I'm<00:02:10.590> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.009> I'm

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
is just me or not but I'm kind of I'm

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.430 
is just me or not but I'm kind of I'm
not<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.640> getting<00:02:12.510> hit<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.870> face<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.170> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
not like getting hit in the face with it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.080 
not like getting hit in the face with it
by<00:02:13.709> sensing<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.519> little<00:02:15.799> chocolate<00:02:16.799> enos<00:02:17.190> maybe

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
by sensing a little chocolate enos maybe

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:29.270 
by sensing a little chocolate enos maybe
maybe<00:02:18.900> I'm<00:02:19.109> just<00:02:19.290> out<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.470> my<00:02:19.590> mind

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.699 

I<00:02:29.370> mean<00:02:30.030> definitely<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:31.010> vanilla<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.190> there

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
I mean definitely the vanilla is there

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.160 
I mean definitely the vanilla is there
but<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.770> thought<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.190> would<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.400> kind<00:02:35.760> of

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
but I thought that I would just kind of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.630 
but I thought that I would just kind of
come<00:02:37.170> out<00:02:37.319> here<00:02:38.300> after<00:02:39.300> work<00:02:40.459> because<00:02:41.459> I'm<00:02:41.610> not

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
come out here after work because I'm not

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.390 
come out here after work because I'm not
at<00:02:41.940> school<00:02:42.030> today<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.620> they<00:02:43.740> had<00:02:43.890> me<00:02:44.040> work<00:02:44.190> for

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
at school today so they had me work for

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.250 
at school today so they had me work for
a<00:02:44.430> guy<00:02:44.550> today<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.739> so<00:02:46.739> uh<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:48.810> got<00:02:48.989> off<00:02:49.080> work

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
a guy today and so uh just got off work

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.020 
a guy today and so uh just got off work
so<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:50.040> figured<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.340> would<00:02:50.459> come<00:02:50.489> out<00:02:50.670> here<00:02:50.910> and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
so I figured I would come out here and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:15.680 
so I figured I would come out here and
uh<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:52.730> chill

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.759 

so<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:17.370> guess<00:03:18.370> that's<00:03:18.519> kind<00:03:18.790> of<00:03:18.819> my<00:03:19.409> my<00:03:20.409> my

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
so I guess that's kind of my my my

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.229 
so I guess that's kind of my my my
review<00:03:21.489> on<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.659> Boswell's<00:03:23.080> best<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.790> very

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
review on the Boswell's best it's a very

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:33.030 
review on the Boswell's best it's a very
very<00:03:26.080> very<00:03:26.500> good<00:03:30.420> very<00:03:31.420> good<00:03:31.890> aromatic<00:03:32.890> blend

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
very very good very good aromatic blend

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.220 
very very good very good aromatic blend
I<00:03:34.739> would<00:03:35.739> say<00:03:36.010> it's<00:03:36.220> classic<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.840> can't<00:03:38.079> get

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
I would say it's classic you can't get

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.319 
I would say it's classic you can't get
much<00:03:38.409> better<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:40.209> can't<00:03:40.480> help<00:03:40.690> do<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:42.329> of

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
much better and you can't help do it of

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.470 
much better and you can't help do it of
course<00:03:43.829> this<00:03:44.829> is<00:03:45.010> my<00:03:45.190> this<00:03:45.640> is<00:03:45.700> my<00:03:45.940> second<00:03:46.329> ball

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
but before I started making this video I

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
something earlier that kind of sparked

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.740 
something earlier that kind of sparked
that<00:04:22.960> I<00:04:24.300> didn't<00:04:25.300> have<00:04:25.389> anything<00:04:25.510> chocolate

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
that I didn't have anything chocolate

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.719 
that I didn't have anything chocolate
earlier<00:04:26.229> but<00:04:27.039> anyways<00:04:27.820> it's<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.360> solid<00:04:28.690> blend<00:04:28.960> I

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
earlier but anyways it's a solid blend I

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.560 
earlier but anyways it's a solid blend I
guess<00:04:30.729> this<00:04:30.910> is<00:04:31.030> technically<00:04:31.360> my<00:04:31.450> first

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570
