00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.920 
y'all won't believe this I just found a
full<00:01:27.229> insulator<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:28.330> can't<00:01:29.330> tell<00:01:29.509> what<00:01:29.690> color

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
full insulator I can't tell what color

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.719 
full insulator I can't tell what color
it<00:01:30.049> is

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
it is

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.240

but you put open a light see right there

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.389 
but you put open a light see right there
insulator<00:01:38.259> so<00:01:39.259> it's<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.310> cool<00:01:40.520> five<00:01:42.340> show<00:01:43.340> you

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
insulator so it's a cool five show you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:02:20.089 
insulator so it's a cool five show you
fine<00:01:43.610> thing<00:01:43.819> else
