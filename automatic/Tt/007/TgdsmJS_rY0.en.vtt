have<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.900> we're<00:01:25.140> not<00:01:25.229> splitting<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
have it and we're not splitting the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.810 
have it and we're not splitting the
team's<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.009> we're<00:01:26.130> not<00:01:26.159> having<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.520> an<00:01:26.610> Xbox

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
team's up we're not having like an Xbox

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
team's up we're not having like an Xbox
division<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> pxe<00:01:27.990> division<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.470> end<00:01:28.619> like

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
division and a pxe division or end like

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.469 
division and a pxe division or end like
that<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.700> gonna<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.880> one<00:01:30.060> big<00:01:30.119> team

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
that and it's just gonna be one big team

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.640 
that and it's just gonna be one big team
and<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.049> probably<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> best<00:01:31.500> way

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and I think that's probably the best way

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.440 
and I think that's probably the best way
to<00:01:31.770> do<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.159> instead<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.880> having<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.150> like

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
to do it and instead of having to like

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.120 
to do it and instead of having to like
like<00:01:34.049> say<00:01:34.170> oh<00:01:34.200> you're<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.590> Miller<00:01:34.740> you're

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
like say oh you're in Miller you're

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.499 
like say oh you're in Miller you're
gonna<00:01:35.250> be<00:01:35.340> an<00:01:35.430> Xbox<00:01:35.850> division<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:36.240> wouldnt<00:01:36.450> be

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
gonna be an Xbox division i wouldnt be

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.850 
gonna be an Xbox division i wouldnt be
in<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> PSC<00:01:37.020> division<00:01:37.350> we're<00:01:37.439> just<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> be

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
in a PSC division we're just going to be

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.340 
in a PSC division we're just going to be
like<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.340> big<00:01:38.490> team<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.689> same<00:01:39.869> way<00:01:39.990> optic

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
like one big team and the same way optic

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
as these days which i think is probably

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.170 
as these days which i think is probably
the<00:01:42.210> best<00:01:42.390> way<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.899> m<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.939> next<00:01:45.119> big

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the best way to do it m and the next big

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.660 
the best way to do it m and the next big
