flathead screwdriver or a torque tool

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.520 
flathead screwdriver or a torque tool
and<00:00:33.130> in<00:00:33.700> this<00:00:33.820> case<00:00:34.030> we're<00:00:34.239> using<00:00:34.390> a<00:00:34.690> size<00:00:35.079> 20

and in this case we're using a size 20

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.360 
and in this case we're using a size 20
torque<00:00:35.890> tool<00:00:36.070> 40<00:00:36.520> 20<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:38.130> the<00:00:39.130> way<00:00:39.250> we're

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
torque tool 40 20 and the way we're

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.970 
torque tool 40 20 and the way we're
going<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.520> do<00:00:39.670> this<00:00:39.850> is<00:00:40.030> you<00:00:40.480> can<00:00:40.510> see<00:00:40.750> that

going to do this is you can see that

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.150 
going to do this is you can see that
there's<00:00:41.980> screws<00:00:42.460> here<00:00:43.000> on<00:00:43.149> the<00:00:43.239> top<00:00:43.450> and<00:00:44.290> you

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
there's screws here on the top and you

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.229 
there's screws here on the top and you
can<00:00:45.190> take<00:00:45.460> this<00:00:45.550> out<00:00:45.700> with<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.879> five<00:00:46.089> head

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
can take this out with the five head

I'm going to go ahead and just use the

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.630 
I'm going to go ahead and just use the
torque<00:00:57.070> tool<00:00:57.219> make<00:00:58.059> it<00:00:58.179> easier<00:00:58.480> on<00:00:58.600> me<00:00:58.780> I<00:00:59.640> find

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
torque tool make it easier on me I find

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:17.860 
torque tool make it easier on me I find
it<00:01:00.730> easier<00:01:01.199> Anderson<00:01:02.199> take<00:01:02.350> these<00:01:02.499> screws<00:01:02.739> out

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:42.109 

also<00:01:18.470> going<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.650> be<00:01:18.740> another<00:01:18.980> one<00:01:20.200> right<00:01:21.200> here

to come out and it has a plug and then

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.179 
to come out and it has a plug and then
we're<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.240> take<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.420> plug<00:01:54.689> out<00:01:55.189> is

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
we're going to take this plug out is

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.959 
we're going to take this plug out is
there's<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.549> tab<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:59.189> we're<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.759> going<00:01:59.909> to

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
there's a tab and we're just going to

one of your screwdrivers either the t30
or<00:02:17.400> your<00:02:17.489> flat<00:02:17.700> tool<00:02:17.940> there's<00:02:18.690> going<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.840> be<00:02:18.900> a

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
or your flat tool there's going to be a

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.740 
or your flat tool there's going to be a
little<00:02:19.140> hole<00:02:19.380> back<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:24.030> we're<00:02:24.599> just

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
little hole back here and we're just

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.039 
little hole back here and we're just
going<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:24.959> push<00:02:25.200> down<00:02:25.230> into<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.799> hole<00:02:26.010> and

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
going to push down into this hole and

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.390 
going to push down into this hole and
you<00:02:28.049> can<00:02:28.170> twist<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:30.829> and<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:31.920> can<00:02:32.069> see<00:02:32.220> now

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
you can twist this and you can see now

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.270 
you can twist this and you can see now
it's<00:02:32.640> going<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.790> come<00:02:32.940> out<00:02:33.950> see<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> way<00:02:35.160> it

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's going to come out see the way it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.319 
it's going to come out see the way it
works<00:02:35.310> right<00:02:36.000> here<00:02:36.269> has<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.170> little<00:02:37.500> tab<00:02:38.329> and

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
works right here has a little tab and

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.530 
works right here has a little tab and
you<00:02:39.420> can<00:02:39.450> push<00:02:39.750> down<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.110> tab<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.819> once<00:02:42.450> you

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
you can push down this tab and once you

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.660 
you can push down this tab and once you
push<00:02:42.720> down<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.019> tab<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:44.190> releases<00:02:44.489> the

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
push down on that tab it releases the

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.599 
push down on that tab it releases the
pressure<00:02:44.819> for<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.329> twist<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.609> that's

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
pressure for you to twist it and that's

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:48.789 
pressure for you to twist it and that's
how<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.940> works

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
how this works

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.720 
how this works
we're<00:02:49.799> going<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.220> start<00:02:50.370> putting<00:02:50.489> everything

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
we're going to start putting everything

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.300 
we're going to start putting everything
back<00:02:50.880> in

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.190 

and<00:02:56.400> that's<00:02:57.209> just<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.569> slide<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.050> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
and that's just going to slide in and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.400 
and that's just going to slide in and
twist<00:02:59.330> now<00:03:00.330> we<00:03:00.420> go<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.720> plug<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:00.990> back<00:03:01.200> in

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
twist now we go and plug this back in

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:11.150 
twist now we go and plug this back in
and<00:03:07.160> it's<00:03:08.160> kind<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.370> tricky<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.860> just<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.100> to

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
and it's kind of tricky you just have to
