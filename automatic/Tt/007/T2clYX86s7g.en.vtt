that's what I've noticed that this one

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.969 
that's what I've noticed that this one
automatically<00:01:24.509> shed<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.140> before<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> even

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
automatically shed you before I even

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.999 
automatically shed you before I even
used<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.580> washed<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> shed<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.380> it's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
used it I washed it in a shed so it's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.310 
used it I washed it in a shed so it's
not<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:31.079> bald

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
not like like it's going bald

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.010 
not like like it's going bald
but<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.770> sheds<00:01:32.400> more<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.210> considerably<00:01:33.810> than

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
but it sheds more so considerably than

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960 
but it sheds more so considerably than
this<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.619> do<00:01:34.950> notice<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.490> there's<00:01:35.729> little

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
this one I do notice that there's little

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.730 
this one I do notice that there's little
frayed<00:01:36.299> ends<00:01:36.869> here

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
frayed ends here

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
frayed ends here
the<00:01:38.009> handle<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.640> one<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.119> better<00:01:39.659> quality

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the handle on this one is better quality

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.140 
the handle on this one is better quality
and<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> ferrule<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.250> better<00:01:41.520> quality<00:01:41.909> than

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and the ferrule is better quality than

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
and the ferrule is better quality than
this<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.840> has<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> shorter<00:01:43.110> handle

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
this one this one has a shorter handle

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.800 
this one this one has a shorter handle
it's<00:01:44.280> definitely<00:01:44.610> plastic<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.720> it's

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
it's definitely plastic and it's

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.530 
it's definitely plastic and it's
definitely<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.229> cheaper<00:01:46.680> ferrule<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.970> think

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
definitely a cheaper ferrule but I think

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.580 
definitely a cheaper ferrule but I think
they<00:01:48.659> both<00:01:48.899> work<00:01:49.229> equally<00:01:49.710> actually<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:51.590> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
they both work equally actually like the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.830 
they both work equally actually like the
spread<00:01:53.430> how<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.850> spreads<00:01:54.210> out<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> little<00:01:54.720> bit

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
spread how this spreads out a little bit

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.630 
spread how this spreads out a little bit

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
than this one but I noticed that this

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.640 
than this one but I noticed that this
one<00:02:21.820> absolutely<00:02:22.210> better<00:02:22.990> for<00:02:23.230> contouring

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
one absolutely better for contouring

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.410 
one absolutely better for contouring
this<00:02:23.860> one<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.280> highlighter<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.000> blending

this one for highlighter and blending
out<00:02:25.570> things<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.290> maybe<00:02:26.440> as<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.680> finishing

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
out things and maybe as a finishing

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.490 
out things and maybe as a finishing
brush<00:02:27.430> or<00:02:27.850> wiping<00:02:28.360> off<00:02:28.510> powder<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:29.020> really

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
brush or wiping off powder it's really

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.500

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
think I'll need another fan brush I'll

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.490 
think I'll need another fan brush I'll
probably<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.270> buy<00:02:37.390> another<00:02:37.420> one<00:02:37.780> off<00:02:38.020> eBay

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.680 
probably just buy another one off eBay
they're<00:02:39.280> pretty<00:02:39.730> much<00:02:39.880> they're<00:02:40.120> not<00:02:40.330> so<00:02:40.630> much

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
they're pretty much they're not so much

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.710 
they're pretty much they're not so much
of<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.140> difference<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:42.220> say<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.940> wanted<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.450> get

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
of a difference to say I wanted to get

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.930 
of a difference to say I wanted to get
this<00:02:43.960> one<00:02:44.260> or<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.920> one<00:02:44.980> if<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.520> like<00:02:45.730> a

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
this one or this one if you like a

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.480 
this one or this one if you like a
heftier<00:02:46.870> handle<00:02:47.410> if<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.070> longer

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
heftier handle if you like a longer

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.570 
heftier handle if you like a longer
handle<00:02:48.700> this<00:02:49.000> one's<00:02:49.270> better<00:02:50.110> if<00:02:51.100> you<00:02:51.310> like<00:02:51.550> a

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
handle this one's better if you like a

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.720 
handle this one's better if you like a
more<00:02:51.880> flared<00:02:52.300> out<00:02:52.830> fan<00:02:53.830> here<00:02:54.100> that's<00:02:54.400> fine

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
more flared out fan here that's fine

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.490 
more flared out fan here that's fine
that<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.390> one<00:02:55.600> might<00:02:55.780> be<00:02:55.810> more<00:02:56.140> for<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.380> and

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
that this one might be more for you and

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.440 
that this one might be more for you and
especially<00:02:56.920> if<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.280> just<00:02:57.490> like<00:02:57.670> Sedona<00:02:58.090> and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
especially if you just like Sedona and

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.540 
especially if you just like Sedona and
Sedona<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.200> great<00:02:59.470> they're<00:02:59.710> not<00:03:00.010> expensive

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
Sedona is great they're not expensive

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.500 
Sedona is great they're not expensive
and<00:03:01.000> they<00:03:01.360> do<00:03:01.420> have<00:03:01.930> sales<00:03:02.710> more<00:03:03.640> often<00:03:04.180> than

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
and they do have sales more often than

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.750 
and they do have sales more often than
definitely<00:03:05.290> Sigma<00:03:05.740> so<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:05.950> really<00:03:06.400> do<00:03:06.550> like

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
definitely Sigma so I really do like

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.640 
definitely Sigma so I really do like
that<00:03:06.790> Sedona<00:03:07.300> does<00:03:07.540> have<00:03:07.750> sales<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.320> they<00:03:08.380> in

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
that Sedona does have sales and they in

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.290 
that Sedona does have sales and they in
the<00:03:08.800> price<00:03:09.010> point<00:03:09.400> even<00:03:09.640> without<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.940> sales

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
the price point even without the sales

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.500 
the price point even without the sales
is<00:03:10.540> very<00:03:11.530> reasonable<00:03:12.160> they<00:03:12.610> also<00:03:12.790> have<00:03:13.180> tons

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
is very reasonable they also have tons

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.830 
is very reasonable they also have tons
of<00:03:13.980> coupon<00:03:14.980> codes<00:03:15.280> from<00:03:15.670> other<00:03:15.910> people<00:03:16.600> who
