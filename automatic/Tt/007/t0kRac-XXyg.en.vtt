00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
music is such a huge part of our world

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.960 
music is such a huge part of our world
just<00:00:04.080> as<00:00:04.230> much<00:00:04.410> as<00:00:04.560> fashion<00:00:04.980> is<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.759> two

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
just as much as fashion is and the two

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.210 
just as much as fashion is and the two
of<00:00:06.120> them<00:00:06.150> are<00:00:06.720> hand-in-hand<00:00:07.350> you<00:00:07.830> can't<00:00:08.069> have

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
of them are hand-in-hand you can't have

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.560 
of them are hand-in-hand you can't have
one<00:00:08.400> without<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.790> other<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.210> think<00:00:09.420> that's

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
one without the other and I think that's

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.209 
one without the other and I think that's
why<00:00:09.750> festival<00:00:10.170> fashion<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.620> becoming<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.190> big

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
why festival fashion is becoming so big

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.910 
why festival fashion is becoming so big
because<00:00:11.820> as<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.660> festival's<00:00:13.170> grow<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.769> more

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
because as the festival's grow and more

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.980 
because as the festival's grow and more
people<00:00:14.070> come<00:00:14.429> it's<00:00:15.089> important<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.750> kind<00:00:15.929> of

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
people come it's important to kind of

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.870 
people come it's important to kind of
portray<00:00:16.470> yourself<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.369> way<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.699> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880

want to be seen and I think that has a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.019
