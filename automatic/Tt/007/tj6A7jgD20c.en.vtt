all<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.849> also<00:02:11.879> has<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> headphone

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
all and it also has a headphone

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.440 
all and it also has a headphone
output<00:02:13.260> for<00:02:13.440> silent<00:02:13.860> listening<00:02:14.280> finally<00:02:15.269> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
output for silent listening finally the

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.539 
output for silent listening finally the
power<00:02:15.659> consumption<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.650> one<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.220> energy

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
power consumption on this one the energy

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.089 
power consumption on this one the energy
efficiency<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.569> plus<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.590> very<00:02:19.860> very

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
efficiency is a plus so very very

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.430 
efficiency is a plus so very very
efficient<00:02:20.640> indeed<00:02:21.030> like<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> demonstration

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
efficient indeed like a demonstration

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.740 
efficient indeed like a demonstration
you<00:02:22.739> can<00:02:22.890> visit<00:02:23.190> one<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.340> our<00:02:23.519> stores<00:02:23.940> or<00:02:24.239> you
