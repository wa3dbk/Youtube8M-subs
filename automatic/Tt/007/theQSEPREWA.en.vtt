00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello guys and girls the max and me 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.020
 'm that kind of mill today that' s the one 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.490
 madness and all my times 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.740
 Subscribers who go to school and 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.750
 say hey maxi or school is always there 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.559
 so boring you have to be there so many 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.330
 listen to things 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.049
 which you do not need anymore today 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.670
 and one not at all 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.070
 interested and totally stupid 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.160
 are now the good news for you 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.810
 that will not be better then later 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.369
 Although there is no training there 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.769
 Although no more school 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.189
 there is something like meetings for that 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.520
 for example a very grandiose 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.780
 Invention of the meeting, as I said 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.340
 You do not have to hope 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.660
 make it somehow beside the form 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 gets better or something else in the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.430
 It will not be that way again 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.010
 someone very nice thing to do with it then 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.410
 invited to any topic with what 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 you maybe directly or just 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.520
 kinda takes away a little something 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.370
 there has to sit there then no idea 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.440
 it times ten people to be half 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.090
 people who are just simply because the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.489
 do not really know why 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.850
 but they would be present then 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.560
 then so beautiful so beautiful how shall I 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.799
 say so dutiful event made 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.360
 like a must write a log 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.189
 must read protocol 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.130
 Of course, none of that 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.689
 Obviously, of course, Bock has, of course, if 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.759
 then something is back then you know 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.409
 even what you get involved with and 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.270
 in some cases, I ask myself 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.479
 seriously why because for everyone 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.460
 fucking without a mist a meeting a call 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.680
 really have everything so after 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.579
 motto oh this button is missing 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.710
 blank 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.829
 We could put the blank there now 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.360
 Alternatively, we could as well 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.659
 before you somehow you stay microphone 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.790
 alternatively we could also before 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.740
 Now we just put the blank in the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.979
 could make button purely synonymous first time 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.299
 to hold in the meeting to discuss 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.549
 which one is the blank 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.390
 now exactly and how wide and how high 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.189
 towards 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.780
 and after he realized that 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.920
 Of course we will be there first 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.439
 watch if for a predefined 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.750
 have the workflow then really 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.520
 is ready for inserting a 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.170
 Blank in a button without 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.239
 blank maybe have synonymous but synonymous 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.069
 bad luck and have only in workflows for that 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.599
 insert 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.459
 blank button of an already 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.349
 blank third then you have to 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.859
 Of course first the workflow change 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.420
 workflow abut and at the end you have 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.249
 the possibility in this one button 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.689
 of course, a blank will be added 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.030
 That was only a fictional example 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.609
 and if you did that and 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.139
 the land is going through different 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.609
 development stages was tested whether 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.739
 because this blank in the button 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.599
 not the complete user 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.840
 experience with this program destroyed 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.340
 one is so far the button pulls now 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.099
 better selection blank has 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.159
 However, who thinks now is the whole 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.780
 finished far missing that it will be a long time 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.879
 not finished because after that 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.189
 Blank has inserted into the button 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.959
 Of course you have one more 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.949
 to hold retrospective 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.419
 that is very important a retrospective 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:01.189
 hold where all the people at the 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.810
 decision how to do this 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:05.629
 Blank inserts the button 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.579
 were again to give her feedback 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.079
 of course the whole great people 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.609
 which adapted the whole workflow and 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.010
 have recreated and then will 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.949
 discussed what went wrong 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.540
 something in the current debate 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:20.120
 can we improve in the future? 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.500
 at blank insert the button what 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.180
 Can we do that? 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.829
 blank the button insert the 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.629
 next time is not necessary 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.139
 and such great things are there 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.509
 discussed 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.280
 that will take a few hours 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:32.540
 and at some point you are done 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.090
 Of course you have the last one 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.859
 five days did nothing but me 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.930
 over a crappy blank 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.470
 to think in a button like that 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.879
 or something like that was depending on the knew 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.590
 we what that always depends on where you are 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.379
 lands that was of course now 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.040
 a bit exaggerated but in the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.609
 principle, it is indeed so 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.329
 you do not realize that now either 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.269
 blandish 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.479
 In my opinion, it just becomes a lot 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.919
 too much rented with people the no 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.780
 have a clue why it is actually there 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.569
 whatever is very nice in such 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.579
 Sometimes meetings could end up 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.610
 or at the beginning depending on this 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.530
 history with someone else has one 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.900
 someone else wants to say something 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.770
 then there are some points 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.190
 all around me 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.480
 the first starts, it has not put 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.010
 I have nothing I have too 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.200
 nothing I have nothing but not 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.780
 ran says then I do not want that and so 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.000
 then you are at the last at the last 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.380
 year and that goes, then it starts for you 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.840
 I thought shit we are 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.030
 away there it starts then there will be 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.650
 is then told yes here and there and if 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.630
 the user clicks on it then comes 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.580
 pop abo that is very bad 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.800
 and if that time then rain 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.720
 everyone comes up when both pop up comes 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.230
 and then tell her first time 20 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.220
 minutes 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.440
 and if you ask, okay and what 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.970
 should one do something now ? 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.169
 you are that bad now how alas 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.580
 nonsense that's not bad I wanted 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.240
 it's only for your information 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.400
 pass on 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.430
 I think it's good that you give me that 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.600
 said yes, this is how it works 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.820
 more often so who somehow the illusion 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.390
 that will be better after school 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.770
 you choose a profession like me and 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.900
 then ends up in the right company 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.850
 then that's just meetings in itself 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.770
 is simple is she is bad 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.340
 just as bad as bad 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.320
 want to do 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.690
 that is before defined processes for 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.900
 Special things live to a certain extent 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.820
 that too is a sensible occasion 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.100
 absolutely okay really problematic 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.770
 Of course, he will know, of course 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.950
 you still really complete 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.410
 Teams has groups for nothing 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.660
 take care of other and accordingly 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.330
 they also have to prove that they are there 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.460
 are correct and then things to the 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.590
 hair are dragged in 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.370
 according to the motto all workflows allowed 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.200
 only in the two in four eyes principle 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.610
 done so but there is also one 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.200
 variation factory or must then also 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.820
 done in the four-eye principle 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.460
 and if one changes with the other 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.410
 work flew workflow definition change 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.850
 then it gets quite complicated and 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.330
 something in the direction then it's real 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.990
 bad 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.720
 and at the latest when you rent more and 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.570
 sticking to workflows workflows 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.620
 Created and blank buttons 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.770
 Thought must do more than work 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.010
 or who make meaningful things 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.210
 then the point has come where you say 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.830
 Actually , I do not give a damn 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.419
 and this point is fortunate for me 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.550
 not reached yet i hope not 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.250
 that it happens but some days 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:37.440
 I think I'm really somehow I 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:39.030
 By the way, just people are yes 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.500
 it's similar, it really can 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.850
 like to write the comments 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.040
 I'm interested if I still have some 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.360
 suffer enjoyed you have the also 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.880
 always looking forward to it 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.810
 again madly rented sensibly 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.919
 to all insanely meaningful topics 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.889
 I could not care me really 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:58.490
 we skip it well for a long time 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.490
 next matches
