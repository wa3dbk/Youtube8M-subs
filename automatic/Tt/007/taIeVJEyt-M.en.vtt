 a little bit here something is twitching blocks but 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.050
 it's nothing about asphalt 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.810
 because its stiffness is simple 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.780

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.380
 There is no reason to mods and appearing and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.200

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.000
 all the same it is a mega cool mechanism 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.600
 everything is done command blocks and on 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.140
 mastery of dudes who came up with it 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.610

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.660

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.520

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.590
 blocks of all sorts of damn horror command blocks 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.120
 it's all necessary to prescribe everything you need to do 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.930
 it's terrible how much 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.430

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.020

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.470
