this<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:40.980> called<00:02:41.190> different<00:02:41.430> things

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
this is called different things

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.430 
this is called different things
different<00:02:41.700> pictures<00:02:42.150> but<00:02:42.840> they<00:02:43.050> all<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.320> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
different pictures but they all do the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.640 
different pictures but they all do the
same<00:02:43.470> things<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.250> all<00:02:44.400> characters<00:02:45.650> any

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
same things for all characters any

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.870 
same things for all characters any
confusion<00:02:47.220> him<00:02:47.310> up<00:02:47.430> as<00:02:47.580> well

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
confusion him up as well

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.990 
confusion him up as well
a<00:02:47.910> fusion<00:02:48.300> up<00:02:49.100> some<00:02:50.100> of<00:02:50.190> them<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.700> think<00:02:50.820> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
a fusion up some of them and I think the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.120 
a fusion up some of them and I think the
motion<00:02:51.180> gap<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.870> 15<00:02:52.260> percent<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:52.860> there<00:02:53.010> is<00:02:53.100> a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
motion gap is 15 percent so there is a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.830 
motion gap is 15 percent so there is a
limit<00:02:53.340> at<00:02:53.550> how<00:02:53.670> many<00:02:53.790> times<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.180> infusion

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
limit at how many times you can infusion

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.390 
limit at how many times you can infusion
them<00:02:54.960> just<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.350> do<00:02:55.590> know<00:02:55.770> dudes<00:02:58.400> is
