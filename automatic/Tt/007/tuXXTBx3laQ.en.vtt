whatever so look at the turbidity of the
McFarland<00:00:43.079> standard<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.739> will<00:00:43.920> give<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.190> an

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
McFarland standard this will give you an

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.040 
McFarland standard this will give you an
estimate<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.820> how<00:00:45.660> many<00:00:45.719> cells<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.379> have

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
estimate as to how many cells you have

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.389 
estimate as to how many cells you have
so<00:00:49.050> you're<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> add<00:00:49.559> your<00:00:49.739> cells<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
so you're going to add your cells to a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.369 
so you're going to add your cells to a
dispersing<00:00:51.059> medium<00:00:51.420> first<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> open

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
dispersing medium first you have to open

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
dispersing medium first you have to open
up<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.890> capsule<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:56.000> then<00:00:57.000> you're<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
up the capsule and then you're going to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.430 
up the capsule and then you're going to
add<00:00:57.660> bacteria<00:00:58.699> from<00:00:59.699> your<00:01:00.030> plates<00:01:00.629> directly

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
add bacteria from your plates directly

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.539 
add bacteria from your plates directly
to<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.890> dispersing<00:01:02.640> media<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:05.010> take<00:01:05.280> several

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
to that dispersing media so take several

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.730 
to that dispersing media so take several
colonies<00:01:07.729> add<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.689> dispersing<00:01:10.350> media

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
colonies add it to your dispersing media

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.429 
colonies add it to your dispersing media
and<00:01:11.040> then<00:01:11.820> check<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.270> density<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.110> media

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and then check the density of the media

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.179 
and then check the density of the media
and<00:01:14.100> compare<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.610> density<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:16.189> your

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and compare that density to your

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.010 
and compare that density to your
McFarland<00:01:17.850> standard<00:01:20.210> these<00:01:21.210> look<00:01:21.750> pretty

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
McFarland standard these look pretty

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.940 
McFarland standard these look pretty
close<00:01:22.290> bill<00:01:22.740> did<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.009> pretty<00:01:23.159> good<00:01:23.310> job<00:01:23.369> here

then<00:01:25.950> you're<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> add<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
then you're going to add this to the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.870 
then you're going to add this to the
little<00:01:27.840> test<00:01:28.110> tubes<00:01:28.490> which<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.640> called

medium<00:02:41.810> mix<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.960> around<00:02:43.230> quite<00:02:43.590> well<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.160> it's

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
medium mix it around quite well so it's

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.900 
medium mix it around quite well so it's
homogeneous<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:46.040> then<00:02:47.040> you're<00:02:47.190> going<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.640> add

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
homogeneous and then you're going to add

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.790 
homogeneous and then you're going to add
that<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.800> remaining<00:02:50.160> couples

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.910 

and<00:02:56.120> determine<00:02:57.120> whether<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.750> have

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
and determine whether you have

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.860 
and determine whether you have
fermentation<00:02:59.030> so<00:03:00.030> notice<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.600> dye<00:03:00.810> is

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
fermentation so notice that the dye is

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.730 
fermentation so notice that the dye is
red<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:02.100> red<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:03.810> red<00:03:03.990> dye<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.470> will

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
red it's red it's a red dye that will

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.100 
red it's red it's a red dye that will
turn<00:03:05.070> change<00:03:05.490> color<00:03:05.790> with<00:03:06.000> pH<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:06.630> if<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.930> have

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
turn change color with pH so if you have

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.250 
turn change color with pH so if you have
fermentation<00:03:07.800> recall<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.780> get<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.960> drop

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
fermentation recall that you get a drop

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.190 
fermentation recall that you get a drop
in<00:03:10.440> pH<00:03:10.860> and<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.190> pH<00:03:11.550> drop<00:03:11.880> will<00:03:12.600> be<00:03:12.630> seen<00:03:12.990> as<00:03:13.170> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
in pH and that pH drop will be seen as a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.060 
in pH and that pH drop will be seen as a
color<00:03:13.620> change<00:03:14.010> from<00:03:14.160> red<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:15.870> orange<00:03:16.070> to

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
color change from red to orange to

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.810 
color change from red to orange to
yellow

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
yellow

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.290 
yellow
so<00:03:18.600> there's<00:03:18.960> ribose<00:03:19.470> arabinose<00:03:20.040> mono<00:03:20.520> sucrose

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
so there's ribose arabinose mono sucrose

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.410 
so there's ribose arabinose mono sucrose
and<00:03:21.660> lactose<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:23.370> need<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.640> be<00:03:23.760> very<00:03:23.970> careful

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
and lactose you need to be very careful

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.230 
and lactose you need to be very careful
to<00:03:24.450> avoid<00:03:24.990> air<00:03:25.350> bubbles<00:03:25.770> you<00:03:25.950> see<00:03:26.610> how<00:03:26.760> as<00:03:26.910> easy

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
to avoid air bubbles you see how as easy

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.260 
to avoid air bubbles you see how as easy
it<00:03:27.570> is<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:28.080> get<00:03:28.440> air<00:03:28.560> bubbles<00:03:28.740> in<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.640> cup

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
it is to get air bubbles in the cup

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.620 
it is to get air bubbles in the cup
you'll<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.620> if<00:03:32.550> we<00:03:32.850> don't<00:03:33.030> get<00:03:33.270> that<00:03:33.450> air

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
you'll so if we don't get that air

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.160 
you'll so if we don't get that air
bubble<00:03:33.810> out<00:03:34.110> we<00:03:34.950> may<00:03:35.160> have<00:03:35.370> too<00:03:35.670> much<00:03:35.820> oxygen

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
bubble out we may have too much oxygen

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.400 
bubble out we may have too much oxygen
to<00:03:37.170> see<00:03:37.410> good<00:03:37.620> fermentation<00:03:39.410> there's

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
to see good fermentation there's

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.940 
to see good fermentation there's
trehalose<00:03:41.160> inulin<00:03:42.530> continuing<00:03:43.530> on<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.920> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
trehalose inulin continuing on to the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.180 
trehalose inulin continuing on to the
end<00:03:44.960> raffinose<00:03:45.960> and<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:48.060> last<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:49.070> then<00:03:50.070> we

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
end raffinose and the last so then we

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.430 
end raffinose and the last so then we
want<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.460> get<00:03:50.550> our<00:03:50.670> mineral<00:03:51.030> after<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:51.930> and

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.580 

cover<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:57.090> mineral<00:03:57.510> oil<00:03:57.750> actually

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
cover it the mineral oil actually

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.740 
cover it the mineral oil actually
prevents<00:03:59.220> the<00:04:00.290> rapid<00:04:01.290> exchange<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.860> oxygen

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
prevents the rapid exchange of oxygen

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.530 
prevents the rapid exchange of oxygen
with<00:04:03.750> your<00:04:03.959> media<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.650> begin<00:04:05.010> with

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
with your media and so you begin with

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.770 
with your media and so you begin with
the<00:04:06.540> ADH<00:04:07.050> in<00:04:07.380> this<00:04:07.530> case<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:08.130> you<00:04:08.940> do<00:04:09.120> have

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
the ADH in this case you you do have

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.680 
the ADH in this case you you do have
that<00:04:10.020> anaerobic<00:04:10.680> as<00:04:10.830> well<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.370> then<00:04:11.970> each<00:04:12.450> of

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
that anaerobic as well and then each of

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.039 
that anaerobic as well and then each of
the<00:04:12.810> sugars<00:04:15.350> and<00:04:17.120> notice<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:18.540> instance

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
the sugars and notice in this instance

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.620 
the sugars and notice in this instance
that<00:04:19.169> some<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.549> bubbles<00:04:20.880> in<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.120> lactose

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
way out to left and then you're going to

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.140 
way out to left and then you're going to
want<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.640> cover<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.450> then<00:04:33.540> incubate<00:04:33.990> it
