and I know some of you guys didn't want

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.549 
and I know some of you guys didn't want
me<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.030> wait<00:00:12.269> until<00:00:12.599> December<00:00:12.719> like<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.259> said<00:00:13.469> in

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
me to wait until December like I said in

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.740 
me to wait until December like I said in
my<00:00:13.740> last<00:00:14.160> video<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.179> thought<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.570> would<00:00:15.719> just

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
my last video so I thought I would just

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.870 
my last video so I thought I would just
do<00:00:15.960> Katherine's<00:00:16.410> because<00:00:16.740> hers<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.250> kind<00:00:17.820> of

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
do Katherine's because hers is kind of

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.970 
do Katherine's because hers is kind of
like<00:00:18.029> Elena's<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.690> feel<00:00:18.840> like<00:00:19.020> except<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
like Elena's I feel like except just a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.140 
like Elena's I feel like except just a
little<00:00:20.189> bit<00:00:20.310> darker<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.850> little<00:00:20.939> bit

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
little bit darker and a little bit

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.269 
little bit darker and a little bit
edgier<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> figured<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.650> might<00:00:22.800> as<00:00:22.859> well<00:00:23.039> tie

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
edgier so I figured I might as well tie

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.340 
edgier so I figured I might as well tie
it<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.670> too<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.300> case<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.840> don't<00:00:25.289> know

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
