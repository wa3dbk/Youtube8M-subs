00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
to show I see if this thing see if this

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.290 
to show I see if this thing see if this
is<00:01:44.100> possible<00:01:46.340> there's<00:01:47.340> any<00:01:47.550> developers<00:01:48.150> out

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
is possible there's any developers out

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.820 
is possible there's any developers out
there<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.660> think<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.080> is<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.290> way<00:01:49.560> that

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
there to think that this is a way that

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.389 
there to think that this is a way that
we<00:01:49.950> can<00:01:50.130> get<00:01:50.910> emulation<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.869> our<00:01:52.740> devices<00:01:53.070> this

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
we can get emulation on our devices this

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.010 
we can get emulation on our devices this
would<00:01:53.550> be<00:01:53.670> great<00:01:59.270> the<00:02:00.270> direction<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.810> keys

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
would be great the direction of keys

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.700 
would be great the direction of keys
work<00:02:02.540> I've<00:02:03.540> noticed<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.050> directional<00:02:04.560> keys

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
work I've noticed the directional keys

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.850 
work I've noticed the directional keys
work<00:02:05.039> in<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:06.149> course<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.569> analog<00:02:06.929> sticks

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
work in this of course the analog sticks

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.969 
work in this of course the analog sticks
don't<00:02:08.100> work<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.259> buttons<00:02:10.679> don't<00:02:10.920> work

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
either if the buttons did work I would

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:56.490
