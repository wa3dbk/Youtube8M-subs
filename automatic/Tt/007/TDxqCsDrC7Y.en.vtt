00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
using and put an e on a lot of time due

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.270 
using and put an e on a lot of time due
to<00:00:45.570> cheese<00:00:45.960> out<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.320> use<00:00:46.500> hand<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.860> lot<00:00:47.039> unless

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
to cheese out you use hand a lot unless

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.240 
to cheese out you use hand a lot unless
on<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.180> leg<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> whole<00:00:49.289> idea<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.800> Chi<00:00:50.039> sau

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
on the leg but the whole idea of Chi sau

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.910 
on the leg but the whole idea of Chi sau
is<00:00:50.309> controlling<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.270> upper<00:00:52.260> body<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.800> you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
is controlling this upper body and you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.549 
is controlling this upper body and you
can<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.250> whatever<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.030> need<00:00:54.110> underneath<00:00:55.110> the

that's why later on po quest will be

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.380 
that's why later on po quest will be
have<00:00:58.680> some<00:00:58.890> sticky<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.430> as<00:00:59.670> well<00:00:59.910> and

you how to do that they bought you taro

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.240 
you how to do that they bought you taro
now<00:01:16.080> when<00:01:16.320> you're<00:01:16.439> training<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.009> sort

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
now when you're training with this sort

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.800 
now when you're training with this sort
of<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:19.110> thing<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.189> fire<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.939> okay<00:01:21.570> so

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
of a thing we have the fire on okay so

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.010 
of a thing we have the fire on okay so
they<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:23.240> actually<00:01:24.240> into<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> close

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
they can it's actually into the close

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
they can it's actually into the close
range<00:01:25.380> something<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.700> put<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
range something like this to put the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.590 
range something like this to put the
knee<00:01:27.180> on

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
knee on

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.719 
knee on
yeah<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.770> easier<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.430> put<00:01:29.610> some

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
yeah it's not that easier to put some

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.510 
yeah it's not that easier to put some
power<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.600> when<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> training<00:01:31.530> form<00:01:32.369> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
power on so when the training form to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.100 
power on so when the training form to
the<00:01:32.610> G<00:01:32.790> sound<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.240> instant<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.869> do<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the G sound for instant like we do the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.810 
the G sound for instant like we do the
two<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.470> inside<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:35.070> okay

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
two and inside here okay

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.179 
two and inside here okay
for<00:01:36.150> instance<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.810> not<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.110> easy<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
for instance it's not that easy to to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.399 
for instance it's not that easy to to
basically<00:01:38.479> control<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.750> put<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> knee<00:01:40.110> another

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
basically control and put a knee another

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.310 
basically control and put a knee another
okay<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.700> movement<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.079> got<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
okay it's that movement so you got to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.080 
okay it's that movement so you got to
make<00:01:43.470> sure<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.710> understand<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:44.850> thing

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
make sure you understand so much thing

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.760 
make sure you understand so much thing

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
happening when I need he put a knee up

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.590 
happening when I need he put a knee up
for<00:01:46.979> me<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:47.579> when<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.119> need<00:01:48.329> again

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
for me and that's when to need again

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.740 
for me and that's when to need again
boom<00:01:49.110> before<00:01:50.009> me<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.460> got<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> problem

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
boom before me I got a problem

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
so this is a real problem here when

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.389 
so this is a real problem here when
you're<00:01:55.320> training<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:56.189> need<00:01:56.340> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
you're training you need to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.700 
you're training you need to
understanding<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.509> thank-yous<00:01:58.049> behind

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
understanding that the thank-yous behind

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.760 
understanding that the thank-yous behind
notice<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.640> when<00:02:00.030> I'm<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.570> yeah<00:02:00.869> if<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.560> go

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
notice now when I'm here yeah if I go

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.319 
notice now when I'm here yeah if I go
right<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.430> pull<00:02:02.670> him<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.030> then<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.210> go

with a hand we have all this hand
movement<00:04:38.270> slowly<00:04:39.270> coming<00:04:39.689> up<00:04:39.960> don't<00:04:40.620> need<00:04:41.009> to

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
movement slowly coming up don't need to

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:43.189 
movement slowly coming up don't need to
rush<00:04:41.400> in<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:41.759> if<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.330> do<00:04:42.509> is<00:04:42.689> life<00:04:42.870> you<00:04:43.080> know

so<00:07:34.950> all<00:07:35.160> this<00:07:35.340> training<00:07:35.700> you<00:07:36.210> need<00:07:36.390> to

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:36.480 
so all this training you need to

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.170 
so all this training you need to
experience<00:07:36.840> this<00:07:37.080> what<00:07:37.800> is<00:07:38.010> the<00:07:38.220> problem

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 
experience this what is the problem

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.720 
experience this what is the problem
there<00:07:39.660> so<00:07:39.870> you<00:07:40.170> identify<00:07:40.260> the<00:07:40.800> problem<00:07:41.010> then

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:41.730 
there so you identify the problem then

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.430 
there so you identify the problem then
you<00:07:41.850> can<00:07:41.880> understand<00:07:42.240> how<00:07:42.420> to<00:07:42.480> fix<00:07:42.810> them<00:07:42.990> avoid

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 
you can understand how to fix them avoid

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.950 
you can understand how to fix them avoid
them<00:07:43.710> spend<00:07:44.460> a<00:07:44.490> little<00:07:44.580> time<00:07:44.820> practice<00:07:45.270> I<00:07:45.480> see
