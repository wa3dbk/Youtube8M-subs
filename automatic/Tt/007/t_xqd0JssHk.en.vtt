00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
hence the blue fusion devices locked

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.869 
hence the blue fusion devices locked

how to change the code we were to remove
the<00:00:53.160> keepers<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.910> wouldn't<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.199> that

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610

I<00:03:23.040> was<00:03:23.580> thinking<00:03:23.910> about<00:03:24.030> firing<00:03:24.330> up<00:03:24.540> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
I was thinking about firing up the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.260 
I was thinking about firing up the
reactors<00:03:25.850> good<00:03:26.850> one

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
reactors good one

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.270 
reactors good one
even<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.840> seraphic<00:03:28.140> adex<00:03:28.620> guys<00:03:28.860> say<00:03:29.160> the

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
even the seraphic adex guys say the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.250 
even the seraphic adex guys say the
reactions<00:03:29.730> too<00:03:29.850> unstable<00:03:30.120> they<00:03:30.900> only<00:03:31.020> bring

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
reactions too unstable they only bring

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.340 
reactions too unstable they only bring
it<00:03:31.380> up<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.590> run<00:03:31.710> tests<00:03:32.160> alien<00:03:33.120> technology<00:03:33.690> and

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
it up to run tests alien technology and

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.900 
it up to run tests alien technology and
that's<00:03:34.560> what<00:03:34.740> they<00:03:34.860> say<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.430> think<00:03:35.490> it's<00:03:35.820> a

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
that's what they say but I think it's a

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.930 
that's what they say but I think it's a
lie<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.930> greys<00:03:37.170> are<00:03:37.380> just<00:03:37.560> clones<00:03:37.800> they<00:03:38.580> say

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
lie the greys are just clones they say

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.880 
lie the greys are just clones they say
from<00:03:39.180> cells<00:03:39.480> they<00:03:39.630> got<00:03:39.780> at<00:03:39.930> Roswell<00:03:40.410> but<00:03:40.740> how

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
from cells they got at Roswell but how

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.320 
from cells they got at Roswell but how
do<00:03:40.950> we<00:03:41.040> know<00:03:41.280> they<00:03:42.060> could<00:03:42.209> have<00:03:42.300> just

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
do we know they could have just

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.210 
do we know they could have just
engineered<00:03:42.930> monkeys<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.560> not<00:03:43.680> have<00:03:43.830> any<00:03:43.980> hair

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
engineered monkeys to not have any hair

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.150 
engineered monkeys to not have any hair
can<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.120> greys<00:03:45.360> run<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.780> reactors<00:03:46.230> huh

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
can the greys run the reactors huh

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.180 
can the greys run the reactors huh
they're<00:03:47.670> monkeys<00:03:48.120> that's<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.200> thing<00:03:49.440> maybe

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
they're monkeys that's the thing maybe

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.920 
they're monkeys that's the thing maybe
they<00:03:50.400> have<00:03:50.580> super<00:03:50.940> brains<00:03:51.240> but<00:03:51.660> they<00:03:51.750> don't

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
they have super brains but they don't

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.240 
they have super brains but they don't
know<00:03:52.020> anything<00:03:52.440> about<00:03:52.530> any<00:03:52.800> alien

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
know anything about any alien

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.860 
know anything about any alien
civilization<00:03:53.970> because<00:03:54.240> they<00:03:54.360> grew<00:03:54.570> up<00:03:54.600> in

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
civilization because they grew up in

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.010 
civilization because they grew up in
cages<00:03:55.380> never<00:03:56.250> been<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.610> sector<00:03:56.910> 4<00:03:57.030> myself<00:03:57.480> but

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
cages never been to sector 4 myself but

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.300 
cages never been to sector 4 myself but
they<00:03:58.140> locked<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.530> blast<00:03:58.770> doors<00:03:59.040> because

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
they locked the blast doors because

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.470 
they locked the blast doors because
they're<00:03:59.459> doing<00:03:59.670> more<00:03:59.820> than<00:03:59.970> cloning<00:04:00.360> down

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
they're doing more than cloning down

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.630 
they're doing more than cloning down
there<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.840> found<00:04:01.709> out<00:04:01.860> one<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.160> codes

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
there I found out one of the codes

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.760 
there I found out one of the codes
10:38<00:04:03.390> but<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.050> turned<00:04:04.290> out<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.470> be<00:04:04.560> for<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
10:38 but that turned out to be for the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.520 
10:38 but that turned out to be for the
akina's<00:04:05.160> hub<00:04:05.340> here<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:05.820> Sector<00:04:06.120> 3<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.630> don't

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
akina's hub here in Sector 3 I don't

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.710 
akina's hub here in Sector 3 I don't
know<00:04:07.680> maybe<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.640> akina's<00:04:09.090> system<00:04:09.390> controls

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
know maybe the akina's system controls

00:04:09.720 --> 00:05:37.440 
know maybe the akina's system controls
access<00:04:09.930> but<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.530> haven't<00:04:10.769> figured<00:04:10.980> out<00:04:11.160> how<00:04:11.310> yet

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.570 

we<00:05:37.960> go<00:05:38.140> to<00:05:38.350> scepter<00:05:38.620> 4<00:05:38.830> and<00:05:39.100> you<00:05:39.220> have<00:05:39.310> to<00:05:39.490> be

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
we go to scepter 4 and you have to be

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.760 
we go to scepter 4 and you have to be
given<00:05:40.060> points

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
given points

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.350 
given points
then<00:05:42.250> you<00:05:42.400> will<00:05:42.490> come<00:05:42.699> back<00:05:42.880> and<00:05:43.240> you

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
then you will come back and you

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.140 
then you will come back and you
integrate<00:05:43.750> our<00:05:44.139> systems<00:05:44.169> I<00:05:44.889> don't<00:05:45.699> understand

integrate our systems I don't understand

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.749 
integrate our systems I don't understand
what<00:05:46.780> you<00:05:46.900> want<00:05:47.110> or<00:05:47.860> just<00:05:47.889> a<00:05:48.099> machine

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
what you want or just a machine

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.850 
what you want or just a machine
you're<00:05:49.330> already<00:05:49.599> but<00:05:50.440> you<00:05:50.530> know<00:05:50.650> what

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860
