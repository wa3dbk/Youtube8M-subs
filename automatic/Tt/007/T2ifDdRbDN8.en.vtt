have a lot of needs there and the one

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
have a lot of needs there and the one
prospect<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.880> teams<00:01:15.420> feel<00:01:15.600> comfortable

on clearance i think there's a chance if
there's<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.770> prospect<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.520> teams<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.880> going

there's a prospect that teams are going
to<00:01:21.060> trade<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> safety<00:01:22.409> could

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
to trade up for it's the safety could

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.380 
to trade up for it's the safety could
creep<00:01:23.009> up<00:01:23.159> we've<00:01:23.280> heard<00:01:23.430> 14<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> Cowboys

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
creep up we've heard 14 to the Cowboys

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.580 
creep up we've heard 14 to the Cowboys
maybe<00:01:24.630> even<00:01:24.810> higher<00:01:24.990> than<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.200> it's

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
maybe even higher than that it's

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.320 
maybe even higher than that it's
possible<00:01:25.920> especially<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:26.909> there's<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.119> trade

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
possible especially if there's a trade

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.940 
possible especially if there's a trade
and<00:01:27.509> someone<00:01:28.229> needs<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.560> before<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
and someone needs to get before the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.319 
and someone needs to get before the
Cowboys<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:29.549> him<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> get

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
Cowboys to get him they have to get

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.090 
Cowboys to get him they have to get
above<00:01:30.540> 14<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.290> finally<00:01:31.680> there's<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> running

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
above 14 and finally there's a running

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.859 
above 14 and finally there's a running
back<00:01:32.340> maybe<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:32.970> sneaking<00:01:33.390> into<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> first

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
back maybe now sneaking into the first

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.539 
back maybe now sneaking into the first
round<00:01:34.110> besides<00:01:34.650> Trent<00:01:34.920> Richardson<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.430> know

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
