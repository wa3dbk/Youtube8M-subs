00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
recommend for you to only buckle the top

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.460 
recommend for you to only buckle the top
two<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.340> buckle<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:03.120> four<00:01:03.870> then

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
two because if you buckle all four then

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050 
two because if you buckle all four then
it's<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.309> squeezing<00:01:05.640> into<00:01:05.909> your

modells<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:34.290> they're<00:03:35.290> really<00:03:35.440> worth<00:03:35.680> it<00:03:36.720> um

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
modells and they're really worth it um

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.630 
modells and they're really worth it um
and<00:03:40.260> another<00:03:41.260> thing<00:03:41.380> is<00:03:41.680> your<00:03:41.890> mouthpiece<00:03:43.020> um

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
and another thing is your mouthpiece um

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.440 
and another thing is your mouthpiece um
your<00:03:45.640> mouthpiece<00:03:47.580> it's<00:03:48.580> close<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.880> attach<00:03:49.270> to

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
your mouthpiece it's close to attach to

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.699 
your mouthpiece it's close to attach to
your<00:03:49.540> helmet<00:03:50.340> but<00:03:52.140> mine<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.290> really<00:03:53.500> attached

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
your helmet but mine is really attached

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.320 
your helmet but mine is really attached
to<00:03:53.830> my<00:03:53.920> home<00:03:54.070> because<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.370> tell<00:03:54.550> them<00:03:54.640> took<00:03:55.120> this

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
to my home because I tell them took this

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.850 
to my home because I tell them took this
thing<00:03:55.510> off<00:03:55.660> that<00:03:55.840> makes<00:03:56.020> it<00:03:56.110> attached<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:56.709> it's

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
thing off that makes it attached so it's

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.860 
thing off that makes it attached so it's
just<00:03:57.040> a<00:03:57.190> plain<00:03:57.430> old<00:03:57.459> thing<00:03:57.790> but<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.570> think<00:03:58.780> it

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
just a plain old thing but I think it

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.220 
just a plain old thing but I think it
helps<00:03:59.020> because<00:03:59.500> it's<00:04:00.160> attached<00:04:00.430> your<00:04:00.700> helmet

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
helps because it's attached your helmet

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.330 
helps because it's attached your helmet
just<00:04:02.230> gets<00:04:02.410> all<00:04:02.530> over<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.830> place<00:04:02.980> me<00:04:03.160> doing

just gets all over the place me doing
pop-ups<00:04:03.580> or<00:04:03.880> whatever<00:04:05.640> so<00:04:06.640> I<00:04:07.110> recommend<00:04:08.110> just

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
pop-ups or whatever so I recommend just

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.140 
pop-ups or whatever so I recommend just
like<00:04:08.800> when<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.160> get<00:04:09.280> something<00:04:09.550> like<00:04:09.730> take
