00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:27.540 

you

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:01:19.300 

you

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.230 

okay<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.370> that<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.730> the<00:01:20.820> first<00:01:21.030> pattern

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
okay so that was the first pattern

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.180 
okay so that was the first pattern
starting<00:01:21.690> out<00:01:21.810> really<00:01:22.170> slow<00:01:22.410> and<00:01:22.650> gradually

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
starting out really slow and gradually

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.190 
starting out really slow and gradually
increasing<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.730> speed<00:01:23.850> without<00:01:24.540> stopping

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
increasing the speed without stopping

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.900 
increasing the speed without stopping
though<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.620> this<00:01:25.890> starts<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.280> involve<00:01:26.640> more

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
though and this starts to involve more

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.640 
though and this starts to involve more
of<00:01:26.970> our<00:01:27.090> counting<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> our<00:01:28.200> ability<00:01:28.410> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
of our counting and our ability to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.160 
of our counting and our ability to
phrase<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.550> beat<00:01:29.760> what<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:30.990> go

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
phrase over the beat what we do is we go

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.890 
phrase over the beat what we do is we go
to<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.830> lot<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.430> six<00:01:32.700> per<00:01:32.880> drum<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.720> go

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
to one lot of six per drum so we go

00:01:33.900 --> 00:02:03.900 
to one lot of six per drum so we go
instead<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.940> 12<00:01:36.260> we<00:01:37.260> just<00:01:37.440> go<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:38.160> two<00:01:39.140> three

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.610 

so<00:02:04.910> as<00:02:05.120> we<00:02:05.300> go<00:02:05.330> through<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:05.870> exercise<00:02:06.080> we

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
so as we go through this exercise we

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.560 
so as we go through this exercise we
gradually<00:02:06.980> play<00:02:07.310> less<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.880> less<00:02:08.030> notes<00:02:08.360> on

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
gradually play less and less notes on

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.150 
gradually play less and less notes on
each<00:02:08.750> drum<00:02:09.080> whether<00:02:09.440> we're<00:02:09.590> moving<00:02:09.860> clockwise

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
each drum whether we're moving clockwise

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.400 
each drum whether we're moving clockwise
or<00:02:10.670> anti-clockwise<00:02:10.970> it's<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.660> same<00:02:11.900> sequence

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
or anti-clockwise it's the same sequence

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.830 
or anti-clockwise it's the same sequence
of<00:02:12.530> drums<00:02:12.770> oh<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.370> always<00:02:13.700> snare<00:02:14.180> first

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
of drums oh it's always snare first

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.370 
of drums oh it's always snare first

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
second floor ride second first crash

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.370 
second floor ride second first crash
hats<00:02:18.800> snare<00:02:19.430> okay<00:02:20.210> so<00:02:20.270> it's<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.810> rotational

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
hats snare okay so it's a rotational

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.680 
hats snare okay so it's a rotational
exercise<00:02:21.770> for<00:02:22.100> just<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.490> hands<00:02:22.850> not<00:02:23.450> using

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
exercise for just the hands not using

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.780 
exercise for just the hands not using
the<00:02:23.750> fit<00:02:23.930> yet<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.650> next<00:02:24.980> we're<00:02:25.460> going<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.610> play

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
the fit yet so next we're going to play

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.060 
the fit yet so next we're going to play
patterns<00:02:26.210> of<00:02:26.330> four<00:02:26.660> ok<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.530> I'll<00:02:27.680> just<00:02:27.740> show

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
patterns of four ok so I'll just show

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.440 
patterns of four ok so I'll just show
you<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.340> first<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.820> then<00:02:28.880> i'll<00:02:29.060> do<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.360> in

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
you that first and then i'll do it in

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.300 
you that first and then i'll do it in
time<00:02:29.750> because<00:02:30.050> this<00:02:30.200> now<00:02:30.410> becomes<00:02:30.590> as<00:02:30.950> much<00:02:31.160> an

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
time because this now becomes as much an

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.460 
time because this now becomes as much an
exercise<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.730> counting<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:32.780> phrasing<00:02:33.170> over

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
exercise in counting and phrasing over

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.260 
exercise in counting and phrasing over
the<00:02:33.560> beat<00:02:33.740> or<00:02:33.890> around<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.280> beat<00:02:34.490> as<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:35.120> is

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
the beat or around the beat as it is

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.120 
the beat or around the beat as it is
just<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.630> get<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.170> raw<00:02:36.470> ability<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.980> be<00:02:37.070> able

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
just to get the raw ability to be able

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.340 
just to get the raw ability to be able
to<00:02:37.280> play<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.490> so<00:02:38.240> now<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:38.510> play<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.260> each

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
to play it so now we play for and each

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.990 
to play it so now we play for and each
drum<00:02:39.680> by<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.160> time<00:02:40.430> we<00:02:40.550> get<00:02:40.670> down<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:40.910> the

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
drum by the time we get down to the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.990 
drum by the time we get down to the
floor<00:02:41.300> tom<00:02:41.510> though<00:02:41.720> we<00:02:41.930> actually<00:02:42.230> play<00:02:42.410> five

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
floor tom though we actually play five

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.400 
floor tom though we actually play five
just<00:02:44.000> like<00:02:44.150> we<00:02:44.300> have<00:02:44.450> been<00:02:44.630> doing<00:02:44.840> adding<00:02:45.260> mean

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
just like we have been doing adding mean

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.260 
just like we have been doing adding mean
that<00:02:45.590> extra<00:02:45.890> note<00:02:46.040> on<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.430> beat<00:02:46.610> because<00:02:47.120> that

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
that extra note on the beat because that

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.940 
that extra note on the beat because that
then<00:02:47.420> frees<00:02:47.750> up<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:47.960> left<00:02:48.230> hand<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.620> take<00:02:48.830> the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
then frees up the left hand to take the

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.620 
then frees up the left hand to take the
lead<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.400> take<00:02:49.880> us<00:02:50.030> anti-clockwise

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
lead and take us anti-clockwise

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.600 
lead and take us anti-clockwise
background<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.560> hats<00:02:51.770> all<00:02:52.070> away<00:02:52.370> from

background to the hats all away from
ride<00:02:52.880> second<00:02:53.420> first<00:02:53.720> crash<00:02:54.140> hats<00:02:54.500> sounds<00:02:55.310> like

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
ride second first crash hats sounds like

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:04.690 
ride second first crash hats sounds like
this

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.790 

but<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.850> play<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.300> time<00:03:06.600> within<00:03:07.020> sextuplets

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
but to play it in time within sextuplets

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:36.230 
but to play it in time within sextuplets
it's<00:03:07.980> actually<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.520> this<00:03:09.770> 34<00:03:34.730> from<00:03:35.730> there<00:03:35.970> we

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
it's actually like this 34 from there we

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.000 
it's actually like this 34 from there we
move<00:03:36.480> down<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.960> smaller<00:03:37.260> unit<00:03:37.380> per<00:03:37.770> drum

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
move down to a smaller unit per drum

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.440 
move down to a smaller unit per drum
we're<00:03:38.310> going<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.490> play<00:03:38.640> two<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:38.910> each<00:03:39.180> drum

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
we're going to play two on each drum

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.320 
we're going to play two on each drum
same<00:03:40.140> sequence<00:03:40.650> same<00:03:41.070> order<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:41.670> drums<00:03:42.150> and

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
same sequence same order of drums and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.270 
same sequence same order of drums and
cymbals<00:03:42.510> but<00:03:42.960> just<00:03:43.170> two<00:03:43.320> on<00:03:43.470> each<00:03:43.620> drum<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.160> the

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
cymbals but just two on each drum so the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.370 
cymbals but just two on each drum so the
pattern<00:03:44.640> forget<00:03:45.240> about<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:45.870> know<00:03:45.990> whether

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
pattern forget about you know whether

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.780 
pattern forget about you know whether
we're<00:03:46.530> playing<00:03:46.740> insects<00:03:47.160> tablets<00:03:47.520> on<00:03:47.610> night

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
we're playing insects tablets on night

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:58.780 
we're playing insects tablets on night
at<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:47.970> stage<00:03:48.210> just<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.780> actual<00:03:49.050> pattern<00:03:49.260> is

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.550 

okay<00:03:59.790> so<00:03:59.850> on<00:04:00.270> the<00:04:00.570> high<00:04:00.720> hats<00:04:00.960> we<00:04:01.110> have<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.380> play

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
okay so on the high hats we have to play

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.220 
okay so on the high hats we have to play
three<00:04:01.950> left<00:04:02.640> right<00:04:03.120> left<00:04:03.600> because<00:04:04.020> then<00:04:04.200> that

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
three left right left because then that

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.350 
three left right left because then that
brings<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.920> right<00:04:05.280> hand<00:04:05.550> free<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.970> start<00:04:06.240> the

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
brings the right hand free to start the

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.910 
brings the right hand free to start the
sequence<00:04:06.540> again<00:04:06.990> moving<00:04:07.200> clockwise<00:04:07.530> and

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
sequence again moving clockwise and

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.350 
sequence again moving clockwise and
you'll<00:04:08.340> notice<00:04:08.610> that<00:04:08.640> once<00:04:08.910> again<00:04:09.150> on<00:04:09.270> the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
you'll notice that once again on the

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.880 
you'll notice that once again on the
floor<00:04:09.600> time<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.900> course<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.290> we<00:04:10.380> are<00:04:10.530> played

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
floor time of course that we are played

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.880 
floor time of course that we are played
three<00:04:11.490> there<00:04:11.670> as<00:04:11.790> well<00:04:11.970> right<00:04:12.630> left<00:04:13.050> right<00:04:13.380> to

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
three there as well right left right to

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.350 
three there as well right left right to
free<00:04:14.130> up<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.370> left<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.760> stand<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.150> ride

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
free up the left to stand on the ride

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:42.550 
free up the left to stand on the ride
move<00:04:15.930> any<00:04:16.080> clockwise<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:16.950> that's<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.250> pattern

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.510 

so<00:04:43.560> if<00:04:43.650> you've<00:04:43.770> been<00:04:43.890> practicing<00:04:44.130> these

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
so if you've been practicing these

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.310 
so if you've been practicing these
exercises<00:04:45.000> now<00:04:45.300> for<00:04:45.510> any<00:04:45.630> amount<00:04:45.810> of<00:04:45.960> time<00:04:46.020> it

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
exercises now for any amount of time it

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.110 
exercises now for any amount of time it
should<00:04:46.440> be<00:04:46.530> pretty<00:04:46.680> warm<00:04:47.010> next<00:04:47.910> we're<00:04:48.030> going

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
should be pretty warm next we're going

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.460 
should be pretty warm next we're going
to<00:04:48.180> stick<00:04:48.450> with<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.690> twos<00:04:48.900> but<00:04:49.170> we're<00:04:49.290> just

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
to stick with the twos but we're just

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.600 
to stick with the twos but we're just
going<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.650> play<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.950> drums<00:04:50.220> so<00:04:50.400> we're<00:04:50.520> going

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
going to play the drums so we're going

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.340 
going to play the drums so we're going
to<00:04:50.700> leave<00:04:50.880> out<00:04:51.030> all<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.210> symbols<00:04:51.510> will<00:04:51.930> do<00:04:52.080> two

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
to leave out all the symbols will do two

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.430 
to leave out all the symbols will do two
on<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.770> snare<00:04:52.830> first<00:04:53.790> second<00:04:54.540> floor<00:04:55.020> then

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
on the snare first second floor then

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.530 
on the snare first second floor then
back<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:55.920> second<00:04:56.460> first<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.270> snare

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
back to the second first and the snare

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.960 
back to the second first and the snare
so<00:04:58.320> we're<00:04:58.470> going<00:04:58.590> clockwise<00:04:59.100> anti-clockwise

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
so we're going clockwise anti-clockwise

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.480 
so we're going clockwise anti-clockwise
and<00:05:00.450> both<00:05:00.690> on<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.080> snare<00:05:01.350> and<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.710> floor<00:05:02.070> in

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
and both on the snare and the floor in

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.220 
and both on the snare and the floor in
order<00:05:02.850> to<00:05:02.940> be<00:05:03.030> able<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.240> change<00:05:03.450> directions<00:05:03.720> we

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
order to be able to change directions we

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.170 
order to be able to change directions we
need<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.470> play<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:04.830> extra<00:05:05.160> note<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:05.850> we<00:05:05.970> play

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
need to play that extra note so we play

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.390 
need to play that extra note so we play
one<00:05:06.690> two<00:05:07.230> one<00:05:07.830> two<00:05:07.890> one<00:05:08.760> two<00:05:09.060> one<00:05:09.780> two<00:05:10.400> three

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
one two one two one two one two three

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.460 
one two one two one two one two three
one<00:05:11.940> two<00:05:12.270> one<00:05:13.050> two<00:05:13.110> one<00:05:13.830> two<00:05:14.360> three<00:05:15.360> ok<00:05:16.110> so<00:05:16.170> the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
one two one two one two three ok so the

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:34.990 
one two one two one two three ok so the
floor<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.860> snare<00:05:17.070> get<00:05:17.280> three

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.490 

from<00:05:36.000> there<00:05:36.210> we<00:05:36.330> just<00:05:36.509> play<00:05:36.689> it<00:05:36.780> on<00:05:36.900> the<00:05:36.990> Tom<00:05:37.199> so

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
from there we just play it on the Tom so

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.779 
from there we just play it on the Tom so
gradually<00:05:37.949> it's<00:05:38.069> getting<00:05:38.310> smaller<00:05:38.460> and

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
gradually it's getting smaller and

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.010 
gradually it's getting smaller and
smaller<00:05:38.900> one<00:05:39.900> two<00:05:40.379> one<00:05:40.919> two<00:05:40.979> one<00:05:41.759> two<00:05:42.020> three

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
smaller one two one two one two three

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.730 
smaller one two one two one two three
one<00:05:43.469> two<00:05:43.500> one<00:05:44.400> two<00:05:44.460> three<00:05:45.449> this<00:05:46.020> time<00:05:46.259> the

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
one two one two three this time the

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.320 
one two one two three this time the
first<00:05:46.919> time<00:05:47.069> gets<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.460> three<00:05:47.759> in<00:05:47.939> order<00:05:48.150> to<00:05:48.240> be

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
first time gets the three in order to be

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.610 
first time gets the three in order to be
able<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.539> change<00:05:48.750> back<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.080> the<00:05:49.259> right-hand

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
able to change back to the right-hand

00:05:49.620 --> 00:06:06.719 
able to change back to the right-hand
lead

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.100 

so<00:06:07.729> to<00:06:07.789> be<00:06:07.939> able<00:06:07.969> to<00:06:08.180> play<00:06:08.300> these<00:06:08.569> sequences

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
so to be able to play these sequences

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.110 
so to be able to play these sequences
just<00:06:09.169> in<00:06:09.590> their<00:06:09.770> own<00:06:09.949> right<00:06:10.249> is<00:06:10.460> one<00:06:10.729> thing<00:06:10.999> but

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
just in their own right is one thing but

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.879 
just in their own right is one thing but
being<00:06:11.180> able<00:06:11.479> to<00:06:11.569> play<00:06:11.719> them<00:06:11.900> in<00:06:12.050> time<00:06:12.379> is

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
being able to play them in time is

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.429 
being able to play them in time is
another<00:06:13.310> that<00:06:14.150> really<00:06:14.449> teaches<00:06:14.870> you're

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:15.439 
another that really teaches you're

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.290 
another that really teaches you're
really<00:06:15.919> test<00:06:16.189> your<00:06:16.340> ability<00:06:16.759> to<00:06:16.879> count<00:06:17.150> and

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
really test your ability to count and

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.519 
really test your ability to count and
cross<00:06:17.539> phrase<00:06:17.779> because<00:06:18.080> a<00:06:18.110> lot<00:06:18.349> of<00:06:18.379> these

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:18.529 
cross phrase because a lot of these

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:20.320 
cross phrase because a lot of these
figures<00:06:18.949> if<00:06:19.099> we're<00:06:19.249> playing<00:06:19.370> in<00:06:19.669> sextuplets

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
figures if we're playing in sextuplets

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.850 
figures if we're playing in sextuplets
and<00:06:20.539> a<00:06:20.990> lot<00:06:21.169> of<00:06:21.199> the<00:06:21.319> time<00:06:21.499> we're<00:06:21.650> playing

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
and a lot of the time we're playing

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.649 
and a lot of the time we're playing
units<00:06:22.189> of<00:06:22.310> two<00:06:22.520> and<00:06:22.789> then<00:06:22.879> units<00:06:23.180> of<00:06:23.300> three<00:06:23.539> as

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:23.659 
units of two and then units of three as

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:25.450 
units of two and then units of three as
well<00:06:23.840> so<00:06:24.080> we've<00:06:24.229> got<00:06:24.379> patterns<00:06:24.710> of<00:06:24.830> five<00:06:25.069> going

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
well so we've got patterns of five going

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.459 
well so we've got patterns of five going
on<00:06:25.580> and<00:06:25.759> so<00:06:25.879> forth<00:06:25.909> well<00:06:26.629> every<00:06:26.990> time<00:06:27.020> that<00:06:27.349> we

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
on and so forth well every time that we

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.050 
on and so forth well every time that we
play<00:06:27.740> it<00:06:27.800> it's<00:06:28.189> not<00:06:28.310> going<00:06:28.460> to<00:06:28.550> land<00:06:28.759> on<00:06:28.879> the

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
play it it's not going to land on the

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.029 
play it it's not going to land on the
beat<00:06:29.270> every<00:06:29.599> single<00:06:29.900> time<00:06:30.139> okay<00:06:30.979> so

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
beat every single time okay so

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:32.769 
beat every single time okay so
particularly<00:06:31.819> with<00:06:31.999> when<00:06:32.449> you're<00:06:32.539> doing<00:06:32.689> the

particularly with when you're doing the

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:44.820 
particularly with when you're doing the
fours<00:06:33.110> you<00:06:33.620> know<00:06:33.740> and<00:06:33.830> you're<00:06:33.949> playing<00:06:34.090> data

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.159 

etc<00:06:46.210> you're<00:06:47.210> not<00:06:47.360> landing<00:06:47.659> on<00:06:47.750> the<00:06:47.810> beat<00:06:47.960> every

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
etc you're not landing on the beat every
