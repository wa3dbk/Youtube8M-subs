00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
like Linux we have to put in the folder

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:37.509 
like Linux we have to put in the folder
ourselves<00:02:34.139> so<00:02:34.769> new<00:02:35.190> folder<00:02:35.609> name<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.329> ACS

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
ourselves so new folder name it a ACS

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:51.470 
ourselves so new folder name it a ACS
and<00:02:39.859> copy<00:02:40.859> and<00:02:41.069> paste<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:44.100> key<00:02:45.230> DB<00:02:46.850> CFG

now<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:52.410> course<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.709> next<00:02:53.069> part<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.550> actually

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
now of course this next part is actually

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.800 
now of course this next part is actually
very<00:02:54.330> interesting<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:56.550> next<00:02:56.580> part<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.269> a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
very interesting the next part is the a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.320 
very interesting the next part is the a
ACS<00:02:58.410> dime<00:02:58.590> attic<00:02:58.920> library<00:02:59.489> now<00:02:59.819> this<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.150> what

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
ACS dime attic library now this is what

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.470 
ACS dime attic library now this is what
the<00:03:00.480> site<00:03:00.690> doesn't<00:03:01.349> tell<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:02.150> all<00:03:03.150> right<00:03:03.239> so
