00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Doubts friend and if you are from the samples 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.810
 destroyed the most style very like 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.719
 use your look your city train in the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.099
 bag throws it we do not need this 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.650
 solution of our expert in 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.059
 technology or not and how many times not 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.770
 it has happened to us that you start once 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.630
 cell phone or we can inside the bag and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.359
 we started to take everything out suddenly 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.130
 flying and cellular and there it was or we were 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.050
 falls into the water or returns after 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.570
 any number of things and I think that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.010
 whose today brings us something that we 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.010
 will love us women who 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.010
 day by day we are talking about we have 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.710
 talked about cell phones like 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.809
 so many subjects here in the new but 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.920
 none like this one calls me a lot 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.660
 attention because we were 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.600
 asking about 'the one phone 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.550
 resistant the new modern that goes by 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.739
 the kids to school and he gets on the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.930
 car and go alone and in the bag 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.820
 it has been of all state been of all and 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.309
 well sometimes we spend a good 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.510
 quantity in in a good protection a 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.460
 tip 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.949
 and sometimes even then just take one out to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 answer in all that hustle falls and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.729
 cell goodbye clear why is that we 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.740
 we put to investigate on telephones 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.740
 resistant that beyond a sheath 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.080
 that will protect you from dust 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.409
 against scratches against falls even 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.930
 against liquids because we did not find something 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.549
 that I had that certainty here look for 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.159
 example let's see what happens with 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.509
 this phone is that apart it is very 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.509
 You can move it responsively 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.210
 this phone is called fai that 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.270
 means is the station and then look 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.429
 what you are doing has a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.720
 sealed hermetically once 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.670
 be it from the card you can see it 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.319
 still work two teeth are believed 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.970
 that is trick and that we put it nothing else 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.409
 from the top we flipped it to 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.409
 spread the panic 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.820
 this I did not put a bucket I got to the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.140
 conclusion that more or less resists a 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.430
 meter deep and wind 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.959
 can be a good time zero here 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.360
 We can continue talking but we are going to 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.069
 show everything else that does but the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.170
 thing is that it is not a not a device 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.480
 so that we are swimming and have it 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.880
 we will find is a device that resists 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.170
 accidents is to say theoretical that I took it 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.989
 from my business bag I bring some 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.300
 keys I bring some coins and it did not happen 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.459
 absolutely nothing more at a distance does not scratch 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.769
 look here I bring my keys and what 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.040
 let's do here because I know what 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.040
 It will happen 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:51.050
 with a coin the technology is called the 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.020
 class 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.090
 it is a device is a crystal technique 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.340
 forged that is used in fact in the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.620
 space ships imagine crystal of 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.330
 high resistance and above it is 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:09.550
 use in this phone also what 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.550
 we have here and so what 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.360
 is flying everywhere or you can see 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.850
 there is that suddenly 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.780
 valera from one side to another not just 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.300
 the lid but also this part of 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.430
 they left everything behind 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.050
 is constructed of transforms that do not 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.110
 They give and this I think it's something 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.550
 prodigious when you already have one this this 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.710
 level of the modern woman who is 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.750
 doing a lot of things no longer happens 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.430
 nothing a friend that is done little told me 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.760
 that was firming on the 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.760
 bathroom 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.849
 doing a manicure talking about 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.390
 phone and in the water of two months 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.390
 manicure 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.639
 You can take pictures inside the 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.380
 water yes yes I tried it and if you can 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.840
 do nothing but remember that it is not 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.639
 navy on holiday get us going and 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.860
 to be being inside is a device 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.930
 of high resistance something that to me 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.150
 love is that it is not the first one has already 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.860
 there were other cell phones that 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.560
 they have these characteristics but they are 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.970
 together and this one I liked because the design 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.250
 surely our family is going to 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.740
 like is a 3.7-inch screen 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.690
 16 million colors can take 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.400
 photos can take videos can have 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.650
 your galleries can browse the internet 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.080
 in the android system which we have 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.940
 previously talked access to 200,000 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.120
 apps on android market manager 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.949
 has 2 gb by default because they can 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.870
 put a lot of songs a lot 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.920
 of money pictures can put a 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.140
 sd card and expand it up to 32 GB 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.560
 and your important documents send and 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.500
 receive mail is a gadget that is 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.900
 so he has flash and in the camera he has 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.610
 autofocus something that not all have if 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.410
 we have to be very sincere and this is already 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.440
 as well as how well nailed the only thing that 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.180
 I do not like the phone is that it does not record 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.920
 in high definition to make a 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.020
 phone of this high and high range 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.780
 resistance to me I would have liked that 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.970
 recorded in high definition detail is 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.020
 what they are looking for is high resistance 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.020
 there is the phone 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.390
 investigating already see that there are two ways 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.250
 in our country to get this guy 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.170
 of appliances by plan with some 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.000
 telephone we only pay the contract 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.010
 that gives us telephone service 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.780
 etcetera without there they give it to you free 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.760
 depending on the plan that you grab but 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.640
 yes 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.370
 you want to buy him put your cards 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.650
 of payment then approximately between 5000 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.070
 and 6000 pesos this is a device that 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.320
 has an android 2.2 operating system 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:06.600
 2.1 and that makes it very fast to 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.600
 navigate you have to not miss 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.960
 something that you will like a lot 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.730
 really like this line of phones and 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.190
 is that it has something called crystal 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.510
 clio that is when you speak the 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.000
 interlocutor listens to you perfectly 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.130
 well and this fact also you listen to 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.810
 he is very clear the sound even when 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.990
 you are in very judicious places and a 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.580
 diffusion is a device that frankly to 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.900
 I like to show other different 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.220
 with different characteristics not 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.990
 we are saying that it is better or worse 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.570
 but this is the one that endures scratches 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.280
 which we can convert to water with 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.590
 so many that we are submitting for him 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.460
 for friends arrive and see what 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.460
 what does my phone do 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.310
 in the day to day that you are with the child you 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:53.070
 the milk falls on top of the juice and everything 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.170
 that's clear for any style of 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.600
 life you know you do not go out and you work in 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.950
 you are an engineer or you have to be 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.470
 life down I think it's the 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.600
 ideal phone for women and men 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.950
 because the design is fresh goes perfect 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.500
 so that it is for anyone 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.390
 even for a teenager 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.610
 thank you for presenting us this option so 

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.610
 incredible thank you for please 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.440
 we leave with a viper zegarra
