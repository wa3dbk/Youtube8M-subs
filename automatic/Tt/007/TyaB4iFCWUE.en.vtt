this one is way better looking it has a
nicer<00:00:34.200> profile<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.280> Chrome<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:36.000> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
nicer profile to it with Chrome as you

nicer profile to it with Chrome as you
can<00:00:36.300> see<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:37.020> scratched<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:38.030> but<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.360> also

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
can see I scratched it but it's also

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
can see I scratched it but it's also
water-resistant<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.340> something<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
water-resistant so it's something I

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.799 
water-resistant so it's something I
really<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.690> about<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:44.010> reason<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.809> choose

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
really like about it the reason I choose

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.170 
really like about it the reason I choose
this<00:00:46.020> kind<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.350> watch<00:00:46.500> instead<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.879> those

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
this kind of watch instead of like those

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.830 
this kind of watch instead of like those
fancy<00:00:49.460> expensive<00:00:50.460> watches<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> G<00:00:51.329> Shock

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
fancy expensive watches like the G Shock

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.189 
fancy expensive watches like the G Shock
is<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.980> those<00:00:53.250> are<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.640> bulky<00:00:54.329> like

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
is because those are really bulky like

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.450 
is because those are really bulky like
when<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.410> try<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.920> something<00:00:56.129> from<00:00:56.309> my
