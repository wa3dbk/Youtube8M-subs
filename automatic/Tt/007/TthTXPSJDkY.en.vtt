I'm<00:00:19.440> making<00:00:19.800> these<00:00:19.950> and<00:00:20.280> and<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.790> know<00:00:20.880> that

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
I'm making these and and you know that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.480 
I'm making these and and you know that
works<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.540> it's<00:00:21.690> okay<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.130> don't

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
works and it's okay but really I don't

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.590 
works and it's okay but really I don't
know<00:00:23.580> if<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.730> know<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.120> there's<00:00:24.450> an

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
know if you know this but there's an

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.200 
know if you know this but there's an
easier<00:00:25.170> way<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.590> doing<00:00:25.860> it<00:00:25.950> okay<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:27.060> we're

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
easier way of doing it okay what we're

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.840 
easier way of doing it okay what we're
gonna<00:00:27.330> do<00:00:28.310> is<00:00:29.310> we're<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.610> gonna<00:00:29.880> roll<00:00:31.850> our

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
gonna do is we're just gonna roll our

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:43.489 
gonna do is we're just gonna roll our
dough<00:00:37.609> just<00:00:38.609> like<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.949> then<00:00:42.469> we're<00:00:43.469> just

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:43.499 
dough just like that then we're just

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:56.810 
dough just like that then we're just
gonna<00:00:43.769> slice<00:00:44.100> it

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.549 

this<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.450> probably<00:00:57.630> better<00:00:57.900> for<00:00:58.170> noodles<00:01:00.559> then

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
this is probably better for noodles then

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.890 
this is probably better for noodles then
spaghetti<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.700> then<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.360> unroll

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
spaghetti and then you can just unroll

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:20.609 
spaghetti and then you can just unroll
it<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.860> have<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> noodles<00:01:08.400> okay

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.969 

so<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:22.659> it<00:01:22.869> there's<00:01:23.079> two<00:01:23.289> there's<00:01:23.679> always

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
so that's it there's two there's always

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.399 
so that's it there's two there's always
more<00:01:24.399> than<00:01:24.460> one<00:01:24.670> way<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:24.909> doing<00:01:25.179> things<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
more than one way of doing things and

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.289 
more than one way of doing things and
typically<00:01:30.250> one<00:01:30.579> way<00:01:30.759> is<00:01:30.819> going<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.060> be<00:01:31.119> better

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
typically one way is going to be better

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.410 
typically one way is going to be better
for<00:01:31.569> one<00:01:31.750> way<00:01:31.960> one<00:01:32.500> thing<00:01:32.799> or<00:01:32.979> than<00:01:33.189> another

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
for one way one thing or than another

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.959 
for one way one thing or than another
guy<00:01:34.420> said<00:01:34.689> this<00:01:34.899> faster<00:01:35.619> but<00:01:36.460> it's<00:01:36.610> not<00:01:36.789> gonna

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
guy said this faster but it's not gonna

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.899 
guy said this faster but it's not gonna
make<00:01:37.149> them<00:01:37.360> as<00:01:37.479> fine

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.080 

it's<00:01:42.909> doing<00:01:43.240> them<00:01:43.359> individually<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:46.060> the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
it's doing them individually with the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:02:07.130 
it's doing them individually with the
pizza<00:01:46.600> cutter

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.169 

there<00:02:08.140> you<00:02:08.349> go

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
there you go

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.309 
there you go
now<00:02:10.179> we're<00:02:10.360> just<00:02:10.479> gonna<00:02:10.720> stick<00:02:10.869> these<00:02:11.050> in<00:02:11.230> the

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
now we're just gonna stick these in the

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.530 
now we're just gonna stick these in the
water
