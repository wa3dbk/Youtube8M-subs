movement<00:02:11.870> speed<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.440> mean<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.549> doesn't<00:02:13.819> hurt

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:13.999 
movement speed I mean it doesn't hurt

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:14.730

right<00:02:14.239> like

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
right like

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.620 
right like

it<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:18.550> could<00:02:18.700> argue<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.030> if<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.390> could

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
it you could argue that if you could

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.000 
it you could argue that if you could
find<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.810> wolf<00:02:19.990> would<00:02:20.140> be<00:02:20.230> better<00:02:20.410> or<00:02:20.650> even<00:02:20.920> the
