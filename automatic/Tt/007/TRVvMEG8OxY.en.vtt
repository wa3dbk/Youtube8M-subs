00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 well hello to all and to all those 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.020
 I do not remember my nickname anymore but 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.370
 anyway we find ourselves for a 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.330
 video that goes very precious but I am 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.540
 with my two colleagues 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:19.410
 youtuber hello to you good morning 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:21.240
 to you final dream and see the super 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.650
 super pseudo so they have not got any 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.240
 youtube channel but I invite you already 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.019
 and asia has nevertheless left on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.460
 this shot there in fact we are not at 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.689
 consider as readings but 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.890
 let's focus on the gameplay 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.510
 since only one as judge 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.859
 exactly we are as a judge 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.170
 we will not go we will not do 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.000
 one of the media rnj and analyzes that there 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.350
 directly available on youtube 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.879
 but we have some direct 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.559
 very precious thing of the thirteen unique 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.629
 that you will be able to see directly 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.600
 it's necessarily a gameplay and not a 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.129
 trailer a gameplay of call of duty name 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.530
 which is not to be expected to review my 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.850
 call of duty ranges black ops 3 one 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.770
 who wants to go out soon 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.539
 then we are talking about it just 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.559
 to be announced and so we have the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.030
 opportunity to offer you a gameplay 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.710
 as you see now then 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.750
 does not it if it 's not the gameplay that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.879
 you see is call of duty black 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.140
 ops 3 necessarily it is perhaps of a 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.460
 quality a bit mediocre since 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.600
 we did something we will say 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.250
 illegal therefore had it we necessarily 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.659
 we are all delighted that it is 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.430
 black ops 3 but I have something 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.790
 to say about that is to look at the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.080
 gameplay 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.880
 look what told us 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.630
 look what gives us necessarily bah 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.100
 I'm a little disappointed we 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.420
 to propose a game like this 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.710
 true that they have proven to us that we 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.119
 said yeah we'll make you 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.540
 things even more futuristic than the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.579
 previous 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.579
 by then we do not even have humans anymore 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.290
 has some peanuts not dessert with 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.880
 organs in it I do not know what is it 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.009
 soon our characters will be 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.180
 dogs is of course a lot of 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.009
 people watched the trailer 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.060
 of multiplayer of the campaign but he 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.220
 there will be no zombie mode 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.119
 actually the word you do not have the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.430
 opportunity to find 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.840
 they decided to delete and if they 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.220
 are going to create it's just for a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.810
 This is for serving more money 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.460
 in their pocket because you're going 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.470
 have to buy the motton said because 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.939
 yes there will be a zombie mode and so that 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.710
 not walk buy the zombie mode and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.049
 it's good the map will pay 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.530
 the zombie mode will be exactly will be 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.229
 paying the weapons are paying 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.729
 so sorry for this little problem 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.229
 technique there was a spider a 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.789
 little spider we had little 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.520
 problems we have you feel 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.290
 let's go straight back 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.680
 let's talk about the zombie mode the their mode 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.480
 zombie in fact the zombie mode will be 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.980
 paying and so you're going to have a 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.690
 system of grades exactly as I 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.040
 you announce is not me who announced it 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.940
 but like my former colleague who is not 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.959
 not the two colleagues he had 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.340
 announced for after old videos 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.989
 well I'll know some 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.370
 something that will be a little disappointing 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.370
 that's why I'm so small 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.050
 little disappointed for the gameplay yes is that 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.820
 you are disappointed quite everything here 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.620
 so we are all disappointed so 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.370
 it's not even the only ones 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.739
 hexal you who is listening to the video well 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.840
 you know what am I going next 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.100
 I'm going then I'll go next 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.750
 interview people on the street 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.400
 to ask what they think 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.290
 ok I'll put you in the end of the video 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.060
 you will hear their voice and this 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.510
 that they take away so here is about 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.459
 grades 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.019
 you will have to pay for a crack 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.130
 simply a euro the graded ya 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.050
 thousand grade so if you want to go to 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.239
 cra 2000 you are going to have to buy 1000 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.620
 euros of course of course there are bonuses 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.670
 you will have to remain emblems 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.780
 who will be paying you will have to 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.400
 to stay also titles that they find 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.570
 pray to change the nickname because 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.829
 yes you will have to invent a nickname 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.120
 which is not playstation network studio 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.410
 had neither that of your iphone you go 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.000
 have also paid a nickname and a 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.370
 legality ten years so if your 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.350
 nickname costs 10 characters it will be 100 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.600
 euros it's frankly a soul here but 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.190
 you have to know that it's commercial 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.209
 sweet and commercial sealed fans 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.519
 of call of duty I advise you 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.019
 save right now and if you 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.430
 have already made savings of the 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.480
 still keep and if you are a kid 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.239
 to deezer ask for pocket money 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.859
 to your parents that in any case this 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.989
 that I can tell you is that everything 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.040
 will be paying the maps will pay and 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.959
 of course for the moment there is only one 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.340
 map but this mappy com pull so 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.709
 according to my calculations I calculated 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.450
 so you have the game that will cost 70 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.799
 euros but of course after the state has 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.470
 invented a rule that will increase the 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.549
 actions no no you are not yet 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.959
 because they invented a law they 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.280
 go before they will increase the 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.739
 video games next-gen consoles including 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.290
 ps4 xbox one of 10 euros that will make 80 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.579
 place of 70 plus grades so me 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.170
 as I am a fan of call of duty 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.640
 Since my childhood I bought my 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.530
 migrants his family have it 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.110
 1400 euros plus the hand of Henry who 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.870
 1181 will cost 100 euros more tour s 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.430
 beaten saffron made 2003 187 euros and well 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.850
 sure there will be the dlc that took out the 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.459
 weapons etc 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.709
 so here I leave you and I have 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.630
 do a little analysis on the whole 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.150
 structure is actually going on the way 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.770
 zombie was paying for that all 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.390
 people who are against each other 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.740
 focused more on the zombie mode itself 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.140
 focuses on the multiplayer but being 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.820
 given the gameplay we are offered 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.340
 fear the worst so she sees so we 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.360
 will leave you with people like us 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.720
 interviewed the street 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.850
 the question is what do you think of this 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.470
 black ops 3 and we'll leave you but 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.970
 frankly a council give up on his 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.650
 politics buy sweets instead 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.560
 liquorice is much better sometimes 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:54.790
 terrible goodbye goodbye 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.790
 finally here it is 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.090
 what I think of them 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.800
 if black ops three months jobs i would 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.290
 crazy because I do not play games 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.450
 children's games way like steve a 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.090
 dad at war you're dead these kids 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.580
 it's me the real thing is the games 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.470
 chess time ben bouali sure 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.820
 I love that the habit is for that 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.410
 that I will buy it directly but 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.530
 but it's just to be at the 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.810
 fashion is to just stay with my 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:27.540
 buddies but I will not play it 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:31.020

 Duty I will follow at the end of the world 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.210
 he will release whatever he wants as long as these 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.210
 call of duty 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.190
 I will buy call of duty then I call 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.780
 of duty for sure I'll go in 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.730
 because it's clear that it takes a little 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.170
 suck the game huh it's something of 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.240
 very important given that we are going 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.250
