00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.869
 you can freely enjoy off-road motorcycling 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.869
 feeling like a part of nature 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.630
 and at the same time 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.630
 is improving his techniques to drive the motorcycle 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.789
 with basic workouts 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.250
 you can enjoy a wonderful world of hofu yet 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.610
 with more freedom 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.610
 and more class 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.460
 let's try to learn some management methods 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.199
 applying the basic techniques that we have learned 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.989
 the first is the slalom 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.970
 This exercise is done to facilitate the continuous movement of the weight 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.580
 bodily 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.740
 when you have to continuously change the routes of the route 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.280
 to do well the slalom the key is the rhythmic swing for this exercise 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.700
 taking into account the following points 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.970
 in the slalom sica, it has to be put in first 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.070
 the position of the inah autos is taken 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 and run avoiding obstacles 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.619
 tighten the knees to maintain stability of the lower part of the 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.960
 body and make rhythmic movements to tilt the machine in and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 outside 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.040
 the turn starts with the slip produced with the rear brake 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.320
 Be careful that the turns do not open too much of the cones 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
 repeat the exercise taking these points into account 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.030
 the exercise becomes more effective if the time of travel is taken and 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.030
 aims to improve achieved at least 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.090
 I show you the techniques necessary to change direction in a very 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.999
 narrow 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.999
 return with accelerator and return with brake 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:28.719
 the return with accelerator is done by exerting a large force on the 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.970
 machine stopped in its rear wheel 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.380
 doing the time and it's done 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.980
 and the machine is rotated having as axis the earth of the motorcyclist of the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.299
 inner side of the curve 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.999
 the speed gear has to be at low speed 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:46.549
 the machine is tilted still some 45 degrees by sliding the hips of the 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.389
 Seat inward of the curve and down 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:50.530
 at this time 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.530
 the foot of the outer ring has to be tightening the stirrup 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.829
 the machine is supported with the arms and leg of the inner side and the 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.519
 flyer slightly inward 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.669
 the accelerator opens abruptly 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.529
 the crochet connects quickly and the waist is rotated and the direction in the 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.529
 what the motorcycle becomes 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.339
 When the machine is turned towards the desired point it stops accelerating 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.289
 and the clot is disconnected almost at the same time 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.399
 this is the main movement of the spin with accelerated 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.399
 the death with brake is realized by the lateral sliding of the wheel 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:29.349
 rear 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.299
 This sliding is caused by the blocking of the rear wheel produced 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.469
 by a total brake on that wheel during the course 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.469
 which is used for the change of direction of the machine 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:40.890
 First 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.859
 exerts the body weight on the front wheel 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.489
 apply the rear brake correctly so that the wheel lock occurs 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.200
 rear 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.139
 spinning the machine in the desired direction 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.870
 let the rear wheel slide out 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.469
 and change the address 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.969
 When the machine has reached the desired point 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:59.110
 stop braking 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.829
 and the machine is returned to the straight position 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.829
 this was the turn with brake 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.359
 now let's look at the wii technique 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:15.040
 first a start race is made with the speed in the first or in the 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:17.519
 second 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.130
 the car is cut and the accelerator is opened then it connects quickly 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:25.129
 the clos at the same time that the steering wheel is pulled 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.849
 let's use this wii technique to test the route on surfaces 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.569
 irregular 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.389
 when the irregularities are small and continuous, it is normally 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.789
 imposition half inclined so that irregularities will be cushioned by 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.059
 the machine itself in this case the machine stays straight and runs to 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:48.430
 a constant speed using the arms the waist and legs to 

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:51.429
 cushion the impacts 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.779
 when there are large continuous irregularities take advantage of the power 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.520
 of the motor to lift the front part of the machine which is put on the 

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:03.819
 peaks of irregularities 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.259
 in this type of management 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.009
 the most important thing is to cushion with the
