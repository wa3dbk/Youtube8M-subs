00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.030

another corner taken by ha beehive loose
in<00:02:32.950> front<00:02:33.159> shot<00:02:34.950> Thomason's<00:02:35.950> goal<00:02:36.189> really

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.339 
in front shot Thomason's goal really
kind<00:02:37.359> of<00:02:37.450> gave<00:02:37.540> us<00:02:37.659> some<00:02:37.840> breathing<00:02:38.049> room<00:02:38.260> a

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
kind of gave us some breathing room a

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.970 
kind of gave us some breathing room a
little<00:02:38.500> bit

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
little bit

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.250 
little bit
it<00:02:39.730> was<00:02:39.849> difficult<00:02:40.090> without<00:02:40.599> question<00:02:41.079> a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
it was difficult without question a

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.619 
it was difficult without question a
place<00:02:41.859> that's<00:02:42.159> kind<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.790> like<00:02:42.939> no<00:02:43.120> other<00:02:43.299> in

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
place that's kind of like no other in

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.839 
place that's kind of like no other in
this<00:02:43.870> region<00:02:44.349> but<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.739> think<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.549> game

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
this region but I think that that game

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.050 
this region but I think that that game
helped<00:02:46.389> us<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:47.319> go<00:02:47.470> down<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.769> Monterrey<00:02:48.069> and

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
helped us to go down to Monterrey and

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.789 
helped us to go down to Monterrey and

coming for a long time before that which
was<00:04:55.470> at<00:04:55.680> least<00:04:55.889> a<00:04:56.070> draw<00:04:56.310> at<00:04:56.460> home<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.880> we

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
was at least a draw at home and we

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.140 
was at least a draw at home and we
advanced<00:04:57.449> I<00:04:58.370> think<00:04:59.370> maybe<00:04:59.550> we<00:04:59.820> kind<00:05:00.090> of

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150

such<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.280> huge<00:05:05.610> game<00:05:06.440> just<00:05:07.440> thinking<00:05:07.770> that<00:05:07.889> we

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
such a huge game just thinking that we

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.250 
such a huge game just thinking that we
really<00:05:08.310> have<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.610> chance<00:05:08.699> to<00:05:09.210> be<00:05:09.570> champions<00:05:10.080> and

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.160 

I<00:07:15.500> think<00:07:16.430> it<00:07:16.520> would<00:07:16.610> be<00:07:16.730> massive<00:07:17.120> if<00:07:17.300> MLS<00:07:17.900> club

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170 
I think it would be massive if MLS club

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.230 
I think it would be massive if MLS club
won<00:07:18.440> the<00:07:18.770> the<00:07:19.190> Champions<00:07:19.640> League<00:07:19.730> I<00:07:20.060> think

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
won the the Champions League I think

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.170 
won the the Champions League I think
that<00:07:20.840> you<00:07:21.440> know<00:07:21.560> for<00:07:22.010> the<00:07:22.100> world<00:07:22.310> to<00:07:22.700> accept
