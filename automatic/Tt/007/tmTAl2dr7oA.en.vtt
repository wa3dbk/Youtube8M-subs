00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
just length so text waxing is basically

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.900 
just length so text waxing is basically
like<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:09.560> texturizer<00:05:10.250> but<00:05:10.580> instead<00:05:10.850> of

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
grabbing the texturizer you take a

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.160 
grabbing the texturizer you take a
relaxer<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.330> you<00:05:14.420> just<00:05:14.600> basically<00:05:14.750> either

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
relaxer and you just basically either

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.440 
relaxer and you just basically either
