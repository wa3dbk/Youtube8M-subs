00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
socket area looks a different color and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.530 
socket area looks a different color and
my<00:01:38.220> face<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.670> different<00:01:39.090> color<00:01:39.270> it's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
my face is a different color it's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.690 
my face is a different color it's
because<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.110> foundation<00:01:40.680> let's<00:01:41.460> get

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
because it's a foundation let's get

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.180 
because it's a foundation let's get
started<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.360> lot<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.900> people<00:01:43.050> who<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.770> darker

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
started a lot of people who are darker

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.520 
started a lot of people who are darker
than<00:01:44.310> medium<00:01:44.670> skin<00:01:44.940> tones<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.450> never<00:01:45.930> find<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
than medium skin tones and never find a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.430 
than medium skin tones and never find a
foundation<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:47.460> affordable<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.180> them<00:01:48.690> so

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
foundation that's affordable for them so

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.100 
foundation that's affordable for them so
that's<00:01:50.340> likely<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.180> good<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.810> neutral

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that's likely really good the neutral

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.139 
that's likely really good the neutral
own<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.380> obviously<00:01:52.710> neutral<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.640> kind<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
own is obviously neutral but it kind of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.080 
own is obviously neutral but it kind of
goes<00:01:54.750> towards<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.259> pinky<00:01:55.680> side<00:01:55.920> whereas<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
goes towards like pinky side whereas the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.330 
goes towards like pinky side whereas the
beige<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.200> more<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.679> the<00:01:58.860> yellowish

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
beige one is more of the yellowish

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.600 
beige one is more of the yellowish
undertone<00:01:59.940> so<00:02:00.179> texture<00:02:00.960> wise<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.530> very<00:02:02.130> good

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
undertone so texture wise it's very good

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.139 
undertone so texture wise it's very good
like<00:02:03.000> liquidy<00:02:04.070> would<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.280> an<00:02:05.340> understatement

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
like liquidy would be an understatement

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.680 
like liquidy would be an understatement
it's<00:02:06.300> like<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.869> river<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:08.310> foundation<00:02:08.970> that

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
it's like a river of foundation that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.840 
it's like a river of foundation that
flows<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.530> coverage<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.430> anywhere

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
flows the coverage of this is anywhere

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.330 
flows the coverage of this is anywhere
from<00:02:12.120> medium<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.840> buildable<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.920> would<00:02:14.160> say

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
from medium to buildable I would say

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.840 
from medium to buildable I would say

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
problematic to match their skin tone but

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.530 
problematic to match their skin tone but
it<00:04:33.980> definitely<00:04:34.130> leave<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.550> in<00:04:34.639> NC<00:04:34.940> 40<00:04:35.330> or
