 this interview on April 14 we have 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.890
 to leave under the stones if it is 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.050
 necessary to give those 10 million 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.599
 votes that the commander always dreamed and 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.970
 We were not able to give him in life now 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.950

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.750

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.920
 satisfaction that he could not see because 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.210

 what we want to see it like me today 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.020
 I came to my family here 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.760
 to see my commander my friend for 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.130

 revolution never ends more in 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.170
 this country for this 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.300
 how exciting to hear those too 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.420
 lyrics of those songs and if I 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.940
 he went back a few years ago they called you 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.520
 the requevista chavista were mentioned 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.440
 so many giving precious moments that 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.060
 I would like to show something to show those 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.210
 memories I will show some memories 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.090
 this was the flyer that circulated in the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.220
 year 99 when the rock movement 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.260
 national gave him cold car support 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.360
 next president of the vecchia is 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.050
 you already what you say join forces 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.910
 for the same ideal Comandante Chávez and 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.490
 he and Paul Goodman the leader of the 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.369
 national rock movement and here he 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.960
 said something that as a military nobody 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.149
 I had wanted not to recruit and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.790
 he complied because everything he said 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.420
 president fulfilled it here I have a 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.420
 another other magazine from 99 when to say 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.610
 this was dangerous recontracted when you 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.560
 I named requeté chavista here is 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.310
 since the year 99 for those who believe 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.140
 that paul gillman came out 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.110
 to make revolution last minute here 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.459
 is the chavista rocker this environment and 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.160
 to my family the costs that we 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.560
 they spit that they will insult us but that 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.450
 made us stronger every day and with more 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.989
 with more interest to keep going 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.540
 in 2002 we were there in the 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.190
 2003 and with that song we were 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.190
 singing with the commander because it was the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.280
 first refinery that was in monagas that 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.319
 we managed to save then from the clutches of 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.450
 the coup plotters practically hit 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.640
 oil and good and another thing that 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.830
 Now, you see these pictures and the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.530
 you can zoom in here is paul gillman in 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.440
 the year 99 guess what has 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.110
 in the arm the bracelet of 4 of 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.540
 February dating this in the 90s was 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.489
 practically a death sentence 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.110
 but here I am and continued to carry the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.000
 bracelet and I'll take it for the rest of 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.349
 my life because because rock is 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.260
 revolution as our 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.819
 next mature president who 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.280
 squalid the attacks because it was rock and 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.590
 revolutionary imagine revolutionaries 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.570
 rockers and worker that we better go to 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.010
 have with president like this who's going to 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.670
 love culture as the president 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.380
 chávez that we're going 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.640
 the sport with President Chávez that 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.640
 will follow everything the president 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.590
 Chávez instilled him for 14 years I think 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.209
 that we have the best one really thank you 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.940

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.250
 that courage to come from Cuba knowing 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.500
 what came to him and come to tell us the 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.880
 line not only left us the program the 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.770
 country not only left us all those 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.680
 missions but he also had the strength 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.260
 to come here practically in his last 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.569
 time from now of lucidity where 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.700

 be he was here he went to see 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.940
 this concert because he is a fan of 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.730
 john lennon and that moment was the 30th 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.440
 December 1980 the acoustic shell of 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.900

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.370
 magnifying glass to see where they are nicole here but 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.560
 Nicholas was for this concert and I 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.240
 he said once and for good what I 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.669
 he was very proud and these days 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.030
 thank you for having named me inside 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.610
 your anecdotes rockera calls us a lot the 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.560
 attention that within the revolution 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.050
 he was also given a space 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.260
 very important rock and especially that 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.500
 important festival that you organize with 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.360
 national rockers following that line 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.580
 and that force that also has this 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.260
 I sing a song because it was born from the 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.450
 black brought the african had like 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.039
 slaves the us from there rock is born the 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.140
 rock born of the suffering of the search 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.610
 of equality of justice and good and 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.990
 I appreciate very much that President Chávez 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.350
 I said it in 2003 in a 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.280
 president in buenos aires when the 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.410
 parish priest in a festival 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.510
 international rock because we have to 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.890
 have rock also in venezuela 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.960
 and we become a music officer 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.580
 urban area that in 2005 becomes the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.790
 gillmanfest and seized the opportunity 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.740
 to say that both the government of 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.930
 capital district as the mayoralty of 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.730
 liberator are not going to suspend the 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.260
 gillmanfest scheduled for March 30 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.560
 because we're going to do it in honor of 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.930
 president to the creator of the festival 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.200
 gillmanfest for 2013 a here in the 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.240
 capital city on March 30 and the 4th of 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.980
 May we will have it in half and that 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.410
 forward because the climate festival 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.370
 efe is a national rock festival 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.050
 where we invite artists 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.180
 international for the national rock is 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.890
 the most important thing in that first 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.530
 photograph that showed us where 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.930
 they were talking about that union of the commander 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.140
 Chávez with the Venezuelan rock that 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.670
 spoke there apart from the information that 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.740
 could be given through the means of 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.140
 communication that this one I'm not going to tell you 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.140
 something really we did not do a 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.460
 Press conference was lost here 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.770
 we reached this agreement if we 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.970
 I can truly read an effort for the 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.080
 same ideal our beautiful homeland 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.880
 venezuela and after coinciding 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.070
 ideologically on all topics 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.750
 both political and ecological because 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.090
 he was an ecological president like bolivia 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.400
 cultural and educational public health 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.340
 critical poverty the abandoned girl the 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.660
 loss of moral values and the union of 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.520
 the family against the security the 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.780
 I fight against drugs 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.660
 tell people who do not know 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.220
 in 1988 this one that is here was the first 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.810
 singer rock in the world in making a 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.640
 propaganda a promotion against 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.770
 drugs I would like to do my call 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.900
 now the hour that is hearing me 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.030
 I want here I am still with that same 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.040
 ideology and I want to continue being the 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.720
 image of the area worldwide as 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.880
 I did it at that time in the year 88 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.919
 because the worst scourge that the 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.530
 Youth is the drug and we who 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.510
 we really carry the rock in his in his 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.290
 positive energy we are against the 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.290
 average of drugs
