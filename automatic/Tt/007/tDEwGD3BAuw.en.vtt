we<00:00:19.020> have<00:00:19.200> another<00:00:19.500> performance<00:00:20.070> review<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
we have another performance review and

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.359 
we have another performance review and
it<00:00:20.700> is<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.180> adidas<00:00:21.630> adizero<00:00:22.529> crazy-like<00:00:23.100> 3

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
it is on the adidas adizero crazy-like 3

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.560 
it is on the adidas adizero crazy-like 3
so<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> being<00:00:24.000> said<00:00:24.090> let's<00:00:24.420> go<00:00:24.540> ahead

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
so with that being said let's go ahead

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.600 
so with that being said let's go ahead
and<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.170> right<00:00:25.290> into<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.619> starting<00:00:26.369> off<00:00:26.460> with

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
and get right into it starting off with

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.160 
and get right into it starting off with
the<00:00:26.730> outsole<00:00:27.060> as<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> can<00:00:27.570> see<00:00:27.780> adidas

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the outsole as you can see adidas

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.480 
the outsole as you can see adidas
implemented<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:28.740> they<00:00:28.830> call<00:00:29.010> wave<00:00:29.250> bone

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
implemented what they call wave bone

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.670 
implemented what they call wave bone
which<00:00:30.180> is<00:00:30.210> very<00:00:30.570> similar<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.960> herringbone

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
which is very similar to herringbone

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.890 
which is very similar to herringbone
it's<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.760> a<00:00:32.850> little<00:00:33.000> bit<00:00:33.120> more<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> wavy

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
it's just a little bit more on the wavy

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.930 
it's just a little bit more on the wavy
side<00:00:34.080> versus<00:00:34.500> angular<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.460> works<00:00:35.670> really

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
side versus angular and it works really

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.119 
side versus angular and it works really
well<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.390> most<00:00:36.780> core<00:00:37.080> conditions<00:00:37.559> obviously

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
well on most core conditions obviously

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.400 
well on most core conditions obviously
quartz<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.090> debris<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:40.020> little<00:00:40.199> bit<00:00:40.290> of

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
quartz with debris and a little bit of

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.900 
quartz with debris and a little bit of
dust<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> things<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.309> you'll<00:00:41.520> limit

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
dust and things like that you'll limit

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.360 
dust and things like that you'll limit
the<00:00:42.000> traction<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> little<00:00:42.720> bit<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.860> far<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.160> it's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
the traction a little bit as far as it's

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.040 
the traction a little bit as far as it's
like<00:00:44.520> stickiness<00:00:45.030> goes<00:00:45.239> mostly<00:00:45.660> because<00:00:45.810> it

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
like stickiness goes mostly because it

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.370 
like stickiness goes mostly because it
is<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.380> pliable<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.070> soft<00:00:47.300> so<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:49.260> know

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
is really pliable and soft so you know

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.680 
is really pliable and soft so you know
if<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.890> something<00:00:50.190> in-between<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
if you have something in-between the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.440 
if you have something in-between the
outsole<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.620> floor<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.250> dust<00:00:53.700> or<00:00:53.940> dirt

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
outsole and the floor like dust or dirt

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.120 
outsole and the floor like dust or dirt
or<00:00:54.630> whatever<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.170> you're<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:55.950> to<00:00:56.010> have

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
or whatever it is you're going to have

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.010 
or whatever it is you're going to have
some<00:00:56.430> sort<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.700> slippage<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.540> clean<00:00:57.780> cord

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
some sort of slippage on a clean cord

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.209 
some sort of slippage on a clean cord
though<00:00:58.170> these<00:00:58.380> things<00:00:58.620> were<00:00:58.770> absolutely

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
though these things were absolutely

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.049 
though these things were absolutely
amazing

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
amazing

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.490 
amazing
the<00:01:00.390> only<00:01:00.510> thing<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.930> will<00:01:01.050> say<00:01:01.260> though<00:01:01.440> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the only thing that I will say though is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.729 
the only thing that I will say though is
that<00:01:01.649> he<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.399> spoils<00:01:02.940> us<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.390> their

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
that he just really spoils us with their

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.290 
that he just really spoils us with their
pure<00:01:04.739> motion<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> crazy<00:01:05.610> quick<00:01:05.910> type<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
pure motion with the crazy quick type of

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.760 
pure motion with the crazy quick type of
traction<00:01:07.020> because<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.410> stuff<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
traction because that stuff is

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.920 
traction because that stuff is
unbelievably<00:01:08.460> awesome<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.060> pretty<00:01:09.660> much

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
unbelievably awesome and pretty much

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.290 
unbelievably awesome and pretty much
anything<00:01:10.229> else<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.710> comparison<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.580> isn't

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
anything else in comparison just isn't

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.210 
anything else in comparison just isn't
as<00:01:12.420> good<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.560> isn't<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.039> good

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
as good not that this isn't a good

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.280 
as good not that this isn't a good
traction<00:01:14.640> source<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:16.229> just

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
traction source because it is it's just

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.680 
traction source because it is it's just
not<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:16.860> good<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.030> know<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> other<00:01:18.420> stuff

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
not as good as you know the other stuff

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.180 
not as good as you know the other stuff
that<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.960> did<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.170> put<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> crazy

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
that it did is put out with the crazy

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.930 
that it did is put out with the crazy
quick<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> row<00:01:20.790> 77032<00:01:21.600> etc<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.760> you<00:01:23.760> know<00:01:23.850> if

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
quick the row 77032 etc so you know if

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.010 
quick the row 77032 etc so you know if
you're<00:01:24.090> looking<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.510> something<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:24.990> just

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
you're looking for something with just

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.929 
you're looking for something with just
perfect<00:01:25.770> traction<00:01:26.190> I<00:01:26.280> would<00:01:26.400> go<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.820> of

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
perfect traction I would go with one of

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.219 
perfect traction I would go with one of
those<00:01:27.060> two<00:01:27.270> models<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.869> you're<00:01:27.990> looking

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
those two models but if you're looking

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.899 
those two models but if you're looking
for<00:01:28.380> something<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.979> traction<00:01:29.250> which

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
for something with good traction which

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.700 
for something with good traction which
this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.330> very<00:01:30.750> good<00:01:30.930> traction<00:01:31.350> then<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.590> would

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
this is very good traction then I would

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.469 
this is very good traction then I would
go<00:01:31.830> with<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.100> guy<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.580> as<00:01:32.760> far<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.000> cushion

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
go with this guy here as far as cushion

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.320 
go with this guy here as far as cushion
the<00:01:33.840> crazy<00:01:34.560> light<00:01:34.799> three<00:01:35.130> sets<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:36.000> really

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
the crazy light three sets really really

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.719 
the crazy light three sets really really
low<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.510> the<00:01:36.659> ground<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.770> foam<00:01:38.130> itself<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
low to the ground and the foam itself is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.469 
low to the ground and the foam itself is
very<00:01:38.970> soft<00:01:39.330> I<00:01:40.580> can't<00:01:41.580> say<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> bad

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
very soft I can't say that it was a bad

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.910 
very soft I can't say that it was a bad
thing<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> like<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.650> kind<00:01:43.830> of

thing because if you like that kind of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.070 
thing because if you like that kind of
soft<00:01:44.189> mushy<00:01:44.580> type<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.180> cushion<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.960> is

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
soft mushy type of cushion this is

performance-wise it wasn't a bad thing
it's<00:03:04.439> just<00:03:04.590> from<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.889> feeling<00:03:05.340> standpoint<00:03:05.909> it

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
it's just from a feeling standpoint it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.929 
it's just from a feeling standpoint it

in my opinion I would like a little bit

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.830 
in my opinion I would like a little bit
thicker<00:03:11.340> material<00:03:11.969> it's<00:03:12.060> not<00:03:12.120> thicker<00:03:12.569> to

thicker material it's not thicker to

thicker material it's not thicker to
wear<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.139> will<00:03:13.230> give<00:03:13.409> you<00:03:13.500> like<00:03:13.650> bunching<00:03:14.189> or

the first hour is that the sprint frame
right<00:04:25.620> back<00:04:25.830> here<00:04:26.159> hopefully<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.120> can<00:04:27.240> see

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419

right back here hopefully you can see
that<00:04:27.599> but<00:04:27.780> right<00:04:27.930> here<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.800> did<00:04:28.949> kind<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.490> hug

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
that but right here it did kind of hug

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.969 
that but right here it did kind of hug
the<00:04:29.789> foot<00:04:29.969> just<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.240> little<00:04:30.270> bit<00:04:30.599> too<00:04:30.780> tight<00:04:30.990> but

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
the foot just a little bit too tight but

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.790 
the foot just a little bit too tight but
the<00:04:32.250> sprint<00:04:32.639> frame<00:04:32.760> is<00:04:32.940> so<00:04:33.090> thin<00:04:33.449> now<00:04:33.800> this

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
the sprint frame is so thin now this

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.290 
the sprint frame is so thin now this
thing<00:04:35.039> like<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:35.310> can<00:04:35.460> actually<00:04:35.789> see<00:04:36.060> through

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
thing like you can actually see through

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.399 
thing like you can actually see through
like<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.139> plastic<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:37.800> all<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:37.979> stuff

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
like the plastic and all that stuff

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.769 
like the plastic and all that stuff
they've<00:04:38.559> thinned<00:04:38.889> it<00:04:38.979> out<00:04:39.099> so<00:04:39.399> much<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:39.909> that

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:40.779 
they've thinned it out so much that that

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.570 
they've thinned it out so much that that
thing<00:04:41.019> broke<00:04:41.319> in<00:04:41.529> really<00:04:42.099> really<00:04:42.309> quickly

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
thing broke in really really quickly

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.070 
thing broke in really really quickly
like<00:04:42.909> your<00:04:43.059> Heat<00:04:43.300> and<00:04:43.330> all<00:04:43.569> that<00:04:43.689> stuff<00:04:43.899> from

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
like your Heat and all that stuff from

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.379 
like your Heat and all that stuff from
your<00:04:44.199> feet<00:04:44.469> kind<00:04:45.189> of<00:04:45.279> expanded<00:04:45.789> that<00:04:45.879> plastic

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
your feet kind of expanded that plastic

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.329 
your feet kind of expanded that plastic
a<00:04:46.479> little<00:04:46.689> bit<00:04:46.809> and<00:04:46.989> it<00:04:47.559> basically<00:04:47.860> made<00:04:48.099> it<00:04:48.129> to

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:48.339 
a little bit and it basically made it to

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:50.759 
a little bit and it basically made it to
like<00:04:48.489> a<00:04:48.519> perfect<00:04:49.089> fit<00:04:49.149> for<00:04:49.389> my<00:04:49.869> foot<00:04:50.169> I<00:04:50.379> don't

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:50.769 
like a perfect fit for my foot I don't

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:52.019 
like a perfect fit for my foot I don't
know<00:04:50.860> if<00:04:50.949> it's<00:04:51.099> molding<00:04:51.459> or<00:04:51.580> whatever<00:04:51.819> but

00:04:52.019 --> 00:04:52.029 
know if it's molding or whatever but

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:54.809 
know if it's molding or whatever but
that's<00:04:52.149> kind<00:04:52.300> of<00:04:52.330> how<00:04:52.449> it<00:04:52.569> felt<00:04:52.809> so<00:04:53.639> and<00:04:54.639> then

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
that's kind of how it felt so and then

two and that's pretty much all you got
to<00:05:18.579> say<00:05:18.699> about<00:05:18.729> it<00:05:19.059> in<00:05:19.389> terms<00:05:19.599> of<00:05:19.869> actual

to say about it in terms of actual
support<00:05:20.529> it's<00:05:21.309> kind<00:05:21.519> of<00:05:21.579> like<00:05:21.819> a<00:05:21.999> half<00:05:22.300> and

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
support it's kind of like a half and

stuff in the base the base meaning the

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.759 
stuff in the base the base meaning the
bottom<00:05:26.589> of<00:05:26.679> the<00:05:26.769> shoe<00:05:26.949> is<00:05:27.179> pretty<00:05:28.179> much<00:05:28.300> great

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
all three of them this is definitely the

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.380 
all three of them this is definitely the
best<00:07:09.980> that<00:07:10.160> they've<00:07:10.280> done<00:07:10.460> so<00:07:10.730> far<00:07:11.030> in<00:07:11.240> my

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.390 
best that they've done so far in my

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.060 
best that they've done so far in my
personal<00:07:11.810> opinion<00:07:11.900> all<00:07:12.410> you<00:07:12.590> got<00:07:12.710> to<00:07:12.830> do<00:07:12.950> is

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
personal opinion all you got to do is

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.620 
personal opinion all you got to do is
make<00:07:13.250> sure<00:07:13.280> that<00:07:13.460> you<00:07:13.790> go<00:07:13.970> up<00:07:14.120> half<00:07:14.330> a<00:07:14.420> size

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630 
make sure that you go up half a size

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.270 
make sure that you go up half a size
because<00:07:14.990> the<00:07:15.080> sizing<00:07:15.500> is<00:07:15.620> a<00:07:15.650> little<00:07:15.920> bit<00:07:16.040> small

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 
because the sizing is a little bit small

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.730 
because the sizing is a little bit small
and<00:07:16.720> other<00:07:17.720> than<00:07:17.900> that<00:07:18.050> if<00:07:18.230> you<00:07:18.350> have<00:07:18.530> weak

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.250

ligaments<00:07:19.430> and<00:07:19.520> your<00:07:19.640> ankles<00:07:19.970> get<00:07:20.870> something
