00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
alphabet folder here there is where you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660 
alphabet folder here there is where you

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.069 
there's also an eye one and an item and
the<00:00:44.190> reason<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.730> because<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.840> just

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the reason for that because really just

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.180 
the reason for that because really just
because<00:00:46.230> there<00:00:46.379> were<00:00:46.440> two<00:00:46.590> different<00:00:46.770> designs

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
because there were two different designs

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.040 
because there were two different designs
in<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> original<00:00:47.879> logo<00:00:48.059> itself<00:00:48.390> got<00:00:48.690> two<00:00:48.840> eyes

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
in the original logo itself got two eyes

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.720 
in the original logo itself got two eyes
and<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.440> two<00:00:49.559> G<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.399> two<00:00:50.550> options

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and got two G so you have two options

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.100 
and got two G so you have two options
really<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.329> choose<00:00:51.510> whatever<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.870> think

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
really just choose whatever you think

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.470
