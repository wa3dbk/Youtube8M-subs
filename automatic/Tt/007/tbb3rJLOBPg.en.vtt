00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
this particular instance it's

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.200 
this particular instance it's
demonstrative<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.390> fact<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.850> over<00:00:50.850> time

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
demonstrative of the fact that over time

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
he had acquired so much power that

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.770 
he had acquired so much power that
people<00:00:53.489> were<00:00:53.820> afraid<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.270> approach<00:00:54.840> him<00:00:56.780> about

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
people were afraid to approach him about

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.049 
people were afraid to approach him about
things<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.469> saw<00:00:58.710> going<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.520> just

things that they saw going on that just

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.000 
things that they saw going on that just
weren't<00:01:01.020> right<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:02.550> don't<00:01:03.180> believe<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.110> my

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
weren't right and I don't believe in my

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.630 
weren't right and I don't believe in my

anything<00:01:09.650> helped<00:01:10.650> anything<00:01:10.920> because<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.640> think

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
anything helped anything because I think

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.179 
anything helped anything because I think
early<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> athletic<00:01:13.229> athletic<00:01:13.619> director<00:01:14.159> I

early the athletic athletic director I

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.999 
early the athletic athletic director I
think<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.760> Tim<00:01:15.030> Curley<00:01:15.409> didn't<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
think that Tim Curley didn't have a

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.640 
think that Tim Curley didn't have a
third<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> say<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.439> on

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
third of the say and what was going on

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.160 
third of the say and what was going on
at<00:01:19.830> Penn<00:01:20.040> State<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.720> supposedly<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> man<00:01:22.020> that

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
at Penn State as supposedly the man that

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.039 
at Penn State as supposedly the man that
worked<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.590> him<00:01:22.799> did<00:01:23.340> being<00:01:23.970> Joe<00:01:24.270> Paterno<00:01:24.630> Joe

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
worked for him did being Joe Paterno Joe

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.469 
worked for him did being Joe Paterno Joe
Paterno<00:01:25.439> was<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.890> man<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.369> effective<00:01:27.119> charge

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
Paterno was the man in effective charge

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.170 
Paterno was the man in effective charge
of<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.229> Penn<00:01:28.439> State<00:01:28.590> program<00:01:29.180> unequivocally

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
of the Penn State program unequivocally

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.660 
of the Penn State program unequivocally
I<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.930> he<00:01:31.110> probably<00:01:31.350> had<00:01:31.710> more<00:01:32.130> power<00:01:32.400> at

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
I think he probably had more power at

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.730 
I think he probably had more power at
Penn<00:01:32.850> State<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.600> obviously<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.259> chairman<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
Penn State and obviously the chairman of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.730 
Penn State and obviously the chairman of
the<00:01:35.189> university<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:37.079> I'm<00:01:37.170> not<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.530> saying

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the university and I'm not just saying

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
the university and I'm not just saying
that<00:01:37.979> Joe<00:01:38.159> Paterno<00:01:38.189> has<00:01:38.909> too<00:01:39.600> much<00:01:39.780> power<00:01:40.049> I

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that Joe Paterno has too much power I

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
that Joe Paterno has too much power I
think<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.740> it's<00:01:40.979> probably<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.909> know

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
think that it's probably a you know

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
think that it's probably a you know
apparent<00:01:42.659> throughout<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.110> rest<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
one of the stunning things is that there

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.210 
one of the stunning things is that there

day well first of all I'll address the
fact<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.400> students<00:03:29.790> riding<00:03:30.300> is

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
fact that the students riding is

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.410 
fact that the students riding is
absolutely<00:03:31.740> ludicrous<00:03:31.920> because<00:03:32.400> these<00:03:32.850> these

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
absolutely ludicrous because these these

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.200 
absolutely ludicrous because these these
events<00:03:33.960> that<00:03:34.170> happened<00:03:34.650> happened<00:03:35.370> way<00:03:35.790> before

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
events that happened happened way before

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.480 
events that happened happened way before
they<00:03:36.390> were<00:03:36.450> even<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.710> school<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.100> students

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
they were even in the school of students

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.100 
they were even in the school of students
number<00:03:38.730> one<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.270> I<00:03:39.330> think<00:03:39.390> if<00:03:39.660> you<00:03:39.750> took<00:03:39.930> them

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
number one and I think if you took them

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.470 
number one and I think if you took them
aside<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.650> asked<00:03:41.010> them<00:03:41.160> really<00:03:41.970> what's<00:03:42.180> going

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
aside and asked them really what's going

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.790 
aside and asked them really what's going
on<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.810> what<00:03:42.900> are<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.140> events<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.620> what

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
on and what are the events and what

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.320 
on and what are the events and what
happened<00:03:44.220> probably<00:03:44.580> only<00:03:44.730> half<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.150> them

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
happened probably only half of them

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.810 
happened probably only half of them
would<00:03:45.450> really<00:03:45.690> know<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:47.070> don't<00:03:47.640> put<00:03:47.790> a

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
would really know and so I don't put a

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.350 
would really know and so I don't put a

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
lot of stock in in in that deal that

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.030 
lot of stock in in in that deal that
they're<00:03:51.540> riding<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:51.990> think<00:03:52.200> it's<00:03:52.530> almost<00:03:52.830> the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
they're riding I think it's almost the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.369 
know that Joe would have known if I miss
my<00:04:51.830> chemistry<00:04:52.340> class<00:04:52.449> he<00:04:53.449> was<00:04:53.539> that<00:04:53.780> on<00:04:53.930> top<00:04:54.199> of
