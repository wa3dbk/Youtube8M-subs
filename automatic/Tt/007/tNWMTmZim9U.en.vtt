00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello all very good I hope you are 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:06.390
 going very well in today's video 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.150
 We will see how to modify the menu that we 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.870
 appears when choosing with what 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.000
 application we want to complete the action 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.790
 the menu is this as you see tells us with 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.800
 what menu with each publication do we want 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.340
 complete the action as you see this is the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.110
 menu that they have changed 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.240
 we can choose if we want to make 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.270
 choose this action forever and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.219
 just with a touch will open us the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.219
 application that we choose as you can see 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.940
 well this is an exposed module called 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.730
 complete action plus which we 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.680
 will allow to modify as I said the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.480
 menu that you just saw for it not 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.880
 they will need to have xbox installed 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.290
 framework I will leave here my video if it is 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.830
 who do not know what that is or how 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.830
 install it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.730
 and good here they have the application as 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.160
 come complete edition plus 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.960
 I already have it installed, you are 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.909
 they would have to go download and look for the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.900
 module with the name they will have there 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.910
 written on the screen and they will have to 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.250
 download as you see now is in the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.800
 version 1.6 point 9 and what I 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.570
 surprising is that I always do not know if each 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.580
 day but at least every two or three days 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.470
 they update it that surprises me 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.570
 quite 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.460
 well once installed you have to go 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.110
 to modules and activate the complete action 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.080
 plus once they activate it, restart 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.330
 your mobile and open the good application 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.850
 here in the options we will have the option 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.190
 to show or not the box always as 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.050
 come here this box that says 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.730
 to select if we want this 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.310
 application forever we put it what 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.170
 we can enable or disable 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.680
 and then show the administrator 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.399
 applications would be this button like that of 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.799
 adjustments that if we touch it we can 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.200
 activate or deactivate the application that 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.479
 we want it or not to appear in the menu 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.179
 we can also change the theme of the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.860
 application both clear and dark and in 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.019
 change designs and we enable it 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.569
 we can change the menu theme 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.269
 we could for example put it dark and 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.000
 As you can see, it becomes black in my 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.370
 case I prefer it clearer the style of 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.040
 Design can be list or grid 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.159
 as you are seeing in my case I prefer 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.690
 lists since I find it easier 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.879
 text size we can be great 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.879
 extra large or normal as they see that would be 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.620
 the extra large I'll just leave normal and 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.400
 well this also modifies the menu 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.470
 when we want to share something as you see 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.060
 this appears to us to test if 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.400
 we touch here we can choose what 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.370
 application we want it to not appear or not 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.409
 when sharing a file in 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.569
 my case for example I do not think that ever 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:56.290
 share a file with the translator 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.709
 google nor with next file explorer 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.799
 and well my visual context has to be 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.629
 as you can see there is a pretty complete module 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.969
 that is always updated as you see now 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.719
 the applications that we play no longer 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.950
 they appear in the sharing menu 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.629
 we can always do this and 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.700
 remember that you always have to create 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.079
 At least two applications 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.790
 I remember by itself it will change to 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.180
 select the application with only one 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.040
 touch as you can see if we keep 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.620
 pressed some application sends us 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.930
 direct to the settings of it as 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.519
 come and well I think that here it would be 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.349
 the review of this module a video a 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.419
 little fast but you liked it 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.319
 Any doubt do not forget to leave it in 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:40.689
 your comments to be answered 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.700
 if they have any good that was all 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.189
 see you next time and greetings see you 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.950
 in today's video I will show you the 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.079
 review of the engine or motorcycle that 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.189
 I recommend that you put the quality of this 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.189
 hd video
