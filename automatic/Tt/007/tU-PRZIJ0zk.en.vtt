00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.080
 hi guys, how are you waiting 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.270
 that very well the theme of this video is 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.480
 difference of cubes and for that we have 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.610
 the next exercise x something less 8 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.730
 good guys first thing we're going to do 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.760
 is to rewrite this amount x to the cube what 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.720
 I write x again as the sign 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.449
 less also now it's 8 is cube of 2 is 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.650
 say 8 is the same as 2 cubed since 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:41.140
 2 for 244 for 28 well and this we have 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.120
 here is a difference of cubes then 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.309
 to factor, what are we going to do? 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.039
 next property and here we have it 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.500
 then the difference of cubes to kubica 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:53.649
 minus b cubed is equal to the following 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.190
 multiplication minus b by a square 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.140
 more bird plus b square if we apply this 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.440
 property to our exercise we have 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.059
 that the value of a is x the value of bs 2 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.520
 then we have the following 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.930
 We open the parentheses and write to 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.450
 minus b is to say x minus 2 we close 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.619
 we open the other parenthesis we put the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.920
 square as a is x the square would be x 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:28.220
 squared we write the plus sign to x 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:33.370
 b ie x by 2 equals 2 x + b al 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.830
 square as you see is 22 squared is 4 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.830
 then boys to conclude the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:44.820
 Factoring from x to cube minus 8 is 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.820
 equal to x2 for x squared plus 2 x 4
