00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.740 
costs twenty dollars so I know
that's<00:06:40.050> expensive<00:06:40.500> but<00:06:41.490> it's<00:06:42.240> hard<00:06:42.450> for<00:06:42.570> me<00:06:42.660> to

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
that's expensive but it's hard for me to

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.510 
that's expensive but it's hard for me to
find<00:06:42.900> primers<00:06:43.320> that<00:06:43.350> don't<00:06:43.680> break<00:06:43.890> me<00:06:44.070> out<00:06:44.100> or

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
find primers that don't break me out or

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.040 
find primers that don't break me out or
they<00:06:44.880> actually<00:06:45.300> work<00:06:45.450> the<00:06:45.600> way<00:06:45.690> I<00:06:45.720> want<00:06:45.960> them

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
they actually work the way I want them

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.260 
they actually work the way I want them
to<00:06:46.230> work<00:06:46.380> and<00:06:46.560> I<00:06:46.620> like<00:06:46.800> this<00:06:46.920> one<00:06:46.980> because<00:06:47.270> it

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
to work and I like this one because it

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.630 
to work and I like this one because it
has<00:06:48.570> a<00:06:48.960> formula<00:06:49.320> that's<00:06:49.500> really<00:06:50.280> great<00:06:50.460> for

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
has a formula that's really great for

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.060 
has a formula that's really great for
dehydrated<00:06:51.360> skin<00:06:51.570> types<00:06:51.990> or<00:06:52.290> really<00:06:52.830> dry<00:06:53.010> skin

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
dehydrated skin types or really dry skin

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.820 
dehydrated skin types or really dry skin
types<00:06:53.720> so<00:06:54.720> just<00:06:54.930> kind<00:06:55.080> of<00:06:55.110> put<00:06:55.320> some<00:06:55.500> moisture

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
types so just kind of put some moisture

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.440 
types so just kind of put some moisture
back<00:06:56.010> in<00:06:56.190> my<00:06:56.310> face<00:06:56.340> and<00:06:56.790> it<00:06:56.940> keeps<00:06:57.120> my<00:06:57.270> face

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
back in my face and it keeps my face

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.600 
back in my face and it keeps my face
really<00:06:57.720> soft<00:06:58.110> and<00:06:58.380> it<00:06:58.800> definitely<00:06:59.010> holds<00:06:59.370> the

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
really soft and it definitely holds the

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:00.890 
really soft and it definitely holds the
makeup<00:06:59.880> all<00:07:00.030> day<00:07:00.210> so<00:07:00.270> I've<00:07:00.540> really<00:07:00.780> been

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:20.790 
for about three years though but the

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.540 
for about three years though but the
last<00:07:21.060> half<00:07:21.540> a<00:07:21.660> year<00:07:21.870> i<00:07:22.050> was<00:07:22.350> using<00:07:22.590> NARS<00:07:23.100> and

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
last half a year i was using NARS and

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.160 
last half a year i was using NARS and
I'm<00:07:23.640> not<00:07:23.850> sure<00:07:23.880> if<00:07:24.120> that<00:07:24.150> was<00:07:24.390> what<00:07:25.020> was

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.170 
I'm not sure if that was what was

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.200 
I'm not sure if that was what was
breaking<00:07:25.500> me<00:07:25.620> out<00:07:25.650> I've<00:07:26.310> been<00:07:26.610> trying<00:07:26.850> to<00:07:27.090> go

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
breaking me out I've been trying to go

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.300 
breaking me out I've been trying to go
back<00:07:27.420> to<00:07:27.570> this<00:07:27.720> Revlon<00:07:27.930> one<00:07:28.290> because<00:07:28.740> i<00:07:29.100> think

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
back to this Revlon one because i think

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.460 
back to this Revlon one because i think
the<00:07:29.400> NARS<00:07:29.580> one<00:07:29.790> completely<00:07:30.150> broke<00:07:30.390> me<00:07:30.570> out<00:07:30.600> so

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470 
the NARS one completely broke me out so

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.800 
the NARS one completely broke me out so
if<00:07:32.130> my<00:07:32.310> acne<00:07:32.580> starts<00:07:32.820> going<00:07:33.090> away<00:07:33.210> then<00:07:33.660> I'll

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:33.810 
if my acne starts going away then I'll

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.960 
if my acne starts going away then I'll
know<00:07:33.960> that<00:07:34.170> the<00:07:34.590> NARS<00:07:34.830> was<00:07:35.130> the<00:07:35.250> problem<00:07:35.490> and<00:07:35.910> I

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:35.970 
know that the NARS was the problem and I

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.550 
know that the NARS was the problem and I
need<00:07:36.090> to<00:07:36.270> start<00:07:36.450> using<00:07:36.630> this<00:07:36.840> more<00:07:36.900> but<00:07:37.110> I<00:07:37.290> like

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 
need to start using this more but I like

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.380 
need to start using this more but I like
this<00:07:37.740> because<00:07:37.920> keeps<00:07:38.730> the<00:07:38.850> moisture<00:07:39.000> in<00:07:39.180> my

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:39.390
