we<00:05:27.770> want<00:05:27.920> to<00:05:28.040> do<00:05:28.190> is<00:05:28.340> taste<00:05:28.640> it<00:05:28.910> right<00:05:29.180> because

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
we want to do is taste it right because

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.910 
we want to do is taste it right because
we<00:05:29.600> want<00:05:29.750> to<00:05:29.780> make<00:05:29.930> sure<00:05:29.960> we<00:05:30.230> have<00:05:30.380> enough<00:05:30.410> salt

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
we want to make sure we have enough salt

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.820 
we want to make sure we have enough salt
and<00:05:31.690> this<00:05:32.690> would<00:05:32.840> be<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.020> perfect<00:05:33.230> time<00:05:33.440> to

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
and this would be the perfect time to

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.040 
and this would be the perfect time to
add<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.280> so<00:05:35.270> I'm<00:05:35.330> going<00:05:35.450> to<00:05:35.480> go<00:05:35.570> ahead<00:05:35.690> and<00:05:35.930> take

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
add it so I'm going to go ahead and take

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.880 
add it so I'm going to go ahead and take
a<00:05:36.080> little<00:05:36.320> taste<00:05:36.530> and<00:05:36.830> see<00:05:37.040> where<00:05:37.190> we're<00:05:37.310> at

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
a little taste and see where we're at

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.170 
a little taste and see where we're at
pretty<00:05:39.890> close<00:05:40.190> I<00:05:40.490> think<00:05:40.790> it<00:05:40.880> needs<00:05:41.000> just<00:05:41.150> a

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
pretty close I think it needs just a

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.950 
pretty close I think it needs just a
little<00:05:41.210> bit<00:05:41.510> more<00:05:41.660> salt<00:05:43.870> sprinkle<00:05:44.870> that

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
little bit more salt sprinkle that

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.440 
little bit more salt sprinkle that
around<00:05:45.020> and<00:05:45.380> I'm<00:05:45.440> gonna<00:05:45.530> let<00:05:45.680> this<00:05:45.800> cook<00:05:46.010> maybe

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
around and I'm gonna let this cook maybe

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.650 
around and I'm gonna let this cook maybe
two<00:05:47.450> more<00:05:47.720> minutes<00:05:49.210> that's<00:05:50.210> all<00:05:50.360> its<00:05:50.510> going<00:05:50.600> to

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
two more minutes that's all its going to

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.240 
two more minutes that's all its going to
need<00:05:50.810> it<00:05:50.960> tastes<00:05:51.170> great<00:05:51.680> it<00:05:51.890> smells

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250
