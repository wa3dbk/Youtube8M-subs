something really special for you this is

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.009 
something really special for you this is
the<00:00:09.360> Knight's<00:00:09.750> armament<00:00:10.759> sr-25<00:00:11.790> or<00:00:12.030> if<00:00:12.870> you

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
the Knight's armament sr-25 or if you

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.570 
the Knight's armament sr-25 or if you
want<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> little<00:00:13.679> bit<00:00:13.769> more<00:00:13.950> specific

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
want to be a little bit more specific

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.310 
want to be a little bit more specific
this<00:00:14.969> one's<00:00:15.210> closer<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> m110<00:00:16.920> SI<00:00:17.609> SS<00:00:18.320> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
this one's closer to the m110 SI SS the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.870 
this one's closer to the m110 SI SS the
distinguishing<00:00:19.920> difference<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.609> really

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
distinguishing difference is really

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.460 
distinguishing difference is really
because<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.480> one<00:00:21.660> actually<00:00:21.810> comes<00:00:22.170> with<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
because this one actually comes with a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.040 
because this one actually comes with a
six<00:00:22.769> position<00:00:23.220> collapsible<00:00:24.000> stock<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.990> is

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
six position collapsible stock this is

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.400 
six position collapsible stock this is
the<00:00:25.170> LMT<00:00:25.529> Salmaan<00:00:26.099> stock<00:00:26.599> if<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.840> wanted<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the LMT Salmaan stock if you wanted to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.769 
the LMT Salmaan stock if you wanted to
have<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.070> actual<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.510> would<00:00:30.630> have

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
have the actual one and you would have

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.310 
have the actual one and you would have
the<00:00:30.960> full<00:00:31.230> full<00:00:32.160> stock<00:00:32.430> right<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:34.050> one

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the full full stock right and this one

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.780 
the full full stock right and this one
instead<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.829> having<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.460> barrel<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
instead of having just the barrel in the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.459 
instead of having just the barrel in the
end<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.090> got<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> flash<00:00:36.570> hider<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.290> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
end it's got the flash hider so this is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.819 
end it's got the flash hider so this is
a<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.890> bit<00:00:38.010> closer<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.879> m110<00:00:39.829> another

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
a little bit closer to the m110 another

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.130 
a little bit closer to the m110 another
distinguishing<00:00:41.399> feature<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.480> new

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
distinguishing feature is that the new

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170 
distinguishing feature is that the new
lower<00:00:43.469> actually<00:00:44.190> has<00:00:44.399> ambidextrous<00:00:45.149> controls

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
lower actually has ambidextrous controls

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.779 
lower actually has ambidextrous controls
so<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:46.020> bolt<00:00:46.260> release<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.950> side<00:00:47.190> you

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
so your bolt release on this side you

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.549 
so your bolt release on this side you
have<00:00:47.820> your<00:00:48.030> bolt<00:00:48.300> lock<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> bolt<00:00:48.899> release<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
have your bolt lock and bolt release and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.040 
have your bolt lock and bolt release and
then<00:00:49.770> mag<00:00:50.250> release<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.879> both<00:00:51.090> side<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
selector on both sides this one's got a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.600 
selector on both sides this one's got a

sight<00:01:05.909> which<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.750> very<00:01:06.960> cool<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:07.799> if

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
sight which is very cool just because if

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.950

front end if something tends to go
farther<00:01:14.939> forward<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> really<00:01:16.049> needed<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
farther forward if you really needed to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.050 
farther forward if you really needed to
you<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.710> mount<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.580> way<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.939> end

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
you can mount it all the way to the end

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.039 
you can mount it all the way to the end
without<00:01:18.240> having<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.780> worry<00:01:18.990> about

without having to worry about

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.789 
without having to worry about
interference<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> front<00:01:21.000> sight<00:01:21.590> now<00:01:22.590> this

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
interference with a front sight now this

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.149 
interference with a front sight now this
one<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.220> also<00:01:23.520> set<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.570> where<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.619> got<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
one is also set up to where it's got the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.399 
one is also set up to where it's got the
gate<00:01:26.610> latch<00:01:26.880> connector<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> sr-25

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410 
gate latch connector for the sr-25
suppressor<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.369> believe<00:01:30.000> there's<00:01:30.210> two

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
suppressor I believe there's two

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
suppressor I believe there's two
different<00:01:30.570> types<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.530> for

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
different types that you can get for

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.460 
different types that you can get for
this<00:01:32.220> gun<00:01:32.570> just<00:01:33.570> different<00:01:33.869> lengths<00:01:34.170> really

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
this gun just different lengths really

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.230 
this gun just different lengths really
but<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> classic<00:01:35.579> dimpled

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
but it's got the classic dimpled

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
but it's got the classic dimpled
suppressor<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.990> can<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.470> buy<00:01:37.979> from

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
suppressor that you can you can buy from

that's very cool just standard across
the<00:02:03.899> board<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.159> uses<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.549> lot<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> familiar

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689

the board and it uses a lot of familiar
controls<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> ar-15<00:02:08.129> like<00:02:08.550> well

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
controls of the ar-15 like well

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.639 
controls of the ar-15 like well
basically<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.750> controls<00:02:10.140> are<00:02:10.259> all<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.440> same

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
basically the controls are all the same

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.170 
basically the controls are all the same
and<00:02:10.920> uses<00:02:11.280> some<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.730> similar

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and uses some of the similar

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.390 
and uses some of the similar
parts<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.569> your<00:02:12.599> trigger<00:02:13.049> your<00:02:13.469> grip<00:02:13.769> you

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
parts like your trigger your grip you

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.789 
parts like your trigger your grip you
know<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.549> can<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:15.269> use<00:02:15.420> whatever<00:02:15.799> spec

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
know you can you can use whatever spec

know you can you can use whatever spec
AR<00:02:17.129> stocks<00:02:17.549> with<00:02:17.819> it<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.239> just<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.840> lot<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.109> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
AR stocks with it and just a lot of the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.979 
AR stocks with it and just a lot of the
parts<00:02:19.500> compatibility<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.989> basically

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
parts compatibility is basically

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.309 
parts compatibility is basically
straight<00:02:22.290> across<00:02:23.060> now<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.510> one<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.049> actually

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
straight across now this one is actually

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.099 
straight across now this one is actually
particularly<00:02:26.250> special<00:02:26.760> because<00:02:26.969> the<00:02:27.659> upper

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
particularly special because the upper

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.530 
particularly special because the upper
so<00:02:28.439> this<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:28.829> brand<00:02:29.159> new<00:02:29.280> lower<00:02:29.609> but<00:02:30.389> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
so this is a brand new lower but the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.319 
so this is a brand new lower but the
upper<00:02:31.049> actually<00:02:31.739> comes<00:02:32.069> from<00:02:32.459> Knights

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
upper actually comes from Knights

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.470 
upper actually comes from Knights
actually<00:02:34.170> came<00:02:34.469> back<00:02:34.829> from<00:02:35.099> CAG<00:02:35.459> or<00:02:35.819> Delta

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
actually came back from CAG or Delta

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.920 
actually came back from CAG or Delta
Force

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
Force

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.740 
Force
so<00:02:37.260> essentially<00:02:37.680> Delta<00:02:38.430> use<00:02:38.969> these<00:02:39.329> uppers

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
so essentially Delta use these uppers

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.770 
so essentially Delta use these uppers
for<00:02:40.079> training<00:02:41.040> or<00:02:41.219> whatever<00:02:41.510> whether<00:02:42.510> they

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
for training or whatever whether they

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.839 
for training or whatever whether they
use<00:02:43.200> them<00:02:43.620> for<00:02:43.650> I'll<00:02:44.159> leave<00:02:44.370> I'll<00:02:44.639> leave<00:02:44.819> that

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
use them for I'll leave I'll leave that

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.110 
use them for I'll leave I'll leave that
up<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.659> but<00:02:46.409> these<00:02:46.950> were<00:02:47.099> actually<00:02:47.579> in<00:02:47.819> use

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
up to you but these were actually in use

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.509 
up to you but these were actually in use
uppers<00:02:48.629> that<00:02:48.659> were<00:02:49.109> sent<00:02:49.470> back<00:02:49.799> to<00:02:49.829> Knights

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
uppers that were sent back to Knights

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.399 
uppers that were sent back to Knights
because<00:02:50.970> they've<00:02:51.180> got<00:02:51.419> they<00:02:51.689> got<00:02:51.720> upgrades

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
because they've got they got upgrades

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.890 
because they've got they got upgrades
and<00:02:52.909> Knights<00:02:53.909> is<00:02:54.120> actually<00:02:54.450> just<00:02:54.629> putting

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
their production of sr25 s is actually

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.339
