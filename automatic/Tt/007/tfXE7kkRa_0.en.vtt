00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the way this is a tiny tactical

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.420

prototype so I am I afraid to say that

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249 
prototype so I am I afraid to say that
you<00:01:17.549> guys<00:01:17.729> cannot<00:01:18.090> pick<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.570> weapon<00:01:19.080> up

since they did only come out with

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.580 
since they did only come out with
limited<00:01:22.460> quantities<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.979> mold<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:27.590> if
