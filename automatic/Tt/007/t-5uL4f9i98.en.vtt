regular bottleneck player it's made by

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.920 
regular bottleneck player it's made by
diamond<00:00:43.649> bottlenecks<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> only<00:00:44.930> slide

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
diamond bottlenecks it's the only slide

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.229 
diamond bottlenecks it's the only slide
in<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> world<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.460> invented<00:00:48.090> it

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
in the world like like it I invented it

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.180 
in the world like like it I invented it
some<00:00:48.450> years<00:00:48.690> ago<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.289> transformed<00:00:50.039> my

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
some years ago and it's transformed my

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.000 
some years ago and it's transformed my
playing<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:51.180> half<00:00:51.390> glass<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.500> half

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
playing it's half glass and half

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.360 
playing it's half glass and half
stainless<00:00:53.820> steel<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> worked<00:00:55.680> hard<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.160> find

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
stainless steel so I worked hard to find

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.189 
stainless steel so I worked hard to find
the<00:00:56.460> right<00:00:56.579> weight<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.719> right<00:00:57.870> type<00:00:58.170> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the right weight and the right type of

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.260 
the right weight and the right type of
type<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.559> glass<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.250> give<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> tone<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> was

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
type of glass to give me the tone I was

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.840 
type of glass to give me the tone I was
looking<00:01:00.600> for<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.980> two<00:01:02.160> slides<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.670> one

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
looking for and it's two slides in one

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.329 
looking for and it's two slides in one
so<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.510> used<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.870> one<00:01:04.049> slide<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.159> like

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so you get used to one slide if you like

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.570 
so you get used to one slide if you like
the<00:01:05.519> sound<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.200> glass<00:01:07.409> certain<00:01:08.070> sounds

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the sound of the glass certain sounds

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.960 
the sound of the glass certain sounds
certain<00:01:09.299> guitars<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.110> use<00:01:10.320> that

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
certain guitars then you use that

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.859 
certain guitars then you use that
alternatively<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.390> turn<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
alternatively you can just turn it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.240 
alternatively you can just turn it
around<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.500> use<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.950> metal<00:01:14.400> side<00:01:14.659> it's

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
around and and use the metal side it's

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.270 
around and and use the metal side it's
certainly<00:01:17.250> transformed<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.060> plane<00:01:19.280> having

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
certainly transformed my plane having

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.460 
certainly transformed my plane having
sent<00:01:20.610> down<00:01:20.820> I'll<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.600> fluff<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> few<00:01:22.200> notes

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
sent down I'll just fluff a few notes

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.050 
sent down I'll just fluff a few notes
for<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:03:26.690 

now

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.760 

you
