00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
dropping 57 kills here but if I hadn't

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.630 
dropping 57 kills here but if I hadn't
been<00:00:47.720> trying<00:00:48.110> for<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.500> Moab<00:00:48.920> I<00:00:49.160> probably

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
been trying for the Moab I probably

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.810 
been trying for the Moab I probably
would<00:00:50.090> have<00:00:50.150> dropped<00:00:50.360> like<00:00:50.629> 70<00:00:51.170> or<00:00:51.290> 80<00:00:51.590> I<00:00:51.980> went

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
would have dropped like 70 or 80 I went

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.580 
would have dropped like 70 or 80 I went
through<00:00:53.059> my<00:00:53.210> killstreaks<00:00:53.480> twice<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:54.530> the

first<00:00:54.800> time<00:00:55.040> through<00:00:55.430> I<00:00:55.460> didn't<00:00:55.969> even<00:00:56.059> use<00:00:56.390> him

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
first time through I didn't even use him

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.139 
first time through I didn't even use him
so<00:00:56.930> I<00:00:56.960> mean<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.380> was<00:00:57.530> uh<00:00:57.559> I<00:00:58.160> was<00:00:58.579> kind<00:00:58.969> of<00:00:59.030> like

so I mean that was uh I was kind of like
sitting<00:00:59.480> there<00:00:59.600> wondering<00:00:59.809> why<00:01:00.200> I<00:01:00.230> didn't<00:01:00.649> hit

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
sitting there wondering why I didn't hit

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.860 
sitting there wondering why I didn't hit

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.850 
know sometimes with the bear it's a
little<00:01:44.030> bit<00:01:44.150> jumpy<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:45.290> know<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.590> missed

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
with the as50 works out perfect man with

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.539 
with the as50 works out perfect man with
stability<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:51.320> only<00:01:51.560> problem<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.100> really<00:01:52.130> have

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
stability the only problem I really have

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.670 
stability the only problem I really have
with<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.850> as50<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.810> clip<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.290> really

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
with the as50 is the clip is really

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.069 
with the as50 is the clip is really
small<00:01:55.130> which<00:01:55.400> is<00:01:55.610> why<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.270> know<00:01:56.659> really

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.410 
small which is why I a you know really
kind<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.500> like<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.740> Barrett<00:01:58.189> um<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:59.299> know<00:01:59.390> I

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.450 
kind of like the Barrett um you know I
think<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.810> Barretts<00:02:00.229> clip<00:02:00.500> is<00:02:00.710> perfect<00:02:01.280> for<00:02:01.430> a

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
think the Barretts clip is perfect for a

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.310 
think the Barretts clip is perfect for a
spot<00:02:01.700> like<00:02:01.909> this<00:02:01.939> especially<00:02:02.299> in<00:02:02.810> ground<00:02:03.049> war

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
spot like this especially in ground war

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.679 
spot like this especially in ground war

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
that game and hating the connection but

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.600 
that game and hating the connection but

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
playing both games at this game is kind

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.949 
playing both games at this game is kind
of<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:54.950> step<00:03:55.250> back<00:03:55.610> as<00:03:55.880> far<00:03:56.090> as<00:03:56.150> connection<00:03:56.780> goes

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
of a step back as far as connection goes

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.229 
of a step back as far as connection goes
for<00:03:57.260> sure<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.370> weapon<00:03:58.700> damage<00:03:58.850> on<00:03:59.209> that

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
for sure and the weapon damage on that

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.300 
for sure and the weapon damage on that
game<00:03:59.630> didn't<00:03:59.959> seem<00:04:00.140> as<00:04:00.290> bad<00:04:00.320> as<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:00.860> remembered

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
game didn't seem as bad as I remembered

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.920 
game didn't seem as bad as I remembered
it<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.670> mean<00:04:02.269> I<00:04:02.330> don't<00:04:02.480> know<00:04:02.570> if<00:04:02.690> there's<00:04:02.870> a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
it I mean I don't know if there's a

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.990 
it I mean I don't know if there's a
patch<00:04:03.170> they<00:04:03.470> put<00:04:03.769> out<00:04:03.890> or<00:04:04.130> what<00:04:04.370> but<00:04:04.550> I<00:04:04.610> don't

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
patch they put out or what but I don't

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.280 
patch they put out or what but I don't
know<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.239> mean<00:04:05.450> it<00:04:05.570> could<00:04:05.690> just<00:04:05.870> be<00:04:05.959> like<00:04:06.080> a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
know I mean it could just be like a

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.979 
know I mean it could just be like a
placebo<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.670> know<00:04:07.760> but<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.300> really<00:04:08.690> didn't

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
placebo you know but it really didn't

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.210 
placebo you know but it really didn't
seem<00:04:09.050> like<00:04:09.170> it<00:04:09.410> was<00:04:09.500> taking<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:10.010> many

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
seem like it was taking that many

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.620 
seem like it was taking that many
bullets<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.670> kill<00:04:10.700> people<00:04:11.150> on<00:04:11.209> that<00:04:11.420> game

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
bullets to kill people on that game

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.470 
bullets to kill people on that game
either<00:04:11.840> which<00:04:12.320> is<00:04:12.700> another<00:04:13.700> knock<00:04:13.970> ahead<00:04:14.330> on

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
either which is another knock ahead on

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.020 
either which is another knock ahead on
that<00:04:14.660> game<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.170> I<00:04:15.470> think<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.549> guys<00:04:16.700> are<00:04:16.940> going

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.530 
like prestiging on the other games you
get<00:05:04.600> them<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:05.260> don't<00:05:05.380> get<00:05:05.560> anything<00:05:05.770> else<00:05:06.070> and

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
get them you don't get anything else and

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.670 
get them you don't get anything else and
it's<00:05:07.540> almost<00:05:07.840> like<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.140> just<00:05:08.320> bought<00:05:08.530> the

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
it's almost like you just bought the

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.500 
it's almost like you just bought the
game<00:05:08.860> except<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:09.490> keep<00:05:09.760> your<00:05:09.940> spot<00:05:10.210> on<00:05:10.360> the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.050 
game except you keep your spot on the
leaderboard<00:05:10.660> so<00:05:11.230> that's<00:05:11.380> basically<00:05:11.590> it<00:05:12.060> not

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
leaderboard so that's basically it not

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.850 
leaderboard so that's basically it not
like<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.420> kill<00:05:13.630> or<00:05:13.840> win<00:05:14.050> leaderboards<00:05:14.650> but

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
like the kill or win leaderboards but

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.950
