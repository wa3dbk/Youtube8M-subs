show<00:00:05.190> today<00:00:05.879> for<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.299> first<00:00:06.450> run<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.870> day

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
show today for the first run of the day

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.020 
show today for the first run of the day
the<00:00:07.440> snow<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> little<00:00:08.130> bit<00:00:08.220> stiff<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.700> I

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
the snow is a little bit stiff so I I

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.570 
the snow is a little bit stiff so I I
went<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.630> took<00:00:09.719> out<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.050> k2<00:00:10.320> sleigh<00:00:11.309> blade

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
went and took out the k2 sleigh blade

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.999 
went and took out the k2 sleigh blade
this<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.990> stiffest<00:00:13.469> board<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.889> their

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
this is a the stiffest board in their

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.980 
this is a the stiffest board in their
collection<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.910> went<00:00:15.059> out<00:00:15.299> with<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
collection so I just went out with the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.660 
collection so I just went out with the
intention<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:16.650> some<00:00:16.830> high-speed<00:00:17.039> groomers

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
intention to do some high-speed groomers

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.310 
intention to do some high-speed groomers
and<00:00:17.699> that's<00:00:17.970> what<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.150> did<00:00:18.240> some<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
and that's what I did some of the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.810 
and that's what I did some of the
technology<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.189> board<00:00:20.430> that's<00:00:20.609> pretty

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
technology on this board that's pretty

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.359 
technology on this board that's pretty
exciting<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.570> new<00:00:21.720> lifted<00:00:22.140> technology<00:00:22.740> so

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
exciting is the new lifted technology so

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.410 
exciting is the new lifted technology so
what<00:00:23.519> they<00:00:23.640> did<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.060> take<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
what they did is they take a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.960 
what they did is they take a
traditionally<00:00:25.140> flat<00:00:25.590> board<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.189> right

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
traditionally flat board and right

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.790 
traditionally flat board and right
before<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.420> ends<00:00:27.750> they<00:00:27.869> add<00:00:28.019> some<00:00:28.289> camber<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
before the ends they add some camber to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
before the ends they add some camber to
it<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.699> does<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:29.939> normally<00:00:30.900> when

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
it and what that does is normally when

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.380 
it and what that does is normally when
you<00:00:31.170> would<00:00:31.399> normally<00:00:32.399> when<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.120> flat

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you would normally when you have a flat

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.030 
you would normally when you have a flat
board<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.840> would<00:00:33.960> stand<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.920> would

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
board you would stand on it and it would

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.799 
board you would stand on it and it would
lift<00:00:35.219> your<00:00:35.370> tip<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.000> lifts<00:00:36.180> your<00:00:36.300> contact

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
lift your tip so it lifts your contact

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
lift your tip so it lifts your contact
points<00:00:37.170> off<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.620> snow<00:00:37.680> which<00:00:38.550> gives<00:00:38.790> you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
points off of the snow which gives you

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.880 
points off of the snow which gives you
less<00:00:39.270> contact<00:00:39.750> for<00:00:40.050> your<00:00:40.170> turn<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.739> made<00:00:40.860> it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
less contact for your turn so it made it

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.410 
less contact for your turn so it made it
a<00:00:41.040> little<00:00:41.160> bit<00:00:41.340> more<00:00:41.460> squirrely<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> board

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
a little bit more squirrely of a board

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.260 
a little bit more squirrely of a board
and<00:00:42.570> then<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.620> had<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> regular<00:00:44.040> camber<00:00:44.550> you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and then if you had a regular camber you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
and then if you had a regular camber you
have<00:00:45.420> those<00:00:45.600> contact<00:00:46.079> points<00:00:46.410> digging<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.980> so

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
have those contact points digging in so

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.490 
have those contact points digging in so
that<00:00:48.059> gave<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> little<00:00:48.539> bit<00:00:48.629> too<00:00:48.780> much<00:00:48.899> bite<00:00:49.200> so

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that gave a little bit too much bite so

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.939 
that gave a little bit too much bite so
what<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.950> did<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.820> theory<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.770> kind<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> have

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
what this did in theory is kind of have

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.439 
what this did in theory is kind of have
the<00:00:53.070> best<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.370> both<00:00:53.430> worlds<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.210> flat

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the best of both worlds it's a flat

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.939 
the best of both worlds it's a flat
board<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.230> bit<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> camber<00:00:55.620> when

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
board with a little bit of camber when

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.260 
board with a little bit of camber when
you<00:00:56.010> step<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.699> makes<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.059> whole<00:00:57.210> thing

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
you step on it it makes the whole thing

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.779 
you step on it it makes the whole thing
flat<00:00:57.809> instead<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.770> making<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.219> making<00:00:59.670> it

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
flat instead of making the making it

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.580 
flat instead of making the making it
lifts<00:00:59.969> off<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.390> having<00:01:00.629> those<00:01:00.719> bite<00:01:00.960> points<00:01:01.350> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
lifts off or having those bite points so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410 
lifts off or having those bite points so
you<00:01:02.430> actually<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> lot<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you actually have a lot of the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.939 
you actually have a lot of the
playfulness<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.229> flat<00:01:04.439> board<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
playfulness of a flat board but you

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.310 
playfulness of a flat board but you
still<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.580> edge<00:01:05.729> hold<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.330> that

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
still have the edge hold and that that

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.260 
still have the edge hold and that that
contact<00:01:07.830> points<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.310> dig<00:01:08.520> into<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.790> toe<00:01:09.030> site

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
contact points to dig into your toe site

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
contact points to dig into your toe site
and<00:01:09.390> hillside<00:01:09.750> turns<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.890> board<00:01:11.130> was

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
and hillside turns so this board was

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.480 
and hillside turns so this board was
super<00:01:11.640> stable<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.150> high<00:01:12.240> speeds<00:01:12.270> i<00:01:12.720> went<00:01:13.020> i

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
super stable at high speeds i went i

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.590 
super stable at high speeds i went i
don't<00:01:14.490> know<00:01:14.549> how<00:01:14.670> fast<00:01:14.939> i<00:01:15.090> went<00:01:15.240> i<00:01:15.299> should<00:01:15.450> win

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
don't know how fast i went i should win

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.940 
don't know how fast i went i should win
got<00:01:15.810> those<00:01:15.990> goggles<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.619> speedometer

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
got those goggles with the speedometer

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.190 
got those goggles with the speedometer
because<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.270> fastest<00:01:18.720> i<00:01:18.840> went<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
because it's a fastest i went on the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.870 
because it's a fastest i went on the
board<00:01:19.380> yet<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.799> i<00:01:20.130> felt<00:01:20.400> insanely

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
board yet and i felt insanely

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
board yet and i felt insanely
comfortable<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.930> edge<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.350> edge<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.770> super

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
comfortable the edge to edge is super

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190 
comfortable the edge to edge is super
fast<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:24.090> thing<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.360> loved<00:01:24.600> about<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.960> board

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
fast one thing I loved about this board

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.410 
fast one thing I loved about this board
is<00:01:25.320> when<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.770> lean<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> edges<00:01:26.909> they're

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
is when you do lean on the edges they're

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.109
