00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
don't feel that they have any products

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.770 
don't feel that they have any products
and<00:02:58.970> also<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.420> fact<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.750> I've<00:02:59.930> used<00:03:00.170> soy<00:03:00.769> oil

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
and also the fact that I've used soy oil

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.170 
and also the fact that I've used soy oil
just<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:03.290> few<00:03:03.650> drops<00:03:03.890> at<00:03:04.160> the<00:03:04.190> end<00:03:04.459> is<00:03:04.760> made<00:03:05.000> it

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
just a few drops at the end is made it

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.729 
just a few drops at the end is made it
also<00:03:05.330> a<00:03:05.510> difference<00:03:05.959> because<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.350> creates<00:03:06.650> a

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
also a difference because it creates a

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.440 
also a difference because it creates a
really<00:03:06.920> nice<00:03:07.130> separation<00:03:07.640> in<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.060> hair<00:03:08.239> and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
really nice separation in the hair and

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.590 
really nice separation in the hair and
the<00:03:09.019> hair<00:03:09.200> looks<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.560> little<00:03:09.590> bit<00:03:09.950> more<00:03:10.160> only<00:03:10.640> so

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
the hair looks a little bit more only so

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.360 
the hair looks a little bit more only so
that's<00:03:12.170> what<00:03:12.410> we<00:03:12.500> like

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.160 

so<00:03:20.370> after<00:03:20.849> shampoo<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.510> conditioning<00:03:21.989> the

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
so after shampoo and conditioning the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.610 
so after shampoo and conditioning the
hair<00:03:22.349> but<00:03:22.980> we're<00:03:23.159> done<00:03:23.430> here<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:24.420> just<00:03:24.689> towel

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
hair but we're done here we just towel

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.580 
hair but we're done here we just towel
dry<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:25.980> hair<00:03:26.280> so<00:03:26.879> we're<00:03:27.000> going<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.209> take<00:03:27.900> most

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
dry the hair so we're going to take most

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.940 
dry the hair so we're going to take most
of<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.799> water<00:03:29.099> out<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.989> then<00:03:30.989> we're<00:03:31.709> going<00:03:31.920> to

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
of the water out and then we're going to

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.729 
of the water out and then we're going to
apply<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.730> new<00:03:32.879> product<00:03:33.360> which<00:03:33.689> is<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.290> oil

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
apply the new product which is the oil

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:42.380 
apply the new product which is the oil
I<00:03:38.689> think<00:03:39.689> you<00:03:39.840> should<00:03:40.049> put<00:03:41.060> start<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.299> the

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
I think you should put start with the

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.300 
I think you should put start with the
little<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.900> then<00:03:43.049> add<00:03:43.290> more<00:03:43.620> if<00:03:43.799> you<00:03:43.829> need<00:03:43.980> it

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
little and then add more if you need it

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.080 
little and then add more if you need it
you<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:45.030> feel<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:46.260> amount<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.890> how<00:03:47.730> much<00:03:47.790> you

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
you can feel the amount and how much you

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.300 
you can feel the amount and how much you
need<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.390> put<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:48.959> know<00:03:49.079> depending<00:03:50.010> on<00:03:50.129> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
need to put you know depending on the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.490 
need to put you know depending on the
hair<00:03:50.519> if<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.150> have<00:03:51.180> thick<00:03:51.629> hair<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:52.319> you<00:03:52.440> have

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
hair if you have thick hair if you have

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.009 
hair if you have thick hair if you have
long<00:03:52.709> hair<00:03:52.950> or<00:03:53.849> if<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.060> have<00:03:54.180> short<00:03:54.540> hair<00:03:54.599> you

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
long hair or if you have short hair you

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.170 
long hair or if you have short hair you
know<00:03:55.560> it's<00:03:56.010> better<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.489> put<00:03:56.639> a<00:03:56.730> little<00:03:56.879> bit<00:03:57.000> at

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
know it's better to put a little bit at

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.899 
know it's better to put a little bit at
the<00:03:57.329> time<00:03:57.510> don't<00:03:58.019> overload<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.590> hair<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.760> in

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
the time don't overload the hair so in

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.119 
the time don't overload the hair so in
this<00:04:00.000> case<00:04:00.329> what<00:04:00.810> we<00:04:00.900> do<00:04:01.139> is<00:04:01.170> real<00:04:01.650> important

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
this case what we do is real important

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.460 
this case what we do is real important
after<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.670> apply<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.060> oil<00:04:03.389> we're<00:04:04.049> just<00:04:04.260> going

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
after you apply the oil we're just going

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.830 
after you apply the oil we're just going
to<00:04:04.530> brush<00:04:04.769> with<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.519> any<00:04:05.819> brush<00:04:06.120> doesn't

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
to brush with the any brush doesn't

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.890 
to brush with the any brush doesn't
matter<00:04:06.989> what<00:04:07.200> brushes<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:09.000> begin<00:04:09.329> with<00:04:09.540> and

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
matter what brushes it to begin with and

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.629 
matter what brushes it to begin with and
then<00:04:10.139> we're<00:04:10.620> going<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.889> go<00:04:11.040> through<00:04:11.280> with<00:04:11.519> the

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
then we're going to go through with the

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.059 
then we're going to go through with the
comb<00:04:11.879> which<00:04:12.720> i<00:04:12.900> think<00:04:12.959> is<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.290> very<00:04:13.439> good<00:04:13.799> and

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
comb which i think is a very good and

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.819 
comb which i think is a very good and
very<00:04:14.129> important<00:04:14.849> to<00:04:14.939> use<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.329> comb<00:04:15.540> because<00:04:16.259> it

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
very important to use a comb because it

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.790 
very important to use a comb because it
will<00:04:17.150> basically<00:04:18.259> help<00:04:19.259> you<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:21.680> mistreat<00:04:22.680> the

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
will basically help you to mistreat the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.920 
will basically help you to mistreat the
products<00:04:23.250> in<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.610> hair<00:04:26.300> then<00:04:27.300> after<00:04:27.780> this

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
products in the hair then after this

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.990 
products in the hair then after this
we're<00:04:28.139> going<00:04:28.289> to<00:04:28.349> go<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.560> three<00:04:28.970> diffusing<00:04:29.970> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
we're going to go to three diffusing the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.360 
we're going to go to three diffusing the
hair<00:04:30.300> in<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.199> natural<00:04:31.620> way

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.650

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
just rehydrate them from so and it

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.189 
just rehydrate them from so and it
really<00:05:10.099> needs<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.759> care<00:05:10.970> of<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.360> spring<00:05:11.720> you
