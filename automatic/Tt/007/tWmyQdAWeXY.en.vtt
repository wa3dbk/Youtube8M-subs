hole here I'll show you how to deal with
that<00:00:50.520> too<00:00:50.789> we're<00:00:51.690> using<00:00:51.870> plaster<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> Paris

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
that too we're using plaster of Paris

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.920 
that too we're using plaster of Paris
quick<00:00:53.100> step<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.670> these<00:00:53.850> joints<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> hardens

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
quick step for these joints it hardens

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.040 
quick step for these joints it hardens
in<00:00:55.079> ten<00:00:55.350> minutes<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.300> what<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.449> allows<00:00:57.600> me<00:00:57.870> to

on<00:01:09.570> drywall<00:01:09.869> you'll<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:10.979> notice<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.400> this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
on drywall you'll also notice that this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.590 
on drywall you'll also notice that this
is<00:01:11.670> blue<00:01:12.000> board<00:01:12.799> his<00:01:13.799> Apple<00:01:14.430> board<00:01:14.670> just

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
is blue board his Apple board just

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
is blue board his Apple board just

provides a waterproof and more

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.120 
provides a waterproof and more
resistance<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.200> that's<00:01:19.409> why<00:01:19.590> they<00:01:19.740> use<00:01:19.950> it

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
resistance so that's why they use it

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:30.590 
resistance so that's why they use it
here<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.670> why<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> missed<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.420> last

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
