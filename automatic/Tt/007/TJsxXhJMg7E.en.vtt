than<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.600> ones<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.230> saw<00:03:05.650> okay<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.250> they<00:03:06.580> got<00:03:06.700> a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
than the ones I saw okay so they got a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.490 
than the ones I saw okay so they got a
good<00:03:06.940> establishment<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.690> character<00:03:08.110> I<00:03:08.290> like

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
good establishment of a character I like

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.250 
good establishment of a character I like
how<00:03:08.770> this<00:03:08.980> isn't<00:03:09.190> some<00:03:09.490> guy<00:03:09.730> who<00:03:09.870> used<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.020> be<00:03:11.110> a

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
how this isn't some guy who used to be a

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.740 
how this isn't some guy who used to be a
rescue<00:03:11.590> pilot<00:03:12.010> now<00:03:12.490> he<00:03:12.550> is<00:03:12.910> still<00:03:13.240> doing<00:03:13.450> that

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
rescue pilot now he is still doing that

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.870 
rescue pilot now he is still doing that
job<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.560> does<00:03:14.710> make<00:03:14.860> more<00:03:15.100> sense<00:03:15.400> now<00:03:15.550> how

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
job so it does make more sense now how

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.000 
job so it does make more sense now how
he's<00:03:16.090> able<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.510> like<00:03:16.720> swerve<00:03:17.170> past<00:03:17.500> falling

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
he's able to like swerve past falling

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.860 
he's able to like swerve past falling
buildings<00:03:18.460> and<00:03:18.730> save<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> bunch<00:03:19.240> of<00:03:19.330> people<00:03:19.660> cuz

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
buildings and save a bunch of people cuz

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.690 
buildings and save a bunch of people cuz
normally<00:03:20.020> it's<00:03:20.440> like<00:03:20.530> this<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.340> what<00:03:21.490> this<00:03:21.640> guy

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
normally it's like this is what this guy

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.520 
normally it's like this is what this guy
used<00:03:22.210> to<00:03:22.390> do<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.720> now<00:03:22.810> he<00:03:22.870> has<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.170> take<00:03:23.290> care

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
used to do and now he has to take care

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.440 
used to do and now he has to take care
of<00:03:23.590> his<00:03:23.680> family<00:03:24.130> but<00:03:24.430> this<00:03:24.610> is<00:03:24.790> establishing<00:03:25.270> a

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
of his family but this is establishing a

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.780 
of his family but this is establishing a
front<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:25.840> yes<00:03:26.080> this<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.620> his<00:03:26.860> job<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.700> it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
front that yes this is his job so it

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.310 
front that yes this is his job so it
makes<00:03:27.970> sense<00:03:28.210> how<00:03:28.360> he<00:03:28.420> can<00:03:28.630> actually<00:03:28.780> save<00:03:29.170> the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
makes sense how he can actually save the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.980 
makes sense how he can actually save the
day<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.500> lot<00:03:29.740> more<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:30.280> film<00:03:30.580> looks<00:03:31.000> scary<00:03:31.690> like

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
day a lot more the film looks scary like

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.290 
day a lot more the film looks scary like
