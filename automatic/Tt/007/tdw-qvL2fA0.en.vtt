the<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.840> barriers<00:02:30.260> I'd<00:02:30.680> recommend<00:02:31.130> doing<00:02:31.340> it

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
the the barriers I'd recommend doing it

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.949 
the the barriers I'd recommend doing it
at<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.670> end<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.060> round<00:02:32.209> because<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.780> do

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
at the end of a round because you do

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.940 
at the end of a round because you do
need<00:02:33.140> 250<00:02:34.130> barriers<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.030> be<00:02:35.239> able<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.510> get<00:02:35.660> this

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
need 250 barriers to be able to get this

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.350 
need 250 barriers to be able to get this
and<00:02:36.950> more<00:02:37.099> does<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.610> changes<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.030> barriers

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
and more does is it changes the barriers

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.030 
and more does is it changes the barriers
from<00:02:38.480> wooden<00:02:38.840> barriers<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.230> steel<00:02:39.590> barriers

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
from wooden barriers to steel barriers

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.250 
from wooden barriers to steel barriers
just<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.880> stop<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.450> zombies<00:02:41.780> coming<00:02:41.959> in<00:02:42.110> so

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
just to stop the zombies coming in so

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.860 
just to stop the zombies coming in so
fast<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:42.980> definitely<00:02:43.310> worth<00:02:43.519> getting

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
fast so it's definitely worth getting

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.839 
fast so it's definitely worth getting
okay<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:44.930> now<00:02:45.680> we've<00:02:45.920> got<00:02:46.099> the<00:02:46.250> assistant

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
okay so now we've got the assistant

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.000 
okay so now we've got the assistant
insta-kill<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.840> what<00:02:48.410> this<00:02:48.560> does<00:02:48.620> is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
insta-kill and what this does is

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.520 
insta-kill and what this does is
basically<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.730> allows<00:02:50.330> you<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.110> just<00:02:51.290> walk

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
that basically to get the yeah the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.360 
that basically to get the yeah the
persistent<00:02:57.049> in<00:02:57.170> skill<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.890> go<00:02:58.010> again

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
persistent in skill you go again

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.339 
persistent in skill you go again
insta-kill<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.209> then<00:02:59.660> not<00:02:59.870> kill<00:03:00.110> any<00:03:00.230> zombies

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.830 
insta-kill and then not kill any zombies
that<00:03:00.920> may<00:03:01.069> sound<00:03:01.250> stupid<00:03:01.610> but<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:02.510> kind<00:03:02.720> of

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
that may sound stupid but it's kind of

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.120 
that may sound stupid but it's kind of
worth<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.200> when<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.349> want<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.530> high<00:03:03.709> round<00:03:03.890> and

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
three times on round one so you go into

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.059 
three times on round one so you go into
a<00:03:47.090> game<00:03:47.299> hold<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.019> frag<00:03:48.230> grenade<00:03:48.500> kill<00:03:48.739> yourself

then hold a fraggin kill yourself and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.410 
then hold a fraggin kill yourself and
then<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.400> end<00:03:55.609> up<00:03:55.700> getting<00:03:55.819> a<00:03:55.970> green<00:03:56.120> flash

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
then you end up getting a green flash

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.729 
then you end up getting a green flash
that<00:03:56.660> lets<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:56.930> know<00:03:57.049> you've<00:03:57.200> got<00:03:57.230> persistent

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
that lets you know you've got persistent

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.860 
that lets you know you've got persistent
Juggernog<00:03:58.099> and<00:03:58.310> what<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.060> does<00:03:59.209> is<00:03:59.420> basically

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
Juggernog and what it does is basically

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.539 
Juggernog and what it does is basically
it<00:04:00.200> gives<00:04:00.349> you<00:04:00.530> two<00:04:00.859> hundred<00:04:00.980> percent<00:04:01.340> health

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
it gives you two hundred percent health

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.569 
it gives you two hundred percent health
instead<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.590> hundred<00:04:03.590> percent<00:04:03.650> health<00:04:03.980> so

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
instead of a hundred percent health so

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.729 
instead of a hundred percent health so
instead<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.060> two<00:04:05.269> hits<00:04:05.510> it's<00:04:05.810> four<00:04:06.200> hits<00:04:06.410> so

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
instead of two hits it's four hits so

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.830 
instead of two hits it's four hits so
it's<00:04:06.889> kind<00:04:07.099> of<00:04:07.160> like<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.760> middle<00:04:08.450> Juggernog

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
it's kind of like a middle Juggernog

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.960 
it's kind of like a middle Juggernog
it's<00:04:09.019> not<00:04:09.200> quite<00:04:09.530> Juggernog<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.340> perk<00:04:10.489> itself

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
it's not quite Juggernog the perk itself

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.089 
it's not quite Juggernog the perk itself
and<00:04:11.349> obviously<00:04:12.349> it's<00:04:12.590> better<00:04:12.769> than<00:04:12.889> just

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
and obviously it's better than just

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.770 
and obviously it's better than just
getting<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:13.489> hit<00:04:13.669> down<00:04:13.880> so<00:04:14.209> it's<00:04:14.389> definitely

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
getting to hit down so it's definitely

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.469 
getting to hit down so it's definitely
worth<00:04:14.959> it<00:04:15.169> and<00:04:15.459> it's<00:04:16.459> just<00:04:16.549> an<00:04:16.760> awesome<00:04:17.120> pic<00:04:17.299> i

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
worth it and it's just an awesome pic i

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.120 
worth it and it's just an awesome pic i
always<00:04:18.079> use<00:04:18.229> it<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.440> lot<00:04:18.560> when<00:04:18.739> i'm<00:04:18.889> going<00:04:19.039> to
