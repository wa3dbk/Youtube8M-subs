00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi my name is Katerina and today I 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.740
 decided not to bother much and take off 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.069
 those hawaii videos called mating 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.069
 games 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.859
 if you thought that now there will be 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.410
 some pickup lessons all the business no you don't 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.539
 guessing here will be so in which 10 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.029
 questions or rather 10 grades 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.890
 relations with books 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.720
 unusual so did not convey the charm 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.309
 young man whose name is Alexander 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.290
 and a link to his video I will 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.239
 leave in the description be sure to go 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.399
 look it is really very cool and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.280
 so let's start everything here 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.260
 recorded as they say and the first phase is 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.600
 the first attraction is the book which you 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.820
 bought because of the cover even choose books 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.010
 on the covers this stupid quite often so 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 I do and probably the last knit which 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.629
 I bought it because of the cover which 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.340
 I want to show you this book nila geymana 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.170
 the story of the cemetery of course I bought 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.420
 this book is not only because she has 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.309
 cool cover but also because it's 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.270
 my adorable neil gaiman and and also 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.790
 because this book with illustrations 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.650
 Krisa gave and I have long wanted to have 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.750
 to him today fine 7 that's actually you 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.299
 gave me a phase number two 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.729
 first impression book in which you 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.040
 attracted the abstract for this phase I would 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.750
 was a book katherine stoker maid 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.180
 from this book as I told you 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.619
 began my story on youtube this book 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.210
 I decided to buy and read only 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.549
 because I really liked it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.560
 her description I did not regret anything 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.200
 I bought it and I read it very much 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.270
 awesome book very interesting smart 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.030
 in what places are sad some funny 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.430
 overall a full set of emotions to me very 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.380
 liked by this book also the film he 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.590
 also cool but a book as you understand 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.439
 better phase number three sweet talk 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.360
 book with beautiful writing style over 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.060
 this phase, I thought the longest 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.860
 I thought I wanted to choose a book 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.829
 some Russian classics then spat 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.960
 decided that for me it is all works 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.820
 jane austin in this case it 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.860
 northanger abbey and pride and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.689
 prejudice i just adore jane 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.990
 Austin I really like the way she writes 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.610
 I like her style 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.990
 like that time about which she 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.380
 tells like her story 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.209
 like or hero and and love line in 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.610
 In general , I like everything about Jane Austen 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.680
 that's why I chose her for this phase 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.690
 I think Jane Austin almost everyone read 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.790
 her and especially advertise it is not needed 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.250
 just really cool and finally we 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.380
 reached number four phase dating 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.360
 first date first book in the series 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.319
 thanks to which you wanted to buy 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.410
 the whole series 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.300
 also broke a little head whatever series 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.819
 choose i'm not really dreamers me 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.980
 more like single whole books but 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.530
 since I need to cedia I decided to choose from my 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.780
 adored harry potter joan rouling 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.970
 and as you can see this is not the first 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.959
 part of harry potter is 3 harry potter and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.269
 Prisoner of Azkaban 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.340
 and I didn’t just take mine 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.950
 getting acquainted with harry potter childhood still 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.269
 in the distant distant began precisely here 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.130
 this book, then I still 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.540
 I watched two films and then decided 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.730
 what I want to know what will happen next 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.040
 I read a book and then as they say 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.299
 I rushed I bought all all all the books 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.459
 I wanted to know what will happen next 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.349
 collected them with the first second part i 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.269
 I met much later but in 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.760
 my time I collected the entire collection of harry 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.700
 potter then she gave her safely 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.160
 the library and already being an adult lady 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.900
 and bought me all this series 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.090
 because she's really cool and she 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.359
 I must be here for some reason 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.579
 vmetyaschilos head and now I have it 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.799
 phase number five midnight talk 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.630
 a book that didn't let you go all night 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.640
 in general, I very rarely read at night 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.319
 because I like to sleep all the same more 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.530
 what is generally read most on 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.600
 light i like to sleep but there were a couple of books in 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.630
 the time I read avidly 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.430
 there that deep deep night and one of 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.049
 of these books this book is colin macklow 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.329
 singing in the thorns 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.310
 I remember at one time I could not tear myself away 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.810
 i read i'll just put in proper 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.790
 probably like blown away 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.160
 but this book in my opinion has not yet shown 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.769
 so I decided to choose it for this phase. 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.260
 Elegant book all advised phase number 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.420
 six is always in my mind a book about 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.760
 which you can't stop thinking and 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.180
 for me this book oranta tyrol god 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.950
 little things I have to 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.319
 not a paper version of this book because 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.689
 what i read in electronic and paper i 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.530
 I can not find anywhere yet, but I really want 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.720
 afford to buy 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.979
 it's just an amazing story you can 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.320
 say she turns you 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.330
 inside you read what you're going through 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.130
 the hero there tells about India 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.900
 the division into castes about huge 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.479
 injustice that exists in 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.490
 society about how people live there 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.860
 worth poverty and how once you are 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.780
 at the wrong time in the wrong place may 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.850
 to happen such events that just 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.470
 turn your life break your 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.090
 life I still can not calm 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.880
 talk and think about this book because 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.009
 that just does not give me rest all that is there 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.539
 many were saying that it is to 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.910
 it was not difficult to read if we 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.699
 easy to read for very much and 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.500
 I madly want myself a paper version 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.289
