there<00:00:04.640> are<00:00:04.729> many<00:00:04.910> shapes<00:00:05.300> a<00:00:05.509> glass<00:00:05.750> block<00:00:06.080> that

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
there are many shapes a glass block that

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.650 
there are many shapes a glass block that
give<00:00:06.620> us<00:00:06.740> a<00:00:06.830> lot<00:00:07.069> of<00:00:07.099> abilities<00:00:07.729> to<00:00:08.269> design

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
give us a lot of abilities to design

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.870 
give us a lot of abilities to design
that<00:00:09.139> didn't<00:00:09.500> used<00:00:09.830> to<00:00:09.890> exist<00:00:10.250> before<00:00:12.880> for

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
that didn't used to exist before for

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.820 
that didn't used to exist before for
instance<00:00:14.210> with<00:00:14.360> a<00:00:14.390> corner<00:00:15.170> block<00:00:15.290> a<00:00:15.410> lot<00:00:15.680> of

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
instance with a corner block a lot of

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.679 
instance with a corner block a lot of
people<00:00:16.070> in<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:16.250> bar<00:00:16.460> make<00:00:17.150> their<00:00:17.330> bars

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
people in the bar make their bars

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.480 
people in the bar make their bars
l-shaped<00:00:18.320> so<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.650> bar<00:00:18.800> kind<00:00:19.009> of<00:00:19.099> comes<00:00:19.339> out

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
l-shaped so the bar kind of comes out

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.439 
l-shaped so the bar kind of comes out
and<00:00:19.699> it<00:00:19.759> makes<00:00:19.939> an<00:00:20.089> L

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
and it makes an L

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.239 
and it makes an L
well<00:00:20.659> you<00:00:20.869> in<00:00:21.169> the<00:00:21.259> old<00:00:21.409> days<00:00:21.619> you<00:00:21.829> get<00:00:21.949> used<00:00:22.159> to

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:22.249 
well you in the old days you get used to

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:23.380 
well you in the old days you get used to
have<00:00:22.339> to<00:00:22.400> make<00:00:22.460> a<00:00:22.550> straight<00:00:22.849> wall<00:00:23.029> and<00:00:23.239> put<00:00:23.359> a

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
have to make a straight wall and put a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.779 
have to make a straight wall and put a
post<00:00:23.659> there<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.409> another<00:00:24.980> wall<00:00:25.249> well<00:00:25.579> now

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
post there and another wall well now

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.159 
post there and another wall well now
with<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.150> quarter<00:00:26.449> block<00:00:26.689> you<00:00:26.900> can<00:00:27.019> come

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
with the quarter block you can come

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.220 
with the quarter block you can come
straight<00:00:27.439> out<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:27.919> have<00:00:28.039> one<00:00:28.390> design<00:00:29.390> of<00:00:29.779> an

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
straight out and have one design of an

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.840 
straight out and have one design of an
l-shaped<00:00:30.769> wall

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.490 

with<00:00:38.850> an<00:00:39.000> arc<00:00:39.149> block<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.870> make<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> little

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
with an arc block you can make a little

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.569 
with an arc block you can make a little
curve<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.520> create<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> small<00:00:42.149> walk-in<00:00:42.780> shower

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
curve to create a small walk-in shower

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.160 
curve to create a small walk-in shower
cost-effectively<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.540> does<00:00:45.870> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
cost-effectively and what that does is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.110 
cost-effectively and what that does is
when<00:00:46.290> you<00:00:46.410> go<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> walk<00:00:47.010> into<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.460> shower

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
when you go in and walk into that shower

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.060 
when you go in and walk into that shower
it<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:49.019> water<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.500> hits<00:00:49.590> off<00:00:49.829> that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
it actually the water that hits off that

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.250 
it actually the water that hits off that
curve<00:00:50.340> bounces<00:00:51.120> back<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.600> towards<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.960> drain

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
curve bounces back in towards the drain

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.490 
curve bounces back in towards the drain
so<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.340> use<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.850> very<00:00:54.059> small<00:00:54.420> space<00:00:54.720> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so you can use a very small space to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.990 
so you can use a very small space to
create<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> walk-in<00:00:56.010> shower<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:56.850> not

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
create a walk-in shower and I'm not

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.329 
create a walk-in shower and I'm not
aware<00:00:57.089> of<00:00:57.239> any<00:00:57.449> other<00:00:57.510> system<00:00:58.290> out<00:00:58.379> there<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
aware of any other system out there that

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.430 
aware of any other system out there that
can<00:00:59.489> cost-effectively<00:01:00.300> do<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.839> like<00:01:01.170> glass

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
can cost-effectively do that like glass

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.000 
can cost-effectively do that like glass
why

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.250 

there's<00:01:07.010> also<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.490> block<00:01:07.940> called<00:01:08.510> a<00:01:08.600> 45-degree

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
there's also a block called a 45-degree

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.990 
there's also a block called a 45-degree
block<00:01:09.500> or<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.740> tried<00:01:10.070> Ron<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.490> might<00:01:10.610> be<00:01:10.760> called

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
block or a tried Ron it might be called

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.390 
block or a tried Ron it might be called
the<00:01:11.660> net<00:01:11.840> block<00:01:12.050> is<00:01:12.260> good<00:01:12.440> for<00:01:12.650> angled<00:01:13.130> walls

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
the net block is good for angled walls

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.280 
the net block is good for angled walls
maybe<00:01:14.090> we've<00:01:14.180> got<00:01:14.330> a<00:01:14.360> bar<00:01:14.660> or<00:01:14.990> we've<00:01:15.110> got<00:01:15.260> a

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
maybe we've got a bar or we've got a

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.950 
maybe we've got a bar or we've got a
countertop<00:01:16.160> this<00:01:16.850> block<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.480> very<00:01:17.660> small

depending<00:02:15.980> on<00:02:16.070> how<00:02:16.280> much<00:02:16.459> muting<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.120> want<00:02:17.330> to

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
depending on how much muting you want to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:26.190 
depending on how much muting you want to
have

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.990 

the<00:02:26.709> one<00:02:26.890> nice<00:02:27.069> thing<00:02:27.099> about<00:02:27.310> glass<00:02:27.760> block

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
the one nice thing about glass block

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.510 
the one nice thing about glass block
shapes<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.569> they<00:02:28.690> can<00:02:28.870> be<00:02:29.020> prefabricated<00:02:29.530> into

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
shapes is they can be prefabricated into

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.390 
shapes is they can be prefabricated into
sections<00:02:31.090> whether<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.599> be<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:32.140> window<00:02:33.130> section

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
sections whether it be a window section

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.940 
sections whether it be a window section
or<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:34.270> wall<00:02:34.569> section<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.470> window<00:02:35.739> doesn't

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
or a wall section the window doesn't

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.800 
or a wall section the window doesn't
just<00:02:36.220> have<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.400> be<00:02:36.489> flat<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.239> use<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.450> shape

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
just have to be flat you can use a shape

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.809 
just have to be flat you can use a shape
like<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.260> 45-degree<00:02:38.950> block<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.459> kind<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.670> come

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
like the 45-degree block to kind of come

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.020 
like the 45-degree block to kind of come
out<00:02:39.870> angle<00:02:40.870> across<00:02:41.080> an<00:02:41.440> angle<00:02:41.770> back<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.700> create

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
out angle across an angle back to create

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.240 
out angle across an angle back to create
really<00:02:43.750> like<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.900> Bey<00:02:44.140> type<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.650> window<00:02:44.950> so

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
really like a Bey type of window so

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.710 
really like a Bey type of window so
there<00:02:45.550> are<00:02:45.640> some<00:02:45.819> interesting<00:02:46.209> things<00:02:46.660> that

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
there are some interesting things that

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.710 
there are some interesting things that
can<00:02:46.870> be<00:02:46.989> done<00:02:47.140> even<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.520> window<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.510> use<00:02:49.690> a

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
can be done even in a window to use a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.440 
can be done even in a window to use a
shape<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.590> create<00:02:51.040> kind<00:02:51.700> of<00:02:51.850> a<00:02:51.910> more

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
shape to create kind of a more

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.420 
shape to create kind of a more
interesting<00:02:52.810> structure<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.830> again<00:02:54.130> whether

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
interesting structure so again whether

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.390 
interesting structure so again whether
it's<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.700> counter<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> bar<00:02:55.540> wall<00:02:56.200> shower<00:02:56.890> glass

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
it's a counter a bar wall shower glass

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.040 
it's a counter a bar wall shower glass
block<00:02:57.760> shapes<00:02:58.090> can<00:02:58.330> be<00:02:58.390> used<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.750> many<00:02:58.930> of

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
block shapes can be used to many of

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:08.820 
block shapes can be used to many of
those<00:02:59.140> applications

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.890
