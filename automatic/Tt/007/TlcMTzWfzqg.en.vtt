00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.210 
picture is super dim so let me see about
this<00:02:38.480> volume<00:02:38.930> stuff<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.380> can't<00:02:39.620> seem<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.040> get

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
this volume stuff I can't seem to get

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.660 
this volume stuff I can't seem to get
much<00:02:40.700> volume

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.699 

is<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.480> man<00:02:48.630> named<00:02:48.900> ale<00:02:49.200> man<00:02:49.530> oh<00:02:51.470> man<00:02:52.470> keep

switching channels

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.850 
switching channels
see<00:02:54.660> that's<00:02:54.810> channel<00:02:55.140> up<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.590> must<00:02:55.770> be

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
see that's channel up so this must be

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.410 
see that's channel up so this must be
volume<00:02:56.190> up<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.890> yeah<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.940> kind<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.180> get<00:03:03.300> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
volume up so yeah you kind of get the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.140 
volume up so yeah you kind of get the
point<00:03:03.660> really<00:03:04.350> dim<00:03:04.650> picture<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:05.610> got<00:03:06.060> to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
point really dim picture so I got to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.550 
point really dim picture so I got to
work<00:03:06.239> on<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.450> maybe<00:03:06.810> check<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.200> flyback

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
work on that maybe check the flyback

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.170 
work on that maybe check the flyback
transformer<00:03:08.390> check<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.510> color<00:03:09.720> tuning<00:03:10.050> pots

transformer check the color tuning pots
can't<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.420> volume<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.720> much<00:03:13.020> higher<00:03:13.260> so

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
can't get the volume that much higher so

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.350 
can't get the volume that much higher so
so<00:03:15.300> there<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.630> have<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.860> let<00:03:16.860> me<00:03:17.989> stop<00:03:18.989> and<00:03:20.360> wow
