00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hi rikki on both sides the coldest place 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.870
 Earth is antarctica and there is in vostok 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.990
 station 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.040
 once minus 89 point 2 degrees 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.109
 measured in 1983 but no one lives there 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.600
 so that does n't count no the coldest either 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.240
 habitable place and I use 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.080
 lots of quotes like me 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.930
 say 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.029
 habitable place is in russian 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.840
 Siberia there is a small one 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.899
 Russian village came to you came to you 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.410
 you head in to you it is average 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.290
 minus 50 degrees every day that's a lot 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.420
 colder than incredibly cold around you could 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.379
 lies in two public sacha that cares 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.600
 upset 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.700
 and is yes carriage which does not mean 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.010
 friends with barrels that name they have 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.840
 because there is a hot water source 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.280
 is in the earth and they might be 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.140
 not standing with each other but without that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820
 no hot water source had lived there 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.309
 and sometimes the location does not 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.620
 especially northern are getting very cold 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.690
 because he village is shielded from 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.640
 warm air flows and people live there 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:11.310
 it is 1932 no less than 521 live there 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.380
 people also have the surrounding here 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.900
 cities had a fight because of football 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.670
 they are there to fight off death 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.500
 by well actually it's cold there is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.180
 seriously a huge fight between the 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.130
 villages that really has the coldest village 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.100
 okay to get your compass out of it already 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.880
 account 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.490
 minus 67 degrees and in the summer it is 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.930
 just again plus 30 that is a difference 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.450
 of 100 degrees 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.220
 if you like to go 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.280
 from the Netherlands after you come to travel 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.830
 is 150 hours by car 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.690
 us there is zero traffic but unfortunately you can 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.750
 do not park because the land is permanent 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.070
 or because there is no more herring in it 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.720
 I am curious about your son you 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.590
 like to go to such a coudorp to 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.690
 see how it is there 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.789
 how they live there or something like that 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.920

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.149

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.560
