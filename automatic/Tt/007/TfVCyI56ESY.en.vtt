 thank you so much who will vote i think 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.579
 that playing maykravt many people tried 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.650
 build some beautiful statues which 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.450
 Then I will make it acceptable as a skin from 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.970
 players or just some out there let's say 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.100
 skeleton zombies creeps and different 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.810
 other things, but I'm sure that many 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.670
 it turned out something like me then 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.500
 I have no f + build nicely and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.600
 today's plugin is a little bit it 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.670
 correct today's plugin will allow us 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.909
 build a huge statue that's in full 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.889
 the growth of people that is, as it were, you scan 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.869
 skin that is, it will do purely with 

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:11.219
 skins people statues but let's say here 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.499
 such a satu now we are with you 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.409
 try to build as well as build 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:20.909
 first land there 90 will stand 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.429
 skin write skin and then micro to which 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.979
 we want to build 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:27.719
 describe if have started a big letter 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.530
 you are over all with the big literally at the end 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.689
 or in the middle 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.840
 that is, respecting the size of the letters we press 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.139
 enter and here is our skin built of course 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.090
 a little turd so let's say because 

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.069
 color rendering is low enough but 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.929
 principle looks very solid to me 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.429
 It seems very good if you do not 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:49.859
 I liked what you built 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:51.599
 write skin on yes and he will also erase it 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.039
 in addition to making skin from 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.219
 wool can also be tried 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.270
 skin and from clay i write the skin on 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.599
 player title 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.899
 sharper skin will do and write glue then 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:07.050
 there is clay here is such a skin of clay 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.600
 more such know some 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.490
 I do not know black and white probably or such 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.680
 that's how this color is called sepia or 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.930
 what when he yellowish so but 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.720
 also not very interesting skin giving it 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.850
 also removed as well in addition to their wool 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.540
 In addition to clay , you can also make skins from 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.740
 the glass looks like it will not tell me what 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.120
 nice or ugly well enough 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.070
 it is interesting to write the eye and so here it is 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.120
 Looks like I would say he is funny 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.670
 up close because firstly he 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.260
 transparent and see what's inside 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.990
 is all sorts of these white 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.030
 eyes or is there still something behind red in 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.860
 principle cool looks the same yet 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.080
 in addition to putting the main skin 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.190
 also if you have any 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.080
 customize socks us something 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.550
 on body armor or caps they will also 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.490
 visible let's say two stones from this 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.040
 piece of iron captain too there so let's 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.800
 try to erase it so itâ€™s not us 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.850
 need as well as lagano also besides 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.180
 what can I put 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.040
 skins glass of clay from wool can 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.890
 choose the skin of all the things that you have 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.410
 there is one of those block items 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:17.820
 minecraft for this we write the skin name 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.680
 and ayug so here it will look 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.489
 that is, it will be approximately in color by 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.230
 pick your skin color 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.670
 something similar but as I can see 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.730
 let's say a darker color on a tie 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.890
 that is, he is there and darker hellish 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.930
 The stone took and the very same eyes are not 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.480
 white gray he decided to take there just 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.640
 I have a hand stone, but not really me 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.770
 a little lighter legs too 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.780
 others but for some reason decided to take all of us 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.130
 obsidian body but such 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.570
 interesting dress hope that many 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.430
