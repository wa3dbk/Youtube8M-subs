00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.169 

we've<00:00:00.120> got<00:00:00.240> our<00:00:00.359> new<00:00:00.450> 10<00:00:00.690> degrees<00:00:00.960> left<00:00:01.140> here<00:00:01.500> a

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:02.179 
we've got our new 10 degrees left here a

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:11.240 
we've got our new 10 degrees left here a
motor<00:00:03.179> running<00:00:09.290> this<00:00:10.290> thing<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.679> yet<00:00:10.980> to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
motor running this thing is yet to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.900 
motor running this thing is yet to
actually<00:00:11.630> climb<00:00:12.630> out<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.259> we're<00:00:13.530> hoping<00:00:13.830> that

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
actually climb out so we're hoping that

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.960 
actually climb out so we're hoping that
between<00:00:14.910> these<00:00:15.150> two<00:00:15.389> changes<00:00:16.250> 10<00:00:17.250> cells<00:00:17.580> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
between these two changes 10 cells and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.420 
between these two changes 10 cells and
the<00:00:18.619> little<00:00:19.619> bit<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.800> deflection<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
the little bit of deflection on the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.179 
the little bit of deflection on the
flaps<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.510> will<00:00:21.720> get<00:00:22.500> where<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.710> want<00:00:22.920> first

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
flaps that will get where we want first

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.950 
flaps that will get where we want first
time<00:00:23.430> off<00:00:29.240> do<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> others<00:00:30.779> if<00:00:30.929> you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
time off do you have the others if you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.420 
time off do you have the others if you
want<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.380> swap<00:00:31.590> them<00:00:31.769> out<00:00:31.800> depending<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.309> how

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
want to swap them out depending on how

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.600 
want to swap them out depending on how
that<00:00:32.489> Eska<00:00:32.850> okay<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.260> gonna<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.610> this

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
that Eska okay so this is gonna be this

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.420 
that Eska okay so this is gonna be this
is<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> way<00:00:35.969> she<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.239> test<00:00:36.660> as<00:00:36.870> opposed<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
is the way she is test as opposed to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:46.000 
is the way she is test as opposed to
futz<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.730> her<00:00:38.820> all<00:00:38.969> day

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:01:10.080 

all<00:00:47.010> right<00:00:47.219> vans<00:00:47.430> gonna<00:00:47.640> throw

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:27.540 

medium<00:01:11.090> he<00:01:11.179> says

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.730 

we've<00:01:28.210> now<00:01:28.390> walked<00:01:28.750> over<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.350> aircraft

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
we've now walked over to the aircraft

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.980 
we've now walked over to the aircraft
and<00:01:30.130> as<00:01:30.370> you<00:01:30.550> can<00:01:30.700> see<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:31.150> fuselage<00:01:31.630> has

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
and as you can see the fuselage has

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.060 
and as you can see the fuselage has
snapped<00:01:32.320> in<00:01:32.500> half

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
snapped in half

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.160 
snapped in half
that<00:01:33.700> was<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.090> first<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:34.479> only<00:01:34.600> test<00:01:34.960> flight

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
that was the first and only test flight

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.270 
that was the first and only test flight
of<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:36.160> day<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.320> was<00:01:38.440> successful<00:01:38.650> first

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
of the day but it was successful first

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.250 
of the day but it was successful first
climb<00:01:39.580> out<00:01:39.790> can't<00:01:40.390> wait<00:01:40.570> to<00:01:40.690> go<00:01:40.780> back<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.140> look

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
climb out can't wait to go back and look

00:01:41.260 --> 00:02:18.020
