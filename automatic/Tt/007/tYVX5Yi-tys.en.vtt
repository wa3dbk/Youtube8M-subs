switching out looking girl because he

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.319 
switching out looking girl because he
did<00:01:59.610> trap<00:01:59.939> me<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.960> me<00:02:01.799> maybe<00:02:02.610> thinking<00:02:03.180> that

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
did trap me so me maybe thinking that

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.940 
did trap me so me maybe thinking that
yeah<00:02:03.810> maybe<00:02:04.140> he<00:02:04.409> was

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
yeah maybe he was

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.270 
yeah maybe he was
that<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.310> could<00:02:05.520> set<00:02:05.729> up<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:05.969> him<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> sub

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
that I could set up on him with a sub

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.639
