00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
I used this fairy tale one to hold my

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.620 
I used this fairy tale one to hold my
son's<00:02:00.540> clothing<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.290> 10<00:02:01.530> days<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.360> last<00:02:03.360> year

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
son's clothing for 10 days and last year

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.780 
son's clothing for 10 days and last year
he<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.079> Tootsie<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> think<00:02:05.340> when<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.579> move

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
he was in Tootsie I think when we move

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.660 
he was in Tootsie I think when we move
so<00:02:06.090> he<00:02:06.270> had<00:02:06.420> 10<00:02:06.630> days<00:02:06.810> worth<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.229> clothing<00:02:07.670> in

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so he had 10 days worth of clothing in

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.360 
so he had 10 days worth of clothing in
here<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:10.080> were<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.440> great<00:02:10.739> for

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
here and then they were just great for

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.280 
here and then they were just great for
traveling<00:02:12.360> throwing<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.050> out<00:02:13.140> of

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
traveling throwing in and out of
