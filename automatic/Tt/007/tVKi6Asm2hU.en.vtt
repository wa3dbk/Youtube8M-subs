 what happens around you due 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.410

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.310
 bluetooth headset 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.600
 either standard wired headset 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.860
 means that there are only two 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.840
 buttons and scale that measures 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.479
 loudness of speech yes let's say so here it is 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.020
 This is displayed here. 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.300
 the key starts recording to draw 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.930
 attention we go are shown here 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.190
 seconds 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.190
 our either you pause and then 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.979
 continue on here either you immediately 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.030
 do stop after what you have completely 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:12.520
 recorded sound 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.750
 you go to the list of their play records and 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.720
 pause 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.490
 so here you will have the entire list 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.170
 all your 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.190
 audio recordings 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:31.370
 make it mean first you can click 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:35.300
 on the arrow again and change so 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.280
 say name means either enter 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:43.819
 here it is arbitrary that is, but its say 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:46.760
 so the lesson after which you can cut 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.900
 This entry, that is, cut only 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.860
 some part 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.960
 and click trim or you can 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.870
 send via mail and naturally 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.110
 as we said in the message program and 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.959
 massage here you can do it our 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.520
 channel click message you have 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.700
 the message program opens well 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.819
 next you know now 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.519

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.720
 we can immediately send either 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.060
 Naturally remove this entry this 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:25.280
 cursor now let's me again 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:27.380
 I'll write down literally 5 seconds so there is clicked 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.349
 stop went to the list 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.890
 pause means this cursor 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:36.830
 helps to move to any place of recording 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.860
 dates that you could listen to but perry 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.920
 rewind roughly so after which we 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.920
 again, we remove this principle
