metal hydride I believe you cannot use
any<00:02:03.310> kind<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.549> lithium<00:02:03.969> just<00:02:04.209> even<00:02:04.689> though<00:02:04.780> you

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
any kind of lithium just even though you

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.569 
any kind of lithium just even though you

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
cannot even use lithium in the reporter

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.719 
cannot even use lithium in the reporter
from<00:02:06.759> what<00:02:06.909> I've<00:02:07.060> seen<00:02:07.359> in<00:02:08.220> what<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.250> call<00:02:09.489> tasks

have<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.600> little<00:03:47.050> loose<00:03:47.880> because<00:03:48.880> when<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.150> put

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
have a little loose because when you put

have a little loose because when you put
this<00:03:49.510> on<00:03:49.690> it's<00:03:49.900> not<00:03:50.170> very<00:03:50.410> easy<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.739> get<00:03:50.890> off

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
this on it's not very easy to get off

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.420 
this on it's not very easy to get off
and<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:53.230> should<00:03:53.410> just<00:03:53.440> slide<00:03:53.650> right<00:03:53.860> into<00:03:54.220> the

and it should just slide right into the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.890 
and it should just slide right into the
rail<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.650> snap<00:03:57.390> pretty<00:03:58.390> simple<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:58.870> that

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
rail and snap pretty simple like that

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.600 
rail and snap pretty simple like that
there's<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.560> quarter-twenty<00:04:00.070> slot<00:04:00.459> on<00:04:00.580> the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
there's a quarter-twenty slot on the

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.370 
there's a quarter-twenty slot on the
bottom<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.209> could<00:04:01.480> try<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:01.720> you<00:04:02.110> can<00:04:02.260> mount

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
bottom so you could try it you can mount

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.990 
bottom so you could try it you can mount
this<00:04:02.500> on<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.680> small<00:04:02.920> tripod<00:04:03.220> or<00:04:03.670> something

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
and with this extra cable that I

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.360 
and with this extra cable that I
supplied<00:04:11.470> you<00:04:12.280> just<00:04:12.489> plug<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.910> in<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:14.370> then

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
supplied you just plug it in and then

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.190 
supplied you just plug it in and then
you<00:04:15.640> would<00:04:15.790> plug<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.239> into<00:04:16.390> the<00:04:16.660> side<00:04:16.870> of<00:04:16.930> the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
you would plug it into the side of the

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.640 
you would plug it into the side of the
tascam<00:04:17.769> right<00:04:18.370> here<00:04:21.960> and<00:04:22.960> I<00:04:23.290> don't<00:04:23.350> have<00:04:23.470> any

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
tascam right here and I don't have any

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.680 
tascam right here and I don't have any
double-a<00:04:23.950> batteries<00:04:24.370> but<00:04:24.610> that's<00:04:25.180> how<00:04:25.450> it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
double-a batteries but that's how it

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.909 
double-a batteries but that's how it
would<00:04:25.780> look<00:04:25.840> when<00:04:26.230> you're<00:04:26.380> powering<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:28.919> it's

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
would look when you're powering it it's

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.490 
would look when you're powering it it's
a<00:04:30.070> nice<00:04:30.310> device<00:04:30.729> if<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.030> need<00:04:31.330> extra<00:04:31.600> power<00:04:32.020> if

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
a nice device if you need extra power if

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.500 
a nice device if you need extra power if
you<00:04:32.620> don't<00:04:32.770> have<00:04:32.950> access<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:37.060> know<00:04:37.090> an<00:04:37.360> AC

you don't have access to you know an AC
plug<00:04:38.070> if<00:04:39.070> you<00:04:39.310> had<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.580> put<00:04:39.729> this<00:04:39.850> somewhere

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
plug if you had to put this somewhere

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
where you can't get power to this is

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.050 
where you can't get power to this is
obviously<00:04:43.300> a<00:04:43.390> great<00:04:43.600> extra<00:04:44.070> add-on<00:04:45.070> I<00:04:45.370> think

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
obviously a great extra add-on I think

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.810 
obviously a great extra add-on I think
it<00:04:46.180> was<00:04:46.300> about<00:04:47.280> $30<00:04:48.280> from<00:04:48.760> B&amp;H<00:04:50.640> if<00:04:51.640> they<00:04:51.729> own

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
it was about $30 from B&amp;H if they own

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.820 
it was about $30 from B&amp;H if they own
this<00:04:51.940> video<00:04:52.090> when<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:52.990> watch<00:04:53.169> it<00:04:53.200> they<00:04:53.650> could

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
this video when you watch it they could

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.650 
this video when you watch it they could
be<00:04:54.100> year<00:04:54.729> to<00:04:54.880> later<00:04:55.060> where<00:04:55.240> they'd<00:04:55.360> be<00:04:55.479> really

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
be year to later where they'd be really

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.400 
be year to later where they'd be really
low<00:04:55.900> in<00:04:56.020> price<00:04:57.450> but<00:04:58.450> anyway<00:04:58.720> I<00:04:58.930> think<00:04:59.140> this

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
low in price but anyway I think this

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.350 
low in price but anyway I think this
will<00:04:59.500> be<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.620> great<00:04:59.770> unit<00:05:00.130> for<00:05:00.280> me<00:05:00.400> because<00:05:01.270> I

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
will be a great unit for me because I

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.690 
will be a great unit for me because I
need<00:05:01.510> really<00:05:01.960> long<00:05:02.169> times<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:03.010> usually<00:05:03.550> want<00:05:03.640> to
