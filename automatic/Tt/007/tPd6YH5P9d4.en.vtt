00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
repetitive stress of climbing we see

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.680

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
kind of things that we can treat pretty

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.630 
kind of things that we can treat pretty
easily<00:00:27.180> with<00:00:27.480> rehabilitation<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:29.250> second

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
easily with rehabilitation the second

easily with rehabilitation the second
group<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.000> injuries<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.570> ones<00:00:30.779> that

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
group of injuries are the ones that

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.139 
group of injuries are the ones that
happen<00:00:31.260> as<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> result<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.890> Falls<00:00:32.219> sometimes

happen as a result of Falls sometimes

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.760 
happen as a result of Falls sometimes
they're<00:00:33.360> not<00:00:33.390> too<00:00:33.719> serious<00:00:33.989> things<00:00:34.559> like

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
they're not too serious things like

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.979 
they're not too serious things like
dislocated<00:00:35.460> shoulders<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.270> sprains<00:00:36.750> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
dislocated shoulders or sprains and

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.479 
dislocated shoulders or sprains and
strains<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.950> they<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.219> also<00:00:38.309> be

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
strains but they can also be

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.880 
strains but they can also be
catastrophic<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.719> spinal<00:00:40.260> cord<00:00:40.469> injuries

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
catastrophic like spinal cord injuries

the<00:00:41.579> fear<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.850> falling<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.420> obviously<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.050> of

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the fear of falling is obviously one of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.420 
the fear of falling is obviously one of
the<00:00:43.200> reasons<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.710> lot<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.010> people<00:00:44.190> will

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the reasons that a lot of people will

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.610 
the reasons that a lot of people will
not<00:00:44.670> go<00:00:44.879> into<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.210> sport<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.379> even

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
not go into a sport like this and even

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
not go into a sport like this and even
veteran<00:00:47.129> climbers<00:00:47.550> will<00:00:47.670> tell<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.059> they

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
veteran climbers will tell you that they

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
veteran climbers will tell you that they
will<00:00:48.960> feel<00:00:49.260> fear<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:49.920> they're<00:00:50.100> holding<00:00:50.520> on

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
will feel fear when they're holding on

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:10.520 
will feel fear when they're holding on
to<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> sheer<00:00:51.210> cliff<00:00:51.239> face<00:01:08.930> ok<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.020> now<00:01:10.200> actually

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
you can obviously move with the weight

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.660 
you can obviously move with the weight
and<00:02:14.170> what<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.650> want<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.100> can<00:02:15.160> start<00:02:15.459> with<00:02:15.580> the

and what you want you can start with the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.890 
and what you want you can start with the
lower<00:02:15.820> weight<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.180> get<00:02:16.300> comfortable<00:02:16.540> with<00:02:16.780> it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
lower weight to get comfortable with it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.900 
lower weight to get comfortable with it
and<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:17.530> move<00:02:17.709> up<00:02:17.800> as<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.100> go<00:02:18.130> I'll<00:02:18.670> give<00:02:18.850> it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
a shot all right here we go I think

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.350 
a shot all right here we go I think
you'll<00:02:23.200> be<00:02:23.230> able<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.620> once<00:02:23.860> okay<00:02:24.360> all

you'll be able to do this once okay all

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.350 
you'll be able to do this once okay all
right<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.720> keep<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.020> flat<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:27.239> rest<00:02:28.239> the
