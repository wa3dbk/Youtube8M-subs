00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.360
 the exit ends the fault to the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.670
 fish I once again is that 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.950
 some pleasure 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.930
 the geronimo elite crossbow is made up 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.290
 an aluminum drum and a bone of 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.540
 cuttlefish 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.320
 she is therefore predestined for hunting 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.720
 to agachon the cuttlebone is a form 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.910
 different from the fus which allows a 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.479
 lateral movement facilitated at the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:13.119
 from the agachon the elite geronimo arrow 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.310
 is provided with three ergo these small 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.320
 protuberances on the arrow that 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.310
 allow for a quick delivery and 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.290
 secure of the particular obuts and in 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.660
 same time having third bone 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.040
 allows a versatility of the fishing is 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.990
 to say that at first regret we can 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.000
 fishing with holes and at the third one can 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.920
 fishing in English lagash regards 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.350
 its end is an arrow that is 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.400
 provided with an art said in language 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.010
 the advantage is to avoid tearing 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.790
 the fish and therefore to secure it when 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.350
 of taking this crossbow is provided 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.290
 an open head that has the advantage 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.840
 to directly mount the arrow on the 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.729
 was like this so she is asked is 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.290
 gone through this movie 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.430
 the disadvantage if one is used to a 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.490
 closed head is to take 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.110
 used to position the film well 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.619
 so that the fresh ones are well 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.619
 fixed 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.429
 the second advantage of this head is 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.410
 that we can fix 200 backs very quickly 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.430
 so these are 100 backs that are 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.320
 descended very powerful of diameter 20 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.480
 mm they are not too that's why 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.880
 precisely that we have the power and from 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.130
 we want to fish with holes just 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.110
 remove one of the 200 backs and hang it 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.730
 at the buoy it's very fast it can be 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.380
 do so in the water in action of 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.540
 hunting the crossbow is so ready for 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.920
 go fishing held the first notch 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.070
 obviously to avoid breaking the 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.070
 arrow 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.980
 the butt of their balls and elite is 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.120
 a stick was perfected by 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.610
 compared to the old generation 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.990
 because when you have 200 backs you have to 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.330
 the mechanisms inside be 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.550
 robust enough first of all the 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.720
 pen this son who was changed he was at 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.050
 left now he's gone right 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.510
 to facilitate precisely the release 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.700
 arrow when shooting otherwise 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.460
 it is provided with a wheel of 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.400
 setting and lies beneath the fus who 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.370
 Adjust the sensitivity of the shot 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.340
 the very fast positioning of the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.740
 security allows a trigger even in 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.959
 buying positions all the way down the 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.300
 lacrosse there is a small trigger guard to the case 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.430
 where the whole film is unrolled on the 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.690
 rifle main reel this is the 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.760
 belt reel that will take the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.870
 relay and that allows the pianist to 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.350
 go up to the surface safely 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.290
 without losing a material she is 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.630
 also provided with protection for 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.940
 allow to arm his rifle more 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.510
 easily to just protect his 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.510
 sternum when loading the crossbow 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:54.530
 these 7 crossbow comes with a 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.940
 reel filled with 50 meters of yarn 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.570
 son and a son of a fairly large diameter 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.380
 of mm the very sensitive reel full of 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.380
 shooting takes place 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.580
 when everyone will be able to personalize 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.280
 crossbow I chose to equip it 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.829
 a leading son being robust enough 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.750
 for shooting big catches because 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.239
 the original son resist do not resist 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.639
 than 80 kg gold a liche at startup this 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.120
 can it break a movie of six so 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.310
 I exchanged it and I added here a 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.530
 would like to be able to detach very 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.340
 quickly my arrow if needed and that's 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.199
 to say in case of no if ever 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:42.800
 it's in melee it can come off any 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:45.919
 immediately their elite geronimo ride is 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.449
 a novelty 2010 at crest if she 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.350
 exists in all standard sizes 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:54.039
 from nh90 to 120 cm and its price is at 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.039
 around 200
