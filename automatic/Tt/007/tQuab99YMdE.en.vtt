00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
coax it into the roll okay it's now in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.539 
coax it into the roll okay it's now in
the<00:01:17.310> roll<00:01:18.380> now<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.650> really<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> hold<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
fabric up in front of the foot and the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.510 
fabric up in front of the foot and the
other<00:01:25.170> thing<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.590> want<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> try<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.280> is

other thing you want to try to do is

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.140 
other thing you want to try to do is
have<00:01:26.759> fabric<00:01:27.509> touching<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:29.009> point<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
have fabric touching this point and this

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.130 
have fabric touching this point and this
point<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.479> watch<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:33.960> started<00:01:34.409> here

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.569 

it's<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.290> matter<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:40.439> holding<00:01:41.439> it<00:01:41.560> so<00:01:41.979> that<00:01:42.250> just

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
it's a matter of holding it so that just

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.200 
it's a matter of holding it so that just
the<00:01:43.210> right<00:01:43.450> amount<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:44.380> fabric<00:01:45.310> get<00:01:45.759> studying

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
the right amount of fabric get studying

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.569 
the right amount of fabric get studying
if<00:01:46.810> I<00:01:47.049> don't<00:01:47.259> have<00:01:47.439> fabric<00:01:47.860> touching<00:01:48.310> this

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
if I don't have fabric touching this

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.850 
if I don't have fabric touching this
side<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.930> not<00:01:50.140> going<00:01:50.320> to<00:01:50.409> have<00:01:50.530> enough

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
side it's not going to have enough

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.550 
side it's not going to have enough
fabric<00:01:51.159> in<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.579> roll<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.899> if<00:01:53.049> I<00:01:53.170> have<00:01:53.380> it

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
fabric in the roll and if I have it

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.940 
fabric in the roll and if I have it
going<00:01:54.490> over<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:55.179> edge<00:01:55.720> there'll<00:01:56.500> be<00:01:56.530> too

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
going over that edge there'll be too

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.120 
going over that edge there'll be too
much<00:01:57.159> in<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.549> world<00:01:58.289> so<00:01:59.289> I<00:01:59.320> know<00:01:59.439> it<00:01:59.679> sounds

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
much in the world so I know it sounds

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.289 
much in the world so I know it sounds
pretty<00:02:00.340> picky<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.470> definitely<00:02:03.250> is<00:02:04.140> worth

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
pretty picky but it definitely is worth

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.580 
pretty picky but it definitely is worth
playing<00:02:07.299> with<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:09.190> training<00:02:09.519> yourself

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
playing with and training yourself

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.380 
playing with and training yourself
exactly<00:02:11.590> how<00:02:11.890> to<00:02:11.950> get<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.730> right<00:02:12.940> amount<00:02:13.090> of

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
exactly how to get the right amount of

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.780 
exactly how to get the right amount of
fabric<00:02:14.130> feeding<00:02:15.130> in<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:17.280> your<00:02:18.280> narrow<00:02:18.489> hem

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
fabric feeding in to your narrow hem

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.650

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
foot so do you see the nice little

foot so do you see the nice little
narrow<00:02:23.410> hand<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.769> I<00:02:23.799> have<00:02:24.010> one<00:02:24.610> step<00:02:24.910> rather

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
narrow hand that I have one step rather

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.170 
narrow hand that I have one step rather
than<00:02:25.900> three
