this<00:03:32.720> unlock<00:03:33.080> code<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:33.470> we<00:03:33.560> use<00:03:33.709> in<00:03:33.860> this

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
this unlock code that we use in this

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.949 
this unlock code that we use in this
video<00:03:34.310> won't<00:03:34.610> work<00:03:34.849> for<00:03:35.030> your<00:03:35.150> phone<00:03:35.360> now<00:03:35.900> the

video won't work for your phone now the

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.140 
video won't work for your phone now the
reason<00:03:36.290> why<00:03:36.440> is<00:03:36.500> because<00:03:36.739> each<00:03:37.400> unlock<00:03:37.910> code

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
reason why is because each unlock code

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.540 
reason why is because each unlock code
is<00:03:38.330> unique<00:03:38.629> to<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.050> IMEI<00:03:39.500> or<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.250> serial

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
is unique to the IMEI or the serial

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.309 
is unique to the IMEI or the serial
