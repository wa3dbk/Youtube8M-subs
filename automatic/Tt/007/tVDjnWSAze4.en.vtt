the<00:02:31.630> same<00:02:31.810> time<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.440> don't<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.710> to<00:02:32.830> do<00:02:32.980> one

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
the same time you don't have to do one

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.260 
the same time you don't have to do one
at<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.400> time<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.560> then<00:02:38.790> pull<00:02:39.790> them<00:02:39.850> out<00:02:40.000> from

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
at a time and then pull them out from

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:47.490 
at a time and then pull them out from
there<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.290> after<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:46.140> you're<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:47.230> going<00:02:47.410> to

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
there so after that you're just going to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.390 
there so after that you're just going to
take<00:02:47.650> your<00:02:47.800> paintbrush<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:49.530> some<00:02:50.530> glue<00:02:50.830> put<00:02:51.370> a

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
take your paintbrush and some glue put a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.540 
take your paintbrush and some glue put a
little<00:02:51.550> bit<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.790> glue<00:02:52.240> on<00:02:52.690> your<00:02:52.750> brush<00:02:53.550> and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
little bit of glue on your brush and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.170 
little bit of glue on your brush and
then<00:02:54.580> take<00:02:54.940> one<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.360> your<00:02:55.570> cupcakes<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.820> glue

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
then take one of your cupcakes and glue

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.460 
then take one of your cupcakes and glue
on<00:02:58.420> it<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.600> then<00:03:01.810> just<00:03:02.200> simply<00:03:03.690> place<00:03:04.690> it<00:03:04.720> on

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
on it and then just simply place it on

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.229 
on it and then just simply place it on
to<00:03:06.040> your<00:03:06.459> Lantern<00:03:08.310> now<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.340> did<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.790> very<00:03:09.820> top

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
to your Lantern now I did the very top

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.110 
to your Lantern now I did the very top
of<00:03:10.270> my<00:03:10.480> lantern<00:03:10.900> first<00:03:11.670> some<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:12.790> them<00:03:12.910> are

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
of my lantern first some of them are

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.850 
of my lantern first some of them are
closer<00:03:13.540> together<00:03:13.810> than<00:03:14.110> others<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.620> that's

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
closer together than others and that's

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.120 
closer together than others and that's
okay<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:16.360> what<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.480> also<00:03:16.570> did<00:03:16.989> was<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.620> took<00:03:17.920> a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
okay and what I also did was I took a

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.729 
okay and what I also did was I took a
little<00:03:18.400> bit<00:03:18.580> of<00:03:18.640> glue<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:20.200> put<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.560> in

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
little bit of glue and I put it in

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.229 
little bit of glue and I put it in
between<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.670> pieces<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.530> they<00:03:24.239> stick

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
between the pieces so that they stick

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.150 
between the pieces so that they stick
together<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.480> put<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.780> glue<00:03:28.959> just<00:03:29.200> in

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
together so I put the glue just in

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.740 
together so I put the glue just in
between<00:03:31.170> these<00:03:32.170> pieces<00:03:32.590> here<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:34.390> that<00:03:34.540> they'd

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
between these pieces here so that they'd

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.260 
between these pieces here so that they'd
stick<00:03:35.050> together<00:03:35.260> better<00:03:36.120> when<00:03:37.120> there

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
stick together better when there

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.430 
stick together better when there
wouldn't<00:03:37.450> be<00:03:37.540> any<00:03:37.660> openings<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.959> once<00:03:41.230> you've

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
wouldn't be any openings so once you've

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.340 
wouldn't be any openings so once you've
done<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.680> we're<00:03:42.100> going<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.489> do<00:03:42.670> rose<00:03:43.630> but

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
done that we're going to do rose but

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.979 
done that we're going to do rose but
we're<00:03:44.620> gonna<00:03:44.709> skip<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.700> next<00:03:45.970> row<00:03:46.360> kind<00:03:46.780> of

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
we're gonna skip the next row kind of

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.949 
we're gonna skip the next row kind of
and<00:03:47.230> then<00:03:47.470> go<00:03:47.739> to<00:03:48.360> somewhat<00:03:49.360> like<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.660> third

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
and then go to somewhat like the third

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.040 
and then go to somewhat like the third
row<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:51.489> this<00:03:51.850> rose<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.450> going<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.720> be<00:03:52.870> left

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
row so this rose is going to be left

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.150 
row so this rose is going to be left
empty<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:55.060> my<00:03:55.680> cupcakes<00:03:56.680> are<00:03:56.769> going<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:56.980> start

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
empty so my cupcakes are going to start

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.860 
empty so my cupcakes are going to start
about<00:03:57.400> here<00:03:58.380> probably<00:03:59.790> just<00:04:00.790> leave<00:04:01.030> this

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
about here probably just leave this

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.149 
about here probably just leave this
space<00:04:02.140> for<00:04:02.500> another<00:04:02.890> cupcake<00:04:03.269> later<00:04:07.830> just<00:04:08.830> put

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
space for another cupcake later just put

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:21.439 
space for another cupcake later just put
some<00:04:09.489> glue<00:04:09.940> on<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.860> just<00:04:17.010> stab<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:20.049> on<00:04:20.320> there

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
some glue on and just stab that on there

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:31.350 
some glue on and just stab that on there
just<00:04:22.449> like<00:04:22.630> that

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.390 

so<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.390> dig<00:04:32.720> my<00:04:32.900> second<00:04:33.530> row<00:04:33.770> all<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.190> way

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
so I dig my second row all the way

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.990 
so I dig my second row all the way
around<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:36.110> now<00:04:36.440> I'm<00:04:36.620> going<00:04:36.890> to<00:04:37.070> do<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.970> very

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
around and now I'm going to do the very

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.950 
around and now I'm going to do the very
bottom<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.410> my<00:04:39.800> lantern<00:04:40.670> now<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.330> just<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.690> small

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
bottom of my lantern now I just a small

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.690 
bottom of my lantern now I just a small
intern<00:04:42.380> that's<00:04:42.590> why<00:04:42.770> I'm<00:04:43.160> only<00:04:43.340> going<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.580> have

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
intern that's why I'm only going to have

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.720 
intern that's why I'm only going to have
5<00:04:44.000> rows<00:04:44.300> but<00:04:45.200> if<00:04:45.350> you<00:04:45.440> had<00:04:45.650> one<00:04:46.040> of<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.280> larger

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
5 rows but if you had one of the larger

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.520 
5 rows but if you had one of the larger
lanterns<00:04:47.240> then<00:04:47.540> you<00:04:47.720> probably<00:04:47.990> would<00:04:48.410> be

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
lanterns then you probably would be

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.460 
lanterns then you probably would be
doing<00:04:48.860> more<00:04:49.130> than<00:04:49.190> just<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:50.780> five<00:04:50.960> rows<00:04:51.230> I'm

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
doing more than just the five rows I'm

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.750 
doing more than just the five rows I'm
gonna<00:04:51.740> do<00:04:52.630> so<00:04:53.630> once<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.230> get<00:04:54.560> one<00:04:54.860> step<00:04:55.520> away

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
gonna do so once you get one step away

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.110 
gonna do so once you get one step away
from<00:04:56.060> your<00:04:56.990> bottom<00:04:57.380> just<00:04:57.560> do<00:04:57.770> your<00:04:57.890> bottom<00:04:58.280> so

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
from your bottom just do your bottom so

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:08.050 
from your bottom just do your bottom so
that's<00:05:00.100> someone's<00:05:01.100> going<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.430> go

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.360 

so<00:05:08.510> now<00:05:08.750> you<00:05:08.810> have<00:05:08.990> to<00:05:09.230> do<00:05:09.380> our<00:05:09.410> fill<00:05:09.919> in<00:05:10.100> rows

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
so now you have to do our fill in rows

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.300 
so now you have to do our fill in rows
I've<00:05:11.120> already<00:05:11.360> done<00:05:11.660> my<00:05:11.690> first<00:05:12.260> one<00:05:12.650> up<00:05:12.919> here

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
I've already done my first one up here

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.420 
I've already done my first one up here
so<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:13.820> looks<00:05:13.970> like<00:05:14.090> this<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.860> now<00:05:15.980> I<00:05:16.010> have<00:05:16.250> to

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
so it looks like this and now I have to

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.129 
so it looks like this and now I have to
do<00:05:16.610> this<00:05:16.820> one<00:05:17.120> down<00:05:17.389> here<00:05:19.360> so<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.450> do<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:20.690> I'm

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
do this one down here so to do that I'm

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:27.370 
do this one down here so to do that I'm
just<00:05:21.200> going<00:05:21.590> to<00:05:21.710> get<00:05:21.860> my<00:05:22.070> cupcake<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:26.720> some

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
just going to get my cupcake and some

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:35.680 
just going to get my cupcake and some
glue<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:32.740> just<00:05:33.740> kind<00:05:34.639> of<00:05:34.700> open<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.300> space<00:05:35.630> up

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
glue and just kind of open the space up

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.830 
glue and just kind of open the space up
and<00:05:36.230> press<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:36.950> cupcake<00:05:37.400> in<00:05:37.669> there<00:05:40.750> so<00:05:41.750> it's
