so how long would it take to charge up

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.450 
so how long would it take to charge up
something<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.680> charge<00:00:55.680> time<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> typically

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
something like charge time is typically

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.130 
something like charge time is typically
about<00:00:56.610> six<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> eight<00:00:57.030> hours<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.570> how<00:00:57.960> long

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
about six to eight hours and how long

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.660 
about six to eight hours and how long

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
would that typically last you're gonna

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.279 
would that typically last you're gonna
get<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> range<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:00.449> 50<00:01:00.809> kilometers

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.380 
basically some BOTS with mesh seats
hmm<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.530> only<00:02:01.770> does<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.010> lighten<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.970> vehicle

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
hmm not only does it lighten the vehicle

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.540 
hmm not only does it lighten the vehicle
but<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.960> also<00:02:04.110> allows<00:02:04.470> for<00:02:04.500> some<00:02:04.920> circulation

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
but it also allows for some circulation

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.430 
but it also allows for some circulation
and<00:02:05.910> cooling<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.390> car<00:02:06.690> because<00:02:06.840> poor<00:02:07.170> skin

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
and cooling in the car because poor skin

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.139 
and cooling in the car because poor skin
want<00:02:08.220> air<00:02:08.340> conditioning<00:02:08.820> you're<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.060> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
want air conditioning you're going to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.510 
want air conditioning you're going to
draw<00:02:09.750> energy<00:02:09.959> from<00:02:10.170> your<00:02:10.410> battery<00:02:10.709> pack<00:02:10.979> right

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
draw energy from your battery pack right

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.000 
draw energy from your battery pack right
basically<00:02:12.240> otherwise<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:13.290> designed

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
basically otherwise it is designed

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.800 
basically otherwise it is designed
around<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.760> standard<00:02:15.120> automobile<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.750> was

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
around a standard automobile that was

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.750 
around a standard automobile that was
kind<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.350> idea<00:02:16.739> from<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.100> design<00:02:17.400> point<00:02:17.670> of

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
kind of the idea from a design point of

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.850 
kind of the idea from a design point of
view<00:02:17.820> design<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.660> like<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.810> car<00:02:19.140> no<00:02:19.530> designer

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
view design it like a car no designer

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.710 
view design it like a car no designer
like<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.100> golf<00:02:20.370> cart<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.120> Stan<00:02:21.510> Laurel

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
like a golf cart we have a Stan Laurel

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.870 
like a golf cart we have a Stan Laurel
which<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> four-door<00:02:22.590> for<00:02:22.980> Cedars<00:02:23.400> okay

which is a four-door for Cedars okay
family<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.989> then<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.320> have<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.680> Tropic<00:02:26.130> which

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
family and then we have the Tropic which

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.160 
family and then we have the Tropic which
is<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> open<00:02:27.000> version<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.840> buggy<00:02:28.140> version

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
is the open version the buggy version

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.170
