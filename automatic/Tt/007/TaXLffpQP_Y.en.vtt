00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:21.080
 unveils and mclaren mp4 12c spyder 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.039
 Therefore table frames can see 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.750
 here decapitated 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:30.619
 this is the discoverable version 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.900
 of the famous mp4 12c that makes 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.140
 havoc on circuit to all the track 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.140
 days 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:44.260
 and we can see here the concept pijuan 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.370
 concept car which mclaren gives no 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.879
 technical information 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.879
 it is actually a small mp4 12c 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.890
 an even sharper model yet 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.890
 lighter 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.550
 should once again turn to 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.550
 lovers of track days 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.219
 design 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.990
 really very muscular reminds her 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:14.500
 by the way a little renault dezir at 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.440
 level of mice before this 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.180
 musculature like that 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.630
 see the all-carbon blade 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.630
 in front of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.439
 with a very large windshield which 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:34.159
 reminds the universe of the nsx to have 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.159
 good visibility 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.730
 the exhaust outlets with the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.730
 carbon diffusers 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.470
 a simply beautiful object 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.460
 how does the press kit work? 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.460
 please you can explain to me 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.560
 yeah download the app 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.600
 exactly conceded charge of 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.470
 the application and then you just need 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.470
 simply to pass it 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.240
 sail and masts without having it especially 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.299
 that it is 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.299
 m 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.950
 it's great is fair 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.170
 m 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.610
 great applications thank you at peugeot 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.160
 we find this concept cars knicks 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.660
 with a 600 horsepower v8 hdi 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.330
 coupled with an electric motor 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.240
 this is a good hybrid is that a 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.570
 concept because any case at the style level 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.720
 it's very successful we have a front 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.300
 really sublime with felt f1 on 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.000
 can hope to find on future 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.810
 models from the range to start with the 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.980
 substitute for the 407 and it gives him 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.980
 still a lot more feline 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:11.290
 at lexus we find this concept cars 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.630
 cut 2 more than lfc it's a hybrid 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.380
 once again it's the tradition at 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.170
 lexus now 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.530
 and as we can see it is 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:27.160
 really a small coupe that evokes 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.940
 by the way the coupe ft-86 it's really 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.380
 cut small 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.480
 so I really like the work on 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.000
 optical even if it is a concept 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.810
 because it's still very pretty even 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.840
 it really worked out 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.530
 a ration of stop light in the antenna 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.080
 it's really not bad 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:50.170
 and here's the sparkling orange interior with 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:56.170
 instrumentation anyway counter 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:04:00.550
 central 13 leave a tactile set of 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.890
 gps menu control and then the 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.920
 ventilation we can see that we are sure 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.000
 obviously an automated transmission 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.500
 as safe 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.560
 the vast majority of vehicles 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:17.269
 hybrids it's very pretty cut a real 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.320
 success I hope it happens 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.320
 quickly in series
