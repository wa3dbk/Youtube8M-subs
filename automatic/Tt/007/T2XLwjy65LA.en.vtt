00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 everyone has felt or will feel 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.299
 sad at some point in your life 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.799
 after all bad things happen in our 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.360
 lives and around the world 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.190
 but when sadness is nothing more than 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.639
 no way and it's hard for us to live 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.639
 our routines 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.980
 depression considered one of the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.730
 common mental disorders 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.400
 of the world 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.840
 more than 350 million people live together 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.460
 with depression in their lives 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.500
 we call it major depressive disorder 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.570
 the condition in which a person feels the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.430
 constant monnerat wu a very vision 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.470
 Negative him a loss of interest 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.420
 for things that once turned pleasure 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.390
 the person feels so in the majority of the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.309
 time and for many weeks months and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.170
 even longer and this is one of the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.879
 main differences between pressure had 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.040
 and feel sad that something more 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.780
 passenger people with depression think 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.460
 different from people in depression is 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.769
 common that they present thoughts 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.449
 negatives and hopelessness that reflect 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.010
 how they see the world around them 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.019
 these thoughts arise from 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.630
 common negative beliefs in people with 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.470
 depression about yourself situations and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.820
 the future 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.740
 we have spoken before under the bias of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.630
 confirmation and motivated racine 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.220
 in the case of people with depression these 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.170
 have an important role to play in 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.700
 these people pay more attention to the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.470
 more importance to the information 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.990
 supports their negative beliefs while 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.280
 ignores or devalues ​​the importance of 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.090
 information contradictory to the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.440
 beliefs 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.450
 this tends to strengthen beliefs 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.550
 negative effects of the person over time and 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.140
 make the symptoms more severe in the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.150
 so far we have hit the analysis level 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.830
 of depression leading to 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.300
 account the level of biological 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.190
 we also know that released hormones 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.420
 during situations of great stress 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.400
 may alter the operation of the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.930
 neurons, especially these situations 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.270
 certain periods of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.710
 childhood and in a prolonged way and this 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.110
 may be related to a greater 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.640
 propensity to develop depression 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.810
 Research indicates that the hippocampus one 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.370
 region of the brain involved in 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.540
 memory operation can be 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.790
 damaged from release 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.620
 of these hormones and this can 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.300
 lead to a change even in the tonic 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.550
 in this region of the brain that predisposes 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.680
 people with depression 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.170
 depression can exist so powerless. 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.700
 apathetic and hopeless with their lives 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.259
 that their relations with others such 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.180
 everyday activities can be 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.470
 extremely committed to 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.269
 a greater propensity to isolate 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.640
 socially and to make an attempt to 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.080
 suicide in this sense depression 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.060
 condition that affects not only the people 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.590
 experiencing suffering but all the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.870
 the context in which it lives and 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.280
 economy of the country since, for example, 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.900
 of the major causes of 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.459
 work is depression 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.049
 despite knowledge about depression 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.850
 that we currently own and how this 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.230
 condition can be dangerous it 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.300
 still not taken seriously for much 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.520
 Many people think it's about something. 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.150
 controllable passenger or nothing serious 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.190
 too much 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.930
 depression is not usually under 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.240
 conscious control of the person and can 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.830
 seriously undermine her life without 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.780
 professional help can be extremely 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.280
 difficult to deal with this condition 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.750
 prevalence of depression in the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.670
 world is no longer explained by the absence 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.050
 of knowledge about the phenomenon or the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.300
 lack of alternatives for treatment 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.580
 there are already several treatments 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.530
 with high levels of effectiveness this high 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.870
 prevalence seems to be related to 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.550
 of fused products on the 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.380
 severe depression and may be also the 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.820
 I fear that many people still have to 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.420
 to call a professional to find 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.130
 help 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.230
 here are some tips that can help 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.670
 people with depression the first tip is 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.980

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.520
 a qualified professional who can 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.530
 to help 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.420
 This can make all the difference 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.640
 tip is to try to move deliberately 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.860
 in physical and social activities such as 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.900
 such as sports and encounters with 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.400
 friends regular involvement with these 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.410
 activities can have multiple effects 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.450
 and reduce symptoms 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.220
 one last tip is to try to pay attention 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.200
 and note down the thoughts that arise in your 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.970
 head just before you start to get 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.860

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.080

 realistic collecting these thoughts 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.720
 can help to flex beliefs 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.030
 and reduce the symptoms of 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.400

 people knew how many lives 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.630
 could not be spared a huge 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.390
 suffering and even death 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.890
 premature short and share the video
