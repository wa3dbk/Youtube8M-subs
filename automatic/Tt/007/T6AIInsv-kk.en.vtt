products like oily products i guess um

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.640

this<00:04:34.699> sometimes<00:04:35.210> is<00:04:35.419> a<00:04:35.449> bit<00:04:36.050> too<00:04:36.229> much<00:04:36.349> for<00:04:36.409> me

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
this sometimes is a bit too much for me

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.260 
this sometimes is a bit too much for me
so<00:04:36.800> i<00:04:36.979> tend<00:04:37.159> to<00:04:37.250> keep<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.550> just<00:04:37.669> on<00:04:37.849> the<00:04:37.940> ends

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
so i tend to keep it just on the ends

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.700 
so i tend to keep it just on the ends
because<00:04:38.509> it<00:04:38.780> does<00:04:38.930> do<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.080> pretty<00:04:39.319> good<00:04:39.409> job<00:04:39.530> at

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
because it does do a pretty good job at

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.640 
because it does do a pretty good job at
like<00:04:39.979> not<00:04:40.580> exactly<00:04:40.879> mending<00:04:41.780> split<00:04:42.080> ends<00:04:42.409> but

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
it's almost like suffocating the hair

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.230 
it's almost like suffocating the hair
shaft<00:05:45.650> and<00:05:45.919> it's<00:05:46.159> not<00:05:46.340> allowing<00:05:46.789> for<00:05:47.000> any

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
shaft and it's not allowing for any

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.480 
shaft and it's not allowing for any
natural<00:05:47.900> oils<00:05:48.440> and<00:05:48.710> moisture<00:05:49.130> to<00:05:49.250> get<00:05:49.370> in

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
natural oils and moisture to get in

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.860 
natural oils and moisture to get in
there<00:05:49.639> so<00:05:49.909> keeping<00:05:50.389> it<00:05:50.449> as<00:05:50.569> light<00:05:50.719> as<00:05:50.840> possible

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
there so keeping it as light as possible

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.170 
there so keeping it as light as possible
is<00:05:51.469> a<00:05:51.500> nice<00:05:51.889> thing<00:05:52.099> to<00:05:52.130> do<00:05:52.400> but<00:05:52.729> here's<00:05:53.120> a

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
afro but it just gets like turns into a

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.530 
afro but it just gets like turns into a
frizzy<00:07:09.920> lion's<00:07:10.430> mane<00:07:10.670> actually<00:07:11.300> is<00:07:11.390> what<00:07:11.480> I

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
frizzy lion's mane actually is what I

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.940 
frizzy lion's mane actually is what I
like<00:07:11.660> to<00:07:11.750> compare<00:07:12.050> it<00:07:12.170> to<00:07:12.290> but<00:07:12.530> this<00:07:12.650> kind<00:07:12.830> of

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:12.950 
like to compare it to but this kind of

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.710 
like to compare it to but this kind of
helps<00:07:13.190> prevent<00:07:13.520> that<00:07:13.700> and<00:07:13.760> turn<00:07:14.180> it<00:07:14.330> into<00:07:14.450> just

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 
helps prevent that and turn it into just

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.990 
helps prevent that and turn it into just
like<00:07:14.840> beachy<00:07:15.050> little<00:07:15.500> curly<00:07:16.010> waves<00:07:16.250> so<00:07:16.760> I

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 
like beachy little curly waves so I

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.520
