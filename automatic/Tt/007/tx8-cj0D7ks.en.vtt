00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.520
 Let's run the luxury party review there. 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.199
 talk about this collection of objects that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.940
 arrived and I already consider pacas first 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.120
 game of the year and a half when I entered the menu 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.850
 and I went to see what this pec had and he 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.930
 showed some hair some clothes and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.390
 only this of expensive objects as can a 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:08.280
 Collection of objects having 12 punk objects 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.549
 this is a lot of old dirty 12 objects 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.619
 but okay I stopped the deep and 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.720
 I say good, we'll see how are the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.819
 things inside the game because it can be 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.770
 which is beautiful and was where I started to 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.659
 to open only the things of the rainy 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.030
 free by placing inside another void 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.950
 he comes two new rooms one that is a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.560
 more space out of the house to the other 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.750
 the most closed lot and the objects yesterday 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.420
 that beautiful but can be used for 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.640
 to do party 2004 he attends the theme of 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.610
 which is very important but it is very 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.289
 little face is very little object these 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.049
 are the objects of the personal rainy looks 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.530
 only in it come some chairs a few lights 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.110
 it's a curtain just a bar a cube that 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.420
 So far I do not know what it's for and two 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.310
 new items that is the buffet and also a 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.319
 sweet waterfall that you should already have 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.360
 seen at the mall business that makes you want 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.789
 Of you, eating everything ahead. 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.769
 because it a waterfall dropped chocolate 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:06.000
 maybe just celebrating good conversations 

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:08.670
 baguley and has nothing else no floor 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.550
 no painting and nothing more than 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.769
 You're there, but beauty, I went. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.019
 then see the luxurious party clothes I 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.940
 I said ready I think it 's something 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.209
 it will be worth it and I almost got it 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.280
 cancer in men's clothing only face 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.830
 two shirts and to speak real I do not 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.800
 I did not like any of them and no color 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.069
 He does not come in pants and costumes, my friend. 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.440
 I've got older than you look 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.330
 a watermelon he left for example - 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.160
 and another that is the case of the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:44.050
 roberto carlos at the end of the year on the globe 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.730
 I'm here I live this moment and 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.410
 after getting a cancer I went there 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.390
 so the hair is not 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.860
 and I found until they're cool or 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.510
 I do not use because I have content 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.300
 custom design that made the most 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.820
 my opinion but at least the hair 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.560
 until you save on this technique and nothing 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.240
 clothes for children also only for 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.620
 teenagers by child stay 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.390
 Outside the party, it's gone. 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.390
 the women's clothes is that thing 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.100
 miracle of this pec that if you buy 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.740
 one of the things that will only be worth more 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.870
 they are because women's clothing up 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.790
 cool, come two t-shirts 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.700
 for women is also a good 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.990
 simple and one as even to decotão 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.770
 see you become law 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.870
 adda in the cup catar and others of this pec 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.250
 they look very beautiful, they are very beautiful 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.680
 of dresses that we have 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.210
 and they are really very beautiful and 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.750
 style I would use for one so 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.040
 my case in a luxurious party and I 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.020
 I think this is going to be very worthwhile. 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.510
 if you want to have a luxurious party 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.360
 everything else and more forward I think the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.310
 until they married very well with the 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.650
 theme of the pec as well as the objects and everything 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.690
 most only have a difference it comes a 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.920
 good amount of strategies so 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.780
 That I'm talking so well about them because 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.640
 For me, it's a quantity until 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.820
 reasonable it has a good amount of 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.220
 dressed in this pec the female hair 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.810
 I did not find great things there because I 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.610
 custom use for 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.380
 women, but some hair 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.150
 Calm down that matching with the clothes 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.090
 so it's worth it if you go 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.310
 to use is the fate of the four not picking up 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.680
 the personalized content summarizing the 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.270
 and say that we would have new things 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.669
 the object back that would 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.060
 Different my God, I found nothing. 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.440
 different found nothing says one thing the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.480
 extraordinary impute the fucking bitch 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.770
 collection of objects because she's a 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.570
 buy now there is one thing you have to 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.190
 unlike other interaction that 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.700
 people had not before 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.390
 is the buffet and the waterfall of candy there and not 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.710
 I know what 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.990
 and nothing more than that 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.570
 that 3 also came with objects 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.380
 unprecedented interactions in things and 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.870
 objects 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.850
 obviously at 3 it was more expensive things 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.820
 objects but also saw more objects in the 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.980
 that 12 né tip quipá of rest I do not think 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.440
 which is worth so much for 20 reais 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.270
 and they could give it for free wait 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.700
 register and it is much more a way of 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.800
 good girl business there and make us 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.600
 much happier than not even wanting 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.980
 beg not but it's because I'm 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.440
 spending 20 and says that this 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.330
 because I 'm getting very pissed I have 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.280
 money to pay so much for their bostas 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.600
 of 3 in the neighborhood of simães de junta 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.940
 money with promoters 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.910
 there they come with twenty reais for a pec 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.310
 that has almost nothing but some is 20 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.260
 for some people is still not enough 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.720
 so if you want to spend 20 reais there 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.330
 You can spend 20 reais and I think it will 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.530
 worth buying and if this 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.170
 object condition 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.610
 Do you buy if not welcome to the club? 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.350
 would not buy if it was not to do 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.540
 the videos and I also have a goal of 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.310
 collect everything from this month four until the 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.770
 end of the cycle if we have a 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.590
 possible 5 yet but can be sure 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.450
 that if you have nine more collections of 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.070
 objects that came out in my video 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.900
 humor and everything else 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.790
 this way the new ones with their objects 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.310
 being this way with the objects in the 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.560
 I'll send the whole world to fucking hell 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.340
 that the coolest thing about this pec is the 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.140
 trailer 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.240
 okay, this is it this was mine 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.310
 analysis if you decide if you will 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.900
 buy or not I showed I gave my 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.780
 opinion I hope it has helped 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.460
 You choose everything there, but if you 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.680
 talk think you do not like it because 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.840
 is criticizing the same critical critic 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.320
 Even when it 's bad I say the technician is 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.610
 Good miss is good business with me is 80 for 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.200
 81 pride 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.090
 only in the comments you will buy 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.370
 or not if you 're angry you can 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.260
 writing a text there sends a bullet there 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.390
 This is what I like. 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.580
 recent videos there on the channel have many 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.560
 rumors left the sims still and everything 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.020
 But you did not see, maybe we'll have one. 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.180
 of his pets coming and maybe he 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.370
 improve this image that was later 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.010
 This pecs to me fucking bitch, then it's 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.080
 Thank you, God, thank you. 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.450
 you liked this video and did not like and 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.030
 physics explains in your years as well as 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.030
 Who created this shit of sipec and bye.
