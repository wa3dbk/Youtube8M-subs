strip okay our second point is this line

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.820 
strip okay our second point is this line
right<00:01:57.690> here<00:01:57.750> that's<00:01:58.409> what<00:01:58.530> we<00:01:58.560> call<00:01:58.800> a

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
right here that's what we call a

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.550 
right here that's what we call a
reference<00:01:59.130> marker<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.110> lined<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.500> with

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
reference marker and it's lined up with

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.240 
reference marker and it's lined up with
your<00:02:01.710> shoulder<00:02:02.929> so<00:02:03.929> I'm<00:02:04.470> gonna<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.860> across

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
your shoulder so I'm gonna go across

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.040 
your shoulder so I'm gonna go across

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
with me and find a reference marker

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.229 
with me and find a reference marker
which<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.190> same<00:02:08.459> line<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.880> other<00:02:09.000> side

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
which is the same line on the other side

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.770 
which is the same line on the other side
however<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.679> case<00:02:11.180> I'm<00:02:12.180> not<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.480> to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
however in this case I'm not going to

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.270 
however in this case I'm not going to
use<00:02:13.019> that<00:02:13.350> because<00:02:13.590> there's<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:14.069> enough

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
use that because there's not enough

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.789 
use that because there's not enough
space<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.670> use<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.870> I'm<00:02:15.930> gonna<00:02:16.080> do<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> what's

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
space to use it so I'm gonna do a what's

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.400 
space to use it so I'm gonna do a what's
known<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.130> an<00:02:17.220> alley<00:02:17.489> dog<00:02:17.989> so<00:02:18.989> on<00:02:19.110> an<00:02:19.230> alley

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
known as an alley dog so on an alley

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.350 
known as an alley dog so on an alley
dock<00:02:19.769> we've<00:02:20.400> got<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:20.760> things<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.120> little<00:02:21.239> bit

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
dock we've got to do things a little bit

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.009 
dock we've got to do things a little bit
differently<00:02:22.370> normally<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:24.180> had<00:02:24.420> some<00:02:24.750> space

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
differently normally if I had some space

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.650 
differently normally if I had some space
out<00:02:25.260> there<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.620> would<00:02:25.829> pull<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.040> my<00:02:27.000> third<00:02:27.269> point

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
out there I would pull up my third point

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.420 
out there I would pull up my third point
about<00:02:28.560> center<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.190> next<00:02:29.489> aisle

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
about center of the next aisle

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.559 
about center of the next aisle
space<00:02:32.170> that's<00:02:33.170> not<00:02:33.260> gonna<00:02:33.500> work<00:02:33.709> this<00:02:34.430> time

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
space that's not gonna work this time

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.569 
space that's not gonna work this time
but<00:02:35.569> that<00:02:35.810> would<00:02:36.049> put<00:02:36.290> my<00:02:36.470> taint<00:02:36.829> my<00:02:37.129> traitor

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
I'm going to go up one more space

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.570
