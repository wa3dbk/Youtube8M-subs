very well that this water produces an

and the acidosis was reversed virtually

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.719 
and the acidosis was reversed virtually
instantly<00:03:25.659> by<00:03:26.439> the<00:03:26.579> administration<00:03:27.579> of

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
now here's another question and this has

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.270 
now here's another question and this has
been<00:05:39.090> battered<00:05:39.900> around<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.650> number<00:05:40.800> of<00:05:40.949> times

and asked in different forms which is

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.379 
and asked in different forms which is
the<00:05:45.030> following<00:05:45.949> can<00:05:46.949> you<00:05:47.250> become<00:05:47.849> too

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
the following can you become too

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.680 
the following can you become too
alkaline<00:05:49.310> by<00:05:50.310> drinking<00:05:50.789> too<00:05:51.000> much<00:05:51.180> kind<00:05:51.570> of

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
alkaline by drinking too much kind of

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.060 
alkaline by drinking too much kind of
water<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:53.550> answer<00:05:54.120> is<00:05:54.270> absolutely<00:05:55.070> no

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
water and the answer is absolutely no

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.770 
water and the answer is absolutely no
way<00:05:56.610> our<00:05:57.449> bodies

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.460 

our<00:06:01.740> bodies<00:06:02.280> have<00:06:02.310> a<00:06:02.790> very<00:06:03.240> very<00:06:03.630> efficient

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
our bodies have a very very efficient

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.990 
our bodies have a very very efficient
mechanism<00:06:05.220> of<00:06:05.370> dealing<00:06:05.970> with<00:06:06.050> acid<00:06:07.050> and<00:06:08.000> there

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
mechanism of dealing with acid and there

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.390 
mechanism of dealing with acid and there
are<00:06:09.090> two<00:06:09.390> pathways<00:06:09.810> one<00:06:10.530> through<00:06:11.010> the<00:06:11.160> lungs

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
are two pathways one through the lungs

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.050 
are two pathways one through the lungs
and<00:06:11.850> the<00:06:12.660> other<00:06:12.810> through<00:06:13.170> the<00:06:13.290> now<00:06:14.060> organ

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
and the other through the now organ

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.980 
and the other through the now organ
transplants

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990

that's<00:06:16.320> a<00:06:16.530> frequent<00:06:16.980> question<00:06:17.600> my<00:06:18.600> prospect

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
that's a frequent question my prospect

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.410 
that's a frequent question my prospect
doesn't<00:06:19.920> want<00:06:20.160> to<00:06:20.280> drink<00:06:20.490> the<00:06:20.670> water<00:06:20.910> because

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
doesn't want to drink the water because

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.020 
doesn't want to drink the water because
she<00:06:21.660> had<00:06:21.810> a<00:06:21.840> kidney<00:06:22.170> transplant<00:06:22.980> and<00:06:23.190> will

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
she had a kidney transplant and will

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.510 
she had a kidney transplant and will
think<00:06:24.390> it<00:06:25.350> will<00:06:25.500> interfere<00:06:26.100> with<00:06:26.160> her

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
think it will interfere with her

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.210 
think it will interfere with her
anti-rejection<00:06:27.170> medicine<00:06:28.170> well<00:06:28.680> let<00:06:28.920> me<00:06:28.950> say

anti-rejection medicine well let me say

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.490 
anti-rejection medicine well let me say
this<00:06:29.250> I<00:06:29.700> don't<00:06:30.150> know<00:06:30.360> if<00:06:30.450> any<00:06:30.690> medicine<00:06:31.290> that

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
this I don't know if any medicine that

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.070 
this I don't know if any medicine that
kangen<00:06:32.190> water<00:06:32.220> interferes<00:06:33.000> with<00:06:33.270> I<00:06:33.600> think

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
kangen water interferes with I think

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.710 
kangen water interferes with I think
that's<00:06:34.260> a<00:06:34.410> total<00:06:34.950> myth<00:06:35.250> in<00:06:35.400> fact<00:06:35.760> I<00:06:36.090> have<00:06:36.480> now

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
that's a total myth in fact I have now

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.560 
that's a total myth in fact I have now
met<00:06:37.110> three<00:06:37.650> heart<00:06:38.190> transplants<00:06:39.000> patients<00:06:39.450> who

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
met three heart transplants patients who

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.640 
met three heart transplants patients who
are<00:06:39.750> in<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.980> kangen<00:06:41.370> water<00:06:41.400> family<00:06:42.120> and

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
are in the kangen water family and

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.170 
are in the kangen water family and
multiple<00:06:43.650> people<00:06:43.680> with<00:06:44.070> kidney<00:06:44.400> transplants

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
multiple people with kidney transplants

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.500 
multiple people with kidney transplants
and<00:06:45.360> there<00:06:46.020> is<00:06:46.160> absolutely<00:06:47.160> no<00:06:47.430> way<00:06:47.970> in<00:06:48.300> which

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
and there is absolutely no way in which

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.480 
and there is absolutely no way in which
they<00:06:48.750> have<00:06:48.900> been<00:06:48.930> adversely<00:06:49.590> affect<00:06:50.130> clicks

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
they have been adversely affect clicks

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.590 
they have been adversely affect clicks
water<00:06:51.120> Li

water Li

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.100

so<00:06:52.520> organ<00:06:53.520> transplants<00:06:54.270> can<00:06:54.450> get<00:06:54.930> water

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
so organ transplants can get water

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.470 
so organ transplants can get water
totally<00:06:55.800> compatible<00:06:57.020> and<00:06:58.250> then<00:06:59.250> there<00:06:59.640> is<00:06:59.880> a

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
totally compatible and then there is a

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.500 
totally compatible and then there is a
