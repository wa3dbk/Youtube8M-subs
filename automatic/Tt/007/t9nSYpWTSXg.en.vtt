00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 no 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.270
 hi today we prepare a dish a little 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.789
 particular we make gnocchi made 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.960
 with some potatoes that I have here already 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.670
 ready they are cold already passed and headlights 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.530
 let it cool thing because unknown 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:47.210
 they should always be made with cold potatoes 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:50.930
 and asparagus here or peeled and or cooked or 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.360
 cooked asparagus then a part o 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.860
 chopped or crushed there a part I 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.570
 left whole what I did though 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.119
 in the water or cooked asparagus later 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.040
 or cooked the potatoes so that the potatoes 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:05.869
 committed themselves to the taste of the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.170
 asparagus 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:15.110
 everything here now we prepare ours 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.700
 gnocchi we take in eyes that are unknown 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.900
 excuse me and the chopped asparagus e 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.030
 we mix together with the potatoes how many 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.939
 I would say that right 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.219
 the nice thing would be to put the 50 x 50 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.740
 50 percent, however, be very careful 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.920
 because the asparagus being a lot 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.020
 wet then they bring us to the eyes a lot 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.979
 flosci etc so do a lot 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.679
 caution 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:50.689
 let's put a couple of spoonfuls of 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:53.780
 Parmesan or salted water so not 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.439
 you need to salt nothing more from just 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.450
 as soon as 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:06.340
 I would say half an egg if you want to insert 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.340
 only just the egg yolk is fine 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:16.819
 then flour 00 I would say a couple of 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.130
 spoons to you is more than enough for 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.440
 knead to knead everything 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.950
 unknown 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.450
 in this case they must be handled 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.459
 very little just the potatoes if they are 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.620
 we will say so amalgamate ours well 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.290
 dumplings are ready do not handle towels 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.930
 so much because you overhaul yourself 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.060
 the more moccas they become, the more difficult then 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.120
 pull them because we are adding 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:50.150
 flour meal flour and this implies 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.150
 then they become hard become brutes 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:02.370
 from the loaf of dumpling we have for it 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:09.200
 let's take a little and start doing like 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.200
 always in Veneto for example the beagle 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:21.840
 we can't always flour anyway 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:27.079
 remember to handle them very much 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.079
 little because this is very important 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:36.919
 now I speak 45 45 at a time 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.409
 ok 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.590
 let's go a saucer 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:31.650
 let 's pass the fire always remember that 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:35.199
 when he plays the games in the fire water 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.360
 nice warm and i these dumplings i them 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.280
 I would do butter and butter again 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.130
 feel the full flavor of the spa 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.750
 stake if we want we can put the 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.690
 slices of asparagus as in this case 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:51.250
 I have cooked asparagus or 2 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.770
 Raw asparagus sauteed I 'd put it right 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.479
 natural at best or if 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:09.190
 we want and jump with a new is a bit 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:12.150
 of Parmesan and here we are ours 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:17.490
 dumplings as you see are ready 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.490
 insert in melted butter 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.920
 let them jump very little because 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:39.200
 otherwise they are very soft 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.200
 become a jelly 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.440
 you can make butter and sage you can 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.980
 do whatever you want I left them 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.310
 so natural simply because 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:03.060
 as I said before I want to hear about it 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:07.320
 asparagus flavor at most at 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:10.260
 maximum I would just put 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.920
 just a new one with a 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.960
 dash of cream and a new here is this 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.710
 our dish a dish a dish that 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.660
 has costs 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.000
 well if we are at the beginning of the season 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.890
 has quite high costs while 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.930
 when we are in full season 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.460
 asparagus also costs little 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.690
 another thing I wanted to say is that 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.270
 you can also do it with asparagus 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:34.290
 green and the exact same plant only 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.570
 that one does not come out into the air the other 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.610
 I get out in the air and take the 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.780
 Chlorophyll's all the plant is is 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.490
 equal 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.900
 with this it seems to me that I have said everything 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.810
 I thank you for your time 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.290
 dedicated and as always to god liking 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.770
 see you tomorrow 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.770
 Hello
