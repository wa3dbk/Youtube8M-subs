to add the banelings here and that's
something<00:01:10.229> i<00:01:10.409> usually<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> ten-ton

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
something i usually do with the ten-ton

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.330 
something i usually do with the ten-ton
yeah<00:01:11.880> she<00:01:12.090> doesn't<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.510> yeah<00:01:12.900> he<00:01:13.049> gets<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
yeah she doesn't do yeah he gets the the

yeah she doesn't do yeah he gets the the
spawning<00:01:14.939> pool<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.689> bit<00:01:15.840> faster<00:01:16.110> um

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
spawning pool a little bit faster um

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.179 
spawning pool a little bit faster um
it's<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.000> definitely<00:01:18.479> an<00:01:18.780> even<00:01:19.110> more<00:01:19.380> all<00:01:19.830> in

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
it's it's definitely an even more all in

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.100 
it's it's definitely an even more all in
an<00:01:20.400> aggressive<00:01:20.820> type<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> gives<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.840> few

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
an aggressive type of it gives you a few

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109 
an aggressive type of it gives you a few
extra<00:01:22.470> seconds<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.610> does<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.000> affect

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
extra seconds but it does kind of affect

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
extra seconds but it does kind of affect
your<00:01:24.450> economy<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.920> so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
your economy when you go for this so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.740 
your economy when you go for this so
sick<00:01:26.340> slings<00:01:26.580> already<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> way<00:01:27.180> eight<00:01:27.450> in

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
sick slings already on the way eight in

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.020 
sick slings already on the way eight in
total<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.560> he's<00:01:28.979> committing<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.640> big

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
total here he's committing to this big

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.580 
total here he's committing to this big
time<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> bill<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.350> for

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
time with the bill that we have here for

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.289 
time with the bill that we have here for
him<00:01:31.710> he's<00:01:31.860> also<00:01:32.040> sacrificing<00:01:32.820> an<00:01:32.909> additional

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
him he's also sacrificing an additional

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.569 
him he's also sacrificing an additional
lava<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:33.930> zerglings<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:35.100> gives<00:01:35.310> him<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
lava for zerglings and this gives him a

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.280 
lava for zerglings and this gives him a
much<00:01:36.030> weaker<00:01:36.240> economy<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.900> he<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.140> usually

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
much weaker economy that he will usually

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.170 
much weaker economy that he will usually
have<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:37.829> already<00:01:38.369> mentioned<00:01:38.490> before<00:01:38.880> he's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
have as already mentioned before he's

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.580 
have as already mentioned before he's
going<00:01:39.479> into<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> baneling<00:01:40.110> nest<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.439> of

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
going into the baneling nest here of

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.830 
going into the baneling nest here of
course<00:01:40.619> speed<00:01:41.430> would<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.850> hit<00:01:41.970> way<00:01:42.360> too<00:01:42.420> late

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
course speed would just hit way too late

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.359 
course speed would just hit way too late
so<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> baneling<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.680> making<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.130> lot<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.280> sense

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
so the baneling is making a lot of sense

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.399 
so the baneling is making a lot of sense
for<00:01:44.610> him<00:01:44.850> instead<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> 1010<00:01:45.990> he<00:01:46.140> plays<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
for him instead of the 1010 he plays a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.830 
for him instead of the 1010 he plays a

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
build and that could get really iffy for

already saw it with his overlord just
barely<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.210> he<00:02:03.270> sees<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> link<00:02:03.750> timing<00:02:04.140> here

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
barely so he sees the link timing here

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.959 
barely so he sees the link timing here
and<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.860> they<00:02:04.950> come<00:02:05.130> went<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> his<00:02:05.520> main<00:02:05.729> base

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
and here they come went to his main base

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.279 
and here they come went to his main base
he<00:02:06.420> needs<00:02:06.600> perfect<00:02:07.170> control<00:02:07.439> on<00:02:07.710> those

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
he needs perfect control on those

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.169

to<00:02:10.269> defend<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.689> pool<00:02:10.869> but<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.469> looks<00:02:11.769> pretty

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
to defend the pool but it looks pretty

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.309 
to defend the pool but it looks pretty
much<00:02:12.219> like<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.609> builder<00:02:13.030> when<00:02:13.239> drg<00:02:13.810> waiting

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
much like a builder when drg waiting

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.679 
much like a builder when drg waiting
buying<00:02:14.829> himself<00:02:15.129> some<00:02:15.459> time<00:02:15.609> going<00:02:16.269> in<00:02:16.510> with

the<00:02:16.780> drones<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.590> pool<00:02:17.950> not<00:02:18.310> going<00:02:18.609> down<00:02:18.730> that

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
the drones the pool not going down that

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.789 
the drones the pool not going down that
would<00:02:19.090> have<00:02:19.180> been<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.420> GG<00:02:19.719> right<00:02:19.989> away<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:20.530> far

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
would have been the GG right away so far

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.649 
would have been the GG right away so far
the<00:02:20.950> edgy<00:02:21.219> trying<00:02:21.609> to<00:02:21.849> do<00:02:21.969> what<00:02:22.120> he<00:02:22.209> can<00:02:22.390> the

main base one bailing hit could take

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.819 
main base one bailing hit could take
down<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.209> entire<00:02:28.329> economy<00:02:29.079> of<00:02:29.319> donegal
