00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
if you need to do touch-ups like if you

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.010 
if you need to do touch-ups like if you
see<00:06:42.830> I<00:06:43.240> feel<00:06:44.240> like<00:06:44.360> there's<00:06:44.630> not<00:06:44.780> enough

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
see I feel like there's not enough

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.990 
see I feel like there's not enough
turquoise<00:06:45.410> on<00:06:45.650> it<00:06:45.800> you<00:06:46.010> can<00:06:46.160> just<00:06:46.190> go<00:06:46.430> back<00:06:46.670> you

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000

on that and that's all the colors now
i'm<00:06:58.220> going<00:06:58.340> to<00:06:58.400> use<00:06:58.640> i<00:06:58.790> bet<00:06:59.300> you<00:06:59.420> could<00:06:59.570> use

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
i'm going to use i bet you could use

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.990 
i'm going to use i bet you could use
more<00:06:59.960> but<00:07:00.250> it's<00:07:01.250> hard<00:07:01.430> to<00:07:01.460> fit<00:07:01.640> it<00:07:01.730> on<00:07:01.850> your

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 
more but it's hard to fit it on your

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.990 
more but it's hard to fit it on your
nail<00:07:02.120> and<00:07:03.070> the<00:07:04.070> last<00:07:04.310> thing<00:07:04.520> I<00:07:04.640> did<00:07:04.790> want<00:07:04.880> to

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
nail and the last thing I did want to

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.520 
nail and the last thing I did want to
mention<00:07:05.060> is<00:07:05.450> the<00:07:05.480> last<00:07:05.780> color<00:07:06.080> that<00:07:06.260> I<00:07:06.290> put<00:07:06.470> on

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
mention is the last color that I put on

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.270 
mention is the last color that I put on
there<00:07:06.770> i<00:07:07.750> usually<00:07:08.750> get<00:07:09.080> right<00:07:09.470> at<00:07:09.740> the<00:07:09.770> tip<00:07:10.070> of

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
there i usually get right at the tip of

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.750 
there i usually get right at the tip of
my<00:07:10.340> nail<00:07:10.640> and<00:07:11.740> just<00:07:12.740> make<00:07:12.920> it<00:07:13.100> solid<00:07:13.370> because

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:13.760 
my nail and just make it solid because

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.990 
my nail and just make it solid because
you<00:07:13.970> can<00:07:14.090> probably<00:07:14.270> see<00:07:14.420> it<00:07:14.600> doesn't<00:07:14.960> come

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
you can probably see it doesn't come

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.970 
you can probably see it doesn't come
like<00:07:17.000> right<00:07:17.330> through<00:07:17.660> it<00:07:17.750> to<00:07:17.870> color<00:07:18.110> as<00:07:18.560> i<00:07:18.710> drop

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 
like right through it to color as i drop

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.570 
like right through it to color as i drop
nail<00:07:19.550> polish<00:07:20.000> or<00:07:20.240> even<00:07:20.480> my<00:07:20.540> laptop<00:07:21.550> anyway<00:07:22.550> i

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580 
nail polish or even my laptop anyway i

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.440 
nail polish or even my laptop anyway i
just<00:07:22.790> think<00:07:23.030> it<00:07:23.120> makes<00:07:23.150> it<00:07:23.390> look<00:07:23.600> better<00:07:25.450> looks

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:26.450 
just think it makes it look better looks

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.330 
just think it makes it look better looks
helps<00:07:27.110> it<00:07:27.230> look<00:07:27.350> more<00:07:27.470> blended<00:07:27.800> I<00:07:27.860> guess<00:07:28.040> so

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340 
helps it look more blended I guess so

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.390 
helps it look more blended I guess so
we'll<00:07:28.520> let<00:07:28.640> that<00:07:28.670> dry<00:07:29.090> and<00:07:29.770> put<00:07:30.770> a<00:07:30.830> top<00:07:31.040> coat<00:07:31.250> on

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:31.400 
we'll let that dry and put a top coat on

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.230 
we'll let that dry and put a top coat on
it<00:07:31.430> and<00:07:31.610> then<00:07:31.700> i'll<00:07:31.790> just<00:07:31.820> show<00:07:32.060> you<00:07:32.090> the
