then<00:02:08.590> you<00:02:08.979> want<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.399> make<00:02:09.729> sure<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.539> area

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
then you want to make sure that the area

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.620 
then you want to make sure that the area
is<00:02:11.079> relatively<00:02:11.620> clear<00:02:12.130> of<00:02:12.310> Splash<00:02:12.700> Damage<00:02:12.730> so

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
is relatively clear of Splash Damage so

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.060 
is relatively clear of Splash Damage so
that<00:02:13.750> brings<00:02:13.870> me<00:02:14.049> back<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.260> my<00:02:14.410> original<00:02:14.650> point

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
that brings me back to my original point

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.160 
that brings me back to my original point
why<00:02:15.730> do<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.000> want<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.239> backup<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.690> lava<00:02:16.900> hound

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
why do you want to backup a lava hound

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.990 
why do you want to backup a lava hound
that<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.380> deploy<00:02:17.709> late<00:02:18.040> with<00:02:18.250> balloons<00:02:18.640> well

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
that you deploy late with balloons well

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.640 
that you deploy late with balloons well
you<00:02:19.150> want<00:02:19.329> to<00:02:19.390> make<00:02:19.510> sure<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.780> area<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.200> clear

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
you want to make sure the area is clear

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.439 
you want to make sure the area is clear
so<00:02:20.950> think<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.640> lava<00:02:21.850> hound<00:02:22.209> as<00:02:22.419> a

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:22.449 
so think of the lava hound as a

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.990 
so think of the lava hound as a
distracting<00:02:23.199> offensive<00:02:23.799> unit<00:02:24.130> rather<00:02:24.699> than

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
distracting offensive unit rather than

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.479 
distracting offensive unit rather than
an<00:02:25.150> offensive<00:02:25.630> powerhouse<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.769> mean<00:02:27.340> obviously

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
an offensive powerhouse I mean obviously

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.260 
an offensive powerhouse I mean obviously
the<00:02:27.910> often

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
the often

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.940 
the often
is<00:02:28.420> critical<00:02:28.930> but<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.470> want<00:02:29.710> to<00:02:29.800> make<00:02:29.920> sure

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
is critical but you want to make sure

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.640 
is critical but you want to make sure
that<00:02:30.550> they<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:31.630> clear<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.110> area<00:02:32.290> as

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
that they that you clear the area as

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.410 
that they that you clear the area as
well<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:32.980> always<00:02:33.400> team<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.880> up<00:02:33.940> with<00:02:34.120> at<00:02:34.240> least

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
well so always team it up with at least

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.930 
well so always team it up with at least
a<00:02:34.600> few<00:02:34.810> balloons<00:02:35.260> coming<00:02:35.620> behind<00:02:36.070> now<00:02:36.700> this

and<00:03:19.690> they're<00:03:20.080> pretty<00:03:20.230> centrally<00:03:20.800> located<00:03:21.250> but

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
and they're pretty centrally located but

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.130 
and they're pretty centrally located but
that's<00:03:21.910> not<00:03:22.090> gonna<00:03:22.240> be<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> match<00:03:22.690> for<00:03:22.720> the

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
that's not gonna be a match for the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.870 
that's not gonna be a match for the
killer<00:03:23.380> as<00:03:23.650> he<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:23.950> going<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.280> deploy<00:03:24.610> his

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
killer as he is going to deploy his

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.600 
killer as he is going to deploy his
hounds<00:03:25.420> in<00:03:26.020> groups<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.680> two<00:03:26.860> from<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> north

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
hounds in groups of two from the north

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.580 
hounds in groups of two from the north
deploying<00:03:28.210> hounds<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.900> groups<00:03:29.080> of<00:03:29.200> two<00:03:29.410> as<00:03:29.560> a

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
deploying hounds and groups of two as a

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.620 
deploying hounds and groups of two as a
townhall<00:03:30.100> 9<00:03:30.130> it's<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.910> smart<00:03:31.270> way<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.450> go

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
townhall 9 it's a smart way to go

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.750 
townhall 9 it's a smart way to go
especially<00:03:32.020> if<00:03:32.350> you're<00:03:32.380> bringing<00:03:32.680> for<00:03:33.160> two

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
especially if you're bringing for two

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.370 
especially if you're bringing for two
groups<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.180> two<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.570> pretty<00:03:34.780> smart<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
groups of two is pretty smart and the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.410 
groups of two is pretty smart and the
reason<00:03:35.680> being<00:03:35.890> because<00:03:36.040> level<00:03:36.670> two<00:03:36.910> hounds

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
reason being because level two hounds

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.970 
reason being because level two hounds
obviously<00:03:38.080> don't<00:03:38.230> have<00:03:38.350> quite<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.860> hit

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
obviously don't have quite the hit

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.680 
obviously don't have quite the hit
points<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.430> level<00:03:39.730> of<00:03:39.940> three<00:03:40.209> hounds<00:03:40.540> do

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
points to the level of three hounds do

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.960 
points to the level of three hounds do
so<00:03:41.620> you<00:03:41.680> can<00:03:41.890> see<00:03:42.130> he's<00:03:42.280> coming<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:42.760> through

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
so you can see he's coming in through

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.670 
so you can see he's coming in through
the<00:03:43.120> north<00:03:43.330> here<00:03:43.630> his<00:03:43.990> hounds<00:03:44.320> are<00:03:44.440> still

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
the north here his hounds are still

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.040 
the north here his hounds are still
alive<00:03:44.980> as<00:03:45.310> they<00:03:45.490> migrate<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.330> southern

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
alive as they migrate to the southern

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.930 
alive as they migrate to the southern
side<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.530> base<00:03:47.800> they're<00:03:48.370> distracting

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
side of the base they're distracting

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.360 
side of the base they're distracting
more<00:03:49.120> defenses<00:03:49.720> more<00:03:49.990> air<00:03:50.200> defenses<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:50.950> you

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
more defenses more air defenses and you

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.540 
more defenses more air defenses and you
can<00:03:51.520> see<00:03:51.730> he<00:03:51.910> has<00:03:52.150> one<00:03:52.870> rage<00:03:53.800> spell<00:03:54.130> in<00:03:54.280> one

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
can see he has one rage spell in one

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.060 
can see he has one rage spell in one
heal<00:03:55.209> spell<00:03:55.720> this<00:03:55.930> is<00:03:56.080> another<00:03:56.410> example<00:03:56.650> of

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
heal spell this is another example of

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.070 
heal spell this is another example of
bringing<00:03:57.459> different<00:03:57.910> spells<00:03:58.510> into<00:03:58.840> the

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
bringing different spells into the

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.960 
bringing different spells into the
battle<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.830> can<00:04:00.010> see<00:04:00.250> here<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.730> killer

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
battle you can see here the killer

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.900 
battle you can see here the killer
obviously<00:04:01.240> also<00:04:01.840> doesn't<00:04:02.230> have<00:04:02.380> max<00:04:02.740> level<00:04:03.550> he

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
obviously also doesn't have max level he

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.220 
obviously also doesn't have max level he
arranged<00:04:04.300> but<00:04:04.540> it's<00:04:04.690> not<00:04:04.810> gonna<00:04:04.959> matter

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
arranged but it's not gonna matter

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.780 
arranged but it's not gonna matter
because<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.560> was<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.709> perfectly<00:04:06.130> executed

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
because it was a perfectly executed

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.780 
because it was a perfectly executed
attack<00:04:07.209> so<00:04:08.140> now<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.860> there's<00:04:09.070> puppies<00:04:09.250> alive

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860
