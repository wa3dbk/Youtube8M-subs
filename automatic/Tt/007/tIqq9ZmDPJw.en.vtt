00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.810
 Hello, I am for a kitten today 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.120
 Today 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.250
 ten 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.680
 today for today we will look at one of the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.840
 the most important approaches are wax worms then 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.090
 there is this is an abrasive yes there is 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.980
 many different technologies one of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.770
 technologies are we doing sandy 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.010
 pillow since we have here now yes then 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.500
 eat so that the worm can 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.309
 swallow the sand of course you need and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.899
 the most important thing is to mix all the ingredients 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.480
 the most important thing is of course sand to 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.399
 either the chest was directly in the pile 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.000
 here as here in the previous videos i 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.039
 laid out like this hog food at home I 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.829
 layering layer after layer then evenly 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.929
 all feel but good 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.059
 It is Khanty-Mansiysk that here 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.999
 very expensive labor and need 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.760
 find ways out sand worms 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:08.820
 necessarily need it is needed in order 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.390
 so that food does not stagnate in it 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.350
 inside the digestive tract and to 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 sand in the form of an abrasive clears all the mucus 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.500
 from the esophagus yes that is it is very important and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.100
 you went on this way but not from below 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 us sand under a heap yes under a heap of manure 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.820
 and above we take the ordinary river 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.130
 sand and this is all our pile 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.440
 you just need to powder 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.200
 i.e 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.540
 the task is just every chip anyway 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.230
 climbs to the surface he doesn't care 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.620
 climbs out 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:49.190
 and he will swallow sand fees necessarily 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.880
 need as much as here is how kuryan is given 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:57.650
 calcium supplements up in trouble 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:00.770
 some kind of limestone alba or stones yes 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.870
 so they captured that ponape helped 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.000
 digestion also 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.700
 and also from what I am not that is 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.650
 easy way if you have dear 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.200
 dear people or expensive equipment 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.120
 dumping food is desirable to do on 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.630
 concrete base but from next year 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.850
 we have already made concrete vylazhivaem feed and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.240
 on top of the drug it is desirable to them sand 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.680
 there should be large river coarse sand 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.690
 there is what it is but it is desirable that he 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.120
 He was a large, and that it would not have 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.310
 weed well there is this so that it is not sod 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.930
 there was some top along with spirea yes and 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.180
 then the worms go natural 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.900
 mucous membrane cleansing 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.550
 inside the esophagus and they actively live in 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.350
 Nothing annoys them, that is, they 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.840
 multiply feed fast 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.060
 get better and well and all they have is very 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.480
 all life processes happen quickly 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.580
 must be without a fight we must always we 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.070
 must repeat nature in nature 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.960
 dangerous worms live there grass her 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.270
 in planting those I also foliage which 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.340
 lying on the ground or it's even near 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.080
 firms there old some sort of dung 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.030
 which lies on the ground that is always 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.720
 there is access to the ground there is always access 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.920
 to the sand 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.010
 there is always access to this abrasive 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.930
 which will clean his esophagus and very 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.480
 it's important never to invent any 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.270
 bike we always do only in 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.130
 repetition of nature and all if you even 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.850
 want to achieve a good result 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.990
 always repeat only nature 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.260
 nature will tell 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.810
 no need to invent anything and this 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.580
 situations I once again focus on 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.680
 that we always get out of that situation 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.500
 which was formed precisely our region 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.290
 why lead worms why all these 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.660
 true technology they are not all the same 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.340
 for all that is we must always 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.440
 adapt to certain 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.450
 circumstances circumstances 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.900
 climatic conditions circumstances there 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.300
 lack of or excess water possible 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.880
 soil mixing if there is no equipment 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.400
 technology has no concrete base 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.230
 a concrete foundation that is the task of this 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.350
 video show is not easy to pour 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.420
 sand show what everyone is 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.090
 must think 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:33.350
 each person adapting to their 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.020
 conditions must find that way out 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.050
 which is especially rational in its place 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.680
 residence probably on this topic 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.510
 all exhausted for today 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.990
 our fate is to the health and happiness 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.990
 dating
