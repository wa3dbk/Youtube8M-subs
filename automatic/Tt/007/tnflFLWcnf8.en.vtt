00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
I was not every bit about how we develop

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.330 
I was not every bit about how we develop
the<00:00:53.789> game<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.329> especially<00:00:54.870> how<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:55.890> did<00:00:56.219> all

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
the game and especially how we did all

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.340 
the game and especially how we did all
of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> combat<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.199> has<00:00:58.320> been

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
of the combat as you know there has been

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.160 
of the combat as you know there has been
a<00:00:58.530> lot<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.680> talks<00:00:59.039> about<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.640> top<00:01:00.149> rider<00:01:00.510> which

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
a lot of talks about the top rider which

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.549 
a lot of talks about the top rider which
are<00:01:01.590> they<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.629> also

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
are they do from are they to be and also

are they do from are they to be and also
a<00:01:04.830> bit<00:01:05.189> harder<00:01:05.790> than<00:01:06.060> how<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.750> deal<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.020> this

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
a bit harder than how we deal with this

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.899 
a bit harder than how we deal with this
so<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.299> our<00:01:09.720> combat<00:01:10.590> simulator

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
so here you can see our combat simulator

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.179 
so here you can see our combat simulator
it<00:01:11.909> basically<00:01:12.659> closed<00:01:12.960> random<00:01:13.530> set<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.770> troops

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
it basically closed random set of troops

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.940 
it basically closed random set of troops
and<00:01:14.670> attacks<00:01:15.210> against<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.960> test<00:01:16.530> release

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and attacks against this test release

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.460 
and attacks against this test release
and<00:01:17.280> we<00:01:17.700> measure<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.390> kind<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> statistics

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and we measure all kind of statistics

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.039 
and we measure all kind of statistics
basically<00:01:19.970> simulation<00:01:20.970> about<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> truth<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
basically simulation about the truth and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.800 
basically simulation about the truth and
top<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.729> course<00:01:24.060> listen<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.689> your

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
top of this we of course listen to your

top of this we of course listen to your
feedback<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.580> also<00:01:26.580> measure<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.299> statistics

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
feedback and also measure the statistics

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
feedback and also measure the statistics
from<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> white<00:01:28.680> environment<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.670> exo

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
from the white environment from exo

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.260 
from the white environment from exo
players<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.979> based<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.220> all<00:01:32.579> these<00:01:32.759> facts

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
players and based on all these facts

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.319 
players and based on all these facts
with<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.990> decided<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.979> need<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> make<00:01:36.060> some

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
with that decided we need to make some

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.289 
with that decided we need to make some
food<00:01:36.570> stronger<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.770> some<00:01:38.040> talk<00:01:38.340> later<00:01:38.700> so

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
food stronger or some talk later so

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.569
