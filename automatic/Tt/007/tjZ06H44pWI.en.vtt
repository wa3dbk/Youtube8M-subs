00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.520
 this one we are gathered today I want to introduce my very last 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.460
 creation in Paris must therefore it is Africa 90 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:12.739
 so chicks 1 last video of the year 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.899
 douala 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:18.070
 a little fugue 360 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.849
 to begin 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.849
 so maybe this is the last video gran torino 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.579
 I will introduce you 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.619
 because I intend to reconvert myself to 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.300
 owners of the video game 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.669
 we follow will not be so far 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.070
 two offers just another thing 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
 it's because I discovered the 75 th of a very good child 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.850
 kuol messi 10th 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.460
 plus it would be a good idea 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.570
 here is every individual hostess who I like 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.570
 so she on different games 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.390
 so I put you on call 90 so for the better 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.830
 here we are happy of chargers 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.410
 something similar 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.140
 jean-louis borloo 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.420
 patrick morel 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.840
 and this is a student of the same class 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.730
 see classic 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.730
 I'm not breaking everything 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.300
 his ex-wife Cecilia 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.960
 so hardly 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.410
 then categorically 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.170
 as she leaves it r 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.650
 for him on the first day 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.650
 by leading to the honor a compress 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.700
 8 the calculation of the diet we will put it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.220
 for pilots 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.560
 then m 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.590
 like me 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.560
 of his supporters reserves in case they are 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 so they are our laurels 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.130
 for the place by water that's like sisyphus 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.130
 brandishing the banner 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.310
 then after the laser sight gradually on the graph 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.160
 the magic orlando 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
 therefore accessible 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.290
 q in place 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.019
 so holographic viewfinder 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.169
 some signs 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.009
 marie-pierre to load tears it's sad 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.309
 it's a weapon for right-handed and left-handed linke trader they're like 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:26.849
 it 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.849
 the rightful the nation 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.739
 that's what we can change on both sides 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.169
 side there 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:38.989
 Why 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.189
 it is on that side 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.269
 so and it's an auction really so for her to stay we're not going but it's 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.889
 in back 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.889
 then we'll take some bricks so for a brick 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:53.709
 like this one road 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.589
 she wants to be in which 9% 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.389
 like this one 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.399
 so she's present you to prepare several targets 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.469
 so many just ahead 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.909
 but we can everyone 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.609
 so I refined the white because I pulled by the left of glasses 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.819
 firefighter 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.959
 the design office a half hour 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.289
 so m 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.289
 we will start with the green a clamor is gone 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.889
 seen the clichÃ©s of the cmu 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.929
 historic photo 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:39.929
 I know a little branch 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.029
 if it is whitened 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.719
 see more clearly 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.689
 so reload it 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.689
 I want to show 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.319
 for this charity match 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.889
 last Sunday in Lille 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.909
 I have to get to the video anyway 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.909
 it would be good 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.209
 when we pick up the same 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:14.259
 why say that gillian 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.879
 braid one last time the scrum 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.049
 he is still twice 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.650
 we will say that I 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.900
 % due to 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.449
 it was wonderful 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.719
 and I hope the slight fee of diedhiou
