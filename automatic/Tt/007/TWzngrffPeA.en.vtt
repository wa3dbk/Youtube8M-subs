00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.830
 Good day left the doctor walking away 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:10.430
 example the sugar 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.830
 it becomes cholesterol 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:17.100
 the sugar that you consume all the 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.820
 days it becomes saturated fat 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.030
 bad fat that clogs the arteries that 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 produces cardiovascular diseases 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.640
 which sugar the bread the donut the chicken 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.320
 Pasta 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.320
 the white bread the angel 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.050
 in vehicle the toast the cookies two 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:46.170
 artinata cookies everything that is flour 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:51.340
 refined refined sugar to be able to give 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.650
 although it becomes saturated fat and 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 cholesterol because 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.870
 remember that fat 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.870
 bad 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.110
 that we consume from 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.060
 sugar 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.060
 from sugar 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.250
 not only do we consume fat starting 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:24.940
 of animal meat or fried meat 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.950
 fried foods we also consume 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.100
 cholesterol from sugar that you 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.229
 consume you are a consuming person 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.120
 of many flours and many sugars 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.900
 refined gas 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.390
 all those sugars that are used in 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.760
 the juices all the juices that you 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.350
 they buy here they are full of sugar the 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:52.260
 the gas chordal the mouths orange 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.450
 pony malt all that contains sugar that 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.250
 it becomes fat in cholesterol 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.250
 in saturated fat 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.430
 remember that to produce energy 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.880
 cell with sugar glucose 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.880
 Y 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.350
 an intermediary glass is the production 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.930
 acetic acid vinegar 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.100
 remember that vinegar is very toxic 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.920
 for the body but it's the pillar of 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.510
 construction of cholesterol vinegar 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.430
 can not be accumulated in the room 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.950
 then the body quickly what 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.569
 it turns into cholesterol you can not 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.620
 accumulate 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.170
 in the body prefers to become acid 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.650
 acetic that lineage quickly the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.020
 cholesterol does not leave it accumulated there 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.870
 because it is very toxic 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:54.819
 then remember the fat 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:58.260
 you consume from sugar 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:02.700
 refined from refined flour 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.370
 it's the same bad fat is the same fat 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.620
 that you consume when you consume 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.430
 animal protein that is the one 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.349
 contains animal fat which is 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.440
 cholesterol that intervenes in the 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:21.870
 cardiovascular diseases 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.870
 the sugar turns into cholesterol 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.299
 the excess sugar becomes 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:31.620
 fat that is known but the fat is not 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.480
 turns into sugar 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.360
 it appears that the brain working 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.140
 glucose working on sugar you do not 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.540
 can give the brain 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.510
 energy from fat because the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.540
 fat sugar becomes the 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.230
 sugar becomes fat but the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.850
 fat does not become sugar that's why 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.120
 is that it is the only way to give 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.700
 energy to our brain is consuming 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.240
 fruits because the brain works with 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.400
 things like glutamic acid with vitamins 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.520
 with minerals then the only 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.670
 way to energize the brain is to 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.239
 starting from fruits from the 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.770
 glucose of fructose sugar 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.919
 we are going to tell you about energy 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.040
 brain from fat the brain 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.680
 does not want energy from fat 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.660
 the brain wants energy from the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.590
 glucose but yes that is recommended 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.590
 eat fruits 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:35.489
 you have to give fruits to the body so that 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:38.129
 the brain has energy you can not 

00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:40.949
 give your brain energy from 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:43.180
 the fat then if you do not consume 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.729
 fruits 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.470
 is that where 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.120
 where the energy comes from 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.620
 if what you consume is only 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.660
 animal proteins 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.840
 because the brain needs energy but 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.180
 as you do not consume any fruit or 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.180
 be energy way of gunpowder so that 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.770
 for the brain uses energy you what 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.710
 that consumes vegetables animal proteins 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.660
 and remember that from fat does not 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.150
 energy is produced for the brain 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.310
 then when you do not consume fruits 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.860
 then what is going to happen the brain of 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.470
 where will you use the most energy 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.800
 used from the protein goes to 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.900
 convert protein into energy for 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.650
 this event 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.360
 to feed the brain tissue like this 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.380
 that's why you have to consume fruits 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.650
 dear readers, consume fruit the day 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.430
 without fruit is a day without sun 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.180
 Dr. Alejandro Sg recommends him 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.180
 a good day
