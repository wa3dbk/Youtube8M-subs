00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to have it dumped in serum when it's dry

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
to have it dumped in serum when it's dry
it's<00:01:08.250> much<00:01:08.460> more<00:01:08.640> smaller<00:01:08.969> I<00:01:09.119> will<00:01:09.359> show<00:01:09.630> you

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.859 
it's much more smaller I will show you
this<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.289> is<00:01:10.619> dry<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.399> and<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.570> dump

so you can definitely see the difference

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.950 
so you can definitely see the difference
and<00:01:15.560> it<00:01:16.560> will<00:01:16.770> enable<00:01:16.979> by<00:01:17.280> better<00:01:17.960> blending

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and it will enable by better blending

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.340 
and it will enable by better blending
and<00:01:19.340> better<00:01:20.340> finish<00:01:20.789> and<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.539> also<00:01:21.749> will<00:01:22.200> not

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and better finish and it also will not

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.529 
and better finish and it also will not
soak<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.039> much<00:01:23.249> product<00:01:23.609> as<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.090> dry<00:01:24.299> wood
