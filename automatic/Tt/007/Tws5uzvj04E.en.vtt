growing<00:00:11.759> really<00:00:11.910> nicely<00:00:12.030> we've<00:00:12.840> already

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
growing really nicely we've already

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.300 
growing really nicely we've already
picked<00:00:14.330> probably<00:00:15.330> ten<00:00:15.990> plus<00:00:16.260> quarts<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.920> snap

peas<00:00:17.550> from<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.910> thing<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.330> think<00:00:18.539> we're

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
peas from this thing and I think we're

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.040 
peas from this thing and I think we're
only<00:00:18.720> about<00:00:18.900> halfway<00:00:19.020> through<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.070> season

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050

harvesting<00:00:22.050> snap<00:00:22.289> peas<00:00:22.500> are<00:00:22.680> real<00:00:22.920> easy<00:00:23.130> it's

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
harvesting snap peas are real easy it's

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.640 
harvesting snap peas are real easy it's
kind<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.730> fun<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.720> kind<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.050> look

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
kind of fun you just kind of look

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.570 
kind of fun you just kind of look
through<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.070> really<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> look

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
through and you really have to look

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.140 
through and you really have to look
because<00:00:26.730> they<00:00:26.880> blend<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:28.760> you<00:00:29.760> don't<00:00:29.880> want<00:00:29.970> to

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
because they blend in you don't want to

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.100 
because they blend in you don't want to
get<00:00:30.269> them<00:00:30.480> when<00:00:30.630> they're<00:00:30.660> too<00:00:30.960> big<00:00:31.230> because

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
get them when they're too big because

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.630 
get them when they're too big because
they<00:00:34.110> lose<00:00:34.620> some<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.860> their<00:00:35.010> sweetness<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
they lose some of their sweetness and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.400 
they lose some of their sweetness and
tenderness<00:00:35.880> when<00:00:36.180> they<00:00:36.270> get<00:00:36.390> big<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.290> see

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
tenderness when they get big you can see

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.310 
tenderness when they get big you can see
this<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.570> is<00:00:39.570> actually<00:00:39.840> probably<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
this one here is actually probably a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.100 
this one here is actually probably a
little<00:00:40.440> too<00:00:40.649> big<00:00:41.120> but<00:00:42.120> it'll<00:00:42.360> still<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.840> fine

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
little too big but it'll still be fine

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.750 
little too big but it'll still be fine
it's<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.340> cook<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> little

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it's just I have to cook it a little

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.410 
it's just I have to cook it a little
longer<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.430> looks<00:00:47.610> maybe<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.329> little

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
longer and this one looks maybe a little

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
longer and this one looks maybe a little
small<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
small but it's actually this is a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.880 
small but it's actually this is a
perfect<00:00:51.059> size<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.890> really<00:00:52.890> tender<00:00:53.309> snap<00:00:53.760> peas

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
perfect size for really tender snap peas

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.060 
perfect size for really tender snap peas
a<00:00:56.210> lot<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> fun<00:00:57.510> if<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.750> young<00:00:58.710> kids<00:00:58.980> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
a lot of fun if you have young kids that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.200 
a lot of fun if you have young kids that
come<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.789> pick<00:01:00.329> snap<00:01:00.600> peas<00:01:01.940> but<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> can

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
come out and pick snap peas but you can

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.609

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
see we've got a ton of snap peas on here

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.340 
see we've got a ton of snap peas on here
and<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.890> said<00:01:07.950> most<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.549> these<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:09.350> what's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and like I said most of these are what's

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.330 
and like I said most of these are what's
these<00:01:10.530> weren't<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:11.159> week<00:01:11.790> ago<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.659> is

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
these weren't here a week ago this is

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.679 
these weren't here a week ago this is
the<00:01:14.340> kind<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> fun<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.180> snap<00:01:15.360> peas<00:01:15.570> is

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the kind of the fun with snap peas is

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.090 
the kind of the fun with snap peas is
once<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:16.049> start<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.560> really<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.009> come

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
once they start you really have to come

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.999 
once they start you really have to come
out<00:01:17.250> every<00:01:17.520> single<00:01:17.700> day<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.890> harvest<00:01:19.890> them

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
you can see this one actually I don't

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.450 
you can see this one actually I don't
know<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.380> tell<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.560> started<00:01:26.340> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
know if you can tell this one started to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.109 
know if you can tell this one started to
form<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.470> peas<00:01:28.680> inside<00:01:29.070> which<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.610> kind<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
form the peas inside which you kind of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.310 
form the peas inside which you kind of
don't<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.600> I'd<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.930> pick<00:01:31.200> them

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
don't want that I'd like to pick them

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.420 
don't want that I'd like to pick them
before<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.979> just<00:01:34.979> want<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
before then so I just want to kind of

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.569 
before then so I just want to kind of
make<00:01:35.579> sure<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.850> come<00:01:36.030> out<00:01:36.150> every<00:01:36.540> day<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
make sure you come out every day and and

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.830 
make sure you come out every day and and
pick<00:01:38.579> them<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:39.150> where<00:01:39.299> right<00:01:39.600> when<00:01:39.720> they're

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
pick them just where right when they're

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.190 
pick them just where right when they're
about<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.140> size

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
about this size

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.010 
about this size
so<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.260> came<00:01:43.440> across<00:01:43.530> these<00:01:44.240> these<00:01:45.240> two<00:01:45.750> snap

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
so it came across these these two snap

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.830 
so it came across these these two snap
peas<00:01:46.230> that<00:01:46.350> are<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.740> big<00:01:46.950> they're<00:01:47.460> about

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
peas that are really big they're about

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.860 
peas that are really big they're about
almost<00:01:48.840> twice<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.140> wide<00:01:49.410> and<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:50.940> whole<00:01:51.660> inch

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
almost twice as wide and a whole inch

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.330 
almost twice as wide and a whole inch
longer<00:01:52.170> than<00:01:52.380> most<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> snap<00:01:52.979> peas<00:01:53.160> we

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
longer than most of the snap peas we

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.719 
longer than most of the snap peas we
found<00:01:53.990> typically<00:01:55.100> when<00:01:56.100> they're<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.400> large

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
found typically when they're this large

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.700 
found typically when they're this large
they<00:01:56.970> start<00:01:57.240> forming<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.050> peas<00:01:58.320> at<00:01:58.590> this

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
they start forming the the peas at this

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.680 
they start forming the the peas at this
point<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.250> these<00:01:59.760> still<00:02:00.210> kind<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.510> look<00:02:00.660> like

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
point but these still kind of look like

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.800 
point but these still kind of look like
they're<00:02:01.729> they're<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.760> good<00:02:02.970> shape<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.390> eat<00:02:03.510> but
