00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.219 
if this so this one's a little bit more
difficult<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> cover<00:02:06.000> because<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.630> can't

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
difficult to cover because I can't

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.589 
difficult to cover because I can't
really<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:07.590> what<00:02:07.710> I'm<00:02:07.770> doing<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.069> long<00:02:08.599> so

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
really see what I'm doing that long so

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.119 
really see what I'm doing that long so
yeah<00:02:09.929> make<00:02:10.349> sure<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:10.619> you're<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:10.950> you're

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
yeah make sure as you're going you're

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.470 
yeah make sure as you're going you're
blending<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.580> edges<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.150> way<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.330> don't

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
blending the edges so that way you don't

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.100 
blending the edges so that way you don't
have<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.660> lot

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
have a lot

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.790 
have a lot
of<00:02:13.200> harsh<00:02:14.190> lines<00:02:14.810> okay<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:16.440> now<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.770> have

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
of harsh lines okay so now that you have

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.380 
of harsh lines okay so now that you have
it<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.070> this<00:02:17.280> you're<00:02:17.760> gonna<00:02:17.820> let<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.090> dry<00:02:18.360> for

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
it like this you're gonna let it dry for

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.300 
it like this you're gonna let it dry for
about<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.050> minute<00:02:19.260> or<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.650> then<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.190> go

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
about a minute or so and then you can go

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.730 
about a minute or so and then you can go
on<00:02:20.460> with<00:02:20.490> another<00:02:20.970> layer<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.230> let's<00:02:22.260> let<00:02:22.620> that

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
on with another layer so let's let that

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.830 
on with another layer so let's let that
dry<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.820> not<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.090> it's<00:02:24.270> pretty<00:02:24.450> much<00:02:24.540> draw

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
dry so not that it's pretty much draw

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.910 
dry so not that it's pretty much draw
what<00:02:24.990> you're<00:02:25.080> gonna<00:02:25.200> do<00:02:25.320> is<00:02:25.440> go<00:02:25.620> in<00:02:25.770> with

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
what you're gonna do is go in with

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.970 
what you're gonna do is go in with
another<00:02:26.010> layer<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:27.200> then<00:02:28.200> let<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.620> dry<00:02:28.950> for

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
another layer and then let that dry for

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.350 
another layer and then let that dry for
a<00:02:29.100> minute<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.430> then<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.910> start<00:02:30.210> a

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
a minute and then you can start a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.900 
a minute and then you can start a
building<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:30.840> from<00:02:31.020> there<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.410> again<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.730> same

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
building up from there so again the same

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.890

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
my fingers well I did find that I have a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.430 
my fingers well I did find that I have a
little<00:03:07.290> bit<00:03:07.380> more<00:03:07.500> control<00:03:08.750> not<00:03:09.750> too<00:03:09.959> much

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
little bit more control not too much

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:25.230 
little bit more control not too much
first<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.160> then<00:03:11.280> also<00:03:11.989> tap<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.230> on

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.920 

so<00:03:26.240> I<00:03:26.270> did<00:03:27.110> not<00:03:27.230> recording<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.010> forgot<00:03:28.490> to

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
so I did not recording and forgot to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.970 
so I did not recording and forgot to
record<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.290> thought<00:03:30.410> it's<00:03:30.560> recording<00:03:30.860> but<00:03:30.950> it

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
record I thought it's recording but it

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.860 
record I thought it's recording but it
wasn't<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.790> just<00:03:32.090> used<00:03:32.270> my<00:03:32.360> Coastal<00:03:32.840> Scents

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.480 
palette and I just went in with a
lighter<00:03:36.430> color<00:03:37.430> than<00:03:37.730> my<00:03:38.830> skin<00:03:39.830> and<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.160> see<00:03:40.370> it
