new<00:00:15.120> models<00:00:15.540> new<00:00:15.570> models<00:00:16.020> but<00:00:16.560> they<00:00:16.710> would

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
new models new models but they would

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.140 
new models new models but they would
have<00:00:16.980> only<00:00:17.130> been<00:00:17.250> able<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.640> have<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.850> dwarf

model<00:00:18.510> ready<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:19.080> release<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:21.029> pretty

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
model ready for release which one pretty

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.330 
model ready for release which one pretty
much<00:00:21.510> sounds<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> release<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.130> going<00:00:23.279> to

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
much sounds like the release is going to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.050 
much sounds like the release is going to
be<00:00:23.430> pretty<00:00:23.550> soon<00:00:23.930> but<00:00:24.930> two<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:26.060> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
be pretty soon but two is that that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.160 
be pretty soon but two is that that
model<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:27.750> saw<00:00:28.640> was<00:00:29.640> not<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.449> torn<00:00:30.750> model

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
model that we saw was not the torn model

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.860 
model that we saw was not the torn model
but<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.189> gives<00:00:32.520> us<00:00:32.790> hope<00:00:33.030> for<00:00:33.059> what<00:00:33.690> they're

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
but that gives us hope for what they're

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.410 
but that gives us hope for what they're
going<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.110> look<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:35.309> actually<00:00:35.760> was<00:00:36.000> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
going to look like what actually was is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.470 
going to look like what actually was is
if<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.840> remember<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.420> Tonka<00:00:39.420> from<00:00:40.079> North<00:00:40.320> red

if you remember the Tonka from North red

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.720 
if you remember the Tonka from North red
it's<00:00:42.480> like<00:00:42.980> another<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.340> those<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.640> know

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
ancestral races it's related them in

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.160 
ancestral races it's related them in
some<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.710> are<00:00:49.920> called<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.550> Yongle<00:00:51.210> y8

which is the northernmost oh where the
shado-pan<00:01:15.630> most<00:01:16.200> areas<00:01:16.350> will<00:01:16.619> snow<00:01:16.979> all<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
shado-pan most areas will snow all that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.510 
shado-pan most areas will snow all that
stuff<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.930> they're<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.229> actually<00:01:19.560> native<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
stuff and they're not actually native to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.429 
stuff and they're not actually native to
that<00:01:20.670> area<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.200> picture

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that area if you see that picture

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.789 
that area if you see that picture
originally<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.090> these<00:01:24.299> like

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
originally there like so these like

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.249 
originally there like so these like
borean<00:01:25.799> tundra<00:01:25.830> looking<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.990> foothills<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
borean tundra looking like foothills and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289 
borean tundra looking like foothills and
that's<00:01:29.100> actually<00:01:29.280> like<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> foothills<00:01:30.210> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that's actually like the foothills of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
that's actually like the foothills of
the<00:01:30.360> snow<00:01:30.659> zone<00:01:30.900> like<00:01:31.049> they're<00:01:31.549> encroaching

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the snow zone like they're encroaching

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.050 
the snow zone like they're encroaching
on<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.090> area<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.130> these<00:01:35.130> mongrels<00:01:35.400> well

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
on that area and these mongrels well

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.520 
on that area and these mongrels well
these<00:01:36.780> young<00:01:37.110> goals<00:01:37.380> were<00:01:38.540> originally<00:01:39.540> push

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
these young goals were originally push

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.039 
these young goals were originally push
out<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.040> their<00:01:41.189> homeland<00:01:41.670> bite<00:01:42.479> while<00:01:42.750> their

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
out of their homeland bite while their

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.789 
out of their homeland bite while their
native<00:01:43.740> area<00:01:44.250> by<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.000> Mantid<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.530> while

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
native area by the Mantid so while

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
native area by the Mantid so while
they're<00:01:46.979> being<00:01:47.220> pushed<00:01:47.610> into<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.180> Coon<00:01:48.990> line

they're being pushed into the Coon line

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.830 
they're being pushed into the Coon line
some<00:01:49.500> area<00:01:49.950> they<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.360> deal<00:01:51.600> with

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
some area they have to deal with

get along a lot of the Reese's get along
pretty<00:02:15.159> well<00:02:15.329> but<00:02:16.329> there<00:02:17.110> once<00:02:17.439> again<00:02:17.650> the

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
pretty well but there once again the

whole sha and negative energy is

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.009 
whole sha and negative energy is

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
creating problems here because like this

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.600 
creating problems here because like this
is<00:02:23.079> breaking<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.709> balance<00:02:24.189> of<00:02:24.250> what's<00:02:24.459> going
