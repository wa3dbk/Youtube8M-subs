 to come in every day to get up and 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.949
 good to go thinking what I'm going to do 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.380

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.950
 farewell in valencia came from Beijing 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.330
 and they were here for the first four days and 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.010
 they were waiting all day since 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.900
 appear they are the truth is that you 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.590
 they happen a lot and they are very passionate 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.590
 think 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.819
 He even went up to the room to 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.260
 that to see me I was doing a 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.090
 massage and it did not become a little crazy luca 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.980
 6 because he called the room in the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.100
 door knocked on the door but no 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.530
 I understand how he acquired it 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.530
 the physio me the physio of the massages 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.850
 and health and he came back for this massage 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.870
 that was the least a 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.870
 little dress with the towel 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.580
 good is that they are like very shameful 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.490
 also if they crouched their heads do not you 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.400
 they say nothing and how they do not speak English 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.180
 then you do not understand with them but 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.180
 preferences 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.040
 azkoyen 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.530
 but it was not the only time I've seen 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.310
 the times and after that 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.810
 in more normal situations is to say the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.000
 soup of china in follow you will like released 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.200
 because they are very good 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.680
 They expose some condiments very 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.180
 interesting for example not at once I 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.940
 I was eating a very good soup 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.170
 chicken and in the end I found some 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.170
 worms the size of volleyball 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.170
 but 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.510
 I think it is very very bad 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.010

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.780

 they have simply supported me and understand 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.960
 the decision to make a decision 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.020
 difficult that comes maturing from a 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.910
 long ago and well they understand it 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.730
 because they are also many years together and 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.530
