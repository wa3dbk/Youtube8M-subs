00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.209
 my name is caiabu, garden, I'm a doctor 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.170
 child psychiatrist 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.450
 the autism specialist invited by 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.790
 part a strange case of the dog by 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.529
 for a debate after the play the brain of 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.080
 patient with autism he is the brain an 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.070
 little different from our brain more 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.550
 precipitate 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.160
 It works more or less, that 's how it is 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.410
 if we our brain and it makes a 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.730
 each time 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.739
 so every time we make a 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.430
 activity people turn off our activity 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.809
 previous 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.239
 even when we 're doing two 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.500
 activities at the same time, people in the 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.320
 reality is doing one at a time 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.180
 very quickly the patient with autism do not 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.070
 because he connects a precipitate brain 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.000
 an activity without shutting down the activity 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.110
 previous 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.350
 throughout the day he is sometimes 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.989
 making 100 200 300 thousand activities 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.239
 same time in that brain and that he 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.030
 Since when he was born the brain 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.890
 We are so then we try it 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.269
 make them work with brain 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.030
 similar to our 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.890
 only if they try to function from the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.850
 same way that we say it 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.970
 body 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.590
 and then they go into crisis then 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.750
 small they will organize themselves and they will 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.799
 creating a method to organize 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.289
 you have a pattern of behavior 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.020
 repetitive in reality this is a 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.740
 brain trying to organize itself 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.409
 It's then the way he always comes back 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.810
 by the same stadium makes them 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.939
 and continue to function 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.539
 in that sea of ​​stimuli that 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.310
 they have 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.770
 so they have to follow a straight line 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.979
 within this sea of stimuli when 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.840
 when I put a lock on this one 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.939
 repetitive behavior I ask that he 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.560
 stop doing that or put a 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.020
 ritual a routine or even a 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.670
 stereotypy he falls again in this sea 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.670
 of stimuli and it is disorganized 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.829
 completely immature brain it 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.710
 it is more sensory and more motor 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.719
 so we will have a predominance of 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.509
 repetitive motor behaviors that 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.909
 are the stories of sinks and sensory 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:12.140
 are the hypersensitivity estate 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.910
 olfactory taste is visual and 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.380
 hearing and then as it goes 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.000
 maturing these standards of 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.580
 repetitive behavior they will 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.980
 switching to repetitive behaviors 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.470
 that we call the higher order that 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.860
 are more mature behaviors then it is 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:33.500
 are based on rituals 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:36.110
 it is routine and it is compulsions and when 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.260
 It becomes a repetitive behavior 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.200
 standard and exemplary that we will have there 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.760
 the skills is when we have a 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.710
 thing that we call insistence on the 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.850
 same agency that is when the patient 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.770
 begins to study differentiated themes 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.620
 so he knows all about astronomy 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.850
 knows everything about animals knows everything 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.560
 about the dinosaurs 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.510
 so see you have the same 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.600
 behavior that is a typical story 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.840
 and the high interest in astronomy is the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.220
 same way of working that celebrated 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.560
 believed 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.000
 only with different cognitive patterns 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.610
 It's from the first day that people 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.380
 what we do during the day is born 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.150
 create neural networks that goes for 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.370
 we are all in and at night 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.830
 to memorize these neural networks 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.570
 the next day we reactive these 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.580
 neural networks adds the 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.480
 information from that day and stores it 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.630
 during the night 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.730
 we make it a lifetime're the 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.799
 patients with autism and they have networks 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.730
 preferably causing it to become 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.650
 to organize 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.080
 Yeah, I have to tie the new ones. 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.880
 information of the day to these networks 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.560
 neurons of interest 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.080
 so if a patient is super there 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.910
 interested in animals in drawing and 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.330
 I want him to be interested in other 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.150
 things I can through the bugs and 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.360
 giving knowledge about other areas 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:00.709
 So I want him to learn about 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:03.709
 It's the sky so I'm going to tell you that that bug 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.290
 is playing a sunny place that has 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.780
 clouds that have sun and then suddenly I am 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.489
 talking about the sky and I left the bugs of 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.450
 side but I'm using the same networks 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.760
 neuronal 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.920
 so we have to use the behavior 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.419
 repetitive in our favor and do 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.640
 that it widens the spectrum of 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.190
 knowledge about these 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.810
 knowledge and situations 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.890
 the importance of ensuring that the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:31.270
 people see the autistic as it is and 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.729
 try to make him a typical person 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:38.900
 understood that if we can give 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.980
 for them one the world they need 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.320
 they will develop super good 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.080
 father games of an autistic boy who 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.690
 this time if more advanced searches 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.980
 indicate any difference between girls 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.530
 and 28 daughter playing and yes that the same 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.090
 researches more days already showed a 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.780
 very big difference 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.950
 girls with autism are they tend to 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.010
 have a slightly different pattern 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.630
 I studied the pictures of the girls 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.660
 are more serious in theory 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.590
 But in practice I can see this 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.190
 difference 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.020
 I have a patient from São Paulo who 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.060
 just finished his master's degree in law 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.430
 she has several difficulties facing 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.470
 difficulties of life but managed to 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.660
 finish for your development 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.610
 I can not analyze much because 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.360
 if you work the difficulties of that 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:37.260
 I dislike it in the high and and the best 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.180
 understood in contract 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.610
 the difficulty that the individual has 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.310
 this much to improve but delay 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.810
 we do not do individual analysis 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.230
 we can not do a reading 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.230
 proper
