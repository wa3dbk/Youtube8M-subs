skin Scout pods that are scattered about

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.950 
skin Scout pods that are scattered about
this<00:00:40.020> junk<00:00:40.649> portion<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.309> area<00:00:41.960> they

this junk portion of the area they

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.630 
this junk portion of the area they
pretty<00:00:43.530> much<00:00:43.680> always<00:00:43.890> spawn<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> same

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
pretty much always spawn in the same

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.170 
pretty much always spawn in the same
spots<00:00:45.920> pretty<00:00:46.920> much<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.399> need<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.879> kind

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
spots pretty much you just need to kind

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.150 
spots pretty much you just need to kind
of<00:00:48.210> fly<00:00:48.420> around<00:00:48.450> using<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.260> radar<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:50.010> an

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
of fly around using your radar as an

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.220 
of fly around using your radar as an
indicator<00:00:50.520> whenever<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.510> starts<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> get

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
indicator whenever it starts to get

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.660 
indicator whenever it starts to get
scrambled<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.489> means

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
scrambled like this that just means

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.090 
scrambled like this that just means
you're<00:00:53.820> close<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.420> start<00:00:54.690> multi<00:00:55.649> targeting

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
you're close so start multi targeting

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.290 
you're close so start multi targeting
all<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> enemies<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> area<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
all the enemies in the area and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
all the enemies in the area and
eventually<00:00:57.719> you'll<00:00:57.870> find<00:00:58.140> it<00:01:00.020> they<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
eventually you'll find it they like to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.840 
eventually you'll find it they like to
hide<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.949> Hulk<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.489> definitely<00:01:03.270> try<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
hide in the Hulk so definitely try to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.000 
hide in the Hulk so definitely try to
fly<00:01:05.850> into<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.390> Hulk's<00:01:06.659> when<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.930> can<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
fly into the Hulk's when you can if you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.080 
fly into the Hulk's when you can if you
can't<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:08.460> them<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.790> automatically<00:01:11.090> other

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
can't see them on automatically other

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.670 
can't see them on automatically other
than<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.750> mission<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.320> simple

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
than that this mission is really simple

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.800 
than that this mission is really simple
you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:14.159> fight<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:14.850> ignore<00:01:15.210> all<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> battle

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you can fight or ignore all the battle

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.460 
you can fight or ignore all the battle
pods<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.350> would<00:01:16.619> recommend<00:01:18.170> ignoring<00:01:19.170> them<00:01:19.290> for

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
pods I would recommend ignoring them for

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.620 
pods I would recommend ignoring them for
the<00:01:19.530> most<00:01:19.710> part<00:01:20.009> unless<00:01:20.310> you're<00:01:20.729> doing<00:01:21.360> multi

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the most part unless you're doing multi

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.999 
the most part unless you're doing multi
targeting<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.170> trying<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.439> find<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> scalp

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
targeting and trying to find the scalp

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
targeting and trying to find the scalp
pod<00:01:23.659> and<00:01:25.880> other<00:01:26.880> than<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.869> good

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
pod and other than that this is a good

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.520 
pod and other than that this is a good
mission<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:29.189> getting<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.409> awards

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
mission for getting one of the awards

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.280 
mission for getting one of the awards
it's<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.009> marksman's<00:01:32.549> award<00:01:32.880> which<00:01:33.570> requires

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it's the marksman's award which requires

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.560 
it's the marksman's award which requires
you<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> kill<00:01:34.860> 50<00:01:35.369> male<00:01:36.299> power<00:01:36.570> armor<00:01:36.990> units

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
you to kill 50 male power armor units

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.350 
you to kill 50 male power armor units
why<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.140> mission<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.740> is

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
why this is a good mission for that is

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.969 
why this is a good mission for that is
actually<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.750> misspoke<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.590> kill<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
actually I misspoke it's not kill you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.490 
actually I misspoke it's not kill you
have<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> snipe<00:01:44.460> 50<00:01:45.420> male<00:01:45.570> power<00:01:45.780> armor<00:01:46.229> units

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
have to snipe 50 male power armor units

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.980 
have to snipe 50 male power armor units
which<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.460> which<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> important

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
which is the which is a important

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.920 
which is the which is a important
distinction<00:01:50.450> reason<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.720> good

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
distinction reason this is a good

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.039 
distinction reason this is a good
mission<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:53.689> they<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.930> an

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
mission for that is they have an

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.929 
mission for that is they have an
infinite<00:01:55.380> number<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.860> male<00:01:56.310> power<00:01:56.520> armor

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
infinite number of male power armor

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.270 
infinite number of male power armor
units<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.960> mission<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:59.009> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
units in this mission so it's a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.480 
units in this mission so it's a
one-stop-shop<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:01.040> getting<00:02:02.040> all<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> male

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
one-stop-shop for getting all the male

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.020 
one-stop-shop for getting all the male
power<00:02:02.759> armors<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.360> need<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.689> appear<00:02:05.030> in

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
power armors that you need to appear in

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.789 
power armors that you need to appear in
order<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.329> snipe<00:02:06.540> them<00:02:06.780> now<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> don't<00:02:07.380> really

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
order to snipe them now I don't really

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.029 
order to snipe them now I don't really
do<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.599> kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.289> take<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.560> second

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
do that in this I kind of take a second

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.850 
do that in this I kind of take a second
to<00:02:11.190> show<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.849> technique<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.540> don't<00:02:13.110> really

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
to show you the technique I don't really

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
to show you the technique I don't really
actually<00:02:14.160> execute<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.850> technique<00:02:15.270> I'll<00:02:15.720> do

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
actually execute that technique I'll do

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.810 
actually execute that technique I'll do
it<00:02:16.170> much<00:02:16.410> later<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.950> another<00:02:17.190> video<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.700> I'll

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
it much later in another video and I'll

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.420 
it much later in another video and I'll
point<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.150> out<00:02:18.240> there<00:02:18.950> but<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> reason<00:02:20.310> being

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
point it out there but the reason being

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.330 
point it out there but the reason being
is<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:22.620> mission<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.010> more<00:02:23.160> about

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
is that this mission is more about

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.160 
is that this mission is more about
finding<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> scalp<00:02:24.210> odd<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> wanted<00:02:25.080> to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
finding the scalp odd so I wanted to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.170 
finding the scalp odd so I wanted to
show<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:26.220> quickest<00:02:26.550> way<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.760> get<00:02:27.120> through

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
show you the quickest way to get through

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.960 
show you the quickest way to get through
that<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.840> not<00:02:28.200> dilly-dally<00:02:28.880> waiting<00:02:29.880> around

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
that and not dilly-dally waiting around

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.560 
that and not dilly-dally waiting around
fighting<00:02:30.510> MPAs<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:31.500> here's<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.860> first<00:02:32.040> NPA

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
fighting MPAs but here's the first NPA

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.000 
fighting MPAs but here's the first NPA
so<00:02:33.570> again<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.990> technique<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.740> kind<00:02:34.980> of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
so again the technique is just kind of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.530 
so again the technique is just kind of
flying<00:02:35.220> around<00:02:35.310> use<00:02:35.580> your<00:02:35.700> missiles<00:02:36.090> take<00:02:36.360> his

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
flying around use your missiles take his

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.040 
flying around use your missiles take his
health<00:02:36.840> down<00:02:37.080> way<00:02:37.410> low<00:02:38.330> with<00:02:39.330> your<00:02:39.480> cannon<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
health down way low with your cannon and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.190 
health down way low with your cannon and
missile<00:02:40.320> fire<00:02:41.270> even<00:02:42.270> lower<00:02:42.540> than<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.810> right

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
missile fire even lower than that right

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.790 
missile fire even lower than that right
about<00:02:43.350> there

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
about there

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.130 
about there
then<00:02:44.100> go<00:02:44.400> immediately<00:02:44.970> target<00:02:45.660> him<00:02:45.750> go<00:02:45.900> into

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
then go immediately target him go into

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.540 
then go immediately target him go into
sniper<00:02:46.350> mode<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.680> take<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.890> final<00:02:47.040> shot<00:02:47.190> now

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
sniper mode and take the final shot now

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.250 
sniper mode and take the final shot now
I<00:02:47.580> actually<00:02:47.910> missed<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.660> started<00:02:48.930> taking<00:02:49.050> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
I actually missed and I started taking a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.310 
I actually missed and I started taking a
beating<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.190> said<00:02:50.790> screw<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.200> is

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
beating so I said screw it but that is

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.890 
beating so I said screw it but that is
essentially<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.830> technique<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:54.510> nice<00:02:54.690> thing

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
essentially the technique the nice thing

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.360 
essentially the technique the nice thing
is<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.050> if<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.410> look<00:02:55.620> when<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:55.920> have<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
is that if you look when you have the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.970 
is that if you look when you have the
power<00:02:57.120> armor<00:02:57.300> unit<00:02:57.600> locked<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.739> hit<00:02:58.890> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
power armor unit locked and you hit the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.150 
power armor unit locked and you hit the
special<00:02:59.430> going<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.270> snipe<00:03:00.600> mode<00:03:01.560> he

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
special going to snipe mode he

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.280 
special going to snipe mode he
automatically

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
automatically

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.500 
automatically
targets<00:03:04.640> whatever<00:03:05.640> you've<00:03:05.790> got<00:03:05.820> targeted<00:03:06.420> he

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
targets whatever you've got targeted he

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.199 
targets whatever you've got targeted he
zooms<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.959> at<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.290> so<00:03:07.550> really<00:03:08.550> it's<00:03:08.790> just<00:03:08.850> three

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
zooms in at it so really it's just three

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.690 
zooms in at it so really it's just three
button<00:03:09.510> presses<00:03:09.930> it's<00:03:10.110> what<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.650> know<00:03:10.770> well<00:03:11.459> -

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
button presses it's what you know well -

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.550 
button presses it's what you know well -
you've<00:03:12.000> already<00:03:12.150> got<00:03:12.360> him<00:03:12.450> locked<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:12.989> he's

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
you've already got him locked so he's

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.949 
you've already got him locked so he's
already<00:03:13.709> locked<00:03:13.950> hit<00:03:14.850> triangle<00:03:15.360> hit<00:03:15.810> your

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
already locked hit triangle hit your

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.410 
already locked hit triangle hit your
fire<00:03:16.110> button<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.910> should<00:03:17.940> be<00:03:18.239> able<00:03:18.330> to

fire button and you should be able to
snipe<00:03:18.840> him<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.170> way<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.620> counts<00:03:19.920> you

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
snipe him that way and that counts you

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.190 
snipe him that way and that counts you
have<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.820> do<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.030> 50<00:03:21.450> times<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.930> get<00:03:22.049> the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
there's a couple other levels that you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.300 
there's a couple other levels that you
can<00:03:33.540> do<00:03:33.690> but<00:03:34.320> this<00:03:34.590> one<00:03:34.769> really<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.160> best

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
can do but this one really is the best

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.910 
can do but this one really is the best
sense<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.970> you'll<00:03:36.690> always<00:03:36.870> have<00:03:37.170> two<00:03:37.709> male

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
sense you you'll always have two male

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
screen so other than that just I would

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.729 
screen so other than that just I would
recommend<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:47.360> destroy<00:03:48.360> at<00:03:48.900> least

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
recommend that you destroy at least

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
seven of the Scout pods before you start

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.130 
seven of the Scout pods before you start
going<00:03:52.650> into<00:03:52.940> killing<00:03:53.940> male<00:03:54.239> power<00:03:54.480> armor<00:03:54.870> unit

going into killing male power armor unit

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.860 
going into killing male power armor unit
mode<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.590> way<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:56.640> can<00:03:56.850> if<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.510> happen<00:03:57.840> to
