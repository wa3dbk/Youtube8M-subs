00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.500
 Good evening, gentlemen, today I will give you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.759
 I will tell about some alterations on 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:15.150
 engine 1 1 liter chery qq6 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:17.640
 which allowed to remove quite tangible 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.720
 noise and engine when fully open 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.410
 throttle and when the engine rpm from 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 three to four thousand rpm rumble 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.250
 reminded the fare of the plane going to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.460
 take off means as you can see 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:41.940
 filter filter body I threw out 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.180
 it is the same as on engine 1 and 3 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.520
 no difference between engines 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.590
 casing no filters between motor on 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.629
 1 and 3 1 1 liters which is in principle very 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.480
 straining 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:03.090
 wears what was made bought 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.530
 filter body from the younger cuckoo because 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.390
 that he was flayed from Matiz 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.990
 that is, you can actually from Matiz 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.570
 but because it is cheaper to buy it 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.570
 in that the filter housing is present 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:28.880
 there is such a here 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.980
 Now the noise silencer 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:37.200
 of silencers do not have the native 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:42.230
 filters were generally cube were purchased 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.990
 pipes from Matiz pipe from Matiz 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:53.100
 Here on the pipe from Matiz, too, are 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:59.430
 mufflers once show mean here 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:04.950
 this one and below 2 the same tube was 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.850
 bought a pipe from the gas tank from the fields 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.840
 Well, take a piece here 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.820
 sewer polypropylene pipe 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:19.050
 50-ki clamps and it's all connected here 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.540
 here for suction of crankcase gases there 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.590
 tube fitting, too obscenely at less than 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.540
 was bought here is an adapter assembled together 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.040
 and so Makar 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.000
 all this is collected of course that's necessary 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.500
 secure but it's just temporary for now 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.989
 here as a result after the test 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.200
 no buzz 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:51.950
 there is no loss from an airplane going to take off 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:55.739
 there is no power either 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.810
 those who have such an engine 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.870
 redo it for this 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.570
 principle may then be me here this 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.650
 I will do even more 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.180
 let's see what effect will be but on 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.110
 this moment I'm fine 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:16.890
 It suits of course this is a cant Chinese 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:21.360
 there is absolutely no no that's not 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:24.540
 this and of course at the same time the filter housing 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.760
 Here same as from Matiz and filter, too, 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.239
 will fit but note here on on 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.900
 so if you buy a case on it these 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.540
 bolts than twist cap leave 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:44.519
 relatives because the purchase 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:45.239
 we are such bolts not only under 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.879
 screwdriver 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.549
 if suddenly rust and warmed up and 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.280
 agreed that all gamon not unscrew 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.680
 so it is better to leave relatives of course 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.049
 it would be better to take this building 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.019
 filter from Matiz but he could 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:05.180
 be not salt there you see here 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:09.060
 crooked damn well, I probably 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.599
 I think that this case is not natural 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.299
 the movie will go fine as you can see 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.310
 mounts everything sits still 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.889
 the only thing that he rests a little 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.120
 in the pipe 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:27.570
 here which goes to the top radiator 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.500
 chilled but it's not critical so all 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:36.419
 rises remarkably very advise not 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.970
 began to record the noise when you go auschwitz 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.210
 Elder had to be written earlier with 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:45.680
 old casing then new but those who 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:51.380
 have such an engine they know how it is 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.380
 can make noise like this
