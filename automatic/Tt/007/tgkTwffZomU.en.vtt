00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.479 

this<00:00:40.030> video<00:00:40.360> is<00:00:40.450> about<00:00:41.070> meta<00:00:42.070> little<00:00:42.309> phrase

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
this video is about meta little phrase

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.720 
this video is about meta little phrase
that<00:00:42.910> I've<00:00:43.000> seen<00:00:43.210> around<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.510> place<00:00:43.719> but<00:00:43.930> I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that I've seen around the place but I

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.439 
that I've seen around the place but I
started<00:00:45.730> again<00:00:45.910> recently<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:49.120> one<00:00:49.300> of<00:00:49.390> those

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
started again recently it's one of those

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.049 
started again recently it's one of those
little<00:00:49.989> quotes<00:00:50.379> I<00:00:50.769> guess<00:00:51.070> it's<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.430> one<00:00:51.969> of

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
little quotes I guess it's a one of

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.799 
little quotes I guess it's a one of
those<00:00:52.350> motorcycling<00:00:54.059> pearls<00:00:55.059> of<00:00:55.210> wisdom<00:00:55.269> that

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
those motorcycling pearls of wisdom that

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.450 
those motorcycling pearls of wisdom that
you<00:00:55.989> see<00:00:56.170> around<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.559> place<00:00:56.739> I<00:00:56.980> was<00:00:57.010> quite

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
you see around the place I was quite

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.460 
you see around the place I was quite
such<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:57.850> tribute<00:00:58.449> abul<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:58.780> an<00:00:59.019> ominous

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.450 

and<00:01:04.040> I<00:01:04.130> guess<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:04.460> Lisa<00:01:04.610> goes<00:01:05.890> there<00:01:06.890> are<00:01:07.070> old

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
and I guess that Lisa goes there are old

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.600 
and I guess that Lisa goes there are old
bikers<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:09.110> there<00:01:09.530> are<00:01:09.650> bold<00:01:09.860> bikers

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
bikers and there are bold bikers

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.480 
bikers and there are bold bikers
but<00:01:12.240> there<00:01:12.420> are<00:01:12.510> no<00:01:12.540> old<00:01:12.870> bold<00:01:13.320> bikers

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.180 

so<00:01:18.490> what<00:01:18.760> do<00:01:18.850> you<00:01:18.909> think<00:01:19.060> about<00:01:19.090> that

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.610 

I<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.630> first<00:01:24.780> time<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.080> saw<00:01:25.440> it<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
I think the first time I saw it I

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.050 
I think the first time I saw it I
thought<00:01:25.650> yeah<00:01:25.950> that's<00:01:26.130> cool<00:01:26.310> man<00:01:26.490> Black<00:01:27.030> is
