bit too sharp but here we go let's see

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.110 
bit too sharp but here we go let's see
if<00:04:08.139> I<00:04:08.200> could<00:04:08.260> beat<00:04:08.530> this<00:04:08.739> eighth<00:04:08.980> player<00:04:09.400> of

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
you quickly go back for a second I can

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.020 
you quickly go back for a second I can
actually<00:04:35.290> show<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.980> controls<00:04:36.490> so

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
actually show you the controls so

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.760 
actually show you the controls so
instead<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.389> steering<00:04:37.840> with<00:04:38.500> your

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
instead of steering with your

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.710 
instead of steering with your
accelerometer<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.669> can<00:04:39.820> also<00:04:39.940> touch<00:04:40.360> and

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
accelerometer you can also touch and

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.659 
accelerometer you can also touch and
drag<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:41.110> steer<00:04:41.440> which<00:04:41.889> is<00:04:42.010> an<00:04:42.130> alternative

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
drag to steer which is an alternative

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.810 
drag to steer which is an alternative
but<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:42.940> prefer<00:04:43.450> using<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:44.230> Excel

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
but I prefer using the Excel

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.310 
but I prefer using the Excel
accelerometer<00:04:45.820> this<00:04:46.360> year<00:04:46.570> i<00:04:46.660> found<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.050> is

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
accelerometer this year i found that is

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.930 
accelerometer this year i found that is
much<00:04:47.590> better<00:04:47.800> of<00:04:47.950> course<00:04:48.070> you<00:04:48.250> can<00:04:48.370> tweak<00:04:48.669> your

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
much better of course you can tweak your

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.360 
much better of course you can tweak your
sensitivity<00:04:49.750> if<00:04:49.930> you're<00:04:50.560> interested<00:04:51.220> as<00:04:51.340> well

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
sensitivity if you're interested as well

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.129 
sensitivity if you're interested as well
there's<00:04:51.729> also<00:04:51.910> a<00:04:52.030> help<00:04:52.300> menu<00:04:52.479> but<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:52.870> pretty

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
there's also a help menu but I pretty

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.050 
there's also a help menu but I pretty
much<00:04:53.229> went<00:04:53.500> over<00:04:53.800> all<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.250> different

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
much went over all the different

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.000 
much went over all the different
gameplay<00:04:55.479> elements<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.320> controls<00:04:56.800> that

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
gameplay elements and the controls that

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.550 
gameplay elements and the controls that
you<00:04:57.160> would<00:04:57.310> have<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.610> know<00:04:57.639> just<00:04:58.450> for<00:04:59.139> to<00:04:59.410> get

you would have to know just for to get

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.940 
you would have to know just for to get
this<00:04:59.710> application<00:05:01.229> so<00:05:02.229> as<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:02.470> can<00:05:02.560> see<00:05:02.770> now

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
did that on purpose I was trying to

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.240 
did that on purpose I was trying to
purposely<00:05:07.540> crash<00:05:07.960> into<00:05:08.320> things<00:05:08.530> damaged<00:05:09.100> my

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
vehicle and you can see that the rear

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.170 
vehicle and you can see that the rear
bumper<00:05:11.110> starting<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:11.740> fall<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.130> glass<00:05:12.880> is

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
bumper starting to fall the glass is

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.020 
bumper starting to fall the glass is
actually<00:05:13.830> starting<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.889> shatter<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:15.910> it's

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
actually starting to shatter so it's

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.909 
actually starting to shatter so it's
actually<00:05:16.150> pretty<00:05:16.479> cool<00:05:16.720> the<00:05:17.260> race<00:05:17.470> just<00:05:17.770> ended

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
actually pretty cool the race just ended

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.730 
actually pretty cool the race just ended
there<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:18.490> i<00:05:18.550> believe<00:05:18.880> i<00:05:19.030> was<00:05:19.180> last<00:05:19.510> i<00:05:20.020> had<00:05:20.560> to

there and i believe i was last i had to

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.040 
there and i believe i was last i had to
be<00:05:20.919> fourth<00:05:21.460> place<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:22.030> at<00:05:22.090> least<00:05:22.270> make<00:05:22.630> some

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
be fourth place to at least make some

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.659 
be fourth place to at least make some
earnings<00:05:23.560> so<00:05:23.710> i<00:05:23.740> pretty<00:05:23.979> much<00:05:24.100> earned<00:05:24.430> nothing

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
earnings so i pretty much earned nothing

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.850 
earnings so i pretty much earned nothing
up<00:05:25.210> top<00:05:25.539> you<00:05:25.750> can<00:05:25.870> see<00:05:25.930> how<00:05:26.289> much<00:05:26.500> earnings

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
up top you can see how much earnings

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.430 
up top you can see how much earnings
actually<00:05:27.310> made<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.610> says<00:05:27.810> 19,000<00:05:28.810> total

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
earnings anyways let's quickly hop back

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.600 
earnings anyways let's quickly hop back
into<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.260> map<00:05:32.440> and<00:05:32.680> let's<00:05:32.890> conclude<00:05:33.100> off<00:05:33.430> this

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
into the map and let's conclude off this

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.610 
into the map and let's conclude off this
review<00:05:34.060> so<00:05:34.270> i<00:05:34.300> am<00:05:34.660> going<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:35.020> zap<00:05:35.350> this

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
review so i am going to zap this

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.430 
review so i am going to zap this
application<00:05:36.460> up<00:05:36.870> just<00:05:37.870> because<00:05:37.990> i<00:05:38.169> think

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
application up just because i think

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.870 
application up just because i think
that's<00:05:38.590> an<00:05:38.740> amazing<00:05:38.950> application<00:05:39.610> not<00:05:39.729> this

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
that's an amazing application not this

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.940 
that's an amazing application not this
thing<00:05:40.030> i<00:05:40.090> don't<00:05:40.150> like<00:05:40.330> is<00:05:40.450> this<00:05:41.260> origin<00:05:41.770> it

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
thing i don't like is this origin it

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.400 
thing i don't like is this origin it
keeps<00:05:42.520> on<00:05:42.760> asking<00:05:43.090> me<00:05:43.450> to<00:05:43.570> sign<00:05:43.720> into<00:05:43.930> origin

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
keeps on asking me to sign into origin

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.469 
keeps on asking me to sign into origin
EA<00:05:44.740> origin<00:05:45.220> is<00:05:45.310> an<00:05:45.430> amazing<00:05:45.850> service<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.360> it's

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
EA origin is an amazing service and it's

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.360 
EA origin is an amazing service and it's
nice<00:05:46.660> to<00:05:46.840> have<00:05:47.020> on<00:05:47.350> here<00:05:47.590> but<00:05:48.070> since<00:05:48.250> I<00:05:48.340> don't

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
interested in using it and it's kind of

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.379

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
many times and that's just one problem

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.420 
many times and that's just one problem
that<00:06:29.050> I<00:06:29.169> found<00:06:29.470> with<00:06:29.680> the<00:06:29.710> game<00:06:29.979> but<00:06:30.220> maybe

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
that I found with the game but maybe

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.480 
that I found with the game but maybe
it's<00:06:30.699> just<00:06:30.759> how<00:06:31.060> I<00:06:31.090> actually<00:06:32.310> interact<00:06:33.310> with

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
it's just how I actually interact with

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.309 
it's just how I actually interact with
it<00:06:33.639> maybe<00:06:33.759> I'm<00:06:34.090> not<00:06:34.569> doing<00:06:34.840> the<00:06:34.960> clicking

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
it maybe I'm not doing the clicking

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.930 
it maybe I'm not doing the clicking
correctly<00:06:36.220> because<00:06:36.280> sometimes<00:06:36.729> I<00:06:36.880> do

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
correctly because sometimes I do

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.749 
correctly because sometimes I do
accidentally<00:06:37.660> slide<00:06:38.050> my<00:06:38.289> finger<00:06:38.590> a<00:06:38.620> bit<00:06:39.069> when

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 
accidentally slide my finger a bit when

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.370 
accidentally slide my finger a bit when
I<00:06:39.819> click<00:06:40.150> but<00:06:40.330> i<00:06:40.360> believe<00:06:40.449> that<00:06:40.690> EA<00:06:41.080> should

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
I click but i believe that EA should

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.320 
I click but i believe that EA should
kind<00:06:41.590> of<00:06:41.680> make<00:06:41.830> some<00:06:42.009> really<00:06:42.250> way<00:06:42.910> for<00:06:43.180> that

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
kind of make some really way for that

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.990 
kind of make some really way for that
and<00:06:43.650> allow<00:06:44.650> users<00:06:45.099> to<00:06:45.130> do<00:06:45.400> that<00:06:45.580> by<00:06:45.699> anyways

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
and allow users to do that by anyways

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.580 
and allow users to do that by anyways
besides<00:06:46.180> that<00:06:46.569> I<00:06:46.630> found<00:06:46.870> no<00:06:47.110> problems<00:06:47.349> with
