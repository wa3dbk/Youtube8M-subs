you a quick tutorial I'm going to be

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.249 
you a quick tutorial I'm going to be
showing<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.060> how<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.240> build<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.750> note<00:00:07.020> block

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
showing you how to build the note block

showing you how to build the note block
door<00:00:07.500> key<00:00:07.710> which<00:00:07.980> is<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.400> practical<00:00:08.820> use<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.179> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
door key which is a practical use of the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.169 
door key which is a practical use of the
dud<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.440> data<00:00:10.800> update<00:00:11.309> detector<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
dud the data update detector and the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.669 
dud the data update detector and the
reason<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.570> sharing<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.139> we've<00:00:13.349> used<00:00:13.559> because

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
reason I sharing this we've used because

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.440 
reason I sharing this we've used because
I<00:00:13.830> think<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.130> note<00:00:14.309> block<00:00:14.490> has<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.940> great

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
I think the note block has a great

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.029 
I think the note block has a great
texture<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.049> something<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.500> interact<00:00:16.920> with

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
texture for something to interact with

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.640 
texture for something to interact with
and<00:00:17.400> open<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.359> door<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.170> when<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.439> right-click

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
and open a door so when we right-click

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.560 
and open a door so when we right-click
on<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.100> all<00:00:20.369> we're<00:00:20.550> doing<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> creating<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
on this all we're doing is creating a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.480 
on this all we're doing is creating a
redstone<00:00:21.900> signal<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.590> then<00:00:23.070> that's<00:00:23.279> hooked

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
redstone signal and then that's hooked

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.340 
redstone signal and then that's hooked
up<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> TV<00:00:24.210> little<00:00:24.539> block<00:00:24.689> which<00:00:24.900> controls

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
up to a TV little block which controls

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.480 
up to a TV little block which controls
our<00:00:25.529> door<00:00:25.800> right<00:00:26.039> here

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
our door right here

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
our door right here
so<00:00:27.119> around<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.449> back<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.140> dud<00:00:28.349> which

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
so around the back we have the dud which

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.980 
so around the back we have the dud which
is<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:28.980> bit<00:00:29.250> over<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.510> have<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.840> T

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
is this bit over here then we have the T

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.410 
is this bit over here then we have the T
flip-flop<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.679> our<00:00:32.369> Jeb<00:00:32.669> door<00:00:32.880> over<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.270> this

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
flip-flop and our Jeb door over on this

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.200 
flip-flop and our Jeb door over on this
side<00:00:33.480> here<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.130> discovered<00:00:35.640> by<00:00:35.850> nice

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
side here so this was discovered by nice

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.209 
side here so this was discovered by nice
Mark<00:00:36.570> MC<00:00:37.020> who<00:00:37.230> has<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> really<00:00:37.710> good<00:00:37.920> video

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
Mark MC who has a really good video

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
Mark MC who has a really good video
explaining<00:00:38.730> how<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> dud<00:00:39.300> works<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.899> also

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
explaining how the dud works and also

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.560 
explaining how the dud works and also
some<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.590> its<00:00:40.710> many<00:00:40.920> uses<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.520> example<00:00:42.420> you

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
some of its many uses for example you

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.330 
some of its many uses for example you
can<00:00:42.750> use<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.260> detect<00:00:43.620> when<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> player

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
can use it to detect when a player

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.660 
can use it to detect when a player
places<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.570> removes<00:00:46.230> items<00:00:46.680> from<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.980> chest<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
places or removes items from a chest and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.700 
places or removes items from a chest and
also<00:00:48.210> when<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.450> simply<00:00:48.840> click<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> empty

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
also when they simply click in the empty

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.650 
also when they simply click in the empty
space<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:50.430> well<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> redstone

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
space as well you can get a redstone

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.959 
space as well you can get a redstone
signal<00:00:51.840> from<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.410> using<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.160> dud<00:00:53.489> now<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
signal from that using this dud now it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.189 
signal from that using this dud now it
interacts<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> lot<00:00:54.809> more<00:00:54.960> than<00:00:55.170> just

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
interacts with a lot more than just

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.830 
interacts with a lot more than just
chests<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:55.980> note<00:00:56.670> blocks<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.120> example<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
chests and note blocks for example it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.900 
chests and note blocks for example it
works<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.260> beacons<00:00:58.739> dispensers<00:00:59.430> droppers<00:00:59.879> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
works at beacons dispensers droppers and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.970 
works at beacons dispensers droppers and
even<00:01:00.570> signs<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.410> want<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.620> know<00:01:01.739> more

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
even signs if you want to know more

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.770 
even signs if you want to know more
about<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:03.059> go<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.329> check<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.539> this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
about this then go and check out this

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.179 
about this then go and check out this
video<00:01:03.989> I'm<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> give<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> quick

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
video I'm going to give you a quick

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.130 
video I'm going to give you a quick
explanation<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:06.210> how<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.479> works<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> then

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
explanation of how this works and then

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.440 
explanation of how this works and then
show<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.439> how<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> build<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.119> chest

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
show you how to build it so this chest

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
show you how to build it so this chest
right<00:01:09.689> here<00:01:09.720> at<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> moment<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.770> can't<00:01:10.979> open

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
right here at the moment we can't open

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.920 
right here at the moment we can't open
it<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.790> has<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> block<00:01:12.299> above<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
it because it has a block above it and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.929 
it because it has a block above it and
the<00:01:13.470> comparator<00:01:14.070> shouldn't<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.460> able<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.790> get

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
the comparator shouldn't be able to get

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.999 
the comparator shouldn't be able to get
a<00:01:14.970> signal<00:01:15.240> from<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.619> falsely

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
a signal from that so it's falsely

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.440 
a signal from that so it's falsely
powered<00:01:17.280> at<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> moment<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.150> means

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
powered at the moment and that means

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.090 
powered at the moment and that means
when<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.750> update<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> realize

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
when we update it it's going to realize

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
when we update it it's going to realize
it<00:01:20.250> shouldn't<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.580> powered<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.750> creates

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it shouldn't be powered and that creates

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.320 
it shouldn't be powered and that creates
a<00:01:22.200> redstone<00:01:22.650> signal<00:01:22.860> which<00:01:23.250> also<00:01:23.490> resets<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
a redstone signal which also resets the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.070 
a redstone signal which also resets the
device<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:25.229> well<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> build<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.840> are

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
device as well so to build this you are

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.569 
device as well so to build this you are
going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> need<00:01:28.380> six<00:01:28.710> building<00:01:29.100> blocks<00:01:29.369> a

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
going to need six building blocks a

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.550 
going to need six building blocks a
piece<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.909> redstone<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.600> sticky<00:01:30.960> piston<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
piece of redstone a sticky piston a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.710 
piece of redstone a sticky piston a
redstone<00:01:31.979> comparator<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.610> chest<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.479> note

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
redstone comparator a chest and a note

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.179 
redstone comparator a chest and a note
block<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.380> we're<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.740> start<00:01:34.979> off<00:01:35.040> by

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
block and we're going to start off by

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.429 
block and we're going to start off by
placing<00:01:35.430> down<00:01:35.759> some<00:01:36.060> blocks<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.930> I'm

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
placing down some blocks like this I'm

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.840 
placing down some blocks like this I'm
going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> remove<00:01:37.950> some<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.340> them<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.820> go

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
going to remove some of them as we go

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.450 
going to remove some of them as we go
and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:40.049> we'll<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> comparator<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.100> top

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and then we'll put a comparator on top

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.859 
and then we'll put a comparator on top
of<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.759> block<00:01:42.000> facing<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.659> direction

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
of this block facing in that direction

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.499 
of this block facing in that direction
and<00:01:43.560> over<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> piece<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.579> redstone<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.210> in

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and over here a piece of redstone and in

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.060 
and over here a piece of redstone and in
front<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.020> sticky<00:01:46.409> piston<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.799> needs

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
front of that a sticky piston that needs

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.160 
front of that a sticky piston that needs
to<00:01:47.250> face<00:01:47.460> towards<00:01:48.060> us<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.810> we're<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
to face towards us then we're going to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.630 
to face towards us then we're going to
put<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> block<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.950> front<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> sticky

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
put a block in front of the sticky

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.700 
put a block in front of the sticky
piston<00:01:51.090> put<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> chest<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.500> put<00:01:52.680> one

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
piston put a chest here and then put one

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.679 
piston put a chest here and then put one
of<00:01:52.950> our<00:01:53.040> building<00:01:53.399> blocks<00:01:53.520> inside<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.509> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
of our building blocks inside there and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.709 
of our building blocks inside there and
that<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.530> going<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> activate<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.369> dud<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.570> now

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that is going to activate the dud so now

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.090 
that is going to activate the dud so now
what<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.049> do<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.380> put<00:01:58.560> your<00:01:58.649> note<00:01:58.890> block

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
what you can do is put your note block

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.459 
what you can do is put your note block
here<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.719> then<00:02:00.719> when<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.960> right-click<00:02:01.170> on

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
here and then when you right-click on

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.440 
here and then when you right-click on
that<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> activates<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.460> also<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.420> have

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that it activates and also you can have

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.170 
that it activates and also you can have
a<00:02:03.630> block<00:02:04.079> there<00:02:04.380> instead<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.219> have<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> block

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
a block there instead so have a block

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.089 
a block there instead so have a block
here<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.869> note<00:02:07.259> block<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.590> front<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.979> it

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
here and the note block in front of it

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.130 
here and the note block in front of it
and<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.759> right-click<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.720> still

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and when you right-click this is still

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.140 
and when you right-click this is still
going<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.530> work<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.910> for<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
going to work so that is it for this

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.820 
going to work so that is it for this
