00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.689
 let's go over what mourinho said to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.689
 see what he said after the match 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.510
 we will be more judged because the 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.019
 coach has thought it was better than 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.019
 will play me 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.870
 I understand your question because we are 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.630
 talking about a player normally 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:24.110
 headline we are talking about a player 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.990
 fantastic but I want to leave very very 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:30.759
 very clear because some of you are 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.150
 they are experts in inventing when they do not know 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.760
 I want to make very very clear what 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.890
 problems between me we are zero 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.329
 problems of any disciplinary order 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.030
 the zero also a decision alone and 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.850
 purely sporting to think that in 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.960
 this moment in time and in all 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.090
 points we will have more conditions for 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.010
 to play a good game I felt the 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.550
 very committed people and I have the 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.040
 feeling that today we could lose that 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.500
 people would be sad house with the 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.930
 result 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.660
 obviously tomorrow they would be financed by 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.070
 we would be prepared for 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.820
 write because we their makers 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.530
 of opinion and we have that power over 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.720
 about a lot of people but I have the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.880
 feeling that people have understood the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.160
 team commitment has understood 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.780
 that people have left absolutely 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.270
 everything in the field and that for me is 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.409
 that's the matrix you can lose 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.900
 but you have to fight until the end 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.630
 summarizing everything worries me in this 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.610
 moment everything worries me what I think 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.580
 that is a team madrid community not 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.190
 can you say we won the cup does 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.440
 two years now we are not interested anymore 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.720
 won the championship last season 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.300
 now what we will do is not the 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.380
 madrid historically wants the tenth and 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.190
 let's fight for her I said the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.020
 Madrid players can lose 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.380
 can lose today if we lose the game 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.330
 It will not happen for us for our 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.390
 and intimate for what we feel like 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.790
 professional is a match like audio and 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.210
 you can lose bad luck the arts 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.930
 amazing 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:31.750
 central forest color and metegol you can 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.750
 lose because losing is part of football 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.980
 history history repeats 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.680
 history is always the story of 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.570
 mourinho looking for rival is absolutely 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.800
 contradictory is the best not the 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.750
 best coaches in history that 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.910
 no doubt is very contradictory 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.130
 statements and we have also extracted 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.440
 of the conference now let's talk 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.720
 a little what said this part where 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.670
 he again puts the focus of all 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.790
 problems and evils about the press what 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.790
 we see 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.460
 you have been asked before in English by the 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.170
 effusive in its celebration says that it 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.760
 it crossed his mind at that time 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.300
 delete all the headlines of the press 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.040
 he expected exaggerated criticism and 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.650
 all directed towards his person without 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.640
 rare and clear that its conditioned by 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.060
 for the language to witness until he commits it 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:29.000
 in grams posts leaves the creative 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:32.520
 all out and then trade with a 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.030
 loved and with with key and with xabi 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.850
 alonso 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.459
 He has no history of goals in the 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.240
 champions of videos place of injury 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.280
 with benzema came out against does not have a 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.800
 been in the championship is cooler 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.410
 Marcelo and I'll have to play phage because 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.000
 is not doubling the championship I know that 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.830
 everything was what it was 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.830
 preparing have a face that has gone there 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.160
 and that before being a desk he already had 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.160
 all controlled
