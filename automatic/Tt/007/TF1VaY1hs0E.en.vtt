00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
hole in the top

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.600 
hole in the top
what's<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.799> name<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.190> whole<00:02:10.340> lot<00:02:10.489> of

inch or so engine a half two inches the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.729 
inch or so engine a half two inches the
most<00:02:20.019> they<00:02:21.019> should<00:02:21.170> have<00:02:21.260> call<00:02:21.379> this<00:02:21.530> instead

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
most they should have call this instead

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
draw the where the icing is going to be

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.800 
draw the where the icing is going to be
see<00:02:27.560> icing<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.010> like<00:02:28.129> just<00:02:28.819> poured<00:02:29.180> right<00:02:29.510> over

see icing is like just poured right over
the<00:02:29.930> three<00:02:30.200> balls<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.220> make<00:02:31.940> nice<00:02:32.120> icing

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
the three balls so you make nice icing

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.229 
the three balls so you make nice icing
shake<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:32.989> that<00:02:33.579> now<00:02:34.579> the<00:02:34.640> icing<00:02:34.849> actually

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
shake like that now the icing actually

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.910 
shake like that now the icing actually
you've<00:02:35.390> sticks<00:02:35.690> out<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.349> you<00:02:36.410> want<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.680> cut

sponge cake is kind of like the color of
a<00:03:16.220> Twinkie<00:03:16.549> I<00:03:16.579> guess<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.359> that's<00:03:18.109> like<00:03:18.349> I
