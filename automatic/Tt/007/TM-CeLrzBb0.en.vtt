00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
oh pretty guesswork I now found where I

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:51.850 
oh pretty guesswork I now found where I
am<00:06:44.599> I<00:06:45.759> now<00:06:46.759> know<00:06:48.430> yeah<00:06:50.080> all<00:06:51.080> of<00:06:51.289> these<00:06:51.500> tall

I<00:06:56.000> don't<00:06:56.720> know<00:06:56.810> whether<00:06:56.990> to<00:06:57.080> end<00:06:57.320> it<00:06:57.530> here<00:06:57.560> I

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:58.480 
I don't know whether to end it here I

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.780 
I don't know whether to end it here I
think<00:06:59.480> it's<00:06:59.690> probably<00:06:59.840> get<00:07:00.080> a<00:07:00.110> bit<00:07:00.290> long<00:07:00.790> it's

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790 
think it's probably get a bit long it's

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.390 
think it's probably get a bit long it's
just<00:07:01.970> going<00:07:02.120> to<00:07:02.150> be<00:07:02.210> really<00:07:02.480> awkward<00:07:02.990> if<00:07:03.170> it's

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 
just going to be really awkward if it's

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.860 
just going to be really awkward if it's
eight<00:07:04.400> minutes<00:07:04.850> long<00:07:05.150> because<00:07:05.540> I'm<00:07:05.660> gonna

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
eight minutes long because I'm gonna

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 
have to put its 24 minute parts or leave

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.110 
have to put its 24 minute parts or leave
it<00:07:08.960> is<00:07:09.080> in<00:07:09.230> a<00:07:09.320> minute<00:07:09.620> farm<00:07:09.890> not<00:07:10.220> sure<00:07:10.430> that

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
it is in a minute farm not sure that

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.120 
it is in a minute farm not sure that
knowing<00:07:11.510> me<00:07:11.720> it's<00:07:11.930> pretty<00:07:12.170> like<00:07:12.440> 20<00:07:12.920> minutes

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
knowing me it's pretty like 20 minutes

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000
