here it is so this brush is kind of like

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.769 
here it is so this brush is kind of like
your<00:00:27.720> typical<00:00:28.590> duo<00:00:29.220> fiber<00:00:29.609> brush<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.300> it

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
your typical duo fiber brush and it

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.209 
your typical duo fiber brush and it
looks<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:33.090> white<00:00:33.329> bristles<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
looks like this the white bristles the

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.940 
looks like this the white bristles the
are<00:00:35.219> taller<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.110> synthetic<00:00:37.110> bristles<00:00:37.620> while

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
are taller and synthetic bristles while

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.790 
are taller and synthetic bristles while
both<00:00:38.190> sets<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.879> bristles<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.450> synthetic<00:00:40.230> but

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
both sets of bristles are synthetic but

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.010 
both sets of bristles are synthetic but
the<00:00:41.129> white<00:00:41.610> ones<00:00:41.820> are<00:00:41.940> taller<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.719> black

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the white ones are taller and the black

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.990 
the white ones are taller and the black
ones<00:00:43.260> are<00:00:43.379> shorter<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:44.520> not<00:00:44.610> sure<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:44.910> you're

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
ones are shorter I'm not sure if you're

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.690 
ones are shorter I'm not sure if you're
going<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.149> be<00:00:45.270> able<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.570> see<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.610> you<00:00:47.610> can

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
going to be able to see this but you can

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.670 
going to be able to see this but you can
see<00:00:49.309> like<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.730> black<00:00:51.030> bristles<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:52.050> shorter

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
see like the black bristles are shorter

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.709 
see like the black bristles are shorter
and<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:54.210> white<00:00:54.870> bristles<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:56.570> you<00:00:57.570> could

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and the white bristles as you could

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.270 
and the white bristles as you could
probably<00:00:57.809> tell<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.289> me<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:58.829> doing<00:00:59.129> this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
probably tell from me just doing this

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.720 
probably tell from me just doing this
this<00:00:59.489> brush<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.820> very<00:01:00.420> flimsy<00:01:01.489> it's<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.670> very

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
this brush is very flimsy it's not very

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.500 
this brush is very flimsy it's not very
stiff<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:04.729> it's<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:06.000> great<00:01:06.240> though

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
stiff at all it's really great though

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.620 
stiff at all it's really great though
for<00:01:07.220> stippling<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.400> product<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
for stippling on product just not so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.859 
for stippling on product just not so
great<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.080> blending<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.369> find<00:01:11.939> unless

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
great for blending it out I find unless

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.240 
great for blending it out I find unless
you<00:01:13.080> push<00:01:14.420> straight<00:01:15.420> down<00:01:15.650> like<00:01:16.650> straight

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you push straight down like straight

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.969 
you push straight down like straight
down<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.479> I'm<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.350> sure<00:01:19.530> how<00:01:19.680> great

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
down and do that I'm not sure how great

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.080 
down and do that I'm not sure how great
that<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> actual<00:01:21.270> brush<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:23.850> is

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that is for the actual brush this is

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.630 
that is for the actual brush this is
also<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.140> larger<00:01:25.650> brush<00:01:25.830> as<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.340> see

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
also not so larger brush as you can see

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.770 
also not so larger brush as you can see
it's<00:01:26.790> kind<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.150> small<00:01:28.939> this<00:01:29.939> way<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.479> put<00:01:30.689> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it's kind of small this way if I put it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.350 
it's kind of small this way if I put it
up<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.900> my<00:01:31.110> face<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.009> small<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
up to my face kind of small so if you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.640 
up to my face kind of small so if you
have<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> smaller<00:01:33.840> face<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.290> guess<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.590> could

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
have a smaller face I guess you could

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.620 
have a smaller face I guess you could
use<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.310> applying<00:01:35.729> foundation<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
use this for applying foundation and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.890 
use this for applying foundation and
things<00:01:36.810> like<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:38.000> for<00:01:39.000> me<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.720> like

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
things like that but for me it's like

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.200 
things like that but for me it's like
the<00:01:40.049> perfect<00:01:40.259> size<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.680> blush<00:01:41.369> application

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the perfect size for blush application

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.130 
the perfect size for blush application
because<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.659> gets<00:01:42.840> me<00:01:42.960> right<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:45.140> also

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
because it gets me right there also

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.170 
because it gets me right there also
because<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.340> very<00:01:47.520> dense<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
because it's it's not very dense and

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.330 
because it's it's not very dense and
it's<00:01:48.329> not<00:01:48.509> very<00:01:48.540> stiff<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.860> great<00:01:50.189> for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it's not very stiff it's great for

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.819 
it's not very stiff it's great for
applying<00:01:50.640> very<00:01:51.000> pigmented<00:01:51.479> flushes<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.799> I

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
applying very pigmented flushes so I

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.609 
applying very pigmented flushes so I
have<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> mixed<00:01:53.909> blush<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.509> red<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
have a mixed blush in red it's like a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.889 
have a mixed blush in red it's like a
bright<00:01:55.920> red<00:01:56.219> color<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.790> applied<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.390> with<00:01:57.659> this

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
bright red color I applied it with this

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.560 
bright red color I applied it with this
and<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.290> made<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:59.430> perfect<00:01:59.759> flush<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.450> my

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
and it made the perfect flush to my

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.510 
and it made the perfect flush to my
cheeks<00:02:00.840> also<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.619> have<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.070> control

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
cheeks also you have a lot of control

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.420 
cheeks also you have a lot of control
over<00:02:02.579> where<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.479> goes<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.780> your<00:02:04.110> face<00:02:04.710> with

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
over where that goes on your face with

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.459 
over where that goes on your face with
this<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.540> one<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.960> reasons<00:02:07.290> why<00:02:07.439> I

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
this so that's one of the reasons why I

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.580 
this so that's one of the reasons why I
like<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.129> size<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.670> brush<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.470> kind<00:02:10.470> of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
like the size of this brush and kind of

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.590 
like the size of this brush and kind of
like<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.890> flimsiness

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
like the flimsiness

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.950 
like the flimsiness
it<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:12.260> works<00:02:12.470> really<00:02:12.680> well<00:02:12.830> for<00:02:12.980> me<00:02:13.720> also<00:02:14.720> if

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
it it works really well for me also if

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.830 
it it works really well for me also if
you<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.730> really<00:02:16.730> really<00:02:17.390> pigmented

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
you have a really really pigmented

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.780 
you have a really really pigmented
anything<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:19.250> going<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.490> give<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.760> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
anything this is going to give you a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.570 
anything this is going to give you a
nice<00:02:20.030> sheer<00:02:20.590> application<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.090> know<00:02:23.720> I

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
nice sheer application of it so I know I

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.330 
nice sheer application of it so I know I
have<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.610> foundation<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.740> very<00:02:27.740> cakey<00:02:28.160> and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
have a foundation that is very cakey and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.210 
have a foundation that is very cakey and
like<00:02:29.060> thick<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.750> don't<00:02:30.470> really<00:02:30.590> like<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.040> lot

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
like thick I don't really like it a lot

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.920 
like thick I don't really like it a lot
what<00:02:31.490> I'll<00:02:31.580> do<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.940> I'll<00:02:32.060> spray<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.480> little<00:02:32.690> bit

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
what I'll do is I'll spray a little bit

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.290 
what I'll do is I'll spray a little bit
of<00:02:33.050> fix<00:02:33.320> plus<00:02:33.620> on<00:02:33.920> this<00:02:34.360> brush<00:02:35.360> onto<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:37.300> onto

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
of fix plus on this brush onto the onto

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.360 
of fix plus on this brush onto the onto
the<00:02:38.450> brush<00:02:38.690> dab<00:02:39.500> it<00:02:39.710> a<00:02:39.800> little<00:02:39.950> bit<00:02:40.160> in<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
the brush dab it a little bit in the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.060 
the brush dab it a little bit in the
foundation<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:41.090> makes<00:02:41.270> it<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.450> lot<00:02:41.630> thinner<00:02:42.620> of

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
foundation it makes it a lot thinner of

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.370 
foundation it makes it a lot thinner of
a<00:02:43.250> consistency<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.090> when<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.720> apply<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.110> it

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
a consistency and when I apply it it

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.090 
a consistency and when I apply it it
makes<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.740> lot<00:02:45.950> like<00:02:46.940> shearer<00:02:47.950> which<00:02:48.950> is

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
makes it a lot like shearer which is

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.920 
makes it a lot like shearer which is
really<00:02:49.340> great<00:02:49.610> because<00:02:49.910> it's<00:02:50.480> not<00:02:50.660> going<00:02:50.720> to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
really great because it's not going to

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.290 
really great because it's not going to
be<00:02:50.990> cakey<00:02:51.380> as<00:02:51.560> much<00:02:51.830> so<00:02:52.460> for<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.820> reason<00:02:52.880> I

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
be cakey as much so for that reason I

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.590 
be cakey as much so for that reason I
like<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:53.840> brush<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.320> lot<00:02:54.800> if<00:02:55.300> I've<00:02:56.300> heard<00:02:56.570> a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
like this brush a lot if I've heard a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.090 
like this brush a lot if I've heard a
lot<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.810> people<00:02:57.110> say<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.650> doesn't<00:02:58.010> even

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
lot of people say that it doesn't even

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.690 
lot of people say that it doesn't even
compare<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.060> mac<00:02:59.590> 187<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.680> believe<00:03:00.920> or<00:03:01.190> 188

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
compare to the mac 187 I believe or 188

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.850 
compare to the mac 187 I believe or 188
I<00:03:02.620> think<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.740> a<00:03:03.800> 187<00:03:04.750> I'm<00:03:05.750> not<00:03:05.990> sure<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:06.800> it

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
I think it's a 187 I'm not sure but it

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.120 
I think it's a 187 I'm not sure but it
doesn't<00:03:07.250> compare<00:03:07.460> to<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.880> mac<00:03:08.060> version<00:03:08.090> in

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
doesn't compare to the mac version in

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.700 
doesn't compare to the mac version in
because<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.340> mac<00:03:10.730> one<00:03:11.000> will<00:03:11.780> have<00:03:11.990> it<00:03:12.350> has<00:03:12.680> a

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
because the mac one will have it has a

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.160 
because the mac one will have it has a
lot<00:03:12.980> more<00:03:13.010> density<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.820> it<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.360> provides<00:03:15.020> a

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
lot more density to it and it provides a

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.650 
lot more density to it and it provides a
lot<00:03:15.410> more<00:03:15.650> coverage<00:03:16.220> than<00:03:16.250> this<00:03:16.670> does<00:03:16.940> but<00:03:17.570> if

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
lot more coverage than this does but if

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.010 
lot more coverage than this does but if
you're<00:03:17.810> like<00:03:17.990> me<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:18.560> just<00:03:18.740> want<00:03:20.020> you

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
know something that's going to look

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.330

really<00:03:22.280> natural<00:03:22.610> and<00:03:23.060> not<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.540> cakey<00:03:24.080> or<00:03:24.340> you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
really natural and not so cakey or you

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
more of a mousse consistency but this is

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.900 
more of a mousse consistency but this is
great<00:03:59.330> because<00:03:59.600> one<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.710> fits<00:04:01.010> perfectly<00:04:01.610> into
