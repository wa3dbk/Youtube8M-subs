00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello everyone today, I'll show you how to change 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.170
 places your drive and external card 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.280
 memory based on this method we can 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.530
 move application cache to card 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.500
 actually what will make our life easier 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.300
 and essentially well, I think all of you 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.869
 faced with such a problem that after 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.810
 install two or three games with weighty 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.330
 of course the memory is simply filled 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.670
 Now I will show a way out of this situation. 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.960
 Actually, but in general there are many ways 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.100
 but I will say that this particular one went to me 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.370
 way for others not to waste 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.469
 failed on this method 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.050
 Works fine on samsung galaxy s 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.690
 advance on others by not knowing did not check 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.910
 we need that key or background were 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.190
 agreed root rights how to install 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.500
 root rights they showed in the previous 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.899
 video and so download download root 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.940
 explorer 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.680
 and archive 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.920
 Here is the archive I am link in the description 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.110
 next we connect the phone 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.119
 computer go settings on 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.740
 advanced settings nosuhi hut 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.340
 connect yusb drive so turn 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.340
 whose cable 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 all click again on a thousand drive 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.360
 while we wait 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:39.740
 everything 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:42.200
 we have a flash drive we open everything so 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.640
 now we throw these two files 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.640
 straight root flash drive 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.760
 everything is alive now we need to rasterize 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:02.320
 this file that we just take 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:06.960
 on it here we have passed we believe everything 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:11.790
 if glue on it you can close the flash drive 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.790
 disconnect the phone from the cable 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.350
 so now I have exchanged and show that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.340
 for example from appreciated 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:29.090
 dead trigger game I will explain to you that he and 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.790
 Now the phone reads the cache itself with 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.790
 internal memory 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.330
 cache give Eger I uploaded to the card 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.750
 of memory 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.390
 That is, to make sure the game 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.720
 now does not work because there is no porridge 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.190
 window live on the memory card you see 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.720
 now we will try to swap well 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.180
 usb drive and external memory card 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.930
 there is a memory card and usb drive and by 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.200
 construction on the saint will come in we go 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.200
 my files 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.490
 install root explorer 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.629
 but 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.890
 to establish 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.890
 install 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.610
 open it 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.930
 next we need to copy the file which 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:34.040
 we extracted from the archive 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.040
 go to our memory card there further 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:45.439
 so started a beginner 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:50.239
 my stop not smt here we go text 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:52.299
 sd cards and here we are looking for our extracted 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.299
 file 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:10.000
 so here is this file we need it 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:16.180
 copy here's how you see copy 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.620
 and actually go to the directory with so what 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:24.100
 to tell 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:27.320
 here is a catalog with and actually here well it 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.650
 we copy but first we press the button 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.650
 right 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:37.190
 that is, you have to press the right rv 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:41.830
 so that you have from the right p. all further 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:46.970
 we press the insert button we press yes 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:51.580
 waiting for everything we put in with the replacement now 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.580
 we need to reboot click 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.580
 shutdown 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.270
 We are waiting for the complete shutdown of the device 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.050
 everything is now on the rule 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.389
 and first thing we do now 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:20.389
 check the game 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:05.069
 all and the phone itself is loaded 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.069
 unlock entering the menu 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.090
 and check our game 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.999
 as you can see the game is loaded that is, we 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.860
 well 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:28.159
 swapped usb drive and external 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.889
 memory card but to me it did not go further 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.779
 that is, the application error occurred well 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:36.229
 the fact itself remains a fact 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:43.819
 I think you liked my video here. 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:48.349
 everything is easy now under the sd card folder on 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:51.159
 A flash drive is hiding from the folder x 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:55.129
 sd card on hiding phone memory 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:59.930
 let's all discuss the pros and cons 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:02.599
 of this method, well, plus of course 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.539
 obvious we can move any 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:09.309
 files from phone to memory card and card 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:13.779
 memory but now is the main 

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:19.339
 store the phone itself to the minus and 

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:22.189
 cons generally small here that is 

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:25.430
 irrelevant if you have 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:28.759
 the application is adapted to the phone 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:31.569
 but has a phone storage place then you 

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:35.360
 I'll just have to change saving to 

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:37.759
 phone and you will actually 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.289
 photos go to memory card 

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:44.940
 if you have storage space on 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:47.160
 tula memory card 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.610
 photos will be saved on the phone 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.980
 Well, that is how it goes the other way around 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:56.580
 Well, actually like minuses like 

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:59.280
 no, that is, the system responds well 

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.540
 everything works well you enjoyed it 

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.040
 my video put likes subscribe 

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.040
