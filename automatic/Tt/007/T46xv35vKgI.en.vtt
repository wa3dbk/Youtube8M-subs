well as brush it down because I feel

like<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.640> um<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.330> think<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.110> little

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.860 
like that um I think it's in a little
sleeker<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:54.209> know<00:02:54.300> you<00:02:54.360> don't<00:02:54.570> have<00:02:54.720> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
sleeker so you know you don't have to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.560 
sleeker so you know you don't have to
brush<00:02:55.110> all<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.070> way<00:02:56.520> back<00:02:56.820> or<00:02:57.090> anything<00:02:57.330> like

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
brush all the way back or anything like

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.199 
brush all the way back or anything like
that<00:02:57.600> just<00:02:58.050> you<00:02:58.350> know<00:02:59.010> use<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.910> want

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
that just you know use it and you want

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.400 
that just you know use it and you want
to<00:03:00.270> make<00:03:00.360> sure<00:03:00.390> you're<00:03:00.660> using<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.959> soft<00:03:01.260> brush

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
to make sure you're using a soft brush

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.350 
to make sure you're using a soft brush
for<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.070> don't<00:03:02.100> want<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.490> be<00:03:03.120> using

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
for this you don't want to be using

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.670 
for this you don't want to be using
something<00:03:03.780> that's<00:03:03.930> going<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.170> damage<00:03:04.470> your

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
something that's going to damage your

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.140 
something that's going to damage your
hair<00:03:05.240> so<00:03:06.240> see<00:03:06.390> how<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.750> lot<00:03:06.930> sleeker<00:03:07.260> now

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
hair so see how it's a lot sleeker now

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.840 
hair so see how it's a lot sleeker now
just<00:03:09.150> do<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.420> on<00:03:09.570> both<00:03:09.720> sides<00:03:10.610> if<00:03:11.610> you're

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
just do that on both sides if you're

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.910 
just do that on both sides if you're
wearing<00:03:12.240> your<00:03:12.390> hair<00:03:12.630> covering<00:03:13.110> one<00:03:13.350> side<00:03:13.650> it's

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
wearing your hair covering one side it's

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.640 
wearing your hair covering one side it's
not<00:03:14.220> quite<00:03:15.150> as<00:03:15.330> important<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.410> side

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
not quite as important on the side

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.090 
not quite as important on the side
that's<00:03:16.980> going<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.459> covered<00:03:18.739> but<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.980> get

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
that's going to be covered but you get

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.300 
that's going to be covered but you get
the<00:03:20.250> idea<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:21.320> once<00:03:22.320> that's<00:03:22.500> done<00:03:22.769> take<00:03:23.160> your

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
the idea so once that's done take your

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.120 
the idea so once that's done take your
scarf<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:24.320> mine<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:26.510> polyester<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.739> don't

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
scarf and mine is polyester so I don't

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.400 
scarf and mine is polyester so I don't
think<00:03:29.310> polyester<00:03:29.910> has<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.570> same<00:03:30.750> absorbency

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
think polyester has the same absorbency

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.840 
think polyester has the same absorbency
as<00:03:31.530> cotton<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:32.160> just<00:03:32.340> make<00:03:32.459> sure<00:03:32.489> you're<00:03:32.670> not

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
as cotton so just make sure you're not

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.250 
as cotton so just make sure you're not
putting<00:03:33.390> something<00:03:33.600> on<00:03:33.840> your<00:03:33.959> hair<00:03:34.110> just

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
putting something on your hair just

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.710 
putting something on your hair just
going<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.470> dry<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.800> up<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.160> see<00:03:36.150> how<00:03:36.300> wide<00:03:36.540> it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
going to dry it up and see how wide it

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.620 
going to dry it up and see how wide it
is<00:03:36.840> I'm<00:03:37.290> just<00:03:37.500> going<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.709> fold<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.280> half

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
is I'm just going to fold it in half

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.800 
is I'm just going to fold it in half
three<00:03:39.630> times<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.200> that's<00:03:40.320> one<00:03:41.959> two<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:44.810> three

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
three times so that's one two and three

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.780 
three times so that's one two and three
and<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.230> just<00:03:46.470> makes<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.830> really<00:03:47.700> skinny<00:03:48.350> and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
and that just makes it really skinny and

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.460 
and that just makes it really skinny and
then<00:03:50.790> you're<00:03:51.330> going<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.510> do<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.750> obvious<00:03:52.200> next

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
then you're going to do the obvious next

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.990 
then you're going to do the obvious next
step<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:53.880> apply<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.870> scarf<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:56.580> your

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
step and just apply the scarf to your

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.640 
step and just apply the scarf to your
edges<00:04:00.200> we<00:04:01.200> wrap<00:04:01.380> it<00:04:01.530> around<00:04:02.900> if<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.110> want<00:04:04.410> you

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
edges we wrap it around if you want you

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.170 
edges we wrap it around if you want you
know<00:04:04.739> make<00:04:05.100> sure<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.340> none<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.940> hair<00:04:06.090> in

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
know make sure that none of the hair in

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.610 
know make sure that none of the hair in
the<00:04:06.209> back<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.630> caught<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.019> so<00:04:07.230> just<00:04:07.410> kind<00:04:07.560> of

little while

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.800

then like especially if I use the gel to

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.060 
then like especially if I use the gel to
slick<00:06:01.760> my<00:06:01.970> hair<00:06:02.000> back<00:06:02.210> I<00:06:03.080> wouldn't<00:06:03.889> really
