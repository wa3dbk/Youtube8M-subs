00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.630 
still intact he does not mark in my
house<00:03:01.960> but<00:03:02.960> I<00:03:02.990> would<00:03:03.350> suggest<00:03:03.560> keeping<00:03:04.550> a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
house but I would suggest keeping a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.310 
house but I would suggest keeping a
close<00:03:04.850> eye<00:03:05.060> on<00:03:05.090> him<00:03:05.450> in<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.900> beginning

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
close eye on him in the beginning

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.080 
close eye on him in the beginning
because<00:03:06.500> anytime<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:07.010> dog<00:03:07.250> goes<00:03:07.520> to<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.730> new<00:03:07.880> home

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
because anytime a dog goes to a new home

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.960 
because anytime a dog goes to a new home
they<00:03:08.240> need<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.540> learn<00:03:08.750> their<00:03:09.020> boundaries

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
they need to learn their boundaries

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.440 
they need to learn their boundaries
which<00:03:10.970> I'm<00:03:11.209> very<00:03:11.540> firm<00:03:11.750> in<00:03:11.930> my<00:03:12.050> boundaries

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
which I'm very firm in my boundaries

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.030 
which I'm very firm in my boundaries

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
doggie door because it just kind of

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.640 
doggie door because it just kind of
gives<00:03:22.430> him<00:03:22.610> some<00:03:22.790> more<00:03:22.940> freedom<00:03:23.390> but<00:03:23.570> we<00:03:24.080> took
