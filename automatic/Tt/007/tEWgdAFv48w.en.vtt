00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.369
 I do not have 10 yet 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.369
 Not 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.259
 to Haiti 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.460
 I am again 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.490
 I would have found Marcel Granollers 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.390
 somehow can 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.040
 the typical modeled 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.660
 non-public I have degrees 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.510
 seek a deal 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.600
 just not from Brakel 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.600
 How to do it right bleed me 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.569
 and go 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.569
 the first thing he does with us is of course 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.020
 mousse 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.340
 I had a 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.330
 there 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.450
 hor 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.040
 Resistance gives 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.920
 and vice versa 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.920
 is sought 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.920
 and no 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.310
 how to change Finks course before 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.770
 after the Jump the Seeker Braunau 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.020
 and urge it always comes down to the hair structure 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.490
 it is still determined 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.400
 if she has killed me as it is 50 it will be hard he gives Gallus 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.050
 and Dr is born the St 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.710
 Customers can be the first offspring 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.610
 Tuesday morning I have not had that much time yet 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.050
 that's a little bit dry 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.770
 and the most important thing is Jennifer dries 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.220
 expect to see some of the races for us 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.500
 in Istanbul 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.560
 always make it upside down 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.680
 at the moment 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.670
 made in addition to Mono Inc Boston is so timely but it is released 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.630
 was developed 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.539
 now after 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:22.150
 then make no compromises then just do it flat-bottomed 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.489
 the most important is 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.329
 and now comes again 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.709
 good news 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.919
 he is drying so far 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.389
 on 12 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.029
 that is still the 10th 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.639
 is racist was the epidemic danger 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.439
 not least because I did not use them 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.469
 including this year 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.469
 Jannik Striepeke can save himself 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.339
 Eick lived 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.289
 more modules only that is the most important 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.209
 with chopped off 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.869
 the top line 8 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:58.959
 the 40 o'clock raised 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.819
 become 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.529
 so around the 4th 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.249
 In the end, I tended to be stuck 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.249
 sda 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.999
 the minister next to Christ 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.399
 and somehow it is too 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:17.620
 in her second appearance 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.770
 Eglis Hütteldorfern on the criticism 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.719
 I invite the Christians 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.849
 are you still the least and m or he also determines 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.849
 Alinghi also believes that the holocaust must be upheld 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:32.769
 by 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.769
 is integrated 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.639
 the little guests are on top 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.989
 and I do not think so 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.239
 and the most important thing is 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.380
 the top places Schindler 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.929
 I do not sit down 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.479
 Smokie find 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.860
 i have wishes 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.280
 what else if you do not do that, do not shut up and that's how they are 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.929
 Do not hesitate and that's not so bad 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:00.899
 Sandmann 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:02.029
 in Eberswalde 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:03.939
 is the most important 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.719
 do not go too hot 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:06.889
 my marriage 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.889
 Finally, the Gräfelfinger and a little answers 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:12.249
 if Denic has time 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:16.409
 never too hot for an animal daily 70 h and it is dry and 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.759
 also the heating off 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.759
 no more 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.669
 after ten hours later 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.289
 as 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.110
 Dr 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.770
 H 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.699
 Dr 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.509
 ca 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.289
 Hofer 20 media 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.750
 we too leave 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.150
 Igling think that went ahead 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.610
 and then I had the title we had also seen 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.379
 Truck tipped the game 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.379
 the most important thing is that one should in future be entitled "Die Die soll 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.120
 Zinos and then you have no more standing 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.409
 the most important 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.249
 and the two men did not tell her 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:36.990
 the most important thing is that they do that 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.729
 so Aussie 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.449
 that is a matter of honor 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.449
 very important 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:47.749
 and tight 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:50.460
 then Graz 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.820
 And most importantly, many also make the disadvantage with distances monumental 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.150
 take the Christians 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.699
 that does not mean September could hurt the night for Saturday 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.230
 wanted to comment 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.230
 There are two variations 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.330
 there is home game Ciolek the first of the l 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.159
 Munich dapd bay 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.290
 that can be done is that's on 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.650
 in understandable 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.779
 especially when turning left to South Africa 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.409
 for the 1st 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.139
 we listen a lot 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.980
 2 to the current status 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.529
 like that 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.529
 that we then nod off plays easily 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.099
 but then only 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:38.389
 the Tea Party Löw of course not here everything going on 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.230
 you have to open again 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.589
 Nüssli Biel fell 

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:44.879
 and they are way ahead 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:48.279
 Remember Duncan's customers 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:50.069
 not such Bisingen said 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:52.119
 so use them 

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:54.169
 now she has this volume 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:55.010
 these are running 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.080
 and what is good 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.759
 the most important thing is also done by many Ettenheim Fich 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.410
 that is then comes with the coast and the title took off then would have the 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:06.389
 Take your hand 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:10.490
 and just so shake I can have a lot of respect but he 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.100
 that made him know what I mean that is almost a bit more relaxed 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.339
 simply by hand 

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:18.659
 or rent can book 

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:21.659
 just having good times and just like Gilbert fights 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.199
 and then there is the beautiful one 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:28.210
 i've never had a problem it was my life i hope i could help you 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.409
 with the day tips and tricks 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:31.899
 and 

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:34.229
 I think I do not do much Wiesbaden
