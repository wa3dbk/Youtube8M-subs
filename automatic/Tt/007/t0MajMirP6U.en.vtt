 To win that everyone expects it 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.639
 submerge 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.320

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.289

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.039
 points now after a final phase of the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.930
 competition yet still go 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.810

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.990
 well i always feel busy so that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.230
 of course to the result of 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.610
 from watching the action the Chinese 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.690
 not once who plays a draw here 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.450
 about 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.100
 I mean back that 's what makes me too 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.289
 well the four wets or four or five and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.610
 t 'are therefore the result and everyone 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.559
 expected doge 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.739
 so i am happy what guys i am 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.719
 last week two made this cat here 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.320
 idea that there is more discharge behind it 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.320
 sat for yourself 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.170
 was very tricky today and we get it 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.820
 don't create that many opportunities 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.850
 when the odds come two and then 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.350
 then we must score when they are like that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.420
 was good to keep a possession of the ball 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.160
 and we dress and couple 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.640
 and few chances but not so big chances 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.680
 I think so yes after the 2nd was a big one 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.000
 relief in practice you were 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.160
 calm down 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.050
 yes absolutely absolutely no stress in the 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.470
 vlog week on max want to the two 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.850
 ones and then those three and relatively 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.160
 Do you know then it wo n't be a one 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.990
 is just as he goes of the 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.060
 opportunities go to welcome 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.690
 yes when one came and was not panic 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.550
 in the team was still half an hour I think the 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.340
 player or more like 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.830
 no panic in the teams was only 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.619
 nice talk lick coach and build 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.120
 now for the first nine to ten minutes 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.030
 persist 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:02:01.450
 1st team in yes yes what is it is beautiful 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:04.030

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.280
 is your moment 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.480
 yes it is quite exemplary but 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.220
 a language becomes good today like that 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.590
 surprising on it 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.270
 they always suffer from me anyway 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.890
 think names stand because he came with you 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.700
 head or ten years with the foot that goal 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.400
 to make 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.930
 luckily that happened and liked well 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.040
 yes definitely been bigger about that says 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.890
 as a soccer player I think the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.360
 matches where this meets yes yes 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.990

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.030

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.630
 this match have the chance to van 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.320
 this match where I of course 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.110
 to liberate 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.200
 Of course I do is can't on one 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.940
 draw reason so no that will be 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.010

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.320

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.200

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.270
 competitions that motivates enormously 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.230

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.230
