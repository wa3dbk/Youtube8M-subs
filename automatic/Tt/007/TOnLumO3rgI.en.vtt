then some shad patterned ones that I
like<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.610> I'll<00:00:50.610> use<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.070> see

it's a football head that they normally

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.970 
it's a football head that they normally
use<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.460> regular<00:00:59.789> jigs<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.559> has<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> bigger

regular z-man will which sometimes good
sometimes<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.810> bad<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.890> found<00:01:20.460> more<00:01:20.759> often

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
sometimes it's bad I found more often

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.670 
sometimes it's bad I found more often
than<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.509> better<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.290> kind<00:01:22.530> of

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
than not it's better because it kind of

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.590 
than not it's better because it kind of
uh<00:01:22.740> unless<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:23.580> fishing<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
uh unless you're fishing in like a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.230 
uh unless you're fishing in like a
school<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.930> baitfish<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.150> gives

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
school of baitfish it just kind of gives

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.030 
school of baitfish it just kind of gives
an<00:01:27.420> easier<00:01:27.750> target<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.350> best<00:01:28.530> hit<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:28.890> don't

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
an easier target for best hit they don't

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.370 
an easier target for best hit they don't
have<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.220> chase<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.579> as<00:01:29.670> far<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
have to chase it as far so they have a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.620 
have to chase it as far so they have a
bigger<00:01:31.590> hook<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.100> it'll<00:01:32.970> stand<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> goes

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
bigger hook and it'll stand up it goes

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.179 
bigger hook and it'll stand up it goes
through<00:01:33.900> cover<00:01:34.200> actually<00:01:34.560> extremely<00:01:34.860> well

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
through cover actually extremely well

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.679 
through cover actually extremely well
because<00:01:35.369> when<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.759> comes<00:01:35.880> over<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
because when it comes over it

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.210 
because when it comes over it
automatically<00:01:37.259> flips<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> hook<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.040> like

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
automatically flips the hook up like

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
automatically flips the hook up like
it's<00:01:38.400> supposed<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.759> uh<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.600> football<00:01:39.810> head

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it's supposed to uh like a football head

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:40.670 
it's supposed to uh like a football head
so<00:01:40.500> you

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
so you

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.310 
so you
I<00:01:40.950> mean<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.220> basically<00:01:41.340> snag<00:01:41.880> list<00:01:42.290> when<00:01:43.290> it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
I mean it's basically snag list when it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.780 
I mean it's basically snag list when it
comes<00:01:43.500> over<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.159> kind<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.340> rolls<00:01:44.549> over

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
comes over you see it kind of rolls over

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.510 
comes over you see it kind of rolls over
and<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.659> has<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> great<00:01:46.320> action<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:47.250> make<00:01:47.399> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and it has a great action they make it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
and it has a great action they make it
in<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.729> half<00:01:48.299> ounce<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> three<00:01:49.079> quarter

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
