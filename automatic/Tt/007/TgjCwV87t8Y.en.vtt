00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.129
 hi guys today we color and build 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.720
 of paper toys as you know me 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.820
 like to go in search of new ideas 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.030
 this is all Italian as you see made 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.270
 in italy realized by two girls who 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.070
 they are creatives and technicians 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.050
 and only illustrators and have 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.390
 thought caspita but we from small ones 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.699
 he played coloring building up inventing 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.469
 and wanted to create this line of 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.989
 totally new games called i 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.149
 magi kart and that uses only the 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.130
 paper therefore also eco-sustainable but 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.410
 of beautiful cardboard resistors for returns 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.540
 make cardboard games that we 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.700
 same we can go to color with 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.800
 markers but above all they last 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.780
 even over time therefore they are resistant 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.450
 we will test them with seven 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.250
 firefighters flying pirate cats do not 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.680
 have you ever seen a flying cat we can 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.450
 do this and then the penguin who runs away 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.430
 from the north pole because obviously much 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.689
 cold so prepij to the helicopter 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.150
 and goes to the lists to sunbathe 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.900
 inside the sets we find the whole 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.210
 necessary 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.580
 we make the opening all necessary for 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.670
 make our toy 03 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.320
 colored markers all parts that 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.180
 we can go poet is simply a 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.369
 detach in this way and then 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.380
 we can go to mount in this other one 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.860
 way or using those that are 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.530
 assembly instructions and 36 parts a 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.960
 available age from 5 to 11 years 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.810
 and here is how you see the assembly 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.880
 we also have a v the truth to be able to 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.439
 let's run our say so that it is 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.939
 one was as true as possible 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.229
 and here is the final result with 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.909
 kittens included let's go to color a 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.710
 coloring as you see helped me 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.170
 nicolò and I also took a marker 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.759
 head one of those you could the package 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.380
 is first started with the yellow and with 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.360
 the blue following a little the instructions 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.860
 which were on the packaging itself is 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.270
 surely I have accelerated everything and 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.280
 campiano di lion and italy did the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.709
 wings outside the wings and inside 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.750
 wings etcetera and so on and so on 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.209
 we have colored all the different parts 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.040
 let's say if we want to find a single one 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.670
 very small defect in these toys 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.640
 of paper the fact that the parts that it is 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.000
 detach from the sheets we say from these 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.430
 little paper squares 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.050
 they come off very easily 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.390
 logically they are made for 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.850
 to break away then try mounted etc. 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.470
 but then if they come off for a moment 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.750
 how it happened that to me how you see fail 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.470
 attacked easily sees time inside 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.239
 inside the 48 and then then colored 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.190
 I am easily advised to remove them 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.680
 after obviously easier to load with 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.019
 all upload sorry with color with 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.120
 all the pieces attached to the 48 and then 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.980
 go and peel off afterwards 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.840
 with economist consulting all the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.489
 instruction is slowly coloring me 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.290
 all those round bits that 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.269
 they will then be used to turn the propeller 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.830
 the beauty of these toys e 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.660
 which are also the dynamics beyond being 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.190
 very solid resistant to states 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.480
 of paper as I told you super 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.360
 tablet that resembles a little 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.400
 compensated is the fact that the leak goes around 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.470
 the wheels of the fire chief who 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.000
 we'll do these too soon after 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.530
 then to a real toy 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.900
 usable as a toy 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.850
 on the other hand here I am coloring with a 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.040
 pen marker of course we are pirates 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.600
 and really delicious cats of course 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.600
 we can color with any typical 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.060
 kind of technique therefore also the pastel 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.280
 there was also the real pastel a 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.780
 large felt-tip pen, thin pen 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.370
 also wanting tempera also wanting 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.280
 the watercolor this because if not much 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.140
 solid toy really quality 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.000
 of the paper is excellent and therefore the color 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.829
 it is absorbed perfectly 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.600
 without altering its consistency 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.549
 so really great also from 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.470
 draw in going to color and behold 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.640
 see you are forming for a plan the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.620
 our plane 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.840
 I'm going to assemble the pieces following the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.760
 instructions to assemble them is really a lot 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.430
 simple it takes a little strength because 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.410
 the takings are very well done 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.290
 precise to this advice to have how 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.210
 you see a plane a nice solid plane from 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.160
 let fly 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.160
 and that I can take with all my 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.290
 hand and then really go to play 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.470
 must not accidents fear no one 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.670
 problem of this kind because it is really 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.070
 very solid from the point of view of 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.960
 structure with which it was made e 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.370
 set aside for a moment they have us 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.310
 played our plane a lot 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.860
 let us now switch to the change of 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.550
 firemen also use the colors a 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.160
 available red , yellow and blue 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.780
 that you saw come out of my boxing 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.190
 of the box then I got help 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.320
 from some of my felt-pen then obviously 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.270
 here are the colors you find in the past 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.920
 of inspiration you can customize 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.050
 obviously the toy with colors 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.540
 which more you like and more you prefer 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.680
 I used these in the meantime 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.470
 package then it took me a while 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.980
 gray to make the firefighter's tank 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.420
 to make the scale etc. the beautiful thing 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.250
 what you see I jumped a little bit 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.380
 when to make a super long video 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.690
 etc. the nice thing is that the fireman 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.670
 then he started driving the truck but 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.530
 can also be placed on the scale that 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.920
 over going up and down then this 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.720
 be mobile to a small small hole 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.180
 the pierced line that she had succeeded in 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.530
 guess where they can stay put 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.570
 our firefighter we also have one 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.040
 swipe cards that you see on the right our 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.020
 fireman who allows us to make him stay 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.240
 standing then let's say make a 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.360
 we say real role-playing game no 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.780
 in which the firefighter values ​​between 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.250
 the emergency drops go up the ladder goes 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.660
 around with his pump turns off 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.090
 the fire and so on 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.710
 and here is the fitting of the wheels well 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.510
 really beautiful these card games 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.040
 however, he wonders as always, write to me 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.660
 below in the comments the appearance 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.390
 next videos if you liked this 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.690
 video i like location and next hi
