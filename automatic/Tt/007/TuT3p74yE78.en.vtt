going<00:01:11.270> on<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:11.689> you<00:01:11.750> understand<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:12.259> well

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.649 

sometimes<00:01:16.070> especially<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.850> boys<00:01:17.030> they<00:01:17.479> need

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
sometimes especially the boys they need

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.969 
sometimes especially the boys they need
something<00:01:17.869> to<00:01:18.079> grab<00:01:18.200> them<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.649> to<00:01:18.740> get<00:01:18.829> them

involved<00:01:19.219> and<00:01:19.520> I<00:01:19.759> think<00:01:19.969> this<00:01:20.119> absolutely

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
involved and I think this absolutely

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.760 
involved and I think this absolutely
does<00:01:20.869> because<00:01:21.170> it's<00:01:21.320> something<00:01:21.469> different

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
does because it's something different

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.230 
does because it's something different
something<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.369> they're<00:01:22.579> not<00:01:22.700> using<00:01:22.969> and

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
something that they're not using and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.219 
something that they're not using and
other<00:01:23.329> subjects<00:01:24.399> it<00:01:25.399> just<00:01:25.549> gets<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.939> point

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
other subjects it just gets to the point

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.820 
other subjects it just gets to the point
but<00:01:27.229> in<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.469> good<00:01:27.560> way

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.950 

we<00:01:30.400> thought<00:01:30.880> about<00:01:31.060> what<00:01:31.390> did<00:01:31.570> children
