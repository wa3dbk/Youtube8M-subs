00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.740
 There are cases similar to Tesla in 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.300
 Latin America as that of the psychoanalyst 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 brazilian roberto who p 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.040
 this researcher like tesla 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.430
 believes that energy is something that we 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.430
 surrounds 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.560
 he says that the vacuum is full of 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.740
 Energy 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.500
 the emptiness itself is energy the planets 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.050
 the human body the matter is not 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.020
 they hold in the universe for causes of 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.630
 intrinsic forces to the matter itself 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.450
 but they would be supported by a 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.780
 energy that wraps in matter 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.940
 two ceased engineers and roberto 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.490
 frascati decided to take the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.010
 revolutionary theory of the doctor that you 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.410
 to practice making a very 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.930
 versatile that uses the energy that is 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.980
 finds in the air and the stuff for 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.980
 its operation 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.460
 the motor that can replace any 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.830
 engine type those that work with 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.930
 speed those that work slow 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.299
 that have high around those who have 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.810
 low torque and always with an efficiency 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.540
 higher 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:21.039
 an engine that will save 70 to 90 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.320
 percent of the energy that works 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.900
 precise 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.960
 what is stopping or preventing the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.500
 engine that is known and receives a greater 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.500
 support for 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.640
 Now we work with our 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.360
 own resources and it is very difficult 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.410
 get partners or investors because 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.660
 there are many interests involved 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.180
 imagine how many interests how many 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.060
 companies how many multinationals are 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.950
 involved 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.200
 it seems that the difficulties that 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.380
 find these researchers always 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.930
 they are the same their discoveries are 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.350
 seen more as threats than as 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350
 advances
