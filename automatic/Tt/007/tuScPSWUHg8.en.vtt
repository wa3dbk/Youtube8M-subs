this<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.579> place<00:01:41.820> obviously<00:01:42.000> where<00:01:42.420> Webber

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
this is the place obviously where Webber

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the car in front of us so we're gonna be

the final turn there and making that
slight<00:02:02.189> mistake<00:02:02.520> which<00:02:02.700> isn't<00:02:02.850> too<00:02:03.119> clever

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
slight mistake which isn't too clever

but across the start/finish line here we

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.869 
but across the start/finish line here we
are<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.649> seven<00:02:08.039> tenths<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> second<00:02:08.789> there

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
are what seven tenths of a second there

well<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.099> nearly<00:02:11.370> look<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:11.910> gonna<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.180> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
well I nearly look like it's gonna be a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.550 
well I nearly look like it's gonna be a
corner<00:02:12.599> cut<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.080> we're<00:02:13.230> all<00:02:13.319> over

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
right behind us here we've lost a little

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.400

went a bit wide that button was gonna

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.190 
went a bit wide that button was gonna
force<00:02:32.190> his<00:02:32.400> way<00:02:32.550> down<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.970> inside<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.660> it's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
force his way down the inside but it's

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.470

I'm not too sure how or why but that's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.240 
I'm not too sure how or why but that's
just<00:03:05.760> how<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.150> currently<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.010> now<00:03:08.010> gonna

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
just how it is currently and now gonna

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.860 
just how it is currently and now gonna

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
stuff now can we get past vertically

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.740 
stuff now can we get past vertically
we've<00:03:29.250> certainly<00:03:29.730> closed<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.239> gap<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:30.630> in

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
we've certainly closed the gap in in

we've certainly closed the gap in in
these<00:03:30.870> last<00:03:31.079> couple<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.650> corners<00:03:32.430> here<00:03:32.880> but

these last couple of corners here but

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.630 
these last couple of corners here but
maybe<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.049> stop<00:03:34.290> narrow<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.890> bit<00:03:35.100> too

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
maybe on the stop narrow just a bit too

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.780 
maybe on the stop narrow just a bit too
much<00:03:35.880> or<00:03:36.470> what<00:03:37.470> go<00:03:37.769> b2y<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.489> should<00:03:38.640> say

around<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.150> final<00:03:39.359> turn<00:03:39.450> maybe<00:03:39.900> losing<00:03:40.319> me<00:03:40.410> a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
around the final turn maybe losing me a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.610 
around the final turn maybe losing me a
bit<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.620> time<00:03:40.709> there<00:03:41.329> now<00:03:42.329> can<00:03:43.200> see<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.350> couple

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620

as<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.299> said<00:03:51.329> there<00:03:51.690> that's<00:03:51.870> pushed<00:03:52.079> into<00:03:52.290> third

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
as I said there that's pushed into third

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.920 
as I said there that's pushed into third
place<00:03:52.950> now<00:03:53.310> behind<00:03:53.670> Massa<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.299> Peter<00:03:54.569> Keller

place now behind Massa and Peter Keller

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.629 
place now behind Massa and Peter Keller
looks<00:03:55.410> like<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.709> front<00:03:55.950> two<00:03:56.160> have<00:03:56.370> pitted

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
looks like the front two have pitted

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.069 
looks like the front two have pitted
which<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.030> think<00:03:57.239> would<00:03:57.359> be<00:03:57.389> Schumaker<00:03:57.870> and

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
which I think would be Schumaker and

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.620 
which I think would be Schumaker and
onso<00:03:58.560> like<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.069> slaughter<00:03:59.370> steak<00:03:59.670> there<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.150> go

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
onso like a slaughter steak there and go

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.599 
onso like a slaughter steak there and go
overtaking<00:04:01.079> one<00:04:01.799> saw<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:01.980> nearly<00:04:02.280> a<00:04:02.370> bit<00:04:02.519> of

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
overtaking one saw a nearly a bit of

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.640 
overtaking one saw a nearly a bit of
contact<00:04:03.000> afterwards<00:04:03.989> as<00:04:04.109> well<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:04.410> luckily

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
contact afterwards as well but luckily

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.430 
contact afterwards as well but luckily
nothing<00:04:05.370> happens<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.209> run<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.049> bit<00:04:07.200> wide<00:04:07.410> there

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
nothing happens and run a bit wide there

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.530 
nothing happens and run a bit wide there
but<00:04:07.829> overall<00:04:08.190> not<00:04:08.790> too<00:04:08.850> bad

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
but overall not too bad

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.960 
but overall not too bad
I<00:04:09.600> still<00:04:10.470> got<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> bit<00:04:10.859> of<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.010> gap<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:11.609> behind

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
I still got a bit of a gap to but behind

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.940 
I still got a bit of a gap to but behind
us<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.720> can<00:04:12.870> see<00:04:13.019> here's<00:04:13.230> our<00:04:13.500> pit<00:04:13.709> stop

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
us and you can see here's our pit stop

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.069 
us and you can see here's our pit stop
lap<00:04:14.100> number<00:04:14.280> three<00:04:14.700> here<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.120> I<00:04:15.720> wasn't<00:04:15.930> too

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
lap number three here and I wasn't too

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.150 
lap number three here and I wasn't too
sure<00:04:16.229> where<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.440> Montoya<00:04:16.739> was<00:04:16.799> actually

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
sure where the Montoya was actually

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.800 
sure where the Montoya was actually
stopping<00:04:17.430> here<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:17.940> we<00:04:18.060> nearly<00:04:18.209> crash<00:04:18.539> into

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
stopping here so we nearly crash into

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.319 
stopping here so we nearly crash into
him<00:04:18.930> multiple<00:04:19.260> times<00:04:19.530> but<00:04:20.130> at<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.120> end<00:04:21.269> the

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
him multiple times but at the end the

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.240 
him multiple times but at the end the
day<00:04:21.359> we<00:04:21.900> managed<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.260> get<00:04:22.830> into<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.070> pits

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
day we managed to get into the pits

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.310 
day we managed to get into the pits
thought<00:04:23.430> without<00:04:23.640> any<00:04:23.940> damage<00:04:24.419> which<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:24.780> good

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
thought without any damage which is good

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.120 
thought without any damage which is good
now<00:04:25.530> you'll<00:04:25.650> see<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:25.950> front<00:04:26.099> of<00:04:26.190> us<00:04:26.280> here<00:04:26.490> that

now you'll see in front of us here that

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.600 
now you'll see in front of us here that
the<00:04:27.340> corpus<00:04:28.330> akela<00:04:28.900> he's<00:04:29.350> pitted<00:04:29.740> then<00:04:29.950> broken

the corpus akela he's pitted then broken

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.070 
the corpus akela he's pitted then broken
and<00:04:30.760> pitting<00:04:31.090> as<00:04:31.210> well<00:04:31.360> slowing<00:04:31.810> us<00:04:31.900> up<00:04:32.020> a

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
and pitting as well slowing us up a

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.120

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
to sixth place here button jumping I

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.620 
to sixth place here button jumping I
think<00:05:30.040> two<00:05:30.370> or<00:05:30.490> three<00:05:30.700> cars<00:05:30.940> in<00:05:31.180> that<00:05:31.210> stops

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
think two or three cars in that stops

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.330 
think two or three cars in that stops
are<00:05:31.840> pretty<00:05:32.110> good<00:05:32.410> stuff<00:05:32.650> there<00:05:32.860> from<00:05:33.070> button

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
are pretty good stuff there from button

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.970 
are pretty good stuff there from button
and<00:05:33.700> has<00:05:34.480> put<00:05:34.720> him<00:05:34.810> up<00:05:35.080> obviously<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.590> good

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
and has put him up obviously a good

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.650 
and has put him up obviously a good
matter<00:05:36.280> positions<00:05:36.790> but<00:05:36.970> that<00:05:37.120> what<00:05:37.390> was<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.630> I

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
matter positions but that what was the I

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.360 
matter positions but that what was the I
do<00:05:38.200> sort<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.590> feel<00:05:38.650> that<00:05:38.950> we<00:05:39.040> should<00:05:39.160> have<00:05:39.250> had

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
do sort of feel that we should have had

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.010 
do sort of feel that we should have had
that<00:05:39.580> position<00:05:39.730> we<00:05:40.030> had<00:05:40.120> two<00:05:40.300> penalties<00:05:40.840> which

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
that position we had two penalties which

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.440 
that position we had two penalties which
I<00:05:41.110> don't<00:05:41.290> think<00:05:41.500> we<00:05:41.560> should<00:05:41.590> have<00:05:41.800> really<00:05:42.040> had

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
I don't think we should have really had

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.640 
I don't think we should have really had
but<00:05:43.450> I<00:05:43.480> suppose<00:05:43.660> it's<00:05:43.870> just<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.110> game<00:05:44.260> it<00:05:44.500> was

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
but I suppose it's just the game it was

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.510 
but I suppose it's just the game it was
it's<00:05:44.800> hard<00:05:44.830> to<00:05:45.070> really<00:05:45.190> just<00:05:45.400> keep

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
it's hard to really just keep

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.130 
it's hard to really just keep
complaining<00:05:45.850> at<00:05:46.090> the<00:05:46.210> games<00:05:46.390> because<00:05:46.810> it's

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
complaining at the games because it's

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.270 
complaining at the games because it's
just<00:05:47.290> how<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.560> is<00:05:47.680> they're<00:05:47.860> not<00:05:47.890> gonna<00:05:48.070> update

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
just how it is they're not gonna update

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.040 
just how it is they're not gonna update
it<00:05:48.640> or<00:05:48.670> anything<00:05:48.880> so<00:05:49.090> no<00:05:49.450> point<00:05:49.810> in<00:05:49.900> really

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
it or anything so no point in really

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.630 
it or anything so no point in really
complaining<00:05:50.590> but<00:05:50.860> I'll<00:05:50.950> do<00:05:51.100> it<00:05:51.130> anyway<00:05:51.580> but
