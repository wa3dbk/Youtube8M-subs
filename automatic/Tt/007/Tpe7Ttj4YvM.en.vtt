00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
situation like this is we will probably

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.700 
situation like this is we will probably
remove<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:51.020> resin<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.409> number

remove that resin that is on number

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
remove that resin that is on number
eight<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.579> will<00:01:53.700> place<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> shade

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
that matches the other teeth or we may

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.130 
that matches the other teeth or we may
even<00:01:56.850> talk<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> patient<00:01:57.719> about<00:01:57.750> doing

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
even talk to the patient about doing

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.840 
even talk to the patient about doing
something<00:01:58.380> more<00:01:58.649> permanent<00:01:58.890> called<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
something more permanent called the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.539 
something more permanent called the
porcelain<00:02:00.299> veneer<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.899> would<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.340> same

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
porcelain veneer that would be the same

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.440 
porcelain veneer that would be the same
color<00:02:02.820> would<00:02:03.540> never<00:02:03.780> lighten<00:02:04.530> or<00:02:04.740> darken<00:02:05.450> so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
color would never lighten or darken so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.089 
color would never lighten or darken so
we<00:02:06.570> want<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> match<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.020> color<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:07.950> would

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
we want to match the color and we would

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:08.419 
we want to match the color and we would
say

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
say

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.309 
say
there<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.909> would<00:02:09.000> be<00:02:09.119> about<00:02:09.299> a<00:02:09.359> 10<00:02:09.659> to<00:02:09.689> 15<00:02:10.140> year

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
there and would be about a 10 to 15 year

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.009 
there and would be about a 10 to 15 year
restoration
