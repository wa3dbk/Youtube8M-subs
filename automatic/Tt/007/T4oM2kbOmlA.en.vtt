bit of a cut fastball of that and I
think<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.449> makes<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> lot<00:00:55.050> better<00:00:55.129> do<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
think I makes it a lot better do you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
never know what you think but uh I think

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500 
never know what you think but uh I think
it<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.699> helps<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.149> that

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it just just just just helps it that

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.799 
it just just just just helps it that
much<00:01:01.070> makes<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> easier<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> read<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.780> yeah<00:01:03.780> I

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
much makes it easier to read and yeah I

quite an extension and a twenty20 so a
little<00:01:55.100> bit<00:01:55.220> closer<00:01:55.400> to<00:01:55.640> my<00:01:55.700> best<00:01:55.940> but<00:01:56.750> still

about<00:01:57.260> three<00:01:57.440> tenths<00:01:57.620> off<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:58.810> yep

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
about three tenths off and yep

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
very to cut and extend it's very small

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.690 
very to cut and extend it's very small
extension<00:03:08.720> there<00:03:09.020> but<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.370> be<00:03:10.400> honest<00:03:10.610> to

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
extension there but to be honest to

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.699 
extension there but to be honest to
India<00:03:11.030> you've<00:03:11.540> kind<00:03:11.810> of<00:03:11.840> got<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.050> accept<00:03:12.320> some

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
India you've kind of got to accept some

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.720 
India you've kind of got to accept some
extensions<00:03:14.260> with<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> cutout<00:03:15.560> or<00:03:15.830> an<00:03:16.160> extension

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
extensions with a cutout or an extension

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.080 
extensions with a cutout or an extension
not<00:03:17.540> great<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:19.280> kind<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.700> got<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:19.880> accept

not great and you kind of got to accept

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.750 
not great and you kind of got to accept
some<00:03:20.330> extensions<00:03:20.840> because<00:03:21.260> it's<00:03:22.220> just<00:03:22.610> such<00:03:22.730> a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
some extensions because it's just such a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.210 
some extensions because it's just such a
terrible<00:03:23.090> track<00:03:23.360> it's<00:03:23.660> just<00:03:23.959> not<00:03:24.140> it's<00:03:25.100> not

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
terrible track it's just not it's not

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.010 
terrible track it's just not it's not
possible<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.610> push<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.209> be<00:03:26.600> fully<00:03:26.750> clean

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
possible to push and be fully clean

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.199 
possible to push and be fully clean
really<00:03:27.290> very<00:03:27.860> very<00:03:28.220> hard<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.610> do<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.090> it's

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
really very very hard to do so and it's

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.520 
really very very hard to do so and it's
just<00:03:29.360> not<00:03:29.540> reasonable<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.930> expect<00:03:30.050> that<00:03:30.320> other

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
just not reasonable to expect that other

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.979 
just not reasonable to expect that other
thing<00:03:30.680> so<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:31.130> think<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:32.030> few<00:03:32.450> cuts<00:03:32.630> loose<00:03:32.870> ends

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
thing so I think a few cuts loose ends

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.390 
thing so I think a few cuts loose ends
are<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.290> be<00:03:33.380> expected<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.830> be<00:03:33.860> on<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.160> track

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
are to be expected to be on this track

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.400 
are to be expected to be on this track
oh<00:03:34.640> come<00:03:35.570> on<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.720> final<00:03:35.959> corn<00:03:36.110> island<00:03:36.320> has

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
pretty good pharma sector good second

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.740 
pretty good pharma sector good second
sector<00:03:38.360> and<00:03:38.720> there<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.650> is<00:03:39.680> then<00:03:39.920> put<00:03:40.370> 958<00:03:41.150> so

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
sector and there it is then put 958 so

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.260 
sector and there it is then put 958 so
quick<00:03:42.050> to<00:03:42.590> overall<00:03:42.920> some<00:03:43.730> quick<00:03:43.880> look<00:03:44.000> at<00:03:44.060> it

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
quick to overall some quick look at it

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.610 
quick to overall some quick look at it
was<00:03:44.390> time<00:03:44.540> dancing<00:03:44.810> marcos<00:03:45.170> much<00:03:45.320> too<00:03:45.440> close

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
was time dancing marcos much too close

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.890 
was time dancing marcos much too close
right<00:03:45.860> up<00:03:45.890> near<00:03:46.160> 244<00:03:46.910> very<00:03:47.150> closeby<00:03:47.420> david

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
right up near 244 very closeby david

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.510 
right up near 244 very closeby david
just<00:03:48.050> behind<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:48.770> that's<00:03:48.920> three<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.220> us<00:03:49.310> within

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
just behind so that's three of us within

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.320 
just behind so that's three of us within
a<00:03:49.700> tenth<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:51.220> looks<00:03:52.220> like<00:03:52.550> first<00:03:52.940> set<00:03:53.180> was

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
a tenth and looks like first set was

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.640 
a tenth and looks like first set was
really<00:03:53.660> really<00:03:53.810> strong<00:03:54.050> for<00:03:54.230> me<00:03:54.320> as<00:03:54.500> it

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
really really strong for me as it

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.750 
really really strong for me as it
usually<00:03:54.770> is<00:03:54.950> when<00:03:55.100> it's<00:03:55.220> long<00:03:55.340> backs<00:03:55.550> rates

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
usually is when it's long backs rates

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.979 
usually is when it's long backs rates
and<00:03:55.910> heavy<00:03:56.030> braking<00:03:56.209> zones<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:56.690> usually<00:03:56.959> very

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
and heavy braking zones is usually very

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.840 
and heavy braking zones is usually very
strong<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.560> little<00:03:58.070> set<00:03:58.370> down<00:03:58.489> perhaps<00:03:58.610> losing

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
strong a little set down perhaps losing

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.030 
strong a little set down perhaps losing
a<00:03:59.150> little<00:03:59.359> bit<00:03:59.480> but<00:04:00.140> none<00:04:00.500> of<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.620> is<00:04:00.769> with<00:04:00.859> it

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
a little bit but none of that is with it

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.580 
a little bit but none of that is with it
out<00:04:01.190> reach<00:04:01.430> my<00:04:02.120> peepees<00:04:02.450> better<00:04:03.109> than<00:04:03.290> most<00:04:03.440> of

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
out reach my peepees better than most of

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.390 
out reach my peepees better than most of
that<00:04:03.680> so

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
that so

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.850 
that so
it's<00:04:04.879> definitely<00:04:05.209> doable<00:04:05.379> so<00:04:06.379> when<00:04:06.709> you<00:04:06.769> can

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
it's definitely doable so when you can

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.440 
it's definitely doable so when you can
I'll<00:04:06.950> go<00:04:06.980> out<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.370> what<00:04:07.909> sector<00:04:08.209> is<00:04:08.329> it<00:04:08.390> we

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
I'll go out and what sector is it we

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.670 
I'll go out and what sector is it we
need<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.599> prove<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.810> final<00:04:09.110> sector<00:04:09.409> Ted<00:04:09.590> the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
need to prove a final sector Ted the
