really heavy-duty high speed you got it

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.080 
really heavy-duty high speed you got it
so<00:00:39.180> that's<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.200> Clipper<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.800> use<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> corded

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
so that's the Clipper I use a corded

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.200 
so that's the Clipper I use a corded
clipper<00:00:42.710> andis<00:00:43.710> makes<00:00:44.040> really<00:00:44.280> great<00:00:44.610> product

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
clipper andis makes really great product

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.610 
clipper andis makes really great product
so<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.539> pretty<00:00:45.719> much<00:00:45.930> my<00:00:46.430> my<00:00:48.320> preference<00:00:49.320> so

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so it's pretty much my my preference so

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.990 
so it's pretty much my my preference so
anyway<00:00:50.340> that's<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> conversion<00:00:51.800> that

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
anyway that's the conversion that

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.930 
anyway that's the conversion that
particular<00:00:54.000> clipper<00:00:54.829> takes<00:00:55.940> interchangeable

everybody see how the teeth are pretty
close<00:04:22.810> together<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:24.100> even<00:04:24.810> now<00:04:25.810> this

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
close together and and even now this

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.270 
close together and and even now this
here<00:04:26.410> is<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:27.550> skip<00:04:28.090> tooth<00:04:28.390> and<00:04:28.690> if<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.770> see<00:04:30.070> why

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
here is a skip tooth and if you see why

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.220 
here is a skip tooth and if you see why
it's<00:04:30.760> called<00:04:30.850> a<00:04:31.150> skip<00:04:31.390> tooth<00:04:31.600> because<00:04:31.930> every

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
it's called a skip tooth because every

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.550 
it's called a skip tooth because every
other<00:04:32.320> one<00:04:32.590> is<00:04:32.800> longer<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:34.240> is<00:04:34.450> for<00:04:34.840> your

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
other one is longer and this is for your

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.610 
other one is longer and this is for your
extremely<00:04:36.250> matted<00:04:36.640> dogs<00:04:36.880> that<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:38.320> owners

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
extremely matted dogs that the owners

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.320 
extremely matted dogs that the owners
just<00:04:38.650> really<00:04:39.100> don't<00:04:39.280> want<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.580> shaved

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
just really don't want it shaved

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.780 
just really don't want it shaved
completely<00:04:40.930> down<00:04:41.340> sometimes<00:04:42.340> if<00:04:42.490> it's<00:04:42.640> not

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
completely down sometimes if it's not

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.610 
completely down sometimes if it's not
too<00:04:43.030> terribly<00:04:43.360> bad<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:43.750> can<00:04:43.900> get<00:04:44.020> through<00:04:44.380> the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
too terribly bad you can get through the

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.490 
too terribly bad you can get through the
mats<00:04:44.800> with<00:04:45.070> this<00:04:46.080> generally<00:04:47.080> you're<00:04:47.230> trying

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
mats with this generally you're trying

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.190 
mats with this generally you're trying
to<00:04:47.650> get<00:04:47.740> under<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.310> mat<00:04:48.730> but<00:04:49.570> if<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:50.020> need<00:04:50.170> to

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
to get under a mat but if you need to

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.660 
to get under a mat but if you need to
try<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:50.650> go<00:04:50.740> through<00:04:50.980> it<00:04:51.100> and<00:04:51.220> brush<00:04:51.370> it<00:04:51.550> out

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
try and go through it and brush it out

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.970 
try and go through it and brush it out
this<00:04:51.940> helps<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.930> can<00:04:53.110> be<00:04:53.200> very<00:04:53.440> careful<00:04:53.860> though

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
this helps it can be very careful though

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.740 
this helps it can be very careful though
because<00:04:54.160> skin<00:04:54.700> can<00:04:54.940> get<00:04:55.090> in<00:04:55.180> there<00:04:55.390> and<00:04:55.540> it<00:04:55.600> can

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
because skin can get in there and it can

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.570 
because skin can get in there and it can
cut<00:04:55.960> very<00:04:56.380> easily<00:04:56.820> okay<00:04:57.820> let<00:04:58.780> me<00:04:58.870> go<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.050> a<00:04:59.110> four

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
cut very easily okay let me go to a four

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.160 
cut very easily okay let me go to a four
