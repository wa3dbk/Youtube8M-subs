00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
 First, the engine has to be kept warm for 1-2 minutes (not without oil!). Before unscrewing the clutch cover, we recommend cleaning the environment. 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:22.450
 Now the five screws in the clutch cover are released. 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:32.600
 Finally, you can remove the clutch cover with gasket. The hot oil should be collected in a container. 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:43.750
 Since there is still oil in the lower gear compartment, the chassis has to be raised at the rear right. 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:53.300
 The remaining oil and the deposited dirt on the engine floor can be caught with a kitchen towel. 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:02.950
 It is recommended to use a reusable rubber seal for the clutch cover. Lightly oil and ensure correct seating. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:29.300
 Then the clutch cover is tightened again. Especially with the rubber seal, DO NOT overtighten the screws. 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:50.050
 Tighten screws crosswise. In this case, the rubber gasket should not be subject to severe bruising. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:04.500
 For all SACHS 504 and 505 engines (automatic and gearshift), SACHS always prescribes ATF transmission fluid (Automatic Transmission Fluid). 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:18.050
 The oil used must comply at least with the TASA standard (Type A suffix A). See also the links in the description. 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:30.400
 The ATF oil may be both mineral and synthetic. For synthetic oil, for example, wear protection at extreme temperatures is often improved. 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:43.950
 Now the oil control screw is removed with a suitable screwdriver. The equipment is recommended with a transparent oil control screw. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.800
 Now the new oil can be filled through this hole. 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:18.450
 So that the oil can be distributed well in the gear compartment, after each short-term filling and with engaged gear and pulled clutch pedaled. 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:38.500
 Repeat this procedure until, after pedaling in a horizontal position, you can clearly see that oil flows out of the control bore (= corresponds to the correct oil level). 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:54.850
 Then the oil control screw can be turned back in (do not over tighten). 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 Finally, only a test drive must be made and the oil level to be checked again in the horizontal state. A good success wishes www.technik-ostfriese.com!
