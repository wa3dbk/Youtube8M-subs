 40 minutes passed I got our cake out 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.459
 ovens 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:38.379
 that's what we got now 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.480
 from above I will coat it with icing on 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:45.629
 making the glaze as small 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.629
 stewpan pour 3 tablespoons of cocoa 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:54.459

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.489
 azure already boiling add here 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.650
 a piece but consistently 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.650
 somewhere in frame 40 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.810
 butter will give our glaze so glossy 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.810
 brilliance 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.480
 eye mix all the time well 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.480
 so that there are no lumps 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.570
 our icing is ready to leave to cool 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.880
 up to such a warm consist and how our 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:04.240
 I put the cake cool on top 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:06.760
 icing is best done here 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.840
 silicone brush she is very good 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:15.600
 distributes over the surface and especially 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.600
 well do it from the sides of the cake 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.870

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.480
