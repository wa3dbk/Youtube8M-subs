the beard got the Hat is got the suit he
actually<00:01:21.990> looks<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.350> Abe<00:01:22.590> Lincoln<00:01:22.619> killing

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
actually looks like Abe Lincoln killing

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
actually looks like Abe Lincoln killing
vampires<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.909> sounds<00:01:24.330> cool<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
vampires that sounds cool but for the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.240 
vampires that sounds cool but for the
first<00:01:25.259> half<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.650> movie<00:01:25.860> even<00:01:25.890> though<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
first half of the movie even though the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.039 
first half of the movie even though the
action<00:01:26.700> was<00:01:26.939> there<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.450> everything<00:01:27.810> it's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
action was there and everything it's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.719 
action was there and everything it's
still<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.500> was<00:01:28.619> just<00:01:28.799> really<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.070> guy<00:01:29.340> cuz<00:01:29.640> he

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
still it was just really a guy cuz he

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.399 
still it was just really a guy cuz he
looked<00:01:29.909> nothing<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.509> Abe<00:01:30.840> Lincoln<00:01:30.960> until

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
looked nothing like Abe Lincoln until

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.690 
looked nothing like Abe Lincoln until
the<00:01:31.470> last<00:01:31.680> half<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> film<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.610> was

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the last half of the film and so it was

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.550 
the last half of the film and so it was
really<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.150> guy<00:01:33.329> killing<00:01:33.659> vampires<00:01:33.869> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
really just a guy killing vampires so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
really just a guy killing vampires so
for<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.310> didn't<00:01:35.549> get<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.790> see<00:01:36.030> Abe

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
for me I really didn't get to see Abe

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.050 
for me I really didn't get to see Abe
good<00:01:37.170> old<00:01:37.350> Honest<00:01:37.740> Abe<00:01:37.890> killing<00:01:38.400> vamps<00:01:38.729> until

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
good old Honest Abe killing vamps until

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
good old Honest Abe killing vamps until
the<00:01:39.329> finale<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> movie<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.680> really

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
the finale of the movie really I really

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.380 
the finale of the movie really I really
thought<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:41.579> was<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.970> potential

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
thought there was a lot of potential

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
thought there was a lot of potential
with<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.780> movie<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:43.680> good<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130

with this movie to be really good and
this<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.729> could<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:45.149> go<00:01:45.390> both<00:01:45.659> ways

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
this one we could really go both ways

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.240 
this one we could really go both ways

problem I have of the movie it's just
the<00:02:39.470> fact<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:39.740> they<00:02:39.890> took<00:02:40.070> it<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:40.550> seriously

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
the fact that they took it so seriously

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.270 
the fact that they took it so seriously
and<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:41.810> just<00:02:42.080> sucked<00:02:42.470> all<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.709> life<00:02:42.890> out<00:02:43.220> of

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
and it just sucked all the life out of

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.650 
and it just sucked all the life out of
this<00:02:43.459> movie<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.880> could<00:02:44.060> have<00:02:44.180> been<00:02:44.300> there<00:02:44.510> it

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
this movie that could have been there it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.570 
this movie that could have been there it
should<00:02:44.840> have<00:02:44.930> been<00:02:45.020> pulpy<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:45.770> fun<00:02:46.310> and

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
should have been pulpy and fun and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.010 
should have been pulpy and fun and
entertaining<00:02:47.060> if<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.360> go<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:47.660> movie<00:02:47.840> and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
entertaining if you go to this movie and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.810 
entertaining if you go to this movie and
you<00:02:48.080> just<00:02:48.260> want<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.530> see<00:02:48.740> some<00:02:48.980> bloody<00:02:49.280> vampire

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
you just want to see some bloody vampire

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.410 
you just want to see some bloody vampire
deaths

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
deaths

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.030 
deaths
you'll<00:02:50.900> get<00:02:51.080> that<00:02:51.290> for<00:02:51.530> sure<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.920> it's

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
you'll get that for sure that it's

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.350 
you'll get that for sure that it's
definitely<00:02:52.459> in<00:02:52.520> this<00:02:52.670> movie<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.120> think

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
definitely in this movie I think

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.270 
definitely in this movie I think
Benjamin<00:02:53.840> Walker<00:02:54.050> does<00:02:54.320> good<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.680> Abe<00:02:54.860> Lincoln

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
Benjamin Walker does good is Abe Lincoln

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.830 
Benjamin Walker does good is Abe Lincoln
but<00:02:55.550> for<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.760> most<00:02:55.910> part<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.360> writing<00:02:56.720> in

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
but for the most part the writing in

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.390 
but for the most part the writing in
this<00:02:56.989> movie<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.590> way<00:02:57.620> that<00:02:57.950> they<00:02:58.070> set<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
this movie and the way that they set the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.400 
this movie and the way that they set the
tone<00:02:58.550> for<00:02:59.000> everything<00:02:59.270> just<00:02:59.660> really<00:03:00.080> sucked

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410
