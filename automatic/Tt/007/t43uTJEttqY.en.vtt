option unfortunately the back end is 60
inches<00:00:56.530> wide<00:00:56.590> so<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.040> should<00:00:57.220> accommodate<00:00:57.730> for

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
inches wide so it should accommodate for

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.360 
inches wide so it should accommodate for
three<00:00:58.210> twenty<00:00:58.510> inch<00:00:58.630> pads<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.920> length<00:01:00.190> is

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
three twenty inch pads the length is

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.090 
three twenty inch pads the length is

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
about 87 inches long in the interior and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.139 
about 87 inches long in the interior and
66<00:01:03.850> inches<00:01:04.180> wide<00:01:04.809> by<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.649> door<00:01:05.979> so<00:01:06.700> it's<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.939> bit

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
66 inches wide by the door so it's a bit

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.270 
66 inches wide by the door so it's a bit
smaller<00:01:07.539> than<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.810> flight<00:01:08.079> creek<00:01:08.409> you<00:01:09.130> need

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
smaller than the flight creek you need

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.929 
smaller than the flight creek you need
to<00:01:09.369> lose<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.700> couple<00:01:10.030> inches<00:01:10.179> it<00:01:10.570> is<00:01:11.409> 44<00:01:11.890> inches

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
to lose a couple inches it is 44 inches

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.940 
to lose a couple inches it is 44 inches
in<00:01:12.939> Headroom<00:01:13.719> or<00:01:13.929> height<00:01:14.259> so<00:01:14.499> it<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.679> taller

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
in Headroom or height so it is taller

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.399 
in Headroom or height so it is taller
than<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.249> pykrete<00:01:15.899> flight<00:01:16.899> crickets<00:01:17.229> some

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
than the pykrete flight crickets some

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.859 
than the pykrete flight crickets some
flurries<00:01:17.649> he<00:01:18.009> has<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.159> much<00:01:19.030> larger<00:01:19.240> vegetable

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
flurries he has a much larger vegetable

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.099 
flurries he has a much larger vegetable
and<00:01:20.140> squirt<00:01:20.530> top<00:01:20.799> so<00:01:21.009> you<00:01:21.130> have<00:01:21.249> more<00:01:21.850> Headroom

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
and squirt top so you have more Headroom

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:25.080 
and squirt top so you have more Headroom
altogether<00:01:23.189> now<00:01:24.189> they<00:01:24.310> do<00:01:24.369> have<00:01:24.460> this<00:01:24.850> really

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
altogether now they do have this really

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.709 
altogether now they do have this really
cool<00:01:26.130> colossal<00:01:27.130> vent<00:01:27.369> system<00:01:27.789> by<00:01:27.939> don't<00:01:28.179> see

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
cool colossal vent system by don't see

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.139 
cool colossal vent system by don't see
very<00:01:28.929> often<00:01:29.170> I<00:01:29.590> can<00:01:30.579> see<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.729> lot<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:30.999> guys

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
very often I can see a lot of guys

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.599 
very often I can see a lot of guys
modifying<00:01:31.719> this<00:01:31.869> eventually<00:01:32.439> as<00:01:32.679> for<00:01:33.520> their

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
modifying this eventually as for their

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.340 
modifying this eventually as for their
wood-burning<00:01:33.880> stoves<00:01:34.299> for<00:01:34.630> smoke<00:01:34.869> stacks<00:01:35.170> or

wood-burning stoves for smoke stacks or

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.840 
wood-burning stoves for smoke stacks or
something<00:01:35.619> like<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.979> probably<00:01:36.429> adds<00:01:36.759> a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
something like that probably adds a

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.919 
something like that probably adds a
little<00:01:36.969> bit<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.179> weight<00:01:37.299> to<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.509> tent<00:01:37.749> but

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
little bit of weight to the tent but

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:39.929 
little bit of weight to the tent but
it's<00:01:38.020> actually<00:01:38.289> still<00:01:38.439> pretty<00:01:38.740> cool<00:01:39.009> I<00:01:39.310> don't

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
it's actually still pretty cool I don't

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.300 
it's actually still pretty cool I don't
think<00:01:40.179> I'll<00:01:40.270> ever<00:01:40.329> use<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:40.810> but<00:01:41.590> most<00:01:42.069> of<00:01:42.189> them

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
think I'll ever use it but most of them

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.660 
think I'll ever use it but most of them
a<00:01:43.020> let's<00:01:44.020> get<00:01:44.170> into<00:01:44.499> the<00:01:44.709> connecting<00:01:45.310> points
