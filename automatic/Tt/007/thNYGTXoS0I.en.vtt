00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.660
 ah 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.630
 and thanks to I win like so now we have 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.750
 always an interesting topic to talk about 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.820
 of ganoderma lucidum remember that the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.189
 ganoderma lucidum has many 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.300
 properties that helps us also like 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.250
 in basic form to the immune system 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.590
 with a sachet of coffee that you can 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.020
 use daily you can also 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.650
 do prevention and you can stimulate and 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.440
 strengthen your immune system but 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.500
 now specifically we're going to talk about 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.540
 the anti-tumor capacity the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.940
 won the one that is from the 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.400
 ganoderma lucidum let's remember that he 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.500
 he won derma hint one of the things that 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.580
 does so that it can be an effect 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.970
 antitumor is that it is a mechanism of 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.850
 anti angiogenic action what does it mean 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.220
 that so that a tumor has life for 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.130
 that a tumor grows so that a cancer 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.770
 develop and evolve as the tumor 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.390
 needs to feed through new 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.770
 blood vessels 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.119
 that's called angiogenesis training 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.149
 and blood vessels is called angiogenesis 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.390
 then the ganoderma lucidum has a 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.329
 anti angiogenic mechanism what does it mean 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.990
 this is going to destroy that new 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.329
 formation of blood vessels to the tumor 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.459
 it is taking away life precisely 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.860
 because as you are destroying your 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.259
 feeding through the blood then 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.259
 then the tumor decreases 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.049
 size this is an anti process 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.599
 angiogenic that works excellent to 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.530
 level of any tissue or organ 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:02.439
 affected with cancer cells this is 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.799
 called cellular apoptosis which means 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.229
 cell death by an anti mechanism 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.810
 angiogenic and this is another of the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.170
 capabilities that fuck us the ganoderma 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.380
 lucidum through won the t won 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.299
 like us we can take an envelope of 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.730
 won beats every day by way of 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.650
 prevention because remember that also 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 stimulates the production of cells 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.650
 killers at the system level 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.409
 immunological 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.689
 between the killer cells or the cell 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.750
 killer of the immune system and the 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.849
 capacity that has anti-angiogenic 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.519
 then we are preventing the 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.220
 tumor formation or the development of 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.959
 a cancerous process but those 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.720
 patients who have already been diagnosed 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.420
 with a cancer because they can also be 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.540
 help with your therapy together 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.760
 radiotherapy chemotherapy remember 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.609
 what are these types of therapies for 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.769
 cancer are very aggressive and what 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.810
 they do is also depress the system 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.180
 immunological in addition to the effects 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.459
 secondary that is all this kind of 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.829
 therapies gives us depending on the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.930
 patient's condition with cancer 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.000
 to decide how many coffee envelopes 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.120
 can take a day that can be between 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.280
 three and six envelopes a day this is going to 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.840
 help the patient to decrease 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.310
 Side effects that are 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.680
 producing chemotherapy and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.709
 radiotherapy such as the fall of 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.129
 hair fall from the nails pain 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.500
 nausea vomiting head and weakness of his 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.010
 immune system what are we going to 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.260
 do 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.900
 won late with won live with won of weapon 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.569
 illusion is that we will provide you more 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.939
 production of cell lymphocytes 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.560
 killer of lymphocytes b we are going to 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.459
 strengthen the system in general 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.439
 immunological 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.000
 but also remember that we are going to 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.280
 decrease side effects 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.430
 then of chemo and radiotherapy 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.030
 but also let's provide that 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.760
 anti angiogenic capacity that has the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.579
 ganoderma lucidum and that already studies 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.799
 scientists verify that this gives very 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.769
 good results especially in 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:12.370
 breast cancer cancer prostate cancer 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.859
 of lung among others so giving life 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.750
 is providing us with an opportunity 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.840
 so that we can prevent 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.660
 also the tumor formation cited 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.610
 level prostate at the breast level 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.320
 pulmonary etcetera 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.720
 won live then it is an option 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.190
 excellent to prevent but also 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.860
 to help all those patients 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.940
 who have serious problems 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.039
 degenerative in any of the 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.289
 systems and well we continue with 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.219
 more interesting topics 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.219
 we come back already 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:44.219
 two
