using actually the the nib was broken so

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.760 
using actually the the nib was broken so
it<00:01:54.149> took<00:01:54.360> forever<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.899> fill<00:01:55.170> everything<00:01:55.439> in

more<00:02:05.350> purple<00:02:05.799> both<00:02:06.549> of<00:02:06.729> them<00:02:06.909> ran<00:02:07.420> out<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.840> ink

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
more purple both of them ran out of ink

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.830 
more purple both of them ran out of ink
as<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.950> was<00:02:09.099> working<00:02:09.280> on<00:02:09.580> them<00:02:09.849> so<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.330> ended<00:02:10.750> up

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
as I was working on them so I ended up

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.490 
as I was working on them so I ended up
coming<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.680> with<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.660> I'm<00:02:13.660> not<00:02:14.110> sure<00:02:14.260> what<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
coming in with a I'm not sure what the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.780 
coming in with a I'm not sure what the
color<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.830> off<00:02:14.950> at<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.130> top<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.400> my<00:02:15.520> head<00:02:15.760> I

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
color is off at the top of my head I

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.580 
color is off at the top of my head I
will<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.270> that<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.050> description<00:02:17.290> box

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
will have that in the description box

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.970 
will have that in the description box
below<00:02:17.709> but<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.760> kind<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:20.489> don't<00:02:21.489> know<00:02:22.980> cream

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
below but it kind of I don't know cream

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.610 
below but it kind of I don't know cream
color<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:25.120> kind<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.510> blend<00:02:25.840> things<00:02:26.200> out<00:02:26.410> to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
color to kind of blend things out to

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.180 
color to kind of blend things out to
kind<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:26.920> try<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.450> make<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.810> colors<00:02:29.470> last<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
kind of try and make the colors last a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.140 
kind of try and make the colors last a
little<00:02:30.459> bit<00:02:30.580> longer<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:32.380> then<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:33.099> went<00:02:33.519> in<00:02:33.819> and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
little bit longer and then I went in and

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.020 
little bit longer and then I went in and
added<00:02:34.420> some<00:02:35.040> variations<00:02:36.040> on<00:02:36.250> these<00:02:36.700> scales

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
added some variations on these scales

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.699 
added some variations on these scales
and<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.420> tails<00:02:37.720> because<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:38.170> wanted<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.470> have<00:02:38.650> a

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
and the tails because I wanted to have a

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.140 
and the tails because I wanted to have a
gradient<00:02:39.040> effect<00:02:39.250> but<00:02:39.670> then<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.819> thought<00:02:40.060> it

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
gradient effect but then I thought it

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.580 
gradient effect but then I thought it
would<00:02:40.269> be<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.420> little<00:02:40.720> bit<00:02:40.870> cooler<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.380> have

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
would be a little bit cooler to have

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.580 
would be a little bit cooler to have
that<00:02:41.860> cool<00:02:42.160> fish<00:02:42.610> scale<00:02:43.480> effect<00:02:44.350> where

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
that cool fish scale effect where

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.830 
that cool fish scale effect where
there's<00:02:44.860> slight<00:02:45.400> different<00:02:45.910> colors<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:46.510> some

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
there's slight different colors on some

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.140 
there's slight different colors on some
of<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.080> scales<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:48.069> was<00:02:48.190> pretty<00:02:48.280> fun<00:02:48.400> I'm

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
of the scales so that was pretty fun I'm

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.710 
of the scales so that was pretty fun I'm
again<00:02:49.569> with<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.440> blue<00:02:51.430> water<00:02:51.880> here<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.269> did<00:02:52.510> cut

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
again with the blue water here I did cut

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.680 
again with the blue water here I did cut
out<00:02:52.840> some<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.350> footer<00:02:53.680> in<00:02:54.100> between<00:02:55.000> so

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
out some of the footer in between so

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.780 
out some of the footer in between so
that<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:56.170> didn't<00:02:56.440> have<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.799> see<00:02:57.069> me<00:02:57.310> filling

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
that you didn't have to see me filling

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.140 
that you didn't have to see me filling
all<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.180> boring<00:02:58.569> blue<00:02:59.290> space<00:02:59.709> here<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.370> then

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
all this boring blue space here and then

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.910 
all this boring blue space here and then
after<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.930> finished<00:03:01.989> as<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.530> thought<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.830> looked

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
after I finished as I thought it looked

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.229 
after I finished as I thought it looked
a<00:03:03.069> little<00:03:03.489> bit<00:03:04.120> plain<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.709> decided<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.310> come

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
a little bit plain so I decided to come

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.150 
a little bit plain so I decided to come
back<00:03:07.420> in<00:03:07.720> with<00:03:08.349> some<00:03:08.950> darker<00:03:09.609> blue<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:09.970> add<00:03:10.570> a

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
back in with some darker blue and add a

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.940 
back in with some darker blue and add a
gradient<00:03:12.160> outline<00:03:12.970> around<00:03:13.180> everything<00:03:13.959> and

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
gradient outline around everything and

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.979 
gradient outline around everything and
again<00:03:15.130> this<00:03:15.430> is<00:03:15.609> another<00:03:15.820> area<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.299> I<00:03:16.690> cut

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
again this is another area that I cut

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.390 
again this is another area that I cut
out<00:03:17.019> a<00:03:17.170> lot<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> footage<00:03:17.859> because<00:03:18.040> this

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
out a lot of the footage because this

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.539 
out a lot of the footage because this
took<00:03:18.670> forever<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:20.290> do<00:03:20.620> because<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.400> know<00:03:21.430> I

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
took forever to do because you know I

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.060 
took forever to do because you know I
would<00:03:21.820> go<00:03:21.940> in<00:03:22.150> with<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:23.440> color<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.920> then<00:03:24.010> I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
would go in with the color and then I

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.920 
would go in with the color and then I
would<00:03:24.250> come<00:03:24.430> back<00:03:24.700> with<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:25.299> base<00:03:25.570> color

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
would come back with the base color

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.440 
would come back with the base color
which<00:03:26.109> I<00:03:26.200> used<00:03:26.380> for<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.739> blue<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:28.030> would

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
which I used for the blue and I would

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.210 
which I used for the blue and I would
blend<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.290> then<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.440> would<00:03:29.650> come<00:03:29.829> in<00:03:29.950> again

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
blend it and then I would come in again

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.250 
blend it and then I would come in again
and<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:30.640> just<00:03:31.329> back<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.870> forth<00:03:32.019> it<00:03:32.140> took

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
and I just back and forth it took

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.979 
and I just back and forth it took
forever<00:03:32.709> but<00:03:33.040> I'm<00:03:33.549> really<00:03:33.970> happy<00:03:34.150> with<00:03:34.420> how<00:03:34.480> it

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
forever but I'm really happy with how it

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.770 
forever but I'm really happy with how it
looks<00:03:35.530> in<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:35.890> or<00:03:36.400> turned<00:03:36.670> out<00:03:36.850> in<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.030> end<00:03:37.120> so

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
looks in the or turned out in the end so

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.420 
looks in the or turned out in the end so
you<00:03:38.709> know<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:38.890> don't<00:03:39.400> mind<00:03:40.799> it's<00:03:41.799> a<00:03:41.980> little<00:03:42.280> bit

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
you know I don't mind it's a little bit

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.620 
you know I don't mind it's a little bit
boring<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.880> watch<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:45.069> then<00:03:45.519> I<00:03:45.880> tried<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.390> keep

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
boring to watch and then I tried to keep

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.080 
boring to watch and then I tried to keep
like<00:03:47.049> I<00:03:47.200> said<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.500> wanted<00:03:48.130> to<00:03:48.250> keep<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.609> girls<00:03:48.940> a

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
like I said I wanted to keep the girls a

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.039 
like I said I wanted to keep the girls a
little<00:03:49.209> bit<00:03:49.450> warmer<00:03:50.410> so<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.549> went<00:03:51.940> on<00:03:52.150> with<00:03:52.359> the

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
little bit warmer so I went on with the

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.280 
little bit warmer so I went on with the
warm<00:03:53.260> top<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.160> then<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:54.970> decided<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:56.230> would

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
warm top and then I decided that I would

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.390 
warm top and then I decided that I would
keep<00:03:56.799> all<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.459> fish<00:03:57.790> a<00:03:58.139> more<00:03:59.139> purple<00:04:00.040> color

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
keep all of the fish a more purple color

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.180 
keep all of the fish a more purple color
which<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.819> will<00:04:01.209> see<00:04:01.450> here<00:04:01.810> in<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.079> second<00:04:02.709> as<00:04:02.950> I

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
which you will see here in a second as I

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.470 
which you will see here in a second as I
go<00:04:03.609> and<00:04:03.940> fill<00:04:04.510> in<00:04:04.930> all<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.440> fish<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.670> guess

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
go and fill in all of the fish I guess

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.479 
go and fill in all of the fish I guess
here<00:04:07.840> though<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.049> am<00:04:08.560> trying<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.100> add<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.250> little

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
here though I am trying to add a little

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.370 
here though I am trying to add a little
bit<00:04:09.639> more<00:04:09.670> details<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.540> them<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.959> thought<00:04:11.319> they

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
bit more details to them I thought they

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.530 
bit more details to them I thought they
look<00:04:11.859> a<00:04:12.160> little<00:04:12.880> bit<00:04:13.000> boring

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
look a little bit boring

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.370 
look a little bit boring
wanted<00:04:13.780> some<00:04:13.989> more<00:04:14.200> excitement<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.219> the<00:04:15.459> gals

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
wanted some more excitement to the gals

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.860 
wanted some more excitement to the gals
and<00:04:17.380> then<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:18.310> went<00:04:18.699> in<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.389> I<00:04:19.479> was<00:04:19.630> all<00:04:19.840> like

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
and then I went in and I was all like

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.439 
and then I went in and I was all like
let's<00:04:20.799> make<00:04:21.009> all<00:04:21.160> of<00:04:21.190> these<00:04:21.459> fish<00:04:21.729> purple<00:04:22.180> and

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
let's make all of these fish purple and

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.700 
let's make all of these fish purple and
I'm<00:04:22.539> actually<00:04:22.660> really<00:04:22.810> happy<00:04:23.080> with<00:04:23.350> how<00:04:23.500> it

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
I'm actually really happy with how it

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.499 
I'm actually really happy with how it
looks<00:04:24.039> but<00:04:24.370> when<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:24.669> first<00:04:24.880> put<00:04:25.150> them<00:04:25.240> in<00:04:25.389> they

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
looks but when I first put them in they

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.540 
looks but when I first put them in they
were<00:04:25.600> too<00:04:25.810> plain<00:04:26.289> so<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.740> decided<00:04:27.130> to<00:04:27.280> do<00:04:27.520> a

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
were too plain so I decided to do a

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.420 
were too plain so I decided to do a
gradient<00:04:28.210> which<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.780> can<00:04:28.930> see<00:04:29.139> here<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.979> I

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
gradient which you can see here and I

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.400 
gradient which you can see here and I
went<00:04:30.669> over<00:04:30.759> them<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.090> couple<00:04:31.600> of<00:04:31.750> times<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.289> kind

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
went over them a couple of times to kind

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.240 
went over them a couple of times to kind
of<00:04:32.590> get<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.830> effect<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.520> really<00:04:34.090> wanted

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
of get the effect that I really wanted

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.430 
of get the effect that I really wanted
because<00:04:36.250> yeah<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:37.120> thought<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:38.050> would<00:04:38.199> just<00:04:38.229> be

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
because yeah I thought it would just be

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.529 
because yeah I thought it would just be
nice<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.949> have<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.460> little<00:04:39.910> bit<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.120> gradient

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
nice to have a little bit of gradient

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.499 
nice to have a little bit of gradient
similar<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.259> the<00:04:41.560> catfish<00:04:42.370> and<00:04:42.699> then<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.150> wanted

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
similar to the catfish and then I wanted

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.659 
similar to the catfish and then I wanted
to<00:04:43.660> make<00:04:43.870> their<00:04:44.320> gradients<00:04:45.070> on<00:04:45.220> like<00:04:45.490> their

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
to make their gradients on like their

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.980 
to make their gradients on like their
paws<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.150> ears<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.389> little<00:04:46.690> bit<00:04:46.810> more

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
paws and ears a little bit more

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.020 
paws and ears a little bit more
noticeable<00:04:47.680> so<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.919> went<00:04:48.130> back<00:04:48.310> over<00:04:48.340> that<00:04:48.820> as

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
noticeable so I went back over that as

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.870 
noticeable so I went back over that as
well<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:50.169> added<00:04:50.320> some<00:04:50.470> shadow<00:04:51.130> work<00:04:51.490> here

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
well and I added some shadow work here

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.350 
well and I added some shadow work here
and<00:04:52.030> there<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.690> then<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.139> went<00:04:53.470> in<00:04:53.590> with<00:04:53.770> my

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
and there and then I went in with my

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.529 
and there and then I went in with my
trusty<00:04:55.360> gel<00:04:56.050> pen<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:57.160> I<00:04:58.060> added<00:04:58.389> some

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
trusty gel pen and I added some

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.930 
trusty gel pen and I added some
highlights<00:04:59.440> I'm<00:04:59.800> really<00:05:00.370> happy<00:05:00.550> with<00:05:00.729> how<00:05:00.789> the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
highlights I'm really happy with how the

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.180 
highlights I'm really happy with how the
highlights<00:05:01.389> look<00:05:01.660> on<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.349> little<00:05:02.740> fish<00:05:02.949> in

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
highlights look on the little fish in

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.890 
highlights look on the little fish in
the<00:05:03.430> background<00:05:04.000> even<00:05:04.180> though<00:05:04.360> it's<00:05:04.570> very

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
the background even though it's very

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.749 
the background even though it's very
simple<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:05.470> just<00:05:05.500> thought<00:05:05.740> it<00:05:05.889> was<00:05:06.009> really<00:05:06.430> cute

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
simple I just thought it was really cute

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.409 
simple I just thought it was really cute
and<00:05:07.030> that<00:05:07.960> is<00:05:08.349> pretty<00:05:08.860> much<00:05:09.039> it<00:05:09.280> I<00:05:09.490> do<00:05:09.610> at<00:05:10.210> the

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
and that is pretty much it I do at the

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.350 
and that is pretty much it I do at the
end<00:05:10.570> decide<00:05:11.050> that<00:05:11.320> I<00:05:11.380> wanted<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:11.860> add<00:05:12.360> some

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
end decide that I wanted to add some

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.070 
end decide that I wanted to add some
details<00:05:13.720> on<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.990> girls<00:05:14.289> and<00:05:14.710> I<00:05:15.660> went<00:05:16.660> in<00:05:16.870> and<00:05:17.020> I

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
details on the girls and I went in and I

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.379 
details on the girls and I went in and I
added<00:05:17.289> some<00:05:17.470> bubbles<00:05:18.430> so<00:05:18.849> that<00:05:19.060> there<00:05:19.240> wasn't

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
added some bubbles so that there wasn't

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.700 
added some bubbles so that there wasn't
so<00:05:19.630> much<00:05:19.750> blue<00:05:20.169> empty<00:05:20.530> space<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:23.380> I

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
so much blue empty space and that I

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.939 
so much blue empty space and that I
actually<00:05:23.979> finished<00:05:24.510> off-screen<00:05:25.510> because<00:05:26.440> I

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
actually finished off-screen because I

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.760 
actually finished off-screen because I
just<00:05:27.370> was<00:05:28.180> really<00:05:28.479> tired<00:05:28.780> and<00:05:28.930> my<00:05:29.289> dad<00:05:29.470> wanted

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
just was really tired and my dad wanted

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.450 
just was really tired and my dad wanted
to<00:05:29.889> watch<00:05:30.099> the<00:05:30.550> Terminator<00:05:31.449> movie<00:05:32.409> so<00:05:33.039> we

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
to watch the Terminator movie so we

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.689 
to watch the Terminator movie so we
watched<00:05:33.699> the<00:05:33.909> first<00:05:34.180> one<00:05:34.630> I<00:05:35.520> had<00:05:36.520> before

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
watched the first one I had before

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.879 
watched the first one I had before
actually<00:05:37.270> going<00:05:37.419> to<00:05:37.630> see<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:38.139> actual<00:05:38.620> movie

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
actually going to see the actual movie

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.950 
actually going to see the actual movie
so<00:05:39.190> I<00:05:39.400> finished<00:05:40.090> that<00:05:40.240> while<00:05:40.449> I<00:05:40.479> was<00:05:40.570> watching
