00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 You wish 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.880
 To everyone in smap 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.880
 Takayuki Mori 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:18.160
 When I heard that 5 people do TV for 27 hours 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.160
 I thought it was amazing 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.699
 The live is over now and it may be 2 came 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.100
 Just under 18 years passed since I stopped smap 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.310
 That time 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.310
 To said Anna unreasonable thing 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:41.540
 Accept me 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.540
 I really appreciate everyone who sent me warmly 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:56.340
 The last shot in smash and toast at Yotsuya yakiniku restaurant 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:59.540
 We went outside the dawn, and we all turned to the camera and took photos 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.540
 I remember strongly 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.590
 That's it 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.590
 Finally, leaning it 6 people 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.550
 New voice 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:20.990
 I bought a real brother because Shingo when I first met it was really a child 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.530
 There was also a time when I thought it was sassy 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.150
 Much cute 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.950
 But 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.940
 That kind of crazy singer 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.590
 If you look on TV now 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.590
 It is reliable as imposing 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.299
 Great signal 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.150
 Go 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.640
 Naa be a way spoke always best together in changing the Tsuyoshi 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.180
 Even when you go home by train 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:59.970
 I'm jealous that my boss can turn over 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.970
 Drifting or prearranged Baku the air many times in the home 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.580
 Reina I saw only after I quit snap 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.920
 Barat of the Go 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.780
 It was very nice 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.490
 I am taking 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.860
 With that 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:20.730
 I have started to meet a bike 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.900
 It is good as a hobby but it is absolutely safe 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.900
 I was not careful 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.950
 following 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:39.510
 This is the reality of quitting smap and entering training school 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:42.500
 Everyone gathered in my house and bought a head for a clipper 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.500
 Other than follow 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.750
 That's where 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.750

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.870
 Nakai- kun 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.900
 Between Kimura and Go and Shingo 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:02.180
 I used to be in the same place if it was old 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.180
 I think it is difficult to be in the middle 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.189
 However , I think that smap can be done with smap because there is Boro-chan . 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.550
 I will follow you from now on 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.560
 Kimura- kun, you're done 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.530
 Kimura- kun 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.530
 Keeping is often the most number of times that I played in members 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.170
 Kimura is cool from the time they first met 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.000
 It's cool to play with 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.000
 Cool even if you work 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:45.270
 It's always been cool since that time 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.270
 It's amazing 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:55.790
 A word that told you want to be scared if you stop 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.790
 I will not forget it 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.920
 Nakai- kun 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.410
 Nakai Queen teaches the most various things 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.970
 And 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.970
 Was the most bother 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.010
 Not from decided to quit 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.690

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.620
 Thank you 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:46.220
 I've traveled 5 people in Smasma 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.660
 Finally from the sea to the best friends commanded 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.660
