started<00:00:36.660> thinking<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:36.989> little<00:00:37.350> kids<00:00:37.440> in

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
started thinking about little kids in

the sixteenth century those little kids

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.930 
the sixteenth century those little kids
probably<00:00:40.500> had<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> bigger<00:00:40.920> vocabulary<00:00:41.100> than<00:00:41.850> I

have<00:00:42.149> now<00:00:42.360> even<00:00:42.719> when<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.230> were<00:00:43.320> little

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
have now even when they were little

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.709 
have now even when they were little
right<00:00:44.430> because<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:44.760> were<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.000> steeped<00:00:45.450> in

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
right because they were just steeped in

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.630 
right because they were just steeped in
that<00:00:45.899> language<00:00:46.410> they<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:46.980> they<00:00:47.280> knew<00:00:47.460> it
