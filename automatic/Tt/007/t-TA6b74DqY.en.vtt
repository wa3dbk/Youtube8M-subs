this<00:00:55.110> I've<00:00:55.440> noticed<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.280> he<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:58.109> only<00:00:58.379> move

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
this I've noticed that he can only move

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.009 
this I've noticed that he can only move
to<00:00:59.780> essentially<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.020> closest<00:01:01.620> two<00:01:02.579> spots<00:01:03.090> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
to essentially the closest two spots so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
to essentially the closest two spots so
if<00:01:04.290> he's<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> middle<00:01:05.070> he's<00:01:05.610> only<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
if he's in the middle he's only going to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.539 
if he's in the middle he's only going to
move<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.990> spot<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.530> there<00:01:07.920> or<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
move to the spot right up there or the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.030 
move to the spot right up there or the
spot<00:01:08.850> right<00:01:09.060> over<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> course

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
spot right over here and then of course

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.310 
spot right over here and then of course
if<00:01:11.549> he's<00:01:11.790> over<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.540> spot<00:01:12.840> he<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> only

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
if he's over in this spot he can only

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770 
if he's over in this spot he can only
move<00:01:13.740> back<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> center<00:01:14.909> or<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.600> can

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
move back into the center or you can

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.820 
move back into the center or you can
move<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.229> over<00:01:16.259> into<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.890> spot<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:18.830> then

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
move back over into this spot and then

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.070 
move back over into this spot and then
you<00:01:20.189> know<00:01:20.280> kaempffer<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.180> back<00:01:21.509> over<00:01:21.869> there

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you know kaempffer here back over there

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
or over into that spot mathys here there

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.740 
or over into that spot mathys here there
are<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:30.210> course<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:33.090> last<00:01:33.390> spot

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
are there and of course this last spot

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.770 
are there and of course this last spot
you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.140> only<00:01:34.259> move<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.159> last<00:01:35.520> spot

you can only move back to that last spot
or<00:01:36.780> back<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> middle<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:39.229> knowing

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
or back into the middle so in knowing

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
or back into the middle so in knowing
that<00:01:40.259> he<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.560> only<00:01:40.650> move<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.040> two<00:01:41.250> spots<00:01:41.610> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
that he can only move the two spots you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.429 
that he can only move the two spots you
can<00:01:41.880> kind<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.240> predict<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.720> movement<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
can kind of predict this movement and

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.620 
can kind of predict this movement and
predict<00:01:44.009> more<00:01:44.670> where<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> mobs<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.329> going

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
predict more where the mobs are going

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.830 
predict more where the mobs are going
because<00:01:45.840> we're<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.710> Templar<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.000> located<00:01:48.659> is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
gather if there are minotaurs up that's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.030 
gather if there are minotaurs up that's

also I've noticed that about ninety to
ninety-five<00:02:14.610> percent<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.420> time<00:02:15.660> when<00:02:16.379> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
way I've seen to get them to move out is

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.340 
way I've seen to get them to move out is
to<00:03:43.859> get<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.609> Templar<00:03:45.090> back<00:03:45.450> into<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.019> middle

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
to get the Templar back into the middle

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.979 
to get the Templar back into the middle
and<00:03:46.560> then<00:03:47.430> once<00:03:47.880> he's<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.359> middle<00:03:48.569> getting

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
and then once he's in the middle getting

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.449 
and then once he's in the middle getting
in<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.230> move<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.620> one<00:03:49.769> of<00:03:49.889> the<00:03:49.980> other<00:03:50.010> spots

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
in the move to one of the other spots

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.280 
in the move to one of the other spots
then<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.030> harpies<00:03:51.450> will<00:03:51.660> leave<00:03:51.840> this<00:03:51.989> area

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
then the harpies will leave this area

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.800 
then the harpies will leave this area
even<00:03:52.980> once<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.400> get<00:03:53.940> him<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.120> go<00:03:54.389> back<00:03:54.630> into

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
even once you get him to go back into

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.660 
even once you get him to go back into
the<00:03:54.930> center<00:03:55.260> they<00:03:55.470> will<00:03:55.620> still<00:03:55.980> stay<00:03:56.310> up<00:03:56.489> in

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
the center they will still stay up in

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.910 
the center they will still stay up in
this<00:03:56.819> area<00:03:56.880> for<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.569> most<00:03:57.810> part<00:03:58.109> so<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.799> have

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
this area for the most part so you have

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.470 
this area for the most part so you have
to<00:03:59.040> get<00:03:59.190> him<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.459> middle<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.060> then<00:04:00.180> move

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
to get him to the middle and then move

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.160 
to get him to the middle and then move
him<00:04:00.750> out<00:04:00.870> all<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.560> other<00:04:01.650> spots<00:04:03.109> that<00:04:04.109> you
