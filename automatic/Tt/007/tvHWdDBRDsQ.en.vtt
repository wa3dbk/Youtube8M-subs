00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
my advanced degrees that way so I really

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.420

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
been hard to do where I started so it's

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.520 
been hard to do where I started so it's
a<00:03:22.030> really<00:03:22.299> great<00:03:22.420> thing<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.930> didn't<00:03:23.260> even<00:03:23.379> think

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
a really great thing I didn't even think

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.780 
a really great thing I didn't even think
him<00:03:23.709> as<00:03:23.829> a<00:03:23.860> mentor<00:03:24.220> really<00:03:24.400> when<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.670> was

to<00:03:28.150> see<00:03:28.269> him<00:03:28.360> more<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.720> way<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.349> a<00:03:29.500> years<00:03:29.769> of

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
to see him more that way as a years of

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.259 
to see him more that way as a years of
progress<00:03:30.069> it's<00:03:30.489> like<00:03:30.640> we're<00:03:30.819> just<00:03:30.849> kind<00:03:31.030> of

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
progress it's like we're just kind of

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.180 
progress it's like we're just kind of
like<00:03:31.360> friends<00:03:31.750> but<00:03:31.900> also<00:03:32.079> no<00:03:32.769> matter<00:03:32.980> what

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
like friends but also no matter what

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.289 
like friends but also no matter what
he's<00:03:33.340> always<00:03:33.459> a<00:03:33.610> teacher<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.030> he<00:03:34.090> was<00:03:34.120> always

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299

a<00:03:34.390> coach<00:03:34.660> I<00:03:34.989> just<00:03:35.260> think<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:35.739> all<00:03:35.920> about

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
a coach I just think it's all about

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.410 
a coach I just think it's all about
relationship<00:03:36.639> building<00:03:36.670> and<00:03:37.090> I<00:03:37.120> think<00:03:37.150> I

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
relationship building and I think I

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.330 
relationship building and I think I
learned<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.750> lot<00:03:37.930> from<00:03:38.200> Dan<00:03:38.620> Gable<00:03:38.859> and<00:03:39.069> I<00:03:39.130> think

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
learned a lot from Dan Gable and I think

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.789 
learned a lot from Dan Gable and I think
maybe<00:03:39.519> for<00:03:39.760> my<00:03:39.850> mom<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.329> you<00:03:40.959> know<00:03:41.079> anything

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
maybe for my mom and you know anything

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.349 
maybe for my mom and you know anything
