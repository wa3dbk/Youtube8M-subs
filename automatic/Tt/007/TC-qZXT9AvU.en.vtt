00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.239
 although the rise more often than the 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.589
 important support that you have 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.030

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.220

 I can not do it and said all we're going to 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.229

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.259
 Well the truth when it comes out 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.220

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.120
 whipped depends I do not know exactly what 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.460

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.960
 the next next question nothing 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.400
 says roberto walls no pipe good 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.080
 Rafita wanted to ask you two questions 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.550
 that you started playing here and how 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.650
 you discovered in greetings from good 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.090
 aires Argentina as an uncle greeting 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.040
 basically that I started playing with 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.650
 if I do not get confused I think it was with 12 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.170
 years okay I think 12 11 13 already I think 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.090
 it does not make you two years 3 I already have four 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.670
 years the line but if you do not confuse me 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.590
 360 with the team I have already believe that 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.990
 four years I think it was with 12 years or 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.670
 11 and a half six to 30 and let's leave it 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.830
 in 12 years and how to discover then 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.230
 I basically discovered it because I had 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.400
 I would be playing medium not worth it was a 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.250
 little of a quite famous shooter 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.819
 well I used to play in play 2 and well 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.680
 I bought the xbox 360 and I faced 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.209
 and I basically spent the campaign 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.220
 that's how I discovered it and more 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.349
 go ahead then I got into the online good 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.970
 the typical then so basically like 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.409
 I discovered it and well I hope there 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.359
 answered that we ask pass to the 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.220
 next in 7 question that says and if the 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.680
 universe is in continuous expansion that 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.209
 there is behind the universe good is a 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.290
 question that the truth that I do not know does not 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.819
 I would have defined but well I'm going to 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.310
 say behind the universe is the fifth 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.629
 of lcd with office washing that is what 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.010
 there's a kiss behind and it's good 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.720
 answer your question we turn to the 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.310
 next the ones that ask you 10 x and 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.079
 Martin in does not say when you're little

 I wanted to do that I wanted to be of greater 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.970
 well basically when I was little and I 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.650
 Now I'm pretty cool to be a policeman 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.930
 pretty little fireman police 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.010
 even now also if that's two 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.750
 things that make me pretty cool 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.280
 I do not know I do not know what I'll do exactly 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.560
 because nothing tells me what do you think that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.599
 you want to study major plan and not 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.639
 I have no idea that I do not know what to study 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.500
 well here when I have it exactly 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.120
 clear but good that two things then the 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.280
 truth is good enough from small 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.590
 attracts me a lot 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.850
 even now also and well I hope that 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.459

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.709
 next that our friend tells us the 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.319

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.999
 face that of heysel or comment 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.130
 It is worth to leave that question answered in 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.419
 the comments including a question 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.650

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.120
 you leave me another question also new and 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.060
 we move on to the next one that does not say it 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.740
 the things that tells us that three weapons 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.360
 any cost would like it to be 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.009
 remastered in planes three and that 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.099
 are gusts of lakes or would you like 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.560
 take arms watches three souls 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.970
 tide that would be remastered would be the acr 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.060
 of modern warfare 3 that is one that I 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.710
 It looked pretty pretty cool 97 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.320
 also modern warfare 3 that the 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.639
 truth is that it was a cheto I do not know in 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.349
 reality that the visit is also 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.419
 another critical color but I do not know what 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.460
 it also calls quite a coin and the in the 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.099
 94 because it was a pretty good grade and 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.050
 is that I do not know is that also of the 94 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.789
 is that there are many very many waters 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.830
 waters of eyes many souls that I 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.330
 they are pretty cool they do not give themselves 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.979
 much were those souls that I do not know 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.419
 they seemed pretty good and sure there's 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.280
 many more than later I remember but 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.040
 fast because the stories and if they are 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.960
 judgment so I remember is that 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.090
 that three white races would you like 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.430
 have in plan to train me 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.140
 the first rat no doubt the machine 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.720
 war that was a rat that the truth 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.360
 I 'm going to put them all over the world 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.310
 know that that this is it has 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.860
 to be yes or yes because if not those 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.600
 also and good in Cambre is also 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.740
 pretty cool, the machine is very important 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.690
 of war that seems pretty cool 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.060
 in the last question says it lucas 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.680
