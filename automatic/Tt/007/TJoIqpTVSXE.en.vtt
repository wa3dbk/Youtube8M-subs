understand the field at the very

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.300 
understand the field at the very
beginning<00:00:53.020> is<00:00:53.110> squawking<00:00:53.650> up<00:00:53.770> into<00:00:53.950> the<00:00:54.040> left

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
beginning is squawking up into the left

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.220 
beginning is squawking up into the left
it<00:00:54.520> heads<00:00:54.700> that<00:00:54.970> tree<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:55.450> the<00:00:55.510> subject<00:00:55.840> is

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
it heads that tree and the subject is

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.250 
it heads that tree and the subject is
filmed<00:00:56.980> in<00:00:57.730> that<00:00:58.000> portion<00:00:58.390> right<00:00:58.900> there<00:00:59.140> and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
filmed in that portion right there and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.870 
filmed in that portion right there and
there's<00:00:59.380> a<00:00:59.440> jump<00:00:59.710> use<00:01:00.340> those<00:01:00.490> two<00:01:00.670> little

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
there's a jump use those two little

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.100 
there's a jump use those two little
black<00:01:01.060> dots<00:01:01.360> at<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.570> very<00:01:01.720> beginning<00:01:01.990> of<00:01:02.020> the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
black dots at the very beginning of the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.880 
black dots at the very beginning of the
video<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.380> see<00:01:02.650> it

video to see it
so<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.490> squawking<00:01:03.970> occurs<00:01:04.330> in<00:01:04.690> there<00:01:05.110> as<00:01:05.320> it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
so the squawking occurs in there as it

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.030 
so the squawking occurs in there as it
moves<00:01:05.830> along<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.160> treeline<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.600> BFRO

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
moves along the treeline the BFRO

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.930 
moves along the treeline the BFRO
encounter<00:01:09.040> talks<00:01:09.250> about<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:09.550> it<00:01:09.729> goes<00:01:09.820> to

encounter talks about that it goes to

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.140 
encounter talks about that it goes to
that<00:01:10.120> tree<00:01:10.740> heads<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:11.890> that<00:01:12.070> spot<00:01:12.370> that<00:01:12.610> spots

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
that tree heads to that spot that spots

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.550 
that tree heads to that spot that spots
where<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.479> beginning<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:13.960> video<00:01:14.080> starts

drinks<00:01:57.640> on<00:01:58.540> me<00:01:58.840> too<00:01:59.080> two<00:01:59.470> too<00:01:59.710> many

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
drinks on me too two too many

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.380 
drinks on me too two too many
and<00:02:01.860> we're<00:02:02.860> gonna<00:02:02.950> do<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.220> magnified<00:02:03.729> it's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
and we're gonna do it magnified it's

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.730 
and we're gonna do it magnified it's
blurry<00:02:04.720> but<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:04.990> gives<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.229> just<00:02:05.260> a<00:02:05.440> general

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
blurry but it gives it just a general

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.859 
blurry but it gives it just a general
motion<00:02:05.979> of<00:02:06.460> what's<00:02:06.640> happening<00:02:07.060> here<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.810> I

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
motion of what's happening here and I

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.270 
motion of what's happening here and I
think<00:02:07.960> it's<00:02:08.140> kind<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.410> important<00:02:08.860> then<00:02:09.040> you'll

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
think it's kind of important then you'll

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.930 
think it's kind of important then you'll
see<00:02:09.519> where<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.790> jump<00:02:10.060> is<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.250> then<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.610> it

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
see where the jump is and and then it it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.699 
see where the jump is and and then it it
collects<00:02:16.510> something<00:02:16.870> in<00:02:17.019> that<00:02:17.140> little<00:02:17.440> area

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
collects something in that little area

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.310 
collects something in that little area
there<00:02:18.100> looks<00:02:19.060> down<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.630> then<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.870> saunters

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
there looks down and then it saunters

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.009 
there looks down and then it saunters
off<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.769> watch<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.850> arms<00:02:22.209> moving<00:02:22.540> in<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
off and watch the the arms moving in a

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.750 
off and watch the the arms moving in a
kind<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.350> they<00:02:23.500> move<00:02:23.709> all<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.430> way<00:02:24.549> we're

now<00:03:58.389> we'll<00:03:58.510> break<00:03:58.689> it<00:03:58.840> down<00:03:58.870> frame<00:03:59.379> by<00:03:59.560> frame

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
now we'll break it down frame by frame

now we'll break it down frame by frame
it's<00:04:00.280> even<00:04:00.489> easier<00:04:01.230> here's<00:04:02.230> what<00:04:02.379> happens<00:04:02.799> the
