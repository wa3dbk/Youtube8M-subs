going<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.200> use<00:03:40.350> all<00:03:40.530> these<00:03:40.709> bundles<00:03:40.950> because

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
going to use all these bundles because

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.940 
going to use all these bundles because
for<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.700> main<00:03:41.850> max<00:03:42.090> extension<00:03:42.950> applications

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.500 
for the main max extension applications
first<00:03:44.130> time<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.310> did<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:44.610> only<00:03:44.880> use<00:03:45.090> one<00:03:45.270> bundle

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
first time I did I only use one bundle

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.970 
first time I did I only use one bundle
and<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.810> was<00:03:45.900> nowhere<00:03:46.260> near<00:03:46.350> thick<00:03:46.709> enough<00:03:46.920> for

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
and it was nowhere near thick enough for

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.729 
and it was nowhere near thick enough for
me<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.459> these<00:03:48.300> three<00:03:48.780> bundles<00:03:49.020> just<00:03:49.500> seems

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
me and these three bundles just seems

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.210
