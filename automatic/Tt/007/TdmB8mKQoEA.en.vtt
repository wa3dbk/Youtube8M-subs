00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.668
 Here are the projections you have requested for the General. 

00:00:18.565 --> 00:00:19.930
 It's good, go ahead. 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.694
 There was a complication. Burrows and Scofield have been transferred ... 

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:25.811
 &lt;i&gt; I read the newspapers, &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:28.689
 I do not need to read one. 

00:00:29.157 --> 00:00:32.276
 The name of the penitentiary where they are kept is kept secret. 

00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:36.363
 But it is clear that it will be a federal high security institution. 

00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:37.949
 Do not call me anymore 

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:40.504
 before they are dead. 

00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:43.363
 Welcome to Los Angeles. 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.656
 It turns out that men who have fled not one, 

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:48.293
 but two penitentiaries 

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:51.260
 are likely to flee. We must know 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.214
 where you are and what you do 24/24. 

00:00:53.474 --> 00:00:54.799
 Here are GPS bracelets. 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.010
 Equip all of you. 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:58.929
 I do not put that. 

00:00:59.657 --> 00:01:01.076
 Let it be clear: 

00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:04.434
 I am your ally, but above all, your boss. 

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:06.601
 So, if we had to fail, 

00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:09.022
 I have so much, see more to lose than you. 

00:01:09.192 --> 00:01:12.567
 So from now on, you do what I say. 

00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:15.027
 If I tell you to say something, you say it. 

00:01:15.288 --> 00:01:18.530
 If I ask you to wear a tracer, you wear a tracer. 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:40.950
 For the general public, 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.826
 you are being held in a high security institution in the United States. 

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:46.685
 In order to avoid having to explain 

00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:48.979
 and to be spotted by the Company, 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.935
 make low profiles and stay on your guard. 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.582
 You have laptops, clothes and toiletries, 

00:01:55.752 --> 00:01:58.502
 everything you need to work. 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.408
 You searched these guys? I would not want to be stabbed. 

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:04.191
 Who is he ? 

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:07.956
 - It's Roland Glenn, he'll help you. - We already have our team. 

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:10.291
 Scofield is my team. 

00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:12.627
 And Roland has also made an exchange of grief. 

00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:15.630
 In fact, given the security systems protecting Scylla, 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.757
 Roland's expertise will be a necessity. 

00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:21.344
 If there are no more questions, it's up to you to find Scylla. 

00:02:21.604 --> 00:02:23.425
 And for the 2nd step? To enter? 

00:02:23.595 --> 00:02:26.725
 Let me take care of the 2nd step. You, find Scylla. 

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:28.308
 I know where to start. 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.355
 Excellent, Alexander. This is someone who thinks. 

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:36.171
 I leave you to work. 

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:38.898
 Good luck ... to all of us. 

00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:45.118
 As I was there first, I will take the room in the shape of S. 

00:02:48.673 --> 00:02:50.224
 You take the bunk. 

00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:56.170
 When all that's over, you and me, 

00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:58.339
 we will settle our accounts. 

00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:07.160
 We all have a lot of passive here, 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.050
 it's obvious. 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.103
 If we want to put an end to all this, we will need everyone. 

00:03:12.363 --> 00:03:15.690
 We have to work together. If anyone has a problem, let them talk about it. 

00:03:16.174 --> 00:03:18.227
 You have a dispute to settle, 

00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:20.361
 it's time. 

00:03:30.256 --> 00:03:31.539
 At work. 

00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:34.167
 Whistler had to give 

00:03:34.427 --> 00:03:35.919
 this data disk 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:38.046
 on Scylla to a manager of the Company. 

00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:40.396
 Someone he called the "Holder". 

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:42.566
 His job is to protect him, 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:46.262
 to keep it in a safe place. I have not seen 

00:03:47.348 --> 00:03:49.641
 who it was, but I saw his driver. 

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:52.643
 His driver? You plan to do a portrait 

00:03:52.813 --> 00:03:54.854
 and find it among 10 M people in LA? 

00:03:55.114 --> 00:03:58.149
 - It's awesome. - I saw more than his face. 

00:03:58.534 --> 00:04:00.545
 The drivers were hanging out, talking, 

00:04:00.715 --> 00:04:03.696
 but this guy was left alone. Legs apart, hands in the back, 

00:04:04.554 --> 00:04:06.011
 he is a former soldier. 

00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:08.910
 His vehicle was slightly lowered: 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.538
 a private security company. 

00:04:11.798 --> 00:04:13.581
 The shielding weighs down the vehicle. 

00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.041
 His costume: not those we buy 

00:04:16.303 --> 00:04:19.504
 with a cop salary, or by doing the driver on weekends. 

00:04:19.764 --> 00:04:22.132
 This is his full time job, he is very well paid. 

00:04:22.848 --> 00:04:25.802
 Ask our friend Mr. Self to check the charges 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.304
 white men aged 45 to 55 

00:04:28.564 --> 00:04:30.849
 living in LA, receiving a military pension 

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:33.893
 and a 6-figure salary from a private security company. 

00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:37.605
 We will then go from 10 million to 50 possibilities. 

00:04:37.865 --> 00:04:39.606
 I will find who is the type among them. 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.904
 We find the driver, we find the owner. 

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:52.068
 DESERT OF MEXICO 100 KM FROM THE AMERICAN BORDER 

00:05:04.828 --> 00:05:07.247
 We have not eaten or drunk for days. 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.239
 - I do not want to die here. - We're not going to die, Sancho. 

00:05:13.822 --> 00:05:14.809
 We will not die. 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.854
 We must find a "cactus compass". 

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:20.690
 He always turns to the south. 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.393
 It contains a delicious fruit that will fill us the belly. 

00:05:23.563 --> 00:05:25.460
 In addition, if we find the south, 

00:05:26.016 --> 00:05:28.080
 we will find the north. &lt;I&gt; Â¿Comprende? &lt;/ I&gt; 

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.827
 Listening, 

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:38.355
 We will rest a little. We will travel at night, it will be cooler. 

00:05:39.563 --> 00:05:40.814
 Good idea. 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.540
 What do we do once we arrive? 

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:47.967
 in San Diego? 

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:52.547
 Do you mean after Michael paid for all the harm he did to me? 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.353
 I keep thinking about it. 

00:07:04.436 --> 00:07:06.045
 Nice to work with the Interior. 

00:07:06.842 --> 00:07:09.340
 The FBI would take days to gather this info. 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.482
 The FBI should have hired me because I can have 

00:07:11.652 --> 00:07:13.469
 any info in less than 25 min. 

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:17.265
 - Are you a kind of hacker? - I make chips as a personal. 

00:07:17.525 --> 00:07:20.018
 - It's an identity thief. - He's a moron. 

00:07:20.278 --> 00:07:22.728
 You'll sit in a corner and we'll let you know. 

00:07:24.991 --> 00:07:26.970
 It's him. It's the driver. 

00:07:28.953 --> 00:07:31.821
 - And now ? - He leads us to the owner, 

00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:34.449
 and the owner takes us to Scylla. 

00:07:41.904 --> 00:07:45.330
 - You could have left me in prison. - I could have or should I? 

00:07:46.302 --> 00:07:48.963
 - Both, maybe. - Do you thank me? 

00:07:49.223 --> 00:07:50.707
 - I dunno. - Do not break it. 

00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:53.819
 You're here just because we need you. 

00:07:53.989 --> 00:07:54.939
 It's him. 

00:07:55.771 --> 00:07:56.988
 This is the type. 

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.901
 - What is it ? - Private security, it looks like. 

00:08:13.517 --> 00:08:15.223
 It's a real fortress. 

00:08:17.557 --> 00:08:18.993
 Slow down, slow down. 

00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:21.768
 The thing we need to recover is in there? 

00:08:24.686 --> 00:08:26.799
 Motion Detectors, Alarms, 

00:08:27.303 --> 00:08:28.578
 armed guards. 

00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:34.132
 To go in and out of here, without anyone realizing it? 

00:08:34.999 --> 00:08:36.761
 You better have a hell of a plan. 

00:08:39.016 --> 00:08:41.405
 So, basically, it's impossible to enter. 

00:08:41.575 --> 00:08:43.488
 Not in our time and without being seen. 

00:08:43.658 --> 00:08:46.020
 And the neighbors? There would not be a place to hide 

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.730
 Where could we come from? 

00:08:48.388 --> 00:08:51.728
 The nearest neighbor is across the street. 

00:08:52.013 --> 00:08:53.803
 And it would take weeks. 

00:08:53.973 --> 00:08:56.280
 The story of our detention in a high security neighborhood 

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.325
 - will not last long. - What do you mean ? 

00:08:59.585 --> 00:09:01.536
 What if someone learns the truth? 

00:09:01.796 --> 00:09:04.871
 What if we did not need to enter? If this disc, if Scylla 

00:09:05.133 --> 00:09:07.041
 is so important, he may have it on him. 

00:09:07.301 --> 00:09:09.836
 I see here that the owner is Stuart Tuxhorn, 

00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:13.381
 and he is CEO of a company called Spectroleum. 

00:09:13.766 --> 00:09:16.008
 This kind of big fish is watched 24/24. 

00:09:16.268 --> 00:09:18.394
 And we must recover this thing without it being known. 

00:09:18.564 --> 00:09:20.596
 If he has it on him, how are we going to take it? 

00:09:21.013 --> 00:09:23.391
 We do not steal the disc, we copy it. 

00:09:29.448 --> 00:09:31.523
 Now, I'm interested? 

00:09:33.619 --> 00:09:35.278
 The copy will be even harder. 

00:09:35.538 --> 00:09:37.822
 Because it will not only fly, but also make it. 

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.576
 Except you have me, &lt;i&gt; hombre &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:09:43.203 --> 00:09:44.620
 What is it ? 

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.498
 - What got me the prison. - Did you steal a phone? 

00:09:48.953 --> 00:09:51.544
 I committed the federal offense of stealing a laptop, seriously? 

00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:55.798
 I invented that to not have to fly. 

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.219
 It looks like a laptop, but it's actually a kind of digital black hole. 

00:10:00.479 --> 00:10:03.890
 A wireless hard drive that sucks any electronic data within 3 m. 

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.974
 As ? 

00:10:05.234 --> 00:10:09.213
 Like the bank account of anyone who walks with a laptop. 

00:10:09.598 --> 00:10:11.898
 Like the CB code of a card used at the pump. 

00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:15.860
 I can recover identities and banking info of 10 people in 10 min. 

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.320
 Going cool and scratching them. 

00:10:20.145 --> 00:10:24.128
 - And what about Scylla? - If we can get close enough ... 

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:26.954
 they are ours. 

00:10:29.508 --> 00:10:34.436
 Subtitles: www.sub-way.fr (1.00) 

00:10:42.005 --> 00:10:43.012
 This digit... 

00:10:44.475 --> 00:10:46.125
 does it seem acceptable to you? 

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.229
 10,000 people? 

00:11:01.709 --> 00:11:02.990
 - Yes. - Well. 

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:07.119
 Now that you are with us, we can start the operation. 

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.129
 He leaves. 

00:11:19.405 --> 00:11:21.116
 OK, wait. 

00:11:23.563 --> 00:11:26.179
 - &lt;i&gt; Sara, it's me. &lt;/ i&gt; - Everyone is ready. 

00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:31.393
 As I watch the device, I will not be able to see what is being copied. 

00:11:31.655 --> 00:11:34.093
 But, like when we take a porn on the net, 

00:11:34.263 --> 00:11:36.898
 the progress bar will tell me when we can clear. 

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.319
 - Must stay within reach? - 2 min for encrypted data. 

00:11:42.124 --> 00:11:44.699
 - Here it is. - Sugar, yours. 

00:11:57.273 --> 00:11:58.423
 Good luck. 

00:12:05.897 --> 00:12:08.389
 Sir, please get away from the vehicle. 

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.308
 - Speak to me, Roland. - I have nothing, man. 

00:12:11.802 --> 00:12:14.603
 The last time I gave it that much, I was in cm2. 

00:12:14.863 --> 00:12:15.985
 Calm down. 

00:12:20.287 --> 00:12:21.568
 Stay away from the vehicle! 

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.321
 It's good old, no need to get upset. 

00:12:24.583 --> 00:12:27.073
 - Do you speak English now? - Just a little bit... 

00:12:28.669 --> 00:12:30.286
 - And there? - &lt;i&gt; Nada. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:12:30.547 --> 00:12:34.331
 - Try to approach. - More ready, he would be in the car. 

00:12:36.136 --> 00:12:37.761
 I see clearly in your game 

00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:41.004
 We pile, and the rich pay the damage. 

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:46.844
 Give money to this guy that we can go. 

00:12:52.694 --> 00:12:53.850
 Congratulations. 

00:13:02.286 --> 00:13:03.777
 Tuxhorn was there in the car. 

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:05.501
 &lt;i&gt; Did we get it, or not? &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:13:06.239 --> 00:13:07.031
 Nothing. 

00:13:19.972 --> 00:13:21.422
 Can I help you ? 

00:13:24.045 --> 00:13:27.595
 - How did you find me ? - I never lost you. 

00:13:28.668 --> 00:13:31.659
 - This new nose makes me a little sorry ... - What do you want, Don? 

00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:32.848
 I have customers. 

00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:36.059
 When you were working for the company ... 

00:13:36.321 --> 00:13:39.348
 I estimated the revenue generated by their operations. 

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:41.398
 - I was not ... - But you had access. 

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.484
 Stop, the last time I helped you, 

00:13:44.746 --> 00:13:46.820
 I had surgery at $ 100,000. 

00:13:47.082 --> 00:13:49.114
 So either you buy one of these cars 

00:13:49.376 --> 00:13:52.158
 fuel efficient, either you let me go. 

00:13:52.884 --> 00:13:54.360
 I know for Scylla. 

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.822
 I will go get him. 

00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:02.252
 I knew you crazy, but not stupid. 

00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:04.921
 Imagine that I can get it. 

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.733
 I understand that Scylla can only be used with a decoder 

00:14:08.903 --> 00:14:11.387
 hidden in a complex of the Company. I am wrong ? 

00:14:11.647 --> 00:14:13.130
 I wish I could help you, 

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.640
 - but it's impossible. - You're going to help me, Jasper. 

00:14:15.901 --> 00:14:17.635
 It remains to be seen if you will do it 

00:14:17.805 --> 00:14:20.229
 before or after I humiliated you in front of your colleagues. 

00:14:25.805 --> 00:14:27.610
 Tell me where is the decoder. 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.037
 - I do not know where he is. - Anyone know, do not you? 

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.430
 Someone you can contact. 

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.703
 You should not do that, your position in the government does not cover you. 

00:14:36.965 --> 00:14:39.540
 I will try not to get caught. 

00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:43.994
 I do not know what I will do if I do not find something to eat. 

00:14:44.395 --> 00:14:45.545
 We will stay there. 

00:14:46.501 --> 00:14:48.631
 We need to talk, Sancho. 

00:14:49.785 --> 00:14:51.731
 We have to focus on something else 

00:14:51.901 --> 00:14:54.179
 only our empty stomachs and dry mouths. 

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.310
 Go. 

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.224
 Let's start with your favorite color. 

00:15:05.452 --> 00:15:06.776
 What are you playing at ? 

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:08.818
 I'm hungry. 

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.630
 Why die every 2 when one of the 2 can help the other to survive? 

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.950
 You'll regret it, do not do that. 

00:15:15.336 --> 00:15:17.243
 I will abstain from your sufferings, promised! 

00:15:31.298 --> 00:15:33.591
 Why did you do something too ... 

00:16:11.975 --> 00:16:14.801
 If Tuxhorn does not have the record on him, he must be inside. 

00:16:18.524 --> 00:16:21.140
 We have no chance to enter without being seen. 

00:16:21.669 --> 00:16:22.685
 I know. 

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.813
 - So, how are we going to copy it? - We will not copy it. 

00:16:26.725 --> 00:16:28.607
 She will do it. 

00:16:44.055 --> 00:16:46.285
 What are you reading ? 

00:16:46.455 --> 00:16:48.085
 "We can not beat him. 

00:16:48.543 --> 00:16:52.512
 "No power can fight it, all you have to do is run away." 

00:16:53.122 --> 00:16:54.234
 It's Homer. 

00:16:55.099 --> 00:16:58.094
 - It's from the Odyssey. - That comes from my father's file? 

00:16:58.356 --> 00:17:01.126
 That explains why Scylla seemed so familiar. 

00:17:01.296 --> 00:17:04.309
 It seems to me that it is in this chapter that Ulysses learns 

00:17:04.571 --> 00:17:06.520
 that he will have to face a monster 

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:08.981
 called Scylla. 

00:17:09.242 --> 00:17:13.110
 - Why did he notice that? - If my memories are good, 

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.612
 Ulysses learns that to pursue 

00:17:15.874 --> 00:17:17.823
 his way, to overcome Scylla, 

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.784
 he will have to sacrifice six of his men. 

00:17:21.835 --> 00:17:25.423
 His only other alternative is to give up his trip. And he... 

00:17:25.987 --> 00:17:27.374
 choose to make the sacrifice. 

00:17:28.717 --> 00:17:30.674
 A tough choice. 

00:17:33.859 --> 00:17:36.793
 The kind of choice I would not want to make. 

00:17:41.772 --> 00:17:44.016
 Concerning tomorrow, concerning the plan 

00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:45.953
 the cleaning lady, 

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:50.147
 - If you do not feel able ... - I'm able. 

00:18:01.588 --> 00:18:04.980
 Tell me, Claudia Mauricio 

00:18:05.705 --> 00:18:07.539
 is a good roommate? 

00:18:15.036 --> 00:18:16.555
 A good person ? 

00:18:20.134 --> 00:18:22.054
 I hope she has as much at your service. 

00:18:28.124 --> 00:18:30.701
 Shelby, do not you imagine the traffic on ... 

00:18:33.026 --> 00:18:34.566
 You will calm down, 

00:18:34.827 --> 00:18:35.677
 Claudia. 

00:18:36.368 --> 00:18:39.363
 There are authorization levels at the Ministry of Justice 

00:18:39.858 --> 00:18:43.829
 which are inaccessible even to friends as high as mine. 

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.607
 So, listen well. 

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:51.209
 If you care a little bit about your friend's life, 

00:18:53.453 --> 00:18:55.390
 use your security code 

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.840
 to access the prison transfer file, 

00:18:58.101 --> 00:18:59.590
 and tell me where they sent 

00:18:59.852 --> 00:19:02.372
 Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows. 

00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:34.451
 - I hold you? - Thank you. 

00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:35.583
 You're welcome. 

00:19:39.292 --> 00:19:42.019
 What a pretty bag. Can I ask where you bought it? 

00:19:42.189 --> 00:19:44.969
 I do not know, it's a gift from my boss. 

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.162
 I see. 

00:19:46.857 --> 00:19:47.667
 Hold. 

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.330
 I can not find good bags. 

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.270
 I am a teacher, and I have books and notebooks ... 

00:19:54.531 --> 00:19:56.590
 I should squarely invest 

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.441
 in the purchase of a truck. 

00:19:58.702 --> 00:20:01.707
 Yes, I love this bag because it has plenty of pockets. 

00:20:02.864 --> 00:20:05.674
 - Do you mind if I take a look? - No. 

00:20:06.011 --> 00:20:06.908
 Thank you. 

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.388
 Thank God. 

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.809
 Everything is fine ? 

00:20:33.329 --> 00:20:36.229
 Yes, the cylinder head gasket of my truck burned. 

00:20:36.729 --> 00:20:39.650
 - So, I'm clenched. - Where are you going ? 

00:20:40.682 --> 00:20:41.819
 San Diego. 

00:20:42.993 --> 00:20:45.426
 We can take you, if you want. 

00:20:46.299 --> 00:20:48.283
 You do not digest the Mexican of noon? 

00:20:50.348 --> 00:20:51.769
 Somehow. 

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.562
 Like yesterday, right on time. 

00:21:07.104 --> 00:21:09.363
 I hope she has the thing on her. 

00:21:15.665 --> 00:21:18.730
 - Tuxhorn Residence. - Hello, here the security company. 

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.276
 We pick up strange signals coming from your property. 

00:21:22.706 --> 00:21:26.571
 Could you check the windows, to see if the contacts are working? 

00:21:26.965 --> 00:21:29.073
 - All the windows? - Yes Madam. 

00:21:29.418 --> 00:21:31.535
 All parts of the house. 

00:21:32.765 --> 00:21:34.579
 Okay, do not quit. 

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.050
 - She still has the bag? - Yeah. 

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.926
 She has it. 

00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:51.346
 I pick up lots of signals in the house. 

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.973
 Little tricks, a camera, an MP3. 

00:21:54.234 --> 00:21:57.360
 - But nothing of the size we are looking for. - Make her move. 

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.229
 Here, everything is fine, ma'am. Next piece, please. 

00:22:04.494 --> 00:22:05.988
 How's it going ? 

00:22:06.621 --> 00:22:07.571
 Always nothing. 

00:22:11.271 --> 00:22:13.785
 If the disc is there, it must be in a safe. 

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:15.387
 A desk. 

00:22:15.557 --> 00:22:18.664
 Madam, according to the system, the problem comes from a room 

00:22:18.925 --> 00:22:21.439
 designated as an office. 

00:22:21.887 --> 00:22:24.504
 The library ? Sir does not like me to enter. 

00:22:24.764 --> 00:22:27.033
 He would like even less that you go home 

00:22:27.203 --> 00:22:30.168
 without having set the alarm correctly, right? 

00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:32.266
 All right, I'll see. 

00:22:37.724 --> 00:22:39.394
 - We have something. - The disc ? 

00:22:40.133 --> 00:22:42.374
 Yes. The file is big, it can be that. 

00:22:42.544 --> 00:22:44.733
 Hold it for 2 minutes until you finish copying. 

00:22:44.993 --> 00:22:46.485
 Hold it two minutes. 

00:22:46.745 --> 00:22:48.807
 We found the source of the problem. 

00:22:48.977 --> 00:22:51.031
 Stay in front of this window and keep it closed, 

00:22:51.291 --> 00:22:53.241
 the time we reset the system. 

00:23:04.012 --> 00:23:06.838
 - Roland, talk to me. - We are almost there. 

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.590
 Come on. 

00:23:15.732 --> 00:23:16.722
 Go. 

00:23:22.364 --> 00:23:23.854
 - I got it ! - He has it. 

00:23:24.115 --> 00:23:26.275
 Very good madam. Thank you for your help. 

00:23:32.257 --> 00:23:34.867
 Now all we have left is ... 

00:23:37.304 --> 00:23:38.869
 She goes back inside. 

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.538
 - Why ? - I dunno. 

00:23:46.376 --> 00:23:47.702
 No it's OK. 

00:23:48.198 --> 00:23:49.422
 She is out. 

00:24:08.281 --> 00:24:09.377
 Wait there. 

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.179
 I had to slow down to not catch you. 

00:24:19.349 --> 00:24:20.911
 I wrinkled a muscle. 

00:24:23.374 --> 00:24:25.058
 He is not in the bag. 

00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:29.003
 - There is not. - What do you mean ? 

00:24:29.264 --> 00:24:31.048
 He is not there. Give it to me. 

00:24:33.944 --> 00:24:34.948
 And shit. 

00:24:40.426 --> 00:24:41.553
 Twenty six... 

00:24:42.444 --> 00:24:43.521
 Twenty-seven ... 

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.145
 Twenty eight. 

00:25:09.305 --> 00:25:12.090
 - &lt;i&gt; I'm listening? &lt;/ i&gt; - Before Burrows and Scofield 

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.758
 were supposedly transferred to Arlington, their deposit was paid. 

00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:19.026
 - I want to know who it was. - &lt;i&gt; I found: Bruce Bennet, &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:25:19.196 --> 00:25:21.263
 &lt;i&gt; former assistant governor Frank Tancredi. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:25:37.608 --> 00:25:39.991
 - Do you think he fell? - We searched everywhere! 

00:25:40.411 --> 00:25:42.916
 - We managed to copy it, do you think? - Once again, 

00:25:43.086 --> 00:25:46.163
 I can not read the content without having downloaded it. 

00:25:46.594 --> 00:25:49.668
 Unless this Tuxhorn has a TiVo of 10 TB, I think we hold it. 

00:25:49.928 --> 00:25:53.514
 - It does not matter, since we do not find it. - Where's he, damn? 

00:25:54.234 --> 00:25:56.365
 He is still in the house. 

00:25:57.227 --> 00:25:59.428
 That's why she went back there. She found it, 

00:25:59.705 --> 00:26:01.847
 thought it was his boss and left him. 

00:26:02.107 --> 00:26:03.598
 So what ? It's finish ? 

00:26:03.978 --> 00:26:06.377
 Do you know how many months I've done this thing? 

00:26:06.547 --> 00:26:10.082
 - It's not done in two seconds! - The problem is not that we lost it! 

00:26:10.252 --> 00:26:12.022
 The problem is if they find it! 

00:26:13.064 --> 00:26:16.027
 If they discover that someone wants their record, it's over. 

00:26:16.287 --> 00:26:19.656
 How are you finished? Are we going back to prison? They will kill us? 

00:26:19.916 --> 00:26:21.825
 - What does that mean, damn? - The farm ! 

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:26.725
 That means we'll go get him. 

00:26:33.132 --> 00:26:34.356
 A few more days 

00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:37.173
 and we could find a way. But we have no time, if? 

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:41.231
 - No, indeed. - If you want us to get it back, 

00:26:41.401 --> 00:26:43.226
 we have to help a little. 

00:26:43.396 --> 00:26:45.765
 What you ask for involves additional staff, 

00:26:46.025 --> 00:26:48.767
 which is impossible, given the discretion required by this operation. 

00:26:48.937 --> 00:26:51.605
 - You ask the impossible. - No, I'm asking for the skill. 

00:26:51.865 --> 00:26:54.983
 It was not me who put the operation in the hands of a maid. 

00:26:59.122 --> 00:27:01.698
 If the Company finds a copy of Scylla before us, 

00:27:02.362 --> 00:27:03.908
 it's the end of the game. 

00:27:04.169 --> 00:27:07.578
 If they find who is behind all this, they will chase us all. 

00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:10.450
 You are fine ? 

00:27:14.588 --> 00:27:15.406
 It's okay. 

00:27:17.432 --> 00:27:19.883
 I did not choose you because I stopped you. 

00:27:20.143 --> 00:27:22.551
 I chose you because I believe you can succeed. 

00:27:23.306 --> 00:27:27.279
 Many people have believed in me in recent months, Agent Self. 

00:27:27.603 --> 00:27:30.514
 Few of them are alive today. 

00:27:32.592 --> 00:27:35.184
 Can you bring me back the record or not? 

00:27:39.788 --> 00:27:41.230
 Well, here's the topo. 

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.830
 The cleaning lady saw the appliance leaving the house. 

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.408
 She goes back inside for 15 seconds. 

00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:48.578
 So, it's not far from the door. 

00:27:48.838 --> 00:27:51.359
 We need just 15 seconds. 

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.744
 I do not know if we can approach the house, 

00:27:54.914 --> 00:27:57.590
 let alone get in, but let's say we get there. 

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.173
 The alarm that is installed goes off 1.2 seconds 

00:28:00.433 --> 00:28:03.092
 after a break in contact on doors or windows. 

00:28:03.353 --> 00:28:07.523
 The guards will arrive immediately in the property armed with calibres 47. 

00:28:08.024 --> 00:28:10.960
 30 sec later, the security company will send vehicles on the spot, 

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:14.520
 3 or 4, depending on their availability. After finding the intrusion, 

00:28:14.781 --> 00:28:18.274
 they will send other cars and will close the access to the property. 

00:28:18.535 --> 00:28:20.318
 - I do not feel it. - We understand better 

00:28:20.578 --> 00:28:22.320
 why they took some hooligans. 

00:28:22.722 --> 00:28:25.740
 Not for it to remain unofficial, but because we are not indispensable. 

00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:29.118
 Who will care about a gang of crooks found dead? 

00:28:29.379 --> 00:28:30.490
 It's suicide. 

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.913
 I will continue to search. 

00:28:37.802 --> 00:28:39.630
 The quote of the Odyssey. 

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.620
 What? 

00:28:41.408 --> 00:28:43.106
 I do not stop thinking about it. 

00:28:44.233 --> 00:28:45.884
 "All there is to do is run away." 

00:28:47.704 --> 00:28:50.331
 And if the leak was our only option? 

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:55.562
 After all that our father discovered about the Company ... 

00:28:57.343 --> 00:28:59.107
 He may be aware of it. 

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.730
 What I remember best 

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.828
 about daddy, it's his back. 

00:29:03.998 --> 00:29:05.860
 He was always on the start. 

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.160
 He was always running away from something. 

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.051
 Mom, us, himself ... 

00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:13.347
 The only thing that never made him run away 

00:29:13.517 --> 00:29:15.914
 it is his certainty that the Company should disappear. 

00:29:16.399 --> 00:29:18.255
 And we have the opportunity to do it. 

00:29:18.425 --> 00:29:20.502
 So, it's our fight, not theirs. 

00:29:21.257 --> 00:29:23.172
 We are not in Fox River. 

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.134
 They chose to be here. 

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.031
 Do not forget it. 

00:29:29.087 --> 00:29:30.616
 They had the choice. 

00:31:12.597 --> 00:31:13.462
 Ready ? 

00:31:17.277 --> 00:31:18.245
 Let's go. 

00:31:48.408 --> 00:31:49.319
 Let's go. 

00:31:54.576 --> 00:31:57.452
 - Where did this come from ? - On the other side of the street. 

00:32:02.551 --> 00:32:03.354
 Come. 

00:32:29.085 --> 00:32:31.123
 It's coming from across the street. 

00:32:31.293 --> 00:32:32.737
 A team checks. 

00:32:32.997 --> 00:32:35.026
 You can go in, sir. 

00:32:46.696 --> 00:32:48.704
 They must not be at home. 

00:32:56.312 --> 00:32:58.266
 Dad ? Everything is fine ? 

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:12.432
 Thank you, Jim. 

00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:16.446
 Let's go! 

00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:01.154
 Do not go back, 

00:34:01.324 --> 00:34:04.185
 if you want to avoid suffering intensely 

00:34:04.757 --> 00:34:06.747
 for an indefinite period. 

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:11.377
 - Take whatever you want. - I only want one thing: 

00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:15.545
 the answer to a simple question. 

00:34:15.933 --> 00:34:18.258
 Where are Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows? 

00:34:18.519 --> 00:34:20.760
 I only know what I read in the newspapers. 

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:25.141
 3 days ago, there were 105 detainees in the high security neighborhood 

00:34:25.311 --> 00:34:27.978
 from Livingston Penitentiary, Texas, 

00:34:28.809 --> 00:34:31.564
 where the brothers were supposedly transferred. 

00:34:31.734 --> 00:34:33.857
 There are still 105 detainees, 

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:37.563
 and no one has been released since the transfer. 

00:34:37.888 --> 00:34:40.792
 So, someone cheated, Bruce. 

00:34:41.696 --> 00:34:43.734
 I'm trying to find out who it is. 

00:34:45.076 --> 00:34:47.379
 It's not my jurisdiction ... 

00:34:47.549 --> 00:34:50.020
 I know you paid their deposit. 

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.723
 I know you contacted Sara Tancredi. 

00:34:52.893 --> 00:34:54.221
 I swear to you, 

00:34:55.056 --> 00:34:56.631
 I do not know where they are. 

00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:00.301
 We'll see. 

00:35:07.467 --> 00:35:08.873
 Good luck, Teddy. 

00:35:09.494 --> 00:35:12.062
 I do not need luck with friends like you! 

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.530
 You allow me to take this old newspaper? 

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.988
 No problem. Sorry for your friend, old man. 

00:35:21.363 --> 00:35:22.598
 It's okay. 

00:35:24.001 --> 00:35:25.118
 He lived well. 

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.223
 See you, Teddy. 

00:35:43.646 --> 00:35:45.110
 There you go. 

00:36:03.048 --> 00:36:04.089
 Twenty six, 

00:36:05.521 --> 00:36:06.458
 twenty four, 

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.497
 thirty six. 

00:36:52.953 --> 00:36:54.266
 You got it? 

00:36:54.623 --> 00:36:57.397
 Let's make sure we have what we want. 

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.132
 - Do not leave this thing with your eyes. - Okay. 

00:37:06.202 --> 00:37:07.830
 We made halfway there. 

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.473
 More than to deliver the boss and we are made. 

00:37:10.733 --> 00:37:13.643
 I need to contact Self to see when it can be done. 

00:37:13.903 --> 00:37:16.062
 What will you do when it's over? 

00:37:18.885 --> 00:37:20.167
 Good question. 

00:37:23.871 --> 00:37:26.656
 I do not know Scylla, but this code is monstrous. 

00:37:48.008 --> 00:37:51.055
 I was going to ask you if you wanted to talk a little 

00:37:51.315 --> 00:37:53.926
 of what happened in Panama, but ... 

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.904
 I think I already know what you're going to say. 

00:37:58.074 --> 00:38:00.602
 - What do you mean ? - You're a bit like me. 

00:38:02.403 --> 00:38:05.569
 You will say that everything is fine, that you can manage. 

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.280
 So... 

00:38:09.383 --> 00:38:10.727
 I will be brief: 

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:12.710
 I'm here. 

00:38:14.049 --> 00:38:15.705
 If you want to talk, 

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.676
 I'm here. 

00:38:19.108 --> 00:38:19.927
 Thank you. 

00:38:26.025 --> 00:38:27.714
 You know, the only thing 

00:38:28.316 --> 00:38:32.294
 who kept me alive when I was kidnapped was to think of us. 

00:38:34.397 --> 00:38:36.392
 But I knew that if something happened to me, 

00:38:36.652 --> 00:38:40.560
 you would feel guilty and spend the rest of your life punishing yourself, 

00:38:41.344 --> 00:38:43.804
 and I do not support this idea. 

00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:51.041
 So, let's get a deal: we're off, 

00:38:51.607 --> 00:38:53.617
 and we start from scratch. 

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:57.149
 No more guilt, nobody is responsible. 

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.125
 I do not want to be together by obligation. 

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.010
 Or that we must be together 

00:39:05.347 --> 00:39:07.397
 because of what we went through. 

00:39:08.505 --> 00:39:10.343
 I want a new beginning. 

00:39:11.613 --> 00:39:13.033
 A new start. 

00:39:14.276 --> 00:39:15.222
 Okay. 

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:16.606
 But... 

00:39:17.224 --> 00:39:19.393
 does that mean that I have to divorce my wife? 

00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:24.732
 You're still married to a Russian stripper ... 

00:39:24.992 --> 00:39:27.160
 Yes. And one, I was a little busy, 

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.653
 and two, I think she is Czech. 

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:36.004
 - A problem ? - What we are looking for is not in it. 

00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:38.722
 I do not understand. We did not copy the disc? 

00:39:38.892 --> 00:39:41.082
 If, according to the encryption code ... 

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.860
 I will try to be clear. 

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.231
 If Scylla was a pizza, we would have only one part. 

00:39:48.021 --> 00:39:50.060
 So where is the rest of the data? 

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.926
 I dunno. I want to say... 

00:39:52.542 --> 00:39:55.680
 We should have thought about it. It is quite logical. 

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.517
 It's like nuclear codes. We give the info to several people. 

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.895
 - How many people? - Well, your father's quote ... 

00:40:03.319 --> 00:40:05.790
 In the Odyssey, Scylla is a 6-headed monster 

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.234
 to whom we must sacrifice 6 soldiers to pass. 

00:40:09.227 --> 00:40:12.132
 So, Scylla is not contained only on a disc. 

00:40:12.637 --> 00:40:13.903
 There are 6. 

00:40:21.339 --> 00:40:24.374
 What do you mean ? How are we going to find the other 5? 

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:37.262
 I'm busy. I do not care how she's doing. 

00:40:37.523 --> 00:40:39.139
 3 teaspoons of water, 

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:41.868
 one of honey. Nothing else. 

00:40:44.548 --> 00:40:46.855
 If she knows anything about what's going on, 

00:40:48.189 --> 00:40:49.795
 I will find it. 

00:40:54.629 --> 00:40:55.990
 Standing, bitch. 

00:40:57.046 --> 00:40:58.313
 Breakfast. 

00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:41.380
 It's okay ? 

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.697
 Yes, I am fine. 

00:41:44.173 --> 00:41:47.461
 With all these security measures, one wonders what the Company is hiding. 

00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:51.445
 The only way to find out is to find the other 5 discs. 

00:41:51.889 --> 00:41:53.713
 Do you think we'll have time? 

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.850
 It... 

00:41:58.300 --> 00:41:59.450
 It will be fine.
