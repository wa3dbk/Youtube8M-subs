00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it's really safe so what we're going to

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.120 
it's really safe so what we're going to
do<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.900> basic<00:00:22.170> dumbbell<00:00:22.710> squat

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130

a<00:00:23.939> lot<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.900> people<00:00:25.080> like<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.320> use<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> leg

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
a lot of people like to use the leg

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.320 
a lot of people like to use the leg
press<00:00:25.830> because<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.400> offers<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> little<00:00:27.060> bit<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
press because it offers a little bit of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.450 
press because it offers a little bit of
stability<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> spine<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> back<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
stability for the spine in the back the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.130 
stability for the spine in the back the
great<00:00:29.730> thing<00:00:29.910> about<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> dumbbells<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.019> as

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
great thing about the dumbbells is it as

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.560 
great thing about the dumbbells is it as
you're<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.890> down<00:00:32.099> into<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.520> squat<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.540> can

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you're going down into the squat you can

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.600 
you're going down into the squat you can
let<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.140> dumbbell<00:00:34.440> slide<00:00:34.800> forward<00:00:35.250> slightly

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
let this dumbbell slide forward slightly

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.850 
let this dumbbell slide forward slightly
and<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.059> acts<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> counterweight<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.680> it's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and it acts as a counterweight so it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.280 
and it acts as a counterweight so it's
going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.309> stabilize<00:00:39.239> your<00:00:39.450> spine<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.050> give

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
going to stabilize your spine and give

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.229 
going to stabilize your spine and give
you<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> little<00:00:40.739> bit<00:00:40.829> more<00:00:40.950> balance<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.879> what

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you a little bit more balance so what

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.490 
you a little bit more balance so what
we're<00:00:42.360> going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> start<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.200> our<00:00:43.290> feet

that<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.560> kind<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> early<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.280> your

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that you do this kind of early on your

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.340 
that you do this kind of early on your
exercise<00:01:38.909> routine<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.110> you're<00:01:40.229> not

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
exercise routine so that you're not

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.780 
exercise routine so that you're not
sweaty<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.950> don't<00:01:41.100> stick<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.579> wall

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
sweaty and you don't stick to the wall

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.069 
sweaty and you don't stick to the wall
and<00:01:42.060> probably<00:01:42.299> trying<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.780> against<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
and probably trying to do it against the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.440 
and probably trying to do it against the
mirror<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.130> try<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.119> might<00:01:45.299> add

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
mirror you can try it but it might add

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.940 
mirror you can try it but it might add
just<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.720> bit<00:01:45.930> more<00:01:46.110> resistance<00:01:46.560> than<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.770> want

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
just a bit more resistance than you want

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.039 
just a bit more resistance than you want
so<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.880> first<00:01:48.149> thing<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.390> want<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.869> talk

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.060

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
but not over the toe all right you can

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.510 
but not over the toe all right you can
actually<00:02:28.560> bring<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.160> out<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> little<00:02:29.370> bit

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
actually bring it out a little bit

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.880 
actually bring it out a little bit
further<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.290> bring<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> bottom

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
further and bring it to the bottom

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.920 
further and bring it to the bottom
position<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.640> where<00:02:32.820> you're<00:02:33.030> in<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.240> 90<00:02:33.660> degree

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
position to where you're in a 90 degree

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.380 
position to where you're in a 90 degree
angle<00:02:33.960> at<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.470> hip<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.950> then<00:02:35.610> drive<00:02:35.910> back<00:02:35.940> up

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
angle at the hip and then drive back up

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.660 
angle at the hip and then drive back up
okay<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.530> either<00:02:37.710> one<00:02:37.950> those<00:02:38.100> two<00:02:38.130> are<00:02:38.460> good

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
okay so either one those two are good

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.090 
okay so either one those two are good
the<00:02:39.180> further<00:02:39.540> out<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.810> get<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.709> actually<00:02:40.800> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
the further out you get and actually the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.830 
the further out you get and actually the
more<00:02:41.250> gluten<00:02:42.090> involvement<00:02:42.570> you're<00:02:42.660> going<00:02:42.780> to

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
more gluten involvement you're going to

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.300 
more gluten involvement you're going to
get<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.020> little<00:02:43.200> bit<00:02:43.350> more<00:02:43.470> hamstring<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.220> you

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
get a little bit more hamstring so you

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.890 
get a little bit more hamstring so you
have<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.459> couple<00:02:44.820> different<00:02:44.910> opportunities<00:02:45.720> to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
have a couple different opportunities to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.900 
have a couple different opportunities to
work<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.890> muscle<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.280> different<00:02:47.520> way<00:02:47.670> so

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
work the muscle in a different way so

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.790 
work the muscle in a different way so
