00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
having to touch up and that's a lot

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.670 
having to touch up and that's a lot
because<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> lot<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> Chanel

tend to wear off after usually like four

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.780 
tend to wear off after usually like four
hours<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> perfection<00:01:44.130> Lumiere<00:01:44.579> and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
hours like the perfection Lumiere and

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.969 
hours like the perfection Lumiere and
the<00:01:45.659> vitamin<00:01:46.020> E<00:01:46.110> are<00:01:46.170> aquata<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.770> usually

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the vitamin E are aquata they usually

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.160 
the vitamin E are aquata they usually
time<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.490> wear<00:01:47.670> off<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.180> me<00:01:48.390> rather<00:01:48.810> quickly

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
time to wear off on me rather quickly

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.200 
time to wear off on me rather quickly
and<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.979> know<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.220> can<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.369> frustrating<00:01:51.090> because

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and I know it can be frustrating because

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.300 
and I know it can be frustrating because
they<00:01:51.540> look<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:51.810> pretty<00:01:52.350> when<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.710> first<00:01:52.920> do<00:01:53.159> it

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
they look so pretty when you first do it

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.310 
they look so pretty when you first do it
but<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.030> after<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> couple<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.750> hours<00:01:54.930> they

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
but then after a couple of hours they

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.039 
but then after a couple of hours they
tend<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.740> break<00:01:56.340> down<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.969> that's<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
tend to break down and that's like a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.469 
tend to break down and that's like a
huge<00:01:58.469> disadvantage<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.610> those<00:01:59.820> foundations

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
huge disadvantage of those foundations

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.020 
huge disadvantage of those foundations
for<00:02:00.780> me<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.710> love<00:02:02.100> them<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.670> wear

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
for me but I do love them and I do wear

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.840 
for me but I do love them and I do wear

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
just covers like pretty much everything

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.150 
just covers like pretty much everything
I<00:03:33.510> will<00:03:34.020> say<00:03:34.200> though<00:03:34.350> if<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.680> do<00:03:34.920> get<00:03:35.130> a

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
I will say though if you do get a

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.699 
I will say though if you do get a
breakout<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:36.120> probably<00:03:36.540> still<00:03:36.870> need<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.410> use

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
breakout you probably still need to use

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.820 
breakout you probably still need to use
a<00:03:37.920> little<00:03:38.100> bit<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.400> concealer<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.620> I<00:03:40.620> actually

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
a little bit of concealer and I actually

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.460 
a little bit of concealer and I actually
used<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.880> underneath<00:03:42.300> my<00:03:42.450> eyes<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:43.260> found

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
used it underneath my eyes and I found

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.500 
used it underneath my eyes and I found
that<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.709> actually<00:03:43.770> covered<00:03:44.459> pretty<00:03:44.700> well<00:03:44.820> now

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
that it actually covered pretty well now

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.570 
that it actually covered pretty well now
obviously<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.080> days<00:03:46.290> where<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.709> have<00:03:46.950> darker

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
obviously in days where you have darker

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.380 
obviously in days where you have darker
circles<00:03:47.820> you<00:03:48.540> probably<00:03:49.050> will<00:03:49.350> need<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:50.390> little

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
circles you probably will need a little

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.120 
circles you probably will need a little
bit<00:03:51.510> extra<00:03:51.750> coverage<00:03:51.870> from<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.410> concealer<00:03:52.950> and

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
bit extra coverage from a concealer and

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.130 
bit extra coverage from a concealer and
then<00:03:53.280> just<00:03:53.970> top<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.209> off<00:03:54.480> with<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:57.110> CC<00:03:58.110> cream

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
then just top it off with the CC cream

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.620 
then just top it off with the CC cream
and<00:03:59.750> I<00:04:00.920> would<00:04:01.920> say<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:02.760> probably<00:04:03.060> still

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
and I would say that you probably still

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.590 
and I would say that you probably still
need<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.870> moisturizer<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.680> feel<00:04:05.100> weird<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.910> would

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
need a moisturizer I feel weird I would

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.940 
need a moisturizer I feel weird I would
feel<00:04:06.780> like<00:04:06.959> really<00:04:07.320> we<00:04:07.500> were<00:04:07.560> just<00:04:07.770> putting

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
feel like really we were just putting

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.880 
feel like really we were just putting
this<00:04:08.220> on<00:04:08.459> my<00:04:08.550> face<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.300> not<00:04:09.480> like<00:04:09.739> putting<00:04:10.739> my

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
this on my face and not like putting my

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.290 
this on my face and not like putting my
