00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hi to all the boys we are heirs 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.370
 of the staff that she wanted to 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.710
 this new as well as last and therefore 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.139
 fifth grumpy May episode indeed 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.509
 we are here to comment on your tia 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.040
 hdc from world is also where the last one 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.330
 episode we also take this opportunity to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.550
 thank all those who have 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.710
 collaborated in this series with media ai 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.779
 ferments writes on facebook 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.150
 views pull the big thanks to 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.830
 all for support but notice to 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.279
 let's talk about the pensions of the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.279
 surveys 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.750
 let's start with the review of 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.830
 these villages first of the screens 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.989
 Instead of the starts of 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.520
 daniele that we thank double 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.470
 Thanks feeds for him and 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.270
 let's start immediately with a little analysis 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.300
 level of mineral structures that if 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.510
 really god in canove only marquisate 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.190
 th says 2013 so it is not just 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.230
 obviously still a lot of things to 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.440
 empower but this is obvious and tivo 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.820
 in every movie you have time between the picture of 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.309
 more rigid effective structure 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.829
 the architecture of the village is also 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.770
 the really good one very balanced 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.360
 if we give we could could be born a 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.369
 dilemma in the attacker of this 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.380
 village 18 randomly just below but 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.020
 both sides are protected in a way 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.640
 it really is simply because above there 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.470
 are the giant bombs below there are a 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.060
 more cap has taken them to the flywheel 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.040
 and put really well you did well a 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.540
 point it upwards and ca n't in 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.710
 way to protect everything a little 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.660
 those changes in the plain and for 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.550
 regarding the castle the heroes 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.840
 so nothing is put in the center 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.030
 say maybe the toll station is activated a 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.890
 innovator I'm almost sure but not 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.060
 goes somehow always attracts the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.470
 autonomous toll-booth as it is more so 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.479
 centered by the most you did not want this is 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.790
 exactly the second of the villages that 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.500
 we are going to analyze today is that of 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.150
 francesco therefore also for francesco 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.920
 double less useful thanks to twenty a 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.720
 this joke matches to have anyway 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.400
 a lot we start immediately with the analysis 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.100
 the level of the sections with the usual 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.990
 really good, certainly even to say something 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.640
 higher this village is for the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.130
 structure and for the level because yes 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.799
 note however 2006 of 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.060
 in total they are good but there is a lot to do 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.340
 improve in particular the interior 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.200
 that up until 1 maya if in other words the magicians 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.840
 I ended up second in fact to the eye 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.769
 because they are even cooler for how much 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.920
 regattas 9 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.739
 the structure in general is not 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.799
 just the best charge because 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.470
 let's face it decided to concentrate everything 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.350
 down but diced by sticking from above 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.480
 you succeed 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.310
 because ok there are many defenses too 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.890
 above but essentially being done 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.820
 in rings we say a lot of changes 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.690
 exactly 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.480
 just put some giants of a 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.220
 used mauro words given some ice 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.800
 maybe a fury and break your ass 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.810
 second over 70 down instead I have to 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.180
 say the split hell adds there is the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.130
 worse brothel several cotans a pine 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.330
 that someone attacks law that they are 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.040
 really too many things 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.720
 the flywheel to the left I don't know 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.370
 because I am doing it and to position it 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.540
 or to put for some particular 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.670
 event that happens often what 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.410
 the body might even excuse my apologies 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.360
 because he says they were two spaces and lines 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.650
 in short no I say I meant the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.330
 done pointing to the left but 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.570
 no more talk 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.190
 this in short changes according to you 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.670
 we recommend changing this village 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.990
 it is decent but there is and instead remedies the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.610
 third of the villages we're going to see 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.320
 today it is the rosary that therefore 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.840
 thank you again very double field of 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.640
 thanked the blackmail or otherwise 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.040
 let's start with an absurdity with a level of 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.960
 defenses in general and 69 nothing to say 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.330
 a beast pretty much everything to 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.340
 maximum except for aerial defenses arches a 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.560
 kings and cannons so if really 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.420
 very strong figure batch is quite a lot 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.220
 mont have something to say instead for 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.390
 to which I say a lot to say because how 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.100
 remembered with the architecture of 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.590
 village terms from two as between modern 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.510
 because because in the end the village is 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.550
 very very compact and left little 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.650
 space for and traps that are almost a 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.690
 while all exterior does not put just fine 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.330
 because the onion onions play like this 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.550
 outside it is exact then very external hero 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.110
 because of the horn there was space and also the 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.580
 clan drawer put a little more 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.620
 laterally because always in the horn 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.120
 there was space and therefore much easier 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.710
 pulls in my opinion in this village is 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.270
 simple enough to stick in 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.950
 primis because it is very compact the 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.060
 50 doing it like enough 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.840
 ease also because there are a lot 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.330
 of things out 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.670
 moreover, ice is essentially enough 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.400
 on the triptych of two lands is hell 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.590
 the defense is played really holy yes 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.030
 then in the end with a jump you enter with 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.010
 the ice blocks things out if in the 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.590
 50 percent of the fin assured 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.990
 convoluted and mixed we say that you are one 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.670
 beta so I think this village 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.680
 make it somehow though that 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.240
 better then maybe my first 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.100
 formation of safe areas reached 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.480
 because otherwise you exactly how to 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.370
 We usually greet you hoping that the 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.720
 video you enjoyed a week video 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.100
 a video week the time has not flown 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.720
 another month has passed is he who 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.790
 we can do nothing but thank me 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.650
 still thank you again for 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.510
 following us supported and whatever else 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.890
 and see you soon here always suter e 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.620
 the stack with other series here we see 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.580
 let service liked it quite like 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.050
 comment I wrote maybe yours 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.060
 opinions regarding the villages 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.760
 here are our suggestions 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.380
 what we say are say tips a 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.970
 certainly no better lines 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.320
 villages but let's say there are gods 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.750
 requirements that must comply with the names 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.750
 of value however beautiful pretty girl
