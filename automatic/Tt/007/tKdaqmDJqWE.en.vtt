 the speaker is healthy by now has begun 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.670
 icebreaker as I predict 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.800
 said it's easy after making of 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.239
 bolzano continues the pusteria there is no 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.690
 history flows and everyone agrees 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.030
 agree prince and amir princess 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.370
 arison breaking is always right all the 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.710
 predictions spot on 100 percent 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.969
 a t-shirt with the current can be 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.850
 know but certainly what salt born in 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.620
 high school 6 beer and banana sport no but 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.769
 Happy New Year's painting is 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.980
 went to high school boy so if he 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.290
 we spent madaya if this shirt 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.470
 that makes us to our coach 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.860
 he made one for the quarters of 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.790
 final and this the shirt we leave 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.520
 final says and nut is drawn the rich 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.570
 Latin flax naturally because you 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.370
 in the locker room 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.560
 talk now i had to be a 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.310
 summed generator named times yes 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.020
 opens Latin as saying 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.600
 and when of this you greet to calculate 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.220
 every now and then, however, they get changed 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.710
 this closing however for one who has 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:47.990
 studied here we do not talk pose warmly 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.990
 also defense of this semifinal 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.410
 well then 4 to 0 I think nobody 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.110
 frankly if three games were expected 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:02.730
 finished scoring 6 goals and an assignment 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.210
 I don't think it was possible either 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.970
 wait now there's the final you don't know 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.170
 still against whom and I ask you 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.380
 simply starting from enrico if you have 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.970
 a preference from the other side does not 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.460
 I think we have to have a favorite 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.950
 that if we play like this we play it 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.490
 with both because curtain but it seems 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.080
 the beginning though I think it's more 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.640
 challenging transfer of bar worse 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.740
 since there is a very long journey 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.480
 by returning to the production is 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:39.300
 for the new then it could be 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.970
 better to play with curtain though if 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.320
 happened countries there is not only how 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.790
 the important thing continues to do so every 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.349
 match e 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.750
 we have time to look at the limbs and 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.209
 think who plays who doesn't play like 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.640
 play seems to play as we know and 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.930
 programmatic our site both mine and 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.769
 it affects both the second thee 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.959
 long trip thinking it may be 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.939
 valpellice that together in a sauce e 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.250
 there is so much extra travel also because 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.780
 there is little recovery time yes 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.510
 could start from that day before 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.859
 but also to see why you don't 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.510
 train in the morning but of those who 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:20.010
 they are used to train on the morning of 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.569
 left a little so and so anyway 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.030
 not even that of a curtain on the shoe side 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:29.609
 simple because anyway and now that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:32.189
 ater oh yes we hope we are short 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.409
 in short, we'll see it's sandro 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.889
 tonight atlanta has finished with one 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:42.239
 shoot out and you are the goalkeeper like 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:45.060
 how did you see the escalation of this 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.050
 flights that arrived if not convincing 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.450
 immediately arrived too 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.160
 some months of inactivity then 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.040
 surely we had to give some time 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.500
 a little trust to be able to get in 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.250
 form that will be able to end with the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.910
 Italian game is used being certain 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.120
 now he is doing very well so there 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:12.050
 it also gives confidence and that is what there is 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.870
 lacked good guys cheers final 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.200
 also because we have 47 seconds still 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.420
 of greetings they glaze paths however i 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.640
 three class 91 of migross supermarkets 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.180
