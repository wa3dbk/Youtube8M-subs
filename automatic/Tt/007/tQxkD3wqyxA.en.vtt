a disinfectant the final thing we have

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.640 
a disinfectant the final thing we have
is<00:01:37.710> hydrogen<00:01:38.670> peroxide<00:01:39.079> hydrogen<00:01:40.079> peroxide

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
is hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.609 
is hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide
is<00:01:41.220> essentially<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> same<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.509> oxygen<00:01:43.170> bleach

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
is essentially the same as oxygen bleach

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.480 
is essentially the same as oxygen bleach
or<00:01:44.299> similar<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.570> borax<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.259> basically<00:01:47.220> it'll

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
or similar to borax and basically it'll

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.910 
or similar to borax and basically it'll
break<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.000> bond<00:01:48.570> between<00:01:48.930> dirt<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
break the bond between dirt and a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.639 
break the bond between dirt and a
surface<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.939> also<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.420> natural<00:01:51.810> whitener<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
surface it's also a natural whitener and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.499 
surface it's also a natural whitener and
brightener<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.220> people<00:01:53.520> often<00:01:54.030> use<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.360> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
brightener so people often use it to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.539 
brightener so people often use it to
