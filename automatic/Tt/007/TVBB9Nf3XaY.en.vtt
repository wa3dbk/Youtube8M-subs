rocking a GT 610 and Asus GT 610 I
didn't<00:00:51.630> want<00:00:51.780> anything<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.230> expend<00:00:52.710> too

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
didn't want anything to expend too

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.880

expensive<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:54.030> frankly<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.079> gamer

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
expensive because frankly I'm not gamer

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.930 
expensive because frankly I'm not gamer
so<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> don't<00:00:56.730> need<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.149> know<00:00:57.239> 100<00:00:58.190> Gig<00:00:59.190> 100

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
so I don't need you know 100 Gig 100

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.570 
so I don't need you know 100 Gig 100
pound<00:01:00.380> GPU<00:01:01.380> and<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:02.340> find<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.450> card

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
pound GPU and I find that with this card

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.060 
pound GPU and I find that with this card
the<00:01:05.580> VGA<00:01:06.540> output<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.200> much<00:01:07.409> better<00:01:07.710> than<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the VGA output is much better than the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.810 
the VGA output is much better than the
DVI<00:01:08.520> output<00:01:09.320> simply<00:01:10.320> because<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:11.100> wow<00:01:11.430> it's

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
DVI output simply because like wow it's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.940 
DVI output simply because like wow it's
just<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.330> lot<00:01:12.570> sharper<00:01:12.870> and<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.470> lot<00:01:13.710> less

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
just a lot sharper and it's a lot less

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.730 
just a lot sharper and it's a lot less
aliased<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.420> works<00:01:15.780> out<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.380> box

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
aliased and that works out of the box

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.190 
aliased and that works out of the box
and<00:01:16.920> by<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> mean<00:01:17.520> literally<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.570> plug<00:01:19.020> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and by that I mean literally you plug it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.550 
and by that I mean literally you plug it
in<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.860> use<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.790> guys<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.990> just

been trying to find all card that work
to<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.150> machine<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> long<00:01:28.530> time<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
to this machine for a long time I

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.050 
to this machine for a long time I
haven't<00:01:29.340> ice<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.850> precision<00:01:30.450> T<00:01:31.340> 7400<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
haven't ice the precision T 7400 so you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.240 
haven't ice the precision T 7400 so you
know<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:34.020> you've<00:01:34.170> got<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.530> machine<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.159> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
know if you've got this machine and you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.520 
know if you've got this machine and you
