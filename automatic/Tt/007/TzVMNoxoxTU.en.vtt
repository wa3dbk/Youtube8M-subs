Freeman calm where I teach real-world
strength<00:00:11.070> training<00:00:11.430> and<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.150> short

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
strength training and in this short

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.760 
strength training and in this short
video<00:00:12.540> I'm<00:00:12.840> going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.080> show<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.260> how<00:00:13.500> I

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
video I'm going to show you how I

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.100 
video I'm going to show you how I
practiced<00:00:14.459> the<00:00:14.820> single<00:00:15.209> leg<00:00:15.360> squat<00:00:15.690> also

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
practiced the single leg squat also

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.440 
practiced the single leg squat also
known<00:00:16.289> as<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.530> pistol<00:00:16.950> last<00:00:17.640> winter<00:00:18.090> when<00:00:18.390> I

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
known as the pistol last winter when I

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.420 
known as the pistol last winter when I
couldn't<00:00:18.900> perform<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.289> single<00:00:19.500> pistol<00:00:19.950> I'm

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
couldn't perform a single pistol I'm

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.380 
couldn't perform a single pistol I'm
just<00:00:20.700> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.850> teach<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.210> progression

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
just going to teach you the progression

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.269 
just going to teach you the progression
I<00:00:21.779> went<00:00:21.990> through<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.410> you<00:00:22.470> can<00:00:22.619> apply<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
I went through and you can apply this to

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.919 
I went through and you can apply this to
almost<00:00:23.550> any<00:00:23.760> exercise<00:00:24.269> just<00:00:24.539> working

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
almost any exercise just working

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.290 
almost any exercise just working
incrementally<00:00:25.310> so<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.609> beginning<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.150> had

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
incrementally so in the beginning I had

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.759 
incrementally so in the beginning I had
a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.509> of<00:00:27.599> trouble<00:00:27.900> lowering<00:00:28.199> myself<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.740> I

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
a lot of trouble lowering myself so I

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.339 
a lot of trouble lowering myself so I
just<00:00:29.039> practiced<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:30.029> eccentric<00:00:30.660> contraction

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
just practiced the eccentric contraction

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.590 
just practiced the eccentric contraction
and<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.980> would<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.369> put<00:00:32.520> my<00:00:32.610> hands<00:00:32.820> down<00:00:32.940> on

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and I would have to put my hands down on

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.210 
and I would have to put my hands down on
the<00:00:33.720> floor<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> beginning<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.010> just

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
the floor of the beginning and I just

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.510 
the floor of the beginning and I just
squat<00:00:35.460> back<00:00:35.640> up<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.739> after<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> practiced<00:00:38.460> that

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
squat back up so after I practiced that

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.790 
squat back up so after I practiced that
for<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.820> couple<00:00:39.090> days<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.710> practiced<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
for a couple days I practiced the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.350 
for a couple days I practiced the
eccentric<00:00:41.309> contraction<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.030> then<00:00:42.120> I'd<00:00:42.210> go

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
eccentric contraction and then I'd go

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.639 
eccentric contraction and then I'd go
immediately<00:00:42.629> into<00:00:43.610> a<00:00:44.610> spinal<00:00:45.149> rock<00:00:45.440> rock<00:00:46.440> back

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
immediately into a spinal rock rock back

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.830 
immediately into a spinal rock rock back
onto<00:00:46.890> my<00:00:47.070> feet<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.520> stand<00:00:48.210> back<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.420> again

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
onto my feet and stand back up again

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.360 
onto my feet and stand back up again
that<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.140> an<00:00:49.289> easier<00:00:49.620> progression<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.340> me

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
that was an easier progression for me

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.830 
that was an easier progression for me
because<00:00:50.609> I<00:00:50.699> had<00:00:50.789> been<00:00:50.910> practicing<00:00:51.090> spinal

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
because I had been practicing spinal

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.660 
because I had been practicing spinal
rocks<00:00:52.020> for<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> while<00:00:52.879> once<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.000> practiced<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
rocks for a while once I practiced the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.400 
rocks for a while once I practiced the
spinal<00:00:56.670> Rock<00:00:56.789> portion<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.390> tried<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
spinal Rock portion I tried just the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.830 
spinal Rock portion I tried just the
eccentric<00:00:58.949> contraction<00:00:59.579> all<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> way<00:01:00.690> down

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
eccentric contraction all the way down

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.229 
eccentric contraction all the way down
to<00:01:01.019> this<00:01:01.140> static<00:01:01.620> hole<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> bottom<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.210> I

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to this static hole in the bottom so I

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
to this static hole in the bottom so I
was<00:01:03.390> building<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.250> stabilization

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
was building this this stabilization

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.000 
was building this this stabilization
strength<00:01:05.940> really<00:01:06.600> opening<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.200> my<00:01:07.380> hip<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
strength really opening up my hip here I

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.760 
strength really opening up my hip here I
further<00:01:08.910> sophisticated<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.930> by

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
further sophisticated this by

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.609 
further sophisticated this by
alternating<00:01:11.570> both<00:01:12.570> legs<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> I'm<00:01:15.560> kind<00:01:16.560> of

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
alternating both legs so I'm kind of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370 
alternating both legs so I'm kind of
giving<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.009> more<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:18.229> balance<00:01:19.229> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
giving a more of a balance and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.429 
giving a more of a balance and
stabilization<00:01:19.770> component<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> it

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
stabilization component to it

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.990 
stabilization component to it
increasing<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.470> skill<00:01:22.829> level<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.579> I<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:23.820> used

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
increasing the skill level so I get used

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.390 
increasing the skill level so I get used
to<00:01:24.270> being<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.140> different<00:01:25.500> positions<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.009> on

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
to being in different positions here on

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.499 
to being in different positions here on
one<00:01:27.210> foot<00:01:27.920> from<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.400> combined<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:30.479> of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
one foot from there I combined all of

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.870 
one foot from there I combined all of
them<00:01:30.750> together<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.369> eccentric

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
them together so I do the eccentric

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.590 
them together so I do the eccentric
contraction<00:01:33.710> into<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> spinal<00:01:35.280> Rock<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.820> then

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
contraction into a spinal Rock and then

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.050 
contraction into a spinal Rock and then
I<00:01:36.659> come<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:36.960> onto<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.649> one<00:01:37.890> foot<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.399> I<00:01:38.820> hold

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
I come up onto this one foot and I hold

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.139 
I come up onto this one foot and I hold
that<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.890> I'd<00:01:40.890> squat<00:01:41.220> back<00:01:41.399> up<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:41.759> two<00:01:41.939> legs

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
that and I'd squat back up with two legs

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.149 
that and I'd squat back up with two legs
after<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.990> practice<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.530> for<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> while<00:01:44.100> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
after I practice that for a while I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.120 
after I practice that for a while I
tried<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.790> full<00:01:45.119> pistol<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.869> think<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.770> 10

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
tried the full pistol I think it was 10

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
tried the full pistol I think it was 10
or<00:01:47.159> 11<00:01:47.310> days<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.149> practicing<00:01:48.780> those<00:01:48.899> things<00:01:49.200> I

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
or 11 days of practicing those things I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.260 
or 11 days of practicing those things I
just<00:01:49.380> showed<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.549> said<00:01:50.820> okay<00:01:51.090> it's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
just showed you and I said okay it's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.959 
just showed you and I said okay it's
time<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.570> try<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> full<00:01:52.229> pistol<00:01:52.770> exercise<00:01:53.280> so

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
time to try the full pistol exercise so

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.039 
time to try the full pistol exercise so
I<00:01:54.000> tried<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.920> lowered<00:01:55.920> myself<00:01:56.310> under<00:01:56.549> control

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
I tried it lowered myself under control

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.510 
I tried it lowered myself under control
got<00:01:58.049> control<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> bottom<00:01:58.950> position<00:01:59.070> so

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
got control in the bottom position so
