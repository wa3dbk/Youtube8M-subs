even<00:01:51.039> see<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.579> like<00:01:51.729> May<00:01:52.299> or<00:01:52.630> something

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
even see it to like May or something

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.169 
even see it to like May or something
like<00:01:53.109> that<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.499> following<00:01:53.920> year<00:01:54.219> however<00:01:54.579> it

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
like that the following year however it

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.270 
like that the following year however it
could<00:01:55.600> be<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:56.259> we<00:01:56.380> get<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.740> storyline

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
could be that we get the storyline

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.980 
could be that we get the storyline
earlier<00:01:57.729> if<00:01:57.969> you<00:01:58.090> really<00:01:58.420> don't<00:01:58.630> want<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.869> wait

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
earlier if you really don't want to wait

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.899 
earlier if you really don't want to wait

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
because when a novel coming out two days

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.639 
because when a novel coming out two days
after<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.390> movie<00:02:01.659> comes<00:02:01.869> out<00:02:02.020> is<00:02:02.200> only<00:02:02.560> a

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
after the movie comes out is only a

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:03.959 
after the movie comes out is only a
matter<00:02:02.799> of<00:02:02.920> time<00:02:02.979> so<00:02:03.219> somebody<00:02:03.520> translates

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
matter of time so somebody translates

is probably gonna be the aftermath
everyone<00:02:58.250> getting<00:02:58.549> out<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.819> tsukiyomi

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
everyone getting out of the tsukiyomi

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.030 
everyone getting out of the tsukiyomi
and<00:02:59.689> hopefully<00:03:00.109> these<00:03:00.230> chapters<00:03:00.500> are<00:03:00.680> really

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
and hopefully these chapters are really

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.410 
and hopefully these chapters are really
chunky<00:03:01.280> too<00:03:01.519> on<00:03:01.640> what<00:03:01.670> these<00:03:01.909> droplets<00:03:02.150> would

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
chunky too on what these droplets would

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.140 
chunky too on what these droplets would
be<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:02.629> 30<00:03:03.079> to<00:03:03.319> 40<00:03:03.650> pages<00:03:03.859> each<00:03:04.220> but<00:03:04.489> 6.99

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
be like 30 to 40 pages each but 6.99

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.880 
be like 30 to 40 pages each but 6.99
will<00:03:05.480> probably<00:03:05.959> be<00:03:06.109> that<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:06.590> know<00:03:06.680> just

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
will probably be that you know just

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.429 
will probably be that you know just
aftermath<00:03:07.730> or<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.209> car<00:03:08.450> getting<00:03:08.810> out<00:03:09.049> maybe<00:03:09.319> a

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
aftermath or the car getting out maybe a

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.140 
aftermath or the car getting out maybe a
little<00:03:09.500> bit<00:03:09.829> of<00:03:09.920> talk<00:03:10.159> here<00:03:10.370> there<00:03:10.639> but<00:03:11.000> the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
little bit of talk here there but the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.580 
little bit of talk here there but the
following<00:03:11.569> chapter<00:03:11.900> after<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.260> I'm<00:03:12.349> really

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
following chapter after that I'm really

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.470 
following chapter after that I'm really
hoping<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.159> maybe<00:03:13.400> like<00:03:13.579> an<00:03:13.760> epilogue<00:03:14.420> of

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
hoping is maybe like an epilogue of

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.449 
hoping is maybe like an epilogue of
sorts<00:03:14.959> kind<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.290> after<00:03:15.829> everything<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.340> know

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
sorts kind of after everything you know

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.979 
sorts kind of after everything you know
so<00:03:16.730> settled<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.389> everything<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:17.780> maybe<00:03:17.900> a

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
so settled and everything and maybe a

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.020 
so settled and everything and maybe a
couple<00:03:18.260> months<00:03:18.590> later<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:19.040> prior<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.790> the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
couple months later and prior to the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.399 
couple months later and prior to the
last<00:03:20.180> ro<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.750> movie<00:03:20.900> because<00:03:21.079> again<00:03:21.290> that's
