like<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:10.440> sometimes<00:00:10.830> tricky<00:00:11.070> when<00:00:11.700> you

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
like this is sometimes tricky when you

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.360 
like this is sometimes tricky when you
don't<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> lot<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.570> tall<00:00:13.139> materials<00:00:13.799> and

the design then we can show you by the
using<00:00:26.490> by<00:00:26.910> using<00:00:27.019> Plexiglas<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:30.359> good<00:00:30.539> thing

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
using by using Plexiglas the good thing

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.540 
using by using Plexiglas the good thing
about<00:00:30.779> Plexiglas<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.160> they<00:00:32.279> are<00:00:32.340> so

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
about Plexiglas is that they are so

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.970 
about Plexiglas is that they are so
pliable<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.570> actually<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.800> much

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
pliable and you can actually do so much

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.100 
pliable and you can actually do so much
things<00:00:35.280> about<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.700> not<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.570> using<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.960> as<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
things about it not just using it as a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.709 
things about it not just using it as a
straight<00:00:37.469> strand<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.550> also<00:00:38.879> twist<00:00:39.360> them

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
straight strand you can also twist them

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.360 
straight strand you can also twist them
a<00:00:39.930> couple<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.530> times<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.100> create<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.030> knot<00:00:43.370> into

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
a couple of times and create a knot into

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.529 
a couple of times and create a knot into
it<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.539> putting<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.680> into<00:00:46.829> different<00:00:47.309> AG

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:02.990 

that's<00:00:54.199> up

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.350 

aside<00:01:03.750> from<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.440> can<00:01:04.620> also<00:01:04.800> have<00:01:05.360> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
aside from that is we can also have the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.500 
aside from that is we can also have the
Plexiglas<00:01:07.230> code<00:01:07.620> with<00:01:07.890> beading<00:01:08.250> wire<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:09.390> we

Plexiglas code with beading wire what we

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.380 
Plexiglas code with beading wire what we
use<00:01:09.690> is<00:01:09.870> we<00:01:10.130> take<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.160> whole<00:01:11.460> bunch<00:01:11.730> of<00:01:11.940> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
use is we take a whole bunch of the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.150 
use is we take a whole bunch of the
Plexiglas<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.080> bind<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:13.800> a<00:01:13.830> bullion

wire<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:15.180> two<00:01:15.450> ends<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.620> can<00:01:16.920> bend<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.400> and

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
wire on two ends so we can bend them and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.690 
wire on two ends so we can bend them and
push<00:01:20.130> them<00:01:20.160> down<00:01:20.610> into<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:22.340> vessels<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.400> we

push them down into the vessels that we

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.980 
push them down into the vessels that we

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.730 

finally<00:04:29.729> just<00:04:30.569> adding<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:30.930> few<00:04:30.960> Morelli<00:04:31.470> condos

on<00:04:31.860> this<00:04:32.039> side<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.969> bring<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.270> color<00:04:33.509> down<00:04:38.539> and

on this side to bring the color down and

on this side to bring the color down and
some<00:04:39.810> more<00:04:39.930> flexible<00:04:40.409> ads<00:04:40.530> but<00:04:40.979> this<00:04:41.159> time<00:04:41.460> is

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
some more flexible ads but this time is

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.700 
some more flexible ads but this time is

thing<00:04:47.340> we<00:04:47.430> can<00:04:47.610> do<00:04:47.759> is<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.360> again<00:04:48.949> create<00:04:49.949> a

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
thing we can do is to again create a

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.959 
thing we can do is to again create a
more<00:04:51.960> active<00:04:52.650> line<00:04:52.830> rather<00:04:53.310> than<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.520> static

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
more active line rather than a static

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:58.129 
more active line rather than a static
line<00:04:54.150> by<00:04:54.900> creating<00:04:55.710> curves<00:04:56.159> or<00:04:56.520> not<00:04:57.090> on<00:04:57.629> to

this<00:05:02.719> we<00:05:03.719> have<00:05:03.900> one<00:05:04.319> or<00:05:04.500> two<00:05:04.710> or<00:05:04.919> more<00:05:05.099> than<00:05:05.280> one

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
this we have one or two or more than one

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:28.470 
this we have one or two or more than one
knot<00:05:05.789> in<00:05:06.330> each<00:05:06.800> bundle
