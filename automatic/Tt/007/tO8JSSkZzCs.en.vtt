which I'm guessing is holding the end of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
which I'm guessing is holding the end of
the<00:01:01.140> remote<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:03.300> charger<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.589> box

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the remote in the the charger this box

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.960 
the remote in the the charger this box
on<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> way<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> once<00:01:10.710> again<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.250> slide

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the remotes and the products work we can

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.219 
the remotes and the products work we can
go<00:02:08.399> into<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.729> little<00:02:08.879> bit<00:02:09.030> later<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.959> then

that this remote charges via USB on the
bottom<00:02:37.560> micro<00:02:38.560> USB<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.370> plug<00:02:39.670> it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
bottom micro USB so you can just plug it

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.520 
bottom micro USB so you can just plug it
and<00:02:39.910> right<00:02:40.060> there<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.570> then<00:02:41.200> here's<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
cable and then the board just plugs in

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.880 
cable and then the board just plugs in
right<00:02:45.180> here<00:02:46.180> on<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.390> back<00:02:46.600> if<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.260> open<00:02:47.530> up

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
which means the board is is that the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.830 
which means the board is is that the
fastest<00:03:21.370> possible<00:03:21.580> speed<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.660> if<00:03:22.750> you

little bit more animation and now you
see<00:03:37.000> full<00:03:37.540> power<00:03:37.780> is<00:03:37.990> a<00:03:38.200> lot<00:03:38.410> less<00:03:38.680> once<00:03:39.550> again

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
see full power is a lot less once again

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.260 
see full power is a lot less once again
one<00:03:40.510> two<00:03:40.720> three<00:03:41.490> little<00:03:42.490> light<00:03:42.700> animation
