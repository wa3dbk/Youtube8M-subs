Robyn here I am going to share with you
how<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.290> do<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.920> etched<00:00:14.460> glass<00:00:14.940> technique<00:00:15.929> I

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
how to do the etched glass technique I

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.550 
how to do the etched glass technique I
actually<00:00:16.650> learned<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.690> the<00:00:18.690> other<00:00:18.810> day<00:00:19.080> while

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
actually learned it the other day while

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.010 
actually learned it the other day while
watching<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.220> Cricut<00:00:20.640> expression

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
watching the Cricut expression

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.540 
watching the Cricut expression
infomercial<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.710> I've<00:00:22.949> never<00:00:23.189> done<00:00:23.430> this

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
infomercial so I've never done this

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.130 
infomercial so I've never done this
before<00:00:23.609> I'm<00:00:24.090> actually<00:00:24.300> doing<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
before I'm actually doing it for the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.320 
before I'm actually doing it for the
first<00:00:25.289> time<00:00:25.560> while<00:00:25.949> I'm<00:00:26.099> filming<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.730> so

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
first time while I'm filming it so

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.450 
first time while I'm filming it so
you'll<00:00:27.539> see<00:00:27.720> my<00:00:27.840> trial<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.470> error<00:00:28.680> if<00:00:29.010> you

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
you'll see my trial and error if you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.700 
you'll see my trial and error if you
have<00:00:29.609> an<00:00:29.699> easier<00:00:30.000> way<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> or<00:00:30.720> you've

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710

to start simple with my project okay I
have<00:01:01.050> my<00:01:01.199> Cricut<00:01:01.680> expression<00:01:01.980> waiting<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> go

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
have my Cricut expression waiting to go

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.280

just<00:01:04.080> load<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.530> paper<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.750> I<00:01:06.750> am<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
just load the paper and I am going to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.640 
just load the paper and I am going to
use<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.860> snowflake

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
use a snowflake

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.340 
use a snowflake
let's<00:01:10.650> see<00:01:10.890> which<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.070> am<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.790> use<00:01:11.970> I

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
let's see which one am I going to use I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.480 
let's see which one am I going to use I
think<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.890> start<00:01:14.130> by<00:01:14.189> using

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
think I'm just going to start by using

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.469 
think I'm just going to start by using
this<00:01:14.909> one<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:16.530> too<00:01:16.890> intricate<00:01:17.479> it

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
this one right here not too intricate it

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.620 
this one right here not too intricate it
looks<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> simple<00:01:19.200> design<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> I

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
looks like a simple design to do so I

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.429 
looks like a simple design to do so I
need<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> hit<00:01:22.020> shift<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.479> let's<00:01:24.479> go<00:01:24.630> flake<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
need to hit shift and let's go flake it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.510 
need to hit shift and let's go flake it
shows<00:01:25.650> me<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.890> my<00:01:26.009> little<00:01:27.590> window<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:29.490> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
shows me in my little window here what I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.990 
shows me in my little window here what I
will<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.909> making<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.799> believe<00:01:32.250> I'm<00:01:32.790> going

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
will be making and I believe I'm going

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.520 
will be making and I believe I'm going
to<00:01:33.090> make<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:34.850> I'm<00:01:35.850> going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.390> say<00:01:36.509> about<00:01:36.659> maybe

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
to make it I'm going to say about maybe

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.710 
to make it I'm going to say about maybe

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and I am going to let see two inches

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.930 
and I am going to let see two inches
sounds<00:01:49.470> good<00:01:49.650> let's<00:01:49.860> try<00:01:49.980> two<00:01:50.100> inches

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
sounds good let's try two inches

it's too big which it's looking like it

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.109 
it's too big which it's looking like it
might<00:01:57.439> be<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.829> little<00:01:58.040> bit<00:01:58.280> too<00:01:58.520> big<00:01:58.759> so<00:02:01.119> let's

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
might be a little bit too big so let's

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.920 
might be a little bit too big so let's
see<00:02:02.270> how<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:02.420> looks<00:02:03.759> really<00:02:04.759> nicely<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:05.509> love

cutting<00:02:06.380> vinyl<00:02:07.630> okay<00:02:08.630> I'm<00:02:08.959> going<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.410> actually

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
cutting vinyl okay I'm going to actually

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.670 
cutting vinyl okay I'm going to actually
bring<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.510> down<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.870> one<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.200> half<00:02:12.319> inches

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
bring it down to one and a half inches

bring it down to one and a half inches
I'm<00:02:12.920> going<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.310> slow<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.630> speed<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.170> was

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
I'm going to slow the speed it was

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.430 
I'm going to slow the speed it was
making<00:02:15.530> me<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> little<00:02:15.800> nervous<00:02:17.260> with<00:02:18.260> him

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
making me a little nervous with him

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.830 
making me a little nervous with him
through<00:02:18.590> there<00:02:18.739> that<00:02:18.890> fast<00:02:19.099> and<00:02:19.370> my<00:02:19.489> pressure

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
through there that fast and my pressure

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.440 
through there that fast and my pressure
okay<00:02:20.840> let's<00:02:21.050> try<00:02:21.200> this<00:02:21.319> again

edging<00:02:58.970> cream<00:02:59.209> I'm<00:03:00.170> wondering<00:03:00.680> if<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:00.890> added

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
edging cream I'm wondering if you added

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.360 
edging cream I'm wondering if you added
a<00:03:01.640> dye<00:03:02.180> based<00:03:02.450> ink<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.200> cream<00:03:03.470> if<00:03:03.739> you<00:03:03.920> make

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
a dye based ink to the cream if you make

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.150 
a dye based ink to the cream if you make
the<00:03:05.180> etching<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:06.140> different<00:03:06.650> color<00:03:06.859> besides

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
the etching a different color besides

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.870 
the etching a different color besides
white<00:03:07.640> or<00:03:08.120> maybe<00:03:08.329> that's<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.900> reason<00:03:09.049> why

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
white or maybe that's the reason why

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.160 
white or maybe that's the reason why
it's<00:03:10.880> called<00:03:10.970> edgy<00:03:11.299> is<00:03:11.540> because<00:03:11.840> it's<00:03:11.989> white

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
it's called edgy is because it's white

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.229 
it's called edgy is because it's white
I'm<00:03:12.380> not<00:03:12.650> sure<00:03:12.890> this<00:03:13.519> is<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.790> first<00:03:14.000> time<00:03:14.209> I

do it I think this is going to pinch it

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.210 
do it I think this is going to pinch it
at<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.460> end<00:05:21.200> okay<00:05:22.200> and<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:22.560> want<00:05:22.710> it<00:05:22.890> really

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
flush I'm just guessing cuz I've never

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.540 
flush I'm just guessing cuz I've never
made<00:05:27.900> this<00:05:28.050> before<00:05:28.230> you<00:05:28.500> know<00:05:28.530> I'm<00:05:29.400> just

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
flush so the etching cream does not

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.870 
flush so the etching cream does not
sleep<00:05:33.510> in<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:34.140> give<00:05:34.260> you<00:05:34.350> fuzzy<00:05:34.740> fuzzy<00:05:35.580> little
