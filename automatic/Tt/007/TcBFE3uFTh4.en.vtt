00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:06.266
 (1 John 4:3) "Fans don't recognize Jesus, 

00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:10.200
 It is not from God. 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.914
 This is the spirit of the Antichrist. ” 

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:20.493
 Not completely denying that Jesus is a historical figure, 

00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:24.047
 But if you don’t recognize the Bible 

00:00:24.638 --> 00:00:27.190
 Jesus, 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.371
 You see what is said here. 

00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:30.042
 Look, 

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:35.794
 Denying the person of Christ, 

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.239
 lesson, 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.142
 (The doctrine is the "lesson"), 

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:44.700
 Denying the doctrine of Christ, 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.579
 Personality and work about Christ 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.328
 Lessons; 

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:56.119
 Fan Ling does not recognize Jesus in the Bible, 

00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:59.475
 It is the spirit of the Antichrist. 

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:03.771
 Denying a truth about Christ is 

00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:06.421
 Confused by the spirit of the Antichrist, 

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:07.731
 You have also become the Antichrist; 

00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:10.491
 You are the antichrist, 

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:15.423
 If you deny Jesus in the Bible. 

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:19.042
 just now, 

00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:21.499
 Note here, 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.938
 1 John 2:22, 

00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:37.222
 "Who is lying? Isn't that not acknowledging Jesus as Christ?" 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:43.005
 There is no doubt that there are some specific paradoxes here. 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.494
 I want to expand to talk about any paradox that is hostile to the person of Christ. 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.741
 But there were some specific paradoxes at that time. 

00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:55.768
 In 1 John 4:3 

00:01:55.768 --> 00:01:58.403
 If you don't recognize Jesus, 

00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:00.538
 Not from God; 

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:01.930
 It is the antichrist. 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.462
 Here, (1 John 2:22) 

00:02:03.462 --> 00:02:06.535
 Do not recognize Jesus as Christ, 

00:02:06.873 --> 00:02:09.618
 Here again, "This is the Antichrist." 

00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:12.076
 "Do not recognize the father and the child," 

00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:13.367
 Note here, 

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:17.100
 (1 John 2:23) "Whoever does not recognize the Son, there is no Father." 

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:20.182
 I hope you can understand, 

00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:25.834
 To deny a truth about Christ is to deny Christ. 

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:28.232
 You need to understand this, 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.636
 Because people won't admit it. 

00:02:31.662 --> 00:02:34.655
 "Jesus is not God! He is the Son of God!" 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.741
 You denied Christ. 

00:02:39.237 --> 00:02:41.172
 "No, I have not denied Christ!" 

00:02:41.172 --> 00:02:42.597
 But look, 

00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:45.042
 God said that you have, 

00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:50.808
 In the end, what do we think is not important. 

00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:54.727
 This is to deny Christ himself. 

00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:56.742
 Note here, 

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:59.228
 They did not raise their fists, 

00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:03.242
 They did not directly deny Christ, 

00:03:04.123 --> 00:03:05.917
 They did not curse the name of Jesus, 

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:10.765
 They did not deny that Jesus did live, 

00:03:11.262 --> 00:03:14.709
 They discuss information about the untrueness of Christ, 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.648
 Changing the person or work of Jesus Christ is hostile to Christ, 

00:03:19.648 --> 00:03:21.834
 Become the Antichrist. 

00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:25.521
 Now pay attention here, 

00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:34.100
 Verse 23 says, "Whoever does not recognize the Son, there is no Father. 

00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:40.404
 The acquaintance of the child, even the father has. ” 

00:03:41.904 --> 00:03:43.697
 The problem is here, 

00:03:47.497 --> 00:03:49.821
 A Catholic said to me, 

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:52.304
 "This is the same god." 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.840
 Muslims want to say, 

00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:04.798
 "We are different, but they are all the same god." 

00:04:05.548 --> 00:04:07.135
 it is good, 

00:04:10.415 --> 00:04:17.342
 I read here that Jesus Christ is called the Almighty God. 

00:04:19.763 --> 00:04:23.867
 I read here: Jesus Christ was crucified, 

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:29.536
 He made a sacrifice for sin and rose from the dead. 

00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:34.540
 Is this the Christ you believe in? 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.288
 You said, "No way!" 

00:04:36.288 --> 00:04:38.181
 You have no father, 

00:04:38.181 --> 00:04:39.493
 Not the same god. 

00:04:39.493 --> 00:04:41.963
 "No way! Never!" 

00:04:42.248 --> 00:04:44.526
 It is to deny Christ. 

00:04:45.587 --> 00:04:49.260
 They said, "We have not denied Christ. He is a prophet." 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.647
 He is indeed a prophet, but he is not only that. 

00:04:53.655 --> 00:04:58.988
 They denied the basic truth about Christ, 

00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:02.385
 This means that they are antichrists and they have no father. 

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:05.709
 When they deny the child, they deny the father. 

00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:08.826
 Do you realize how we got to God? 

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:12.207
 He is the road, he is the truth, he is the life. 

00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:18.167
 If no one can go to the Father through this Christ, this is what the Bible reveals. 

00:05:18.244 --> 00:05:19.468
 There is no way to God, 

00:05:19.468 --> 00:05:22.012
 Can't be called righteousness in the eyes of God, 

00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:23.739
 Can't be reconciled to God, 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.393
 Can't escape the wrath of God, 

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:30.010
 Unless we accept the true Christ. 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.208
 Then you can watch 25, 

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:39.904
 "What the Lord has promised us is eternal life." 

00:05:39.904 --> 00:05:41.396
 Who is “we” referring to? 

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:42.611
 Is the person who is anointed, 

00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:44.424
 It is the one who believes in the truth. 

00:05:44.424 --> 00:05:46.994
 There is no father who denies Christ; 

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:49.666
 There is no eternal life to deny Christ! 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.185
 Don't make a mistake! 

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:55.032
 Have a wrong view of Christ, 

00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:57.165
 It’s a matter of life and death!
