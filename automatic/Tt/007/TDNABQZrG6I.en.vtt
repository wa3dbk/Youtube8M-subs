00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.559
 hello today I bring you a new craft 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.120
 from spiderman 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:10.820
 Today I'm going to teach you how to make a backpack 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.010
 of the face of spiderman that will remain 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.880
 its opening and very original we are going to 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.880
 make eva 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.280
 The materials that we are going to use are 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.620
 eva red black rubber 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.780
 a spiderman face template 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.570
 that here below I will leave the link for you 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.880
 that you can download and silicone 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.380
 hot to paste then the first thing that 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.220
 let's do it first is 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.220
 cut it out 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.270
 and once we have cut the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.190
 template what we are going to do is pass 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.960
 the eva rubber 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.090
 to pass it we are not going to help with a 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.090
 stick and we will trace 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.250
 we are not going to trace twice 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.410
 the same template one ahead and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.810
 another one for back once you've already 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.590
 let's have traced what we 're going to do 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.590
 is to cut them 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.700
 once we have trimmed what 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.210
 let's do is cut back 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.490
 of the template what black is the fabric 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.200
 of spider and mask all the edge that 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.380
 there is black we cut it 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.329
 once we have trimmed what 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.969
 let's do is pass it to rubber eva 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.600
 black with the help of a stick the 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.600
 decal moss 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.030
 and once we have it traced 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.030
 what we are going to do is cut it 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.350
 Well, I have already cropped the look 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.860
 stayed super good and now what we're going 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.050
 to do is cut an eva rubber strip 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.020
 in red where you can do it in blue 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.010
 because spiderman is red and blue like 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.820
 You want me to do everything in red 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.130
 and this is going to be to paste it later in the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.380
 backpack 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.850
 well in the two parts that we have done 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.490
 previously we are leaving a 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.399
 little by little 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.769
 I remembered 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.980
 and around here and this is going to be what I do 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.870
 the bottom of the backpack you 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.209
 you can make bigger smaller more 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.980
 Fine as you want, I've done it 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.489
 smaller than it's going to be up 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.890
 then close if you have a zipper 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.689
 you can put zipper in this case 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.810
 I forgot to say or we will use it 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:33.500
 Velcro 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.200
 I'm going to put it with Velcro so it sticks 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.880
 and it opens to close and that's fine 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.680
 what we are going to do is paste 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.620
 the bottom of the strip until we have 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.100
 I cut it around and I'm going to paste it and now 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.100
 I teach it 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.569
 I have already stuck it looking started more or 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.880
 less a little bit more up from the 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.570
 half 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.400
 and as far as May has arrived now 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.150
 what we are going to do is paste this here to 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.150
 continuation 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.520
 a little bit to the same extent 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.560
 once we have already pasted what 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.380
 we are going to do is pass it here and here 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.770
 on this side we are going to put a piece 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.820
 Velcro 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.660
 one on one side and another that up and here 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:30.070
 will close the backpack and open it 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.070
 I'm going to beat him to grandpa 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.900
 to stick the velcro what we're going to 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.400
 to do is join them the two pieces 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.550
 we put a little bit of silicone what 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.680
 we paste here and we are also silicone 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.680
 out here and now the jobs 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.159
 And while we let it dry, it dries 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.159
 of 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.799
 and now what we are going to do 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.799
 take off 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:05.360
 the black in the red 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.360
 so that the face of spider 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.750
 and now that we have it stuck but what 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.010
 what we are going to do is paste it to 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.560
 paste it we put a little bit of 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.750
 silicone here and what we're going here in a 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.810
 side 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.630
 and the same down we go so we stick it 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.070
 so let's see one on each side and already 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.070
 we will have the backpack ready 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.039
 we already have the backpack ready 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:36.210
 that has given you an idea to give 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.210
 to do for your children 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.260
 the truth that has been super original 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.260
 and for less than one euro 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.620
 because nothing fits or gives of a 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.550
 idea do not forget to give I like to comment 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.470
 and share with your friends and nothing 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.280
 see you in the next craft that 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.240
 Have a good day 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.240
 bye
