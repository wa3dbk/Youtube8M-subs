00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
inside here is a little bit

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.560

uncomfortable and this mask is made for

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.630 
uncomfortable and this mask is made for
a<00:01:54.630> bigger<00:01:54.930> sized<00:01:55.259> head<00:01:55.560> mine<00:01:56.070> fits<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
pretty good but I mean it's it would be

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.959 
pretty good but I mean it's it would be
better<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.520> was<00:01:59.729> had<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> bigger<00:02:00.899> head<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
better if I was had a bigger head and
