00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.440
 it is there all delighted to find on 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 direct race provoked the program of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.379

 sea ​​it addresses the trotters and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.230
 drop down at night 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.089
 this event gathered 18 horses 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.870
 of age five of them are mocked by 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.420
 yannick alain briand 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.160
 that said the latter is not at the top of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.080
 my selection I preferred it number 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 three lists of curgings a horse that has 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.769
 been acquired to claim a current 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.150
 September who joined eric's boxes 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.400
 prodon he also did not delay to 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.080
 give and bring satisfaction to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.160
 his new entourage signing three 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.410
 success in less than two months 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.719
 the horse stays on two good outings 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.100
 on the course that interests us 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.540
 is entrusted to christophe martens he is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.160
 well engaged in the lead he will be barefoot 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 I think they would not grows 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.149
 the truth will pose the number 8 Ultra 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.649
 see who has long been kept out 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.640
 tracks four months of April 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.989
 in the month of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.550
 seven months running from April to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.320
 November, the horse finds 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.120
 progressively his best 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.350
 sensations attests to his recent race 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.170
 in the president a group iii disputed 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.790
 in vincennes or confront him some of 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.820
 his contemporaries a very good level 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.960
 here in this lot I think able to 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.460
 play the leading roles anyway 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.820
 pure class he perfectly has the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.860
 means 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.509
 add to that he likes the tracks 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.150
 flat and that he knows the racetrack of 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.320
 cagnes-sur-mer lemire have a meaning to this 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.330
 gain is in my eyes a beautiful 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.590
 outsider in according to her arrived 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.330
 in the stable of yannick-alain briand 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.370
 this winter 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.460
 always adorned with the casaque of his 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.560
 owner namely hydro who 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.120
 the trained beforehand the mare has 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.770
 now three races in the region 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.240
 know that it will be deferré of the four 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.190
 for the first time in his career 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.720
 know also that during his 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.890
 penultimate exit and fight for a 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.450
 place the appearance was faulty 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.300
 near the goal on this course 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.680
 so be wary of the number 12 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.360
 tango somolli no longer has to do his 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.800
 evidence to cagnes on sea and on this 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.360
 course where he already has a lot of 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.680
 victories it's a hard horse to the effort 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.300
 who knows how to finish fast he should a 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.630
 once again allowed in the quinté 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.240
 winner 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.010
 the number 10 and 18 forgiveness it was that he 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.330
 had a good laugh the richest of the lot she 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.890
 also references to argue 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.479
 at this level of competition is not worth 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.340
 judge her on saona and an attempt where 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.900
 she evolves and shoe this time 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.070
 this race is a goal for 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.840
 it makes a nice commitment to 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.940
 earnings cap and she will be barefoot 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.649
 it is better then to take it back on 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.119
 number 2 it's iceman no longer has a margin 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.950
 maneuver in similar society 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.450
 sir lavis she just proved her 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.000
 form by ranking second on this 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.440
 track also know how repeat 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.240
 his races and in these conditions 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.340
 a place is in his strings I 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.170
 also held number 4 rybak beval this 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.580
 is none other than the titleholder 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.810
 certainly he stays on two 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.670
 disqualifications us in two outings 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.959
 this year but in a good day it is 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.550
 able to accompany the previous ones 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.200
 cited I also retained number 9 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.240
 like chip that is maybe better 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.550
 on the reduced course 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.050
 that said in favor of a good course 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.220
 hidden as she loves them she 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.100
 is able to add to the reports 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.960
 she who depends on rain man form of 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.060
 romane maurice who enjoys a riff 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.740
 of the efficient a david becker t who does 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.460
 facing a beautiful commitment to the first 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:55.390
 echelon that's it for this scheme is encrypted 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.950
 3.8 as 12 18 of 4 and 9 for my 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.570
 prognosis for this fifth of Friday 14 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.950
 to cagnes 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.510
 in the rest of the program 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.000
 first I really like 112 rules of the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.410
 ried who had finished 3rd on the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.630
 course that interests us a quinté 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.100
 more it was or in the course of the month 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.660
 of January if the repeat is value and 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.250
 looks daunting even for the 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.770
 victory is the sound of the rib rules 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.140
 in the fourth the 416 8 jobs that 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.890
 remain on three third places 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.520
 but it's also a mention 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.410
 favorable 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.660
 a regularity that deserves to be 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.340
 rewarded with a success he had 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.190
 besides fight with ultra woods 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.470
 round with forgiveness 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.820
 ulysses of curgies so black and bones who 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.310
 participate in the quinté so in this lot 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:37.090
 must be able to play the leading roles 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.560
 the 418 goals molly deferré of the four 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.510
 for this beautiful commitment to the ceiling of 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.800
 gains will also have to struggle for 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.180
 first places 416,418 in the sixth 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.220
 I recommend the six in seven poles 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.240
 healed this is not I do there advised 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.710
 to the heart he drives 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.960
 disqualification in as many outings 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.150
 this year ie in 2014 this 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.460
 lives on horseback that has quality because 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.860
 that he was part of the good hopes of 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.810
 louis baudron in this promotion en 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.670
 pure class and I think him capable of 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.740
 to inflict a race of this ilk 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.030
 this one on this beautiful healed for the 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.170
 lovers of sensations a little strong 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.840
 since he is not immune to 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.450
 incartade in the seventh on 7 107 7 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.400
 brothers represents to me a good 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.530
 fulcrum the horse is in shape there 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.480
 is confirmed in similar company sell 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.490
 races reserved for amateur tribes 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.930
 it will be good to ride the horse is in 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.630
 form well engaged brief it has not hurt 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.520
 trumps in his game the 702 tarnac which 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.620
 just won on the course that 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.590
 we are interested should be one of his 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.419
 main opponents 707 702 race 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.900
 to the targets and lull in this Friday 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.700
 1st 4th 6th and 7th little word also on 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.610
 the skin's meeting two shots 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.200
 heart the 101 mechtras is certainly he 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.639
 makes his return he did not run 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.600
 since the month of October but when they 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.820
 October was needed was 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.220
 cutting edge the weekend of the price of the bow 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.510
 of triumph is in a group 1 here he 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.800
 does not have to be 100 % for 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.840
 to impose itself is the class horse of the 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.400
 lot it would be disappointing not to see it 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.680
 to do well from the outset in any case he has 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.850
 perfectly the means and the toffes the 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.600
 blood a thug is brought to you by 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.860
 jean-pierre total the 601 alico to the boy 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.230
 also seems to me able to 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.300
 compete for victory with two 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.010
 podiums in as many outings on the 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.340
 steeple-chase deserves to open 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.860
 his record he puts weight on all his 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.260
 rivals of the day but I think he has 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.300
 the means to do it victoriously 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.729
 which the blood a mistral and the 601 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.830
 alcoba there for the info of 100 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.970
 euros 10 February 14th I play is very 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.570
 good game to all a good day we get 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.570
 say meeting tomorrow
