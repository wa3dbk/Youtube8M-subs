00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 80 Welcome to my subscriber 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.970
 visit sequence number 7 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.440
 if you want to be here too and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.380
 you from the bass my master of mine 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.719
 want to have competition then you are applying as 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.880
 that works you see in sequence 1 the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.740
 link below in the description yes 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.109
 do the same as explain it there and 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.900
 otherwise we ask already 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.490
 yes we are here to visit at 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.059
 Coconut Hello Coconut is Town Hall 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.930
 Level 6 Build is currently at level 7 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.239
 And I have not had any stock design yet 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.770
 seen from covert from the outset 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.809
 army camp will be a bit more 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.430
 otherwise they all look quite the whole 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.530
 excursion good level from the one 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.910
 City Hall 5 does not light up on the laboratory 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.079
 because the whole units already at three 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.550
 have great so these are the consequences 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.629
 this woman is completely improvising me 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.600
 never imagined the villages'm looking angeguckt 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.309
 I just do it all this way 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.699
 stomachfeel yes magath about klaas and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.650
 Susanne good village caught the cannons 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.939
 are great are all at high level d 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.810
 radiator is also super placed yes me 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.220
 Maybe I want another camp 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.080
 design search but that has now 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.450
 soon anyway since you now soon 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.360
 City Hall seven and then you have to go there 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.040
 but so what change otherwise also 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.939
 are too far leveled them a bit 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.979
 It really looks really good 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.420
 she has two now 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.610
 maybe soon the third tree 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.409
 would he are about pokalen 1250 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.780
 otherwise we will leave a mix there 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.590
 I like saying 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:41.700
 Keep up the good work goes on 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.100
 Visit to Gabor Alst Town Hall 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.600
 stage 7 from the outset city ​​hall 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.299
 no problem but place 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.740
 at least so close that others so that 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.930
 because somebody just does not have to come along 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.460
 destroyed a baba with you then city ​​hall 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.869
 that is not the purpose of the matter why 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.340
 should record the town hall set it 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.649
 at least that's a little bit 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.149
 Yes, the anti-atoms are protected for me 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.920
 also a bit too so the cover 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.020
 Not at all the whole camp from the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.550
 I'm definitely too decentralized 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.019
 before the stage they are okay yes i would 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.739
 In any case, another camp the 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.200
 to look for one 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.220
 that's so i know i can do that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.230
 can not imagine that there are so 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.290
 everything is efficient because so far 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.519
 lies apart and just the anti atom 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.629
 if by now someone with 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.879
 archer attacks on it to the 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.170
 destroyed adware and then just yet 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.830
 a little something on his bow 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.299
 then your archer door is set 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.500
 Can he use it for a few flight units? 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:37.110
 get all the resources as soon as possible 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.519
 he destroyed the two towers outside and 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.590
 then the few archer towers 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.209
 then the usa can not do anything anymore 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.840
 against three kites or two kites 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.209
 align 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.329
 Yes, but otherwise it looks from abroad 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.430
 in the file in the building quite well 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.860
 You're building a marathon right now 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.099
 out of relationship just both from whatever 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.900
 urgently needed is also yours 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.690
 Mine values are too low too 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.370
 I think it's good for your laboratory 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.010
 clear castle in the middle is synonymous 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.510
 archery pieces are great as well 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.530
 extremely little class I think great 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.019
 yes, like I said , maybe she's looking for one 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.120
 other stock design is the tip for 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.920
 crash tactics interesting app exists 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:23.630
 Good stock designs mating the not 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:27.569
 use so then we move on 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.670
 and already visitors visit here at 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.160
 What we are both looking for is natural 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.190
 to visit at la jewelry or track 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.370
 so read federal council on stage eight he has 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.599
 his army camp at level six that 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.910
 it does not get much higher 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.849
 He also looked good on the brand 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.410
 the good again a step 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.609
 could be higher or two stages 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.359
 So yes, that should be on everyone 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.010
 case specialize then yes on the 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.250
 archer look great 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.019
 you're building two anti- atoms 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.160
 Piece of the end of the felt 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.739
 archer is also beautiful 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.650
 central of the construction of the 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.380
 to what is on life of the camp master it 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.639
 actually pretty good one says 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.690
 tesla the zero degrees on three expansion 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:17.530
 if I see that right, maybe yes 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.030
 a little early on 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.470
 Town Hall 8 but you have that I guess you 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.609
 because you are with your units 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.730
 when leveling was already so far 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.900
 therefore this is also acceptable your 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.040
 Cannons are already quite far 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.110
 which are now nearing 10 and all 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.970
 yes you do not have your mines and collectors 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.740
 have so far healed that I find 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.210
 also cool so I would too 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.490
 let each case so first 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.630
 you can already build packers that too 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.630
 you do not really need super 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.389
 your moerser gate through now on everyone 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.730
 case also upgrade times otherwise sees 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.900
 It looks pretty good on guns and bow 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:58.960
 for towers all in all good village 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:01.830
 and yes we will continue it you get him 482 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.660
 Of course, I like x-bow right away 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.740
 so lab had already been on the 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.760
 highest level 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.040
 yes that is definitely a little too early 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.260
 City Hall 9 so neither did you see that 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.160
 actually the first look cool 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.840
 that dix bow already both hate and man 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.870
 see if we compare that to now 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.880
 He did not have the courage to the previous one 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.110
 has his archer towers and his 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.970
 Cannons already a whole stage 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.150
 above as you partially natural 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.770
 not all but partial and you would have 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.539
 good and easy on rank eight 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.400
 to stay look he was mine 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.720
 condolences because you meet firstly then 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.669
 even better units and me 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.140
 you do not even have your violence 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.780
 that means you need that lay 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.150
 that just again not even 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.680
 that even that's all up to 188 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.720
 can make your units out too 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.510
 level and has a magician towers 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.220
 definitely too low the arrangement of one 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.680
 I like the atom but they are 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.690
 much too low for your level since 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.240
 Did you just leave more time ? 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:08.229
 on stage eight there are my magicians 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.400
 Thurmann partly already better of 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.630
 the construction during the construction of the warehouse 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.220
 I really like it all 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:17.080
 good stands outside so that's all 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.760
 very cool that the little one can 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.070
 I do not like box is because I 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.020
 can you me yes I would soon 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.470
 try that you still in the middle 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.760
 put yes and thus are already 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.920
 arrived at the end of a very 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.750
 short sequence 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.160
 yes I hope you liked it when 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.750
 he was not present this time, of course 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.770
 Sorry but the accident decides that 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.900
 you are all you are not 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.510
 then you have applied to apply 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.940
 you get that in the first video yes me 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.940
 I'm out of here doing a good job
