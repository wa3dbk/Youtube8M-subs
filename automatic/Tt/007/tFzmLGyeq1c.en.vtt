experience and how it came about yeah

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.720

the<00:00:31.779> idea<00:00:32.050> behind<00:00:32.230> this<00:00:32.439> one<00:00:32.680> was<00:00:32.980> to<00:00:33.310> make

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
the idea behind this one was to make

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.000 
the idea behind this one was to make
ramps<00:00:34.270> that<00:00:34.480> actually<00:00:35.170> made<00:00:35.350> a<00:00:35.380> sound<00:00:35.680> when

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
ramps that actually made a sound when

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.280 
ramps that actually made a sound when
you<00:00:36.190> ride<00:00:36.640> on<00:00:36.820> them<00:00:36.940> so<00:00:37.239> they<00:00:37.899> have<00:00:38.050> some

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
you ride on them so they have some

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.440 
you ride on them so they have some
sensors<00:00:38.680> hooked<00:00:39.010> up<00:00:39.250> as<00:00:39.489> you<00:00:40.120> right<00:00:40.270> across

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
sensors hooked up as you right across

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.810 
sensors hooked up as you right across
the<00:00:40.660> keyboard<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:41.680> makes<00:00:42.010> individual<00:00:42.610> notes

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
the keyboard it makes individual notes

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.390 
the keyboard it makes individual notes
for<00:00:43.030> each<00:00:43.059> key<00:00:43.390> or<00:00:43.540> odd<00:00:43.719> and<00:00:44.020> they<00:00:44.290> have<00:00:44.440> a<00:00:44.470> this

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
for each key or odd and they have a this

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.730 
for each key or odd and they have a this
Flying<00:00:45.730> V<00:00:45.850> guitar<00:00:46.420> wall<00:00:46.660> and<00:00:46.960> as<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:47.290> go<00:00:47.410> up<00:00:47.440> it

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
Flying V guitar wall and as you go up it

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.320 
Flying V guitar wall and as you go up it
it<00:00:48.190> actually<00:00:48.340> is<00:00:48.640> like<00:00:48.820> going<00:00:49.030> up<00:00:49.180> the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
it actually is like going up the

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330 
it actually is like going up the
fretboard<00:00:49.600> on<00:00:50.080> a<00:00:50.110> guitar<00:00:50.290> so<00:00:50.950> it<00:00:51.070> makes<00:00:51.190> a

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
fretboard on a guitar so it makes a

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.010 
fretboard on a guitar so it makes a
louder<00:00:51.550> noise<00:00:51.700> and<00:00:52.270> a<00:00:52.360> deeper<00:00:52.660> noise<00:00:52.810> the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
louder noise and a deeper noise the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.810 
louder noise and a deeper noise the
higher<00:00:53.200> up<00:00:53.350> you<00:00:53.380> go<00:00:53.530> and<00:00:53.950> a<00:00:54.340> few<00:00:54.670> other

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
higher up you go and a few other

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.070
