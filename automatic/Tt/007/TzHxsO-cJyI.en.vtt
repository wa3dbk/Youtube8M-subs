00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
of a good choice in any case for stress

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.100 
of a good choice in any case for stress
is<00:02:53.430> still<00:02:53.579> on<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> field<00:02:54.090> as<00:02:54.390> enemy<00:02:54.810> goes<00:02:54.930> for

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
another i switch is still kind of stupid

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.970 
another i switch is still kind of stupid
because<00:02:57.329> if<00:02:57.780> i<00:02:57.989> was<00:02:58.140> his<00:02:58.290> enemy<00:02:58.410> i<00:02:58.650> would<00:02:58.890> have
