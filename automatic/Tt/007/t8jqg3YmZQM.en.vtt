00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 knows that student who does not participate in 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.010
 afraid of making mistakes and when the student 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.890
 decides not to answer a question for 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.260
 dodging the class without escape is 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.080
 a technique to show that you will not try 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.380
 unacceptable and that the error is part of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.390
 learning how the teacher works 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.149
 calls a student to respond to a 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.670
 asks when the called student does not 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.190
 answer or miss the teacher calls 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.739
 other students in the sequence until 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.140
 someone responds correctly with the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.300
 clear correct answer to the teacher 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.789
 asks students again not to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.460
 answered or erred in a way that they 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.460
 can confirm the response and participate 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.280
 when I said that if I make a 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.250
 So ask the king what the king 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:18.290
 I like bruna, what's the answer? 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:18.290
 Bruna asking the bruna. 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.860
 this is what the king liked best 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.900
 bruno that the king liked best we saw that 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 one student did not answer the question 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.090
 teacher and then another student 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.100
 gave the correct answer then the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.740
 teacher returned the first student 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.730
 so as not to miss out on her chance 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.440
 reply 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.810
 even if the student was only 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.300
 repeating the teacher passed the message 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 that participation is essential 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.070
 this encourages the participation of the next 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.820
 time the student was called now 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.800
 look at another example who knows 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:03.390
 the location of this park that was 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:05.340
 quoted in their text but the country that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.340
 You chose the country where you are located. 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.740
 This park is right, so it is 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.740
 Just what I'm asking Bruno 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:27.120

 with a technique without escape to 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.320
 shows that she does not participate in the 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.110
 class is not an option and that the error may 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.030
 be a step to learn the teacher 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.160
 gives the message that he will not give up 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.350
 of any student and who has high 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.350
