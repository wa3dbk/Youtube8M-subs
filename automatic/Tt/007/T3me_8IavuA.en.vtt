these thanks quite a variety of units

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.860 
these thanks quite a variety of units
which<00:00:03.949> kind<00:00:04.340> of<00:00:04.430> really<00:00:04.759> destroyed<00:00:05.360> my<00:00:05.540> unit

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
which kind of really destroyed my unit

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.139 
which kind of really destroyed my unit

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
ready to own those noobs but if you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.119 
ready to own those noobs but if you
you're<00:00:37.820> starting<00:00:38.059> out<00:00:38.329> a<00:00:38.660> lot<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.410> people<00:00:39.769> do

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
you're starting out a lot of people do

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.549 
you're starting out a lot of people do
not<00:00:40.280> scout<00:00:40.760> at<00:00:41.000> all<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:41.600> I<00:00:41.870> would<00:00:42.140> just<00:00:42.289> take

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
not scout at all so I would just take

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.349 
not scout at all so I would just take
the<00:00:42.710> gold<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:43.280> they<00:00:43.789> would<00:00:43.940> probably<00:00:44.269> never

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
the gold and they would probably never

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.750 
the gold and they would probably never
find<00:00:44.629> out<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:44.960> by<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.350> time<00:00:45.440> they<00:00:45.710> do<00:00:45.769> you've

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
find out and by the time they do you've

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.630 
find out and by the time they do you've
already<00:00:47.030> played<00:00:47.179> paid<00:00:47.690> like<00:00:47.960> four<00:00:48.350> times<00:00:48.679> like

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
already played paid like four times like

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.060 
already played paid like four times like
what<00:00:50.059> it<00:00:50.149> costs<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:50.629> build<00:00:50.839> that<00:00:51.019> hatchery<00:00:51.440> so

blue Terran moving out that skin that's
gonna<00:00:55.010> hurt<00:00:55.309> here<00:00:55.760> because<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.510> don't<00:00:57.230> really

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
gonna hurt here because I don't really

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
have a good unit composition not many

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.540 
have a good unit composition not many
units<00:00:59.480> in<00:00:59.690> one<00:00:59.929> place<00:01:00.109> at<00:01:00.289> all<00:01:00.409> because<00:01:00.920> I<00:01:01.190> just

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
units in one place at all because I just

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.759 
units in one place at all because I just
spent<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.879> whole<00:01:02.149> bunch<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.899> resources<00:01:03.260> on<00:01:03.649> this

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
spent a whole bunch of resources on this

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.410 
spent a whole bunch of resources on this
hatchery<00:01:04.010> here<00:01:04.339> there<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:05.239> go

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
hatchery here there you go

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.030 
hatchery here there you go
systematically<00:01:05.960> getting<00:01:06.530> raped<00:01:06.800> by

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
systematically getting raped by

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.160 
systematically getting raped by
everything<00:01:07.610> these<00:01:08.240> siege<00:01:08.570> tanks<00:01:08.990> just

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
everything these siege tanks just

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.830 
everything these siege tanks just
sniping<00:01:09.590> everything<00:01:10.250> I've<00:01:10.370> got<00:01:10.580> I<00:01:10.940> was

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
sniping everything I've got I was

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.570 
sniping everything I've got I was
hydrolysed<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:12.560> they<00:01:12.770> held<00:01:12.950> up<00:01:13.100> quite<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.370> bit

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
hydrolysed so they held up quite a bit

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.600 
hydrolysed so they held up quite a bit
but<00:01:14.390> their<00:01:14.540> tanks<00:01:14.900> are<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.050> really<00:01:15.680> payment<00:01:16.160> ass

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
but their tanks are a really payment ass

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.270 
but their tanks are a really payment ass
right<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:17.120> if<00:01:17.270> they<00:01:17.450> had<00:01:17.600> siege<00:01:18.410> tank<00:01:18.680> ability

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
right now if they had siege tank ability

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.620 
right now if they had siege tank ability
researched<00:01:19.760> I<00:01:19.880> probably<00:01:20.090> be<00:01:20.240> dead<00:01:20.390> right<00:01:20.570> now

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
researched I probably be dead right now

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.680 
researched I probably be dead right now
but<00:01:20.990> who<00:01:21.500> spine<00:01:22.010> crawler<00:01:22.280> Justin<00:01:22.880> sniped<00:01:23.300> one

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
but who spine crawler Justin sniped one

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.140 
but who spine crawler Justin sniped one
of<00:01:23.840> those<00:01:23.990> Marauders<00:01:24.550> that<00:01:25.550> was<00:01:25.700> pretty<00:01:25.910> cool

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
of those Marauders that was pretty cool

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.020 
of those Marauders that was pretty cool
Here<00:01:27.140> Come<00:01:27.260> roaches<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:27.860> hydraulics<00:01:28.340> I<00:01:28.610> kind

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
Here Come roaches and hydraulics I kind

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.240 
Here Come roaches and hydraulics I kind
of<00:01:29.090> stupidly<00:01:29.540> move<00:01:29.840> them<00:01:29.960> toward<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.500> siege

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
of stupidly move them toward the siege

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.460 
of stupidly move them toward the siege
tanks<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:31.850> it's<00:01:32.600> kind<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.810> a<00:01:32.900> waste<00:01:33.140> here

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
tanks and it's kind of a waste here

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.980 
tanks and it's kind of a waste here
because<00:01:33.740> I<00:01:33.830> don't<00:01:34.010> really<00:01:34.130> kill<00:01:34.460> much<00:01:34.990> but

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
because I don't really kill much but

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.890 
because I don't really kill much but
making<00:01:36.620> zerglings<00:01:37.420> moving<00:01:38.420> four<00:01:38.690> of<00:01:38.780> them

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
making zerglings moving four of them

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.110 
making zerglings moving four of them
there<00:01:39.340> they're<00:01:40.340> going<00:01:40.520> is<00:01:40.640> really<00:01:40.970> good

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
there they're going is really good

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.490 
there they're going is really good
against<00:01:41.390> siege<00:01:41.660> tanks<00:01:41.960> I've<00:01:42.080> got<00:01:42.230> to<00:01:42.380> say

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
against siege tanks I've got to say

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.250 
against siege tanks I've got to say
because<00:01:42.650> they're<00:01:42.920> quick<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:44.630> don't<00:01:44.870> get<00:01:44.960> shot

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
because they're quick so don't get shot

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.560 
because they're quick so don't get shot
a<00:01:45.290> lot<00:01:45.610> or<00:01:46.610> but<00:01:46.790> like<00:01:46.940> one<00:01:47.120> shot<00:01:47.300> will<00:01:47.450> kill

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
a lot or but like one shot will kill

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.930 
a lot or but like one shot will kill
them<00:01:47.690> I<00:01:47.810> think<00:01:47.870> but<00:01:48.170> they<00:01:49.070> really<00:01:49.490> quickly

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
them I think but they really quickly

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.330 
them I think but they really quickly
surround<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.300> siege<00:01:50.480> tank<00:01:50.750> not<00:01:51.740> allowing<00:01:52.040> it

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
surround the siege tank not allowing it

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.410 
surround the siege tank not allowing it
to<00:01:52.370> really<00:01:52.880> do<00:01:53.270> much<00:01:53.420> damage

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
to really do much damage

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.120 
to really do much damage
we<00:01:54.750> would<00:01:54.900> like<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> whole<00:01:55.320> group<00:01:55.530> because

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
we would like the whole group because

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.410 
we would like the whole group because
they're<00:01:56.280> spread<00:01:56.460> out<00:01:56.490> watch<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:56.970> just<00:01:57.240> see

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
they're spread out watch this just see

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.570 
they're spread out watch this just see
they<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.320> instantly<00:01:58.799> spread<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.310> around

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
they just instantly spread out around

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.039 
they just instantly spread out around
the<00:01:59.850> unit<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.509> see<00:02:01.500> stank<00:02:01.799> gone<00:02:02.960> tearing<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the unit and see stank gone tearing you

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.980 
the unit and see stank gone tearing you
now<00:02:04.710> going<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.250> his<00:02:05.369> expansion<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.720> is<00:02:06.960> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
now going for his expansion this is a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.040 
now going for his expansion this is a
pretty<00:02:07.200> sneaky<00:02:07.409> expansion<00:02:08.069> too<00:02:08.220> um<00:02:08.929> but<00:02:09.929> if

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
pretty sneaky expansion too um but if

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.180 
pretty sneaky expansion too um but if
you're<00:02:10.200> playing<00:02:10.410> against<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.739> zerg<00:02:10.890> player<00:02:11.009> I

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
you're playing against the zerg player I

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.710 
you're playing against the zerg player I
wouldn't<00:02:11.580> recommend<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.209> because<00:02:12.330> they've

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
wouldn't recommend it because they've

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.090 
wouldn't recommend it because they've
probably<00:02:12.900> got<00:02:13.050> an<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:13.350> they're<00:02:13.590> smart<00:02:13.860> they

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
probably got an if they're smart they

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.250 
probably got an if they're smart they
have<00:02:14.220> an<00:02:14.370> overlord<00:02:14.760> there<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.090> they'll<00:02:16.080> know

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
have an overlord there and they'll know

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.020 
have an overlord there and they'll know
they'll<00:02:16.739> know<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.010> you've<00:02:17.160> got<00:02:17.310> an<00:02:17.430> expansion

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
they'll know if you've got an expansion

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.320 
they'll know if you've got an expansion
up<00:02:18.150> here<00:02:18.800> hey<00:02:19.800> well<00:02:19.980> no<00:02:20.160> because<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.850> will<00:02:21.180> know

soon you'll see in this video he tries

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.770 
soon you'll see in this video he tries
to<00:02:23.760> expand<00:02:24.180> their<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.980> yeah<00:02:26.190> there<00:02:26.400> we<00:02:26.489> go<00:02:26.780> mmm

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
to expand their so yeah there we go mmm

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.640 
to expand their so yeah there we go mmm
just<00:02:28.620> making<00:02:28.980> more<00:02:29.190> larva<00:02:29.640> or<00:02:30.019> larvae<00:02:31.019> larva

whatever you know spreading this gunk
around<00:02:36.410> make<00:02:37.410> my<00:02:37.590> units<00:02:37.920> go<00:02:38.100> faster<00:02:38.549> make<00:02:39.540> more

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
around make my units go faster make more

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.930 
around make my units go faster make more
hydraulics<00:02:40.290> make<00:02:40.500> more<00:02:40.680> everything<00:02:41.069> this<00:02:41.730> is

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
hydraulics make more everything this is

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.580 
hydraulics make more everything this is
the<00:02:42.269> time<00:02:42.480> where<00:02:42.660> I'm<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:42.810> like<00:02:43.230> gathering

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
the time where I'm just like gathering

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.759 
the time where I'm just like gathering
materials<00:02:44.459> got<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.420> shit<00:02:46.110> ton<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.380> vespene<00:02:46.769> gas

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
materials got a shit ton of vespene gas

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.979 
materials got a shit ton of vespene gas
but<00:02:47.610> not<00:02:47.790> really<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.390> minerals<00:02:48.690> I'm<00:02:48.810> going<00:02:48.930> to

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
but not really the minerals I'm going to

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.650 
but not really the minerals I'm going to
skyrocket<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.069> minerals<00:02:50.489> soon<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:51.180> that'll

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
skyrocket and minerals soon and that'll

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.449 
skyrocket and minerals soon and that'll
allow<00:02:51.810> me<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.140> make<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.440> shit<00:02:52.799> ton<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.010> muta<00:02:53.250> list

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
allow me to make a shit ton of muta list

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.000 
allow me to make a shit ton of muta list
hydralisk<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.540> roaches<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.230> allow<00:02:55.830> me

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
hydralisk and roaches and just allow me

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.849 
hydralisk and roaches and just allow me
to<00:02:56.100> keep<00:02:56.310> pumping<00:02:56.760> them<00:02:56.880> out<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.739> this<00:02:58.739> is

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
to keep pumping them out and this is

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.949 
to keep pumping them out and this is
where<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.430> basically<00:02:59.700> out<00:03:00.180> macro<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.840> other

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
where you basically out macro the other

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.420 
where you basically out macro the other
player<00:03:01.260> because<00:03:01.590> there's<00:03:01.769> no<00:03:01.890> combat<00:03:02.190> going

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430

player because there's no combat going
around<00:03:02.609> you're<00:03:03.329> just<00:03:03.510> gotten<00:03:03.950> maximize<00:03:04.950> as

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
around you're just gotten maximize as

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.310 
around you're just gotten maximize as
many<00:03:05.430> resources<00:03:05.670> as<00:03:06.030> you<00:03:06.209> can<00:03:06.390> build<00:03:07.140> up<00:03:07.260> your

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
many resources as you can build up your

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.340 
many resources as you can build up your
army<00:03:07.739> either<00:03:08.519> defend<00:03:08.940> or<00:03:09.209> attack<00:03:09.420> or<00:03:09.930> spread

army either defend or attack or spread

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.440 
army either defend or attack or spread
if<00:03:10.530> you're<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.310> would<00:03:11.579> recommend<00:03:11.850> if<00:03:12.090> you're<00:03:12.180> on

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
if you're I would recommend if you're on

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.250 
if you're I would recommend if you're on
the<00:03:12.480> attacking<00:03:12.900> side<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.910> you're<00:03:14.910> winning

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
the attacking side and you're winning

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.229 
the attacking side and you're winning
best<00:03:16.260> time<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.709> expand<00:03:17.100> because<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:18.060> going

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
best time to expand because it's going

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.759 
best time to expand because it's going
to<00:03:18.299> take<00:03:18.510> them<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.870> while<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.140> get<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.560> that

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
to take them a while to get to that

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.340 
to take them a while to get to that
expansion<00:03:20.220> or<00:03:20.609> if<00:03:20.940> they<00:03:21.120> even<00:03:21.150> do<00:03:21.540> like<00:03:21.570> just

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
expansion or if they even do like just

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.780 
expansion or if they even do like just
harassing<00:03:22.890> them<00:03:22.980> will<00:03:23.130> piss<00:03:23.310> them<00:03:23.489> off<00:03:23.579> and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
harassing them will piss them off and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.819 
harassing them will piss them off and
make<00:03:24.420> them<00:03:24.630> defensive<00:03:25.260> they're<00:03:25.530> not<00:03:25.680> going<00:03:25.769> to

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
make them defensive they're not going to

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.430 
make them defensive they're not going to
want<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.100> push<00:03:26.310> out<00:03:26.519> because<00:03:27.049> he'll<00:03:28.049> who<00:03:28.410> knows

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
want to push out because he'll who knows

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.370 
want to push out because he'll who knows
what<00:03:28.859> else<00:03:28.890> you've<00:03:29.100> got<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.519> know<00:03:30.079> but<00:03:31.079> if

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
what else you've got you know but if

what else you've got you know but if
they're<00:03:31.859> attacking<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.400> you've<00:03:32.670> got<00:03:32.850> to

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
they're attacking you you've got to

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.610 
they're attacking you you've got to
watch<00:03:33.060> out<00:03:33.239> for<00:03:33.299> those<00:03:33.570> extra<00:03:33.959> expansions<00:03:34.500> you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
watch out for those extra expansions you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.099 
watch out for those extra expansions you
got<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.859> make<00:03:35.010> sure<00:03:35.040> you're<00:03:35.850> watching<00:03:36.269> them<00:03:36.420> so

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
got to make sure you're watching them so

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.390 
got to make sure you're watching them so
it's<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.290> lot<00:03:37.470> more<00:03:37.500> stressful<00:03:37.890> when<00:03:38.130> you're<00:03:38.280> on

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
it's a lot more stressful when you're on

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.300 
it's a lot more stressful when you're on
the<00:03:38.430> defensive<00:03:38.910> end<00:03:39.799> so<00:03:40.799> there's<00:03:41.160> my

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
the defensive end so there's my

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.699 
the defensive end so there's my
evolution<00:03:42.060> chamber<00:03:42.359> going<00:03:42.989> up<00:03:43.140> I'm<00:03:43.530> going<00:03:43.650> to

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
evolution chamber going up I'm going to

destructible rocks here this is a really
good<00:03:53.280> way<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.519> getting<00:03:53.880> to<00:03:54.150> your<00:03:54.299> enemy<00:03:54.690> real

good way of getting to your enemy real
quickly<00:03:55.319> that's<00:03:56.069> that's<00:03:56.639> not<00:03:56.819> even<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.120> far

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
quickly that's that's not even that far

honestly like you destroy these two

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.640 
honestly like you destroy these two
rocks<00:03:59.069> they're<00:03:59.280> just<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.670> a<00:04:00.290> couple<00:04:01.290> feet

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
rocks they're just like a couple feet

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.710 
rocks they're just like a couple feet
will<00:04:02.010> not<00:04:02.220> feed<00:04:02.549> but<00:04:02.760> whatever<00:04:03.060> they're

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
will not feed but whatever they're

will not feed but whatever they're
pretty<00:04:03.870> close<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.140> each<00:04:04.349> other<00:04:04.440> these

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
pretty close to each other these

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.680 
pretty close to each other these
destructible<00:04:05.310> debris<00:04:05.640> comes<00:04:06.060> really<00:04:06.599> in

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
destructible debris comes really in

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.370 
destructible debris comes really in
handy<00:04:07.019> though

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
handy though

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.580 
handy though
it<00:04:08.010> allows<00:04:08.310> me<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.610> defend<00:04:08.940> my<00:04:09.120> main<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.750> my

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
it allows me to defend my main and my

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.590 
it allows me to defend my main and my
natural<00:04:11.100> expansion<00:04:11.370> in<00:04:11.820> this<00:04:12.060> one<00:04:12.240> time<00:04:12.450> you

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
natural expansion in this one time you

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.240 
natural expansion in this one time you
choke<00:04:12.780> point<00:04:13.020> and<00:04:13.230> here<00:04:13.890> we<00:04:14.010> go<00:04:14.040> another

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
choke point and here we go another

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.550 
choke point and here we go another
attack<00:04:14.760> from<00:04:15.060> them<00:04:15.270> but<00:04:15.930> they're<00:04:16.230> running

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
attack from them but they're running

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.150 
attack from them but they're running
away<00:04:16.800> like<00:04:16.830> little<00:04:17.370> girls<00:04:17.550> so<00:04:18.680> yeah<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.860> allows

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
away like little girls so yeah it allows

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.570 
away like little girls so yeah it allows
me<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.489> defend<00:04:20.850> my<00:04:21.270> to<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.989> bases<00:04:22.920> with<00:04:23.400> one

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
me to defend my to a bases with one

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
me to defend my to a bases with one
choke<00:04:23.790> point<00:04:24.740> even<00:04:25.740> here<00:04:26.070> even<00:04:26.670> if<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.480> guy

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
choke point even here even if the guy

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.570 
choke point even here even if the guy
doesn't<00:04:27.660> go<00:04:28.020> for<00:04:28.200> these<00:04:28.290> I'd<00:04:28.860> put<00:04:29.070> an<00:04:29.160> overlord

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
doesn't go for these I'd put an overlord

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.070 
doesn't go for these I'd put an overlord
here<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:30.240> if<00:04:30.360> you're<00:04:30.480> seeing<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.870> they're

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
here so if you're seeing that they're

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.300 
here so if you're seeing that they're
not<00:04:31.200> even<00:04:31.410> destroying<00:04:31.740> these<00:04:31.860> rocks<00:04:32.130> you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
not even destroying these rocks you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.890 
not even destroying these rocks you
could<00:04:32.460> probably<00:04:32.850> hold<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.270> right<00:04:33.450> here<00:04:33.510> this

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
could probably hold it right here this

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.870 
could probably hold it right here this
would<00:04:34.050> be<00:04:34.140> a<00:04:34.170> perfect<00:04:34.500> choke<00:04:34.980> for<00:04:35.190> them<00:04:35.280> or<00:04:35.820> for

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
would be a perfect choke for them or for

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.330 
would be a perfect choke for them or for
you<00:04:36.120> anyway<00:04:36.480> because<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:37.680> can<00:04:37.830> put<00:04:37.980> your<00:04:38.130> main

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
you anyway because you can put your main

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.250 
you anyway because you can put your main
bulk<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.670> your<00:04:38.730> army<00:04:39.060> like<00:04:39.240> roaches<00:04:39.540> circlings

good okay so trying to maximize all the
resources<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:31.159> can<00:06:31.189> by<00:06:31.639> building<00:06:32.029> these<00:06:32.119> two

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
resources I can by building these two

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.450 
resources I can by building these two
extractors<00:06:32.779> and<00:06:32.960> making<00:06:33.259> even<00:06:33.889> more<00:06:34.009> drones

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
extractors and making even more drones

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.339 
extractors and making even more drones
and<00:06:34.879> putting<00:06:35.449> them<00:06:35.569> on<00:06:35.749> to<00:06:35.930> these<00:06:36.050> little

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349 
and putting them on to these little

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:38.619 
and putting them on to these little
things<00:06:36.379> these<00:06:36.830> little<00:06:37.099> extractors<00:06:37.729> so<00:06:38.509> you

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:38.629 
things these little extractors so you

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:42.279 
things these little extractors so you
get<00:06:38.839> some<00:06:38.869> more<00:06:39.110> vespene<00:06:39.289> gas<00:06:39.550> and<00:06:41.139> this<00:06:42.139> is

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
get some more vespene gas and this is

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.469 
get some more vespene gas and this is
quite<00:06:42.499> a<00:06:42.529> sizable<00:06:43.039> army<00:06:43.279> right<00:06:43.550> here<00:06:43.789> got

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
quite a sizable army right here got

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.329 
quite a sizable army right here got
roaches<00:06:44.689> and<00:06:45.020> hydras<00:06:45.349> in<00:06:45.469> a<00:06:45.559> couple<00:06:46.279> of

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:46.339 
roaches and hydras in a couple of

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.909 
roaches and hydras in a couple of
zerglings<00:06:46.639> in<00:06:46.999> the<00:06:47.089> mix<00:06:47.270> and<00:06:47.559> I<00:06:48.559> think<00:06:48.800> I've

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
zerglings in the mix and I think I've

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.950 
zerglings in the mix and I think I've
got<00:06:49.099> a<00:06:49.129> a<00:06:49.399> crap<00:06:49.819> ton<00:06:49.849> of<00:06:50.180> muta<00:06:50.449> lists<00:06:50.719> being

got plenty of minerals and gas to defend

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:39.820 
got plenty of minerals and gas to defend
I<00:07:37.939> could<00:07:38.509> just<00:07:38.629> move<00:07:38.839> this<00:07:39.050> army<00:07:39.409> back<00:07:39.620> and

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 
I could just move this army back and

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.509 
I could just move this army back and
quickly<00:07:40.300> once<00:07:41.300> they<00:07:41.449> take<00:07:41.629> this<00:07:41.809> out<00:07:42.050> I

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:42.519 
quickly once they take this out I

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:44.920
