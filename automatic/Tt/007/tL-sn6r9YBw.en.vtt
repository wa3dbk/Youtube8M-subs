right up and down trying to dodge the
bullets<00:00:25.350> from<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.560> time<00:00:26.720> this<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
bullets from the time this is the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.650 
bullets from the time this is the
torrent<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.800> created<00:00:29.210> it's<00:00:30.210> pretty

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
torrent here that I created it's pretty

torrent here that I created it's pretty
basic<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.529> made<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> cube<00:00:32.130> with<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> cylinder

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
basic I just made a cube with a cylinder

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.420 
basic I just made a cube with a cylinder
attached<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> center<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.800> acting<00:00:35.250> as

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
attached to it the center is acting as

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.569 
attached to it the center is acting as
the<00:00:35.730> barrel<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.420> turn<00:00:37.040> nothing<00:00:38.040> fancy

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
here I have a empty game object right in

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.500 
here I have a empty game object right in
front<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> turn<00:00:44.250> which<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.289> used<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.739> fire

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
front of the turn which is used to fire

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.740 
front of the turn which is used to fire
the<00:00:48.510> time<00:00:49.670> let's<00:00:50.670> jump<00:00:50.850> right<00:00:50.940> into<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.510> code

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the time let's jump right into the code

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
the time let's jump right into the code
and<00:00:52.850> this<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:56.000> this

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.160 
and this is what I have here now this
firing<00:00:58.730> function<00:00:59.730> here<00:00:59.940> shoot<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.600> actually

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
firing function here shoot I actually

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.640 
firing function here shoot I actually
got<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.070> from<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:03.059> tutorial<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.080> seen<00:01:04.470> on

redoing a tutorial that they did reason
being<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.560> I've<00:01:23.130> seen<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> way<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.000> could

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
being is I've seen a way that they could

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.120 
being is I've seen a way that they could
have<00:01:24.270> made<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> little<00:01:24.930> bit<00:01:25.200> easier<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
have made it a little bit easier for the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.020 
have made it a little bit easier for the
user<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> understand<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:29.280> one<00:01:29.460> aspect

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
user to understand and that one aspect

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.069 
user to understand and that one aspect
was<00:01:30.860> delaying<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.100> shots<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.939> between<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
was delaying the shots in between the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.420 
was delaying the shots in between the
turn<00:01:34.829> firing<00:01:36.020> okay<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.770> let's<00:01:37.950> start<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
turn firing okay so let's start from the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.810 
turn firing okay so let's start from the
beginning<00:01:39.140> first<00:01:40.140> thing<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:41.100> when<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> turn

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
beginning first thing that when I turn

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.749 
beginning first thing that when I turn
to<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.450> find<00:01:42.899> our<00:01:43.140> target<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> made<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
to do is find our target so I made a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.210 
to do is find our target so I made a
variable<00:01:45.210> find<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.829> allows

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
variable find here and this just allows

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.399 
variable find here and this just allows
two<00:01:47.759> trying<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.420> able<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.840> look<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.229> the

function here this transform dot look at

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.530 
function here this transform dot look at
this<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> very<00:02:34.560> powerful<00:02:35.130> functional<00:02:36.060> unity

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
this is a very powerful functional unity

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.170 
this is a very powerful functional unity
it's<00:02:37.530> very<00:02:37.860> simple<00:02:38.370> other<00:02:38.640> programming

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
it's very simple other programming

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.990 
it's very simple other programming
languages<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:40.800> will<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.600> basically

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
languages you will have to basically

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.670 
languages you will have to basically
step<00:02:45.000> by<00:02:45.060> step<00:02:45.660> look<00:02:45.930> at<00:02:46.260> each<00:02:46.640> vector<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.680> map

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
step by step look at each vector and map

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.850 
step by step look at each vector and map
that<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:51.120> our<00:02:51.269> turn<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.930> look<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.440> capsule

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
that to our turn to look at the capsule

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.170 
that to our turn to look at the capsule
but<00:02:52.970> UNC<00:02:53.970> does<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.390> all<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:54.840> us<00:02:56.030> which<00:02:57.030> it

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
but UNC does it all for us which it

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.809 
but UNC does it all for us which it
basically<00:02:57.569> all<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.959> does<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.530> each<00:02:58.890> time<00:02:58.950> unity

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
basically all it does is each time unity

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.080 
basically all it does is each time unity
updates<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.840> tells<00:03:01.470> our<00:03:01.680> turn<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.340> look<00:03:02.549> at<00:03:02.790> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
updates it tells our turn to look at the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.130 
updates it tells our turn to look at the
position<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.900> capsule<00:03:05.959> next<00:03:06.959> here<00:03:07.110> we

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
position of the capsule next here we

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.699 
position of the capsule next here we
have<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:09.470> check<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.709> time<00:03:12.350> just<00:03:13.350> basically

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
have to check the time just basically

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.190 
have to check the time just basically
test<00:03:14.130> to<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.459> if<00:03:14.489> it's<00:03:14.790> time<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.150> fire<00:03:15.420> this

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
test to see if it's time to fire this

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.130 
test to see if it's time to fire this
function<00:03:16.709> here<00:03:17.010> time<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:18.060> time<00:03:18.329> UNC<00:03:18.930> has

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
function here time that time UNC has

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.190 
function here time that time UNC has
which<00:03:19.799> just<00:03:20.220> gives<00:03:20.430> us<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.760> time<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.600> unity

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
which just gives us the time of unity

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.380 
which just gives us the time of unity
and<00:03:22.410> we're<00:03:22.980> gonna<00:03:23.100> compare<00:03:23.579> that<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.850> next

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
and we're gonna compare that to next

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.259 
and we're gonna compare that to next
time<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.350> if<00:03:25.620> time<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.160> time<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.910> greater

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
time and if time that time is greater

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.729 
time and if time that time is greater
than<00:03:27.510> next<00:03:27.840> time<00:03:28.049> then<00:03:28.470> why<00:03:29.040> life<00:03:29.250> we<00:03:29.519> shoot

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
than next time then why life we shoot

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.690 
than next time then why life we shoot
after<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.920> we're<00:03:32.100> going<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.250> update<00:03:32.670> our

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
after that we're going to update our

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.080 
after that we're going to update our
next<00:03:33.209> time<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.720> add<00:03:34.170> delay<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:35.489> we<00:03:35.910> can

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
next time and add delay to it so we can

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.560 
next time and add delay to it so we can
regulate<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.290> shooting<00:03:37.760> it's<00:03:38.760> firing<00:03:39.060> script

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
regulate the shooting it's firing script

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.780 
regulate the shooting it's firing script
it's<00:03:39.840> pretty<00:03:40.200> straightforward<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:41.760> just

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
it's pretty straightforward you just

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.979 
it's pretty straightforward you just
grabs<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.720> use<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.320> initiate<00:03:44.750> function<00:03:45.750> and

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
grabs the use the initiate function and

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.240 
grabs the use the initiate function and
it<00:03:46.350> grabs<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.890> ammo<00:03:47.549> prefab<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:49.040> what<00:03:50.040> this

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
it grabs the ammo prefab and what this

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.630 
it grabs the ammo prefab and what this
transform<00:03:50.940> dot<00:03:51.120> by<00:03:51.390> here<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:52.100> actually<00:03:53.100> finds

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
transform dot by here is actually finds

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.330 
transform dot by here is actually finds
our<00:03:53.760> empty<00:03:54.209> object<00:03:54.410> which<00:03:55.410> once<00:03:55.859> again<00:03:56.160> it's

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
our empty object which once again it's

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.390 
our empty object which once again it's
right<00:03:56.519> in<00:03:56.670> front<00:03:56.880> of<00:03:57.030> barrel<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.630> we<00:03:58.590> position

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
right in front of barrel and we position

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.000 
right in front of barrel and we position
it<00:03:59.519> correctly<00:03:59.670> and<00:04:00.269> we<00:04:00.720> fire<00:04:00.989> for

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
it correctly and we fire for

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.140 
it correctly and we fire for
the<00:04:02.430> mo<00:04:02.610> rigidbody<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.720> add<00:04:03.930> force<00:04:05.150> so

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
the mo rigidbody that add force so

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.479 
the mo rigidbody that add force so
that's<00:04:06.329> pretty<00:04:06.540> much<00:04:06.659> it<00:04:06.840> for<00:04:07.319> the<00:04:07.439> script<00:04:07.799> as

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
that's pretty much it for the script as

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.520 
that's pretty much it for the script as
always<00:04:09.030> I'll<00:04:09.420> post<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:10.110> in<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.590> tutorial<00:04:12.530> so

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
I'll beginning unity users I'm going to

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.330 
I'll beginning unity users I'm going to
go<00:04:26.310> ahead<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.760> run<00:04:27.300> this<00:04:27.530> thing<00:04:28.530> well<00:04:29.010> right

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
go ahead and run this thing well right

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.460 
go ahead and run this thing well right
before<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:29.699> run<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.240> want<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.690> show<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.380> a

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
before I run it I want to show you a

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.640 
before I run it I want to show you a
couple<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.860> things<00:04:31.949> that<00:04:32.490> find<00:04:33.180> variable<00:04:33.810> I

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
couple of things that find variable I

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.010 
couple of things that find variable I
just<00:04:35.400> added<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.880> capsule<00:04:36.389> right<00:04:36.570> here

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
just added the capsule right here

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.460 
just added the capsule right here
our<00:04:37.350> target<00:04:38.090> added<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.419> 5<00:04:39.660> variable<00:04:40.229> here

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
our target added to the 5 variable here

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.590 
our target added to the 5 variable here
and<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:41.910> ammo<00:04:42.240> prefab<00:04:42.930> which<00:04:43.470> is<00:04:44.060> this<00:04:45.060> prefab

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
and the ammo prefab which is this prefab

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.750 
and the ammo prefab which is this prefab
I<00:04:45.810> created<00:04:46.229> right<00:04:46.440> here<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:47.220> like<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.520> said

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
I created right here and like I said

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.520 
I created right here and like I said
it's<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.060> spear<00:04:48.479> we're<00:04:49.020> going<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.229> use<00:04:49.380> this

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
it's a spear we're going to use this

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.200 
it's a spear we're going to use this
bullets<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:51.680> finally<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.979> delay<00:04:53.340> it's<00:04:53.850> very

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
bullets and finally the delay it's very

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.770 
bullets and finally the delay it's very
important<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:54.960> set<00:04:55.500> my<00:04:55.680> delay<00:04:56.010> at<00:04:56.190> point<00:04:56.490> three

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
important I set my delay at point three

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.779 
important I set my delay at point three
this<00:04:57.780> is<00:04:57.960> how<00:04:58.080> rapid<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.650> want<00:04:58.919> my<00:04:59.039> turn<00:04:59.310> to<00:04:59.520> fire

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
this is how rapid I want my turn to fire

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.570 
this is how rapid I want my turn to fire
you<00:05:00.060> could<00:05:00.210> say<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.660> whatever<00:05:00.990> you<00:05:01.289> like<00:05:01.580> and

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
you could say that whatever you like and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.000 
you could say that whatever you like and
I've<00:05:03.180> changed<00:05:03.660> that<00:05:03.840> once<00:05:04.169> I<00:05:04.350> play<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.800> video

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
I've changed that once I play the video

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.300 
I've changed that once I play the video
just<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.550> give<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.910> guys<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:06.720> view<00:05:07.500> of<00:05:07.710> how

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
just to give you guys a view of how

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.820 
just to give you guys a view of how
different<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:09.000> delay<00:05:09.330> can<00:05:09.539> be<00:05:09.570> so<00:05:10.560> let's<00:05:10.710> go

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
different the delay can be so let's go

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.400 
different the delay can be so let's go
ahead<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.039> play<00:05:11.250> our<00:05:11.430> scene<00:05:14.930> so<00:05:15.930> right<00:05:16.229> now

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
ahead and play our scene so right now

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:25.360 
ahead and play our scene so right now
firing<00:05:17.310> at<00:05:17.639> point<00:05:17.970> three<00:05:18.770> seconds

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.210 

you<00:05:26.030> see<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:27.020> tire<00:05:27.260> follows<00:05:27.740> you<00:05:27.830> if<00:05:27.979> you<00:05:28.070> go

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
you see the tire follows you if you go

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.300 
you see the tire follows you if you go
up<00:05:28.460> down<00:05:29.290> right<00:05:30.290> left<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:33.680> all<00:05:33.830> it<00:05:33.979> does<00:05:34.100> is

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
up down right left and all it does is

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.050 
up down right left and all it does is
rotate<00:05:34.850> it<00:05:35.000> doesn't<00:05:35.419> move<00:05:35.600> so<00:05:36.910> it's<00:05:37.910> pretty

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
rotate it doesn't move so it's pretty

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.320 
rotate it doesn't move so it's pretty
cool<00:05:40.240> let's<00:05:41.240> put<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.510> higher<00:05:42.050> delay<00:05:42.530> rate<00:05:43.330> say

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
cool let's put a higher delay rate say

00:05:44.330 --> 00:06:04.200 
cool let's put a higher delay rate say
one<00:05:46.630> play<00:05:50.199> see<00:05:51.199> fires<00:05:51.530> a<00:05:51.770> slower<00:05:52.190> rate

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.630 

so<00:06:04.750> again<00:06:05.050> you<00:06:05.200> can<00:06:05.350> adjust<00:06:05.470> your<00:06:05.830> rate<00:06:06.160> in

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
so again you can adjust your rate in

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.300 
so again you can adjust your rate in
your<00:06:06.850> game<00:06:07.150> is<00:06:07.480> whatever<00:06:08.140> you<00:06:08.380> want<00:06:08.440> to<00:06:09.040> have

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
your game is whatever you want to have

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.510 
your game is whatever you want to have
your<00:06:09.460> turn<00:06:09.760> fire<00:06:10.120> your<00:06:10.590> fire<00:06:11.590> at<00:06:11.770> your<00:06:11.920> enemies

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
your turn fire your fire at your enemies

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.360 
your turn fire your fire at your enemies
as<00:06:13.300> fast<00:06:13.630> as<00:06:13.810> they<00:06:13.900> want<00:06:14.080> so<00:06:14.920> this<00:06:15.040> is<00:06:15.250> what

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
as fast as they want so this is what

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.400 
as fast as they want so this is what
happens<00:06:15.700> when<00:06:15.790> you<00:06:15.880> set<00:06:16.150> a<00:06:16.180> zero<00:06:16.330> some<00:06:17.110> pretty

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
happens when you set a zero some pretty

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:25.080 
happens when you set a zero some pretty
cool<00:06:17.620> die<00:06:17.860> happen

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.630 

cease<00:06:25.690> firing<00:06:26.140> just<00:06:26.560> constantly<00:06:27.070> firing<00:06:27.520> that

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
cease firing just constantly firing that

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.670 
cease firing just constantly firing that
update<00:06:28.090> function<00:06:28.540> is<00:06:28.660> getting<00:06:29.020> called<00:06:29.230> every

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
update function is getting called every

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.830 
update function is getting called every
like<00:06:29.860> millisecond<00:06:30.610> so<00:06:30.850> it's<00:06:31.510> going<00:06:31.810> pretty

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
like millisecond so it's going pretty

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.710 
like millisecond so it's going pretty
quick

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.380 

so<00:06:38.290> once<00:06:38.470> again<00:06:38.590> I<00:06:38.800> like<00:06:38.950> to<00:06:39.010> keep<00:06:39.250> mine<00:06:39.490> at<00:06:39.520> 0.3

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
so once again I like to keep mine at 0.3

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.230 
so once again I like to keep mine at 0.3
