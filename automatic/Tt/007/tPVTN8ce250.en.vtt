00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.150 
from these late seventies eighties
probably<00:04:07.470> actually<00:04:08.470> belong<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.680> me<00:04:08.950> some

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
probably actually belong to me some

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.330 
probably actually belong to me some
peach<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:10.050> some<00:04:11.050> caring<00:04:11.470> juice<00:04:11.680> for<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.190> as

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
peach and some caring juice for it as

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.020 
peach and some caring juice for it as
well<00:04:12.550> so<00:04:13.800> well<00:04:14.800> we've<00:04:15.010> got<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.400> set<00:04:15.640> up<00:04:15.820> well

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
well so well we've got this set up well

00:04:16.030 --> 00:05:13.610 
well so well we've got this set up well
give<00:04:16.930> this<00:04:17.049> on<00:04:17.230> a<00:04:17.260> spin<00:04:17.590> as<00:04:17.739> well

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.790 

he<00:05:14.620> stopped<00:05:15.100> in<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.340> virtual<00:05:15.640> design<00:05:15.970> place<00:05:16.270> I

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.420 

think<00:05:20.800> we<00:05:21.100> can<00:05:21.250> see<00:05:21.490> here<00:05:21.850> that<00:05:22.060> say<00:05:23.430> motors

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
think we can see here that say motors

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.230 
think we can see here that say motors
pretty<00:05:25.150> much<00:05:25.570> an<00:05:25.840> identical<00:05:26.500> really<00:05:27.240> mounting

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
pretty much an identical really mounting

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.380 
pretty much an identical really mounting
at<00:05:28.360> the<00:05:28.450> front<00:05:28.660> line<00:05:28.900> for<00:05:29.940> wheels<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:33.430> molded

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
at the front line for wheels the molded

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.860 
at the front line for wheels the molded
coupling<00:05:34.750> at<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.930> back<00:05:36.510> suppose<00:05:37.510> you<00:05:37.690> could

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
coupling at the back suppose you could

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:49.130 
coupling at the back suppose you could
actually<00:05:38.080> exchange<00:05:38.650> them<00:05:40.530> so<00:05:41.530> you'd<00:05:42.400> want

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.100 

just<00:05:50.140> for<00:05:50.230> comparison<00:05:50.560> I'll<00:05:51.040> get<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.490> year

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
just for comparison I'll get the year

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.750 
just for comparison I'll get the year

look compared to the Baldy on this one

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.730 
look compared to the Baldy on this one
oh<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:01.330> clockwork<00:06:01.750> can't<00:06:02.080> be<00:06:02.230> ones<00:06:02.410> on<00:06:02.590> the

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
oh the clockwork can't be ones on the

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.880 
oh the clockwork can't be ones on the
right<00:06:02.920> and<00:06:03.310> a<00:06:03.790> Batman<00:06:04.270> the<00:06:04.390> electric<00:06:04.810> one<00:06:05.020> he's

right and a Batman the electric one he's
on<00:06:06.040> the<00:06:06.130> left<00:06:07.320> so<00:06:08.460> similarities<00:06:11.460> quite

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
on the left so similarities quite
