00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.049
 my dear everyone, thank you so much 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.420
 looked at my channel today with you 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.880
 will draw out attack mini smash book 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.800
 he is such a moth equestrian I when 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.990
 rummaged on ebay search some 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.680
 original interesting stationery 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.930
 stumble upon such a cute notebook 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.670
 I decided to order it yet did not really know 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 so that I will write in him but he is very me 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.989
 I liked him very interesting here 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.700
 such here are colorful decorated different 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.630
 topics 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.399
 the leaves are very strong for me 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.190
 interested like them 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.410
 very cute and funny and fun and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.780
 columns did not go poison the time thought what is 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.640
 write it and I visited this 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.910
 brilliant thought you know sometimes happens 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.800
 I want to draw some kind of drawing or 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.920
 write a quote and make to her some 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.360
 association that occurs when 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.359
 reading this quote 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.640
 sometimes you know there is a lot of usual 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.769
 smashbuk many ordinary notebooks that is 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200
 but wrote quotes drew a picture 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.960
 what's up with the rest of the free space and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.790
 so I decided 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.549
 that's it in this little smash beech 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.409
 write down some thoughts of your own 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.240
 be which is clever in my head 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.759
 will arise or somewhere for something if i 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.990
 I read just to do this inscription 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.880
 corresponding picture 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.890
 today we will draw the first 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.650
 spread this leaf here i am probably all 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.180
 seal it because it's not very 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.250
 conveniently this is the cover 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.290
 most likely that I must be comfortable 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.640
 glue and now this turn will be 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.979
 our our first page of goats here I 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.299
 I've already sketched myself 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.770
 bring to mind if you this topic 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.759
 interesting that sit down more comfortably 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.759
 let's start now 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.470
 and 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.000
 but this is my first 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.740
 turn my mini with mouse beeches 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.780
 I thought at first to me whether this girl 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.430
 draw on top here that's funny 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.890
 girls either for me and here it is 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.900
 seal decided to leave everything as is in 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.930
 In principle, it does not interfere with sit here in 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.000
 corner smiles to himself smiles around 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.640
 of course I got a turn but by 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.280
 I have nothing to fill in here, and 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.020
 I do not want because firstly here so 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.510
 background there is such an interesting nothing 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.150
 here supplement and secondly this one 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.180
 I will have a little smash book 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.490
 here is a picture and an inscription about no here 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.770
 decorating with a special one I don't plan on doing 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.360
 I hope you like this turn 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.210
