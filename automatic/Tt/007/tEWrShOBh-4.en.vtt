00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.209 
to brightness now I've already had that
dialed<00:02:04.990> in<00:02:05.109> but<00:02:05.259> look<00:02:05.439> at<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.619> difference<00:02:06.009> see

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
dialed in but look at the difference see

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.040 
dialed in but look at the difference see
this<00:02:06.399> is<00:02:06.549> normal<00:02:06.789> right<00:02:07.030> here<00:02:07.420> for<00:02:07.630> brightness

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
this is normal right here for brightness

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.080 
this is normal right here for brightness
you<00:02:08.619> can<00:02:08.679> brighten<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.190> right<00:02:09.399> up<00:02:09.580> well<00:02:09.910> what

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
you can brighten it right up well what

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.670 
you can brighten it right up well what

not going to go to it right now let's
look<00:02:27.879> at<00:02:28.000> some<00:02:28.180> other<00:02:28.300> things<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.840> can

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
look at some other things that you can

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.940 
look at some other things that you can
do<00:02:29.170> call<00:02:29.950> up<00:02:30.040> another<00:02:30.310> shot<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:32.680> close-up

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
do call up another shot of this close-up

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.589 
do call up another shot of this close-up
one<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.430> Martha<00:02:33.760> I'm<00:02:33.819> going<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.030> hit<00:02:34.120> function

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
one of Martha I'm going to hit function

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.100 
one of Martha I'm going to hit function
again<00:02:34.900> go<00:02:35.590> all<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.860> way<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.220> right<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.110> we

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
again go all the way to the right and we

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.800 
again go all the way to the right and we
can<00:02:38.319> have<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> sepia<00:02:39.040> look<00:02:39.310> we<00:02:40.239> can<00:02:40.390> have<00:02:40.540> the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
can have the sepia look we can have the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.960 
can have the sepia look we can have the
rich<00:02:41.110> color<00:02:41.409> again<00:02:41.830> using<00:02:42.220> your<00:02:42.250> trial<00:02:42.730> on<00:02:42.879> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
rich color again using your trial on the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.640 
rich color again using your trial on the
back<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.330> camera<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.720> can<00:02:43.870> rich<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.470> or

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
back of the camera you can rich in or

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.300 
back of the camera you can rich in or
reduce<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:45.909> as<00:02:46.870> much<00:02:47.080> as<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.379> want<00:02:47.590> then<00:02:48.190> go

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
reduce it as much as you want then go

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.009 
reduce it as much as you want then go
down<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.489> soft<00:02:48.909> and<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.299> is<00:02:49.480> nice<00:02:49.659> you<00:02:49.690> can

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
down to soft and this is nice you can

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.530 
down to soft and this is nice you can
soften<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.680> effects<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.250> somebody<00:02:51.640> if<00:02:51.849> they

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
soften the effects of somebody if they

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.059 
soften the effects of somebody if they
felt<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:52.930> they<00:02:53.049> had<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.200> bad<00:02:53.500> day<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:53.980> you

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
felt that they had a bad day and you

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.750 
felt that they had a bad day and you
want<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.340> sort<00:02:54.909> of<00:02:54.970> cover<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:56.459> darkness<00:02:57.459> under

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
want to sort of cover the darkness under

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.339 
want to sort of cover the darkness under
their<00:02:57.879> eyes<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.330> this<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.569> illustration

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
their eyes and this is illustration

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.869 
their eyes and this is illustration
which<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.650> just<00:02:59.860> really<00:03:00.129> weird<00:03:00.310> sort<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.730> makes

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
which is just really weird sort of makes

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.610 
which is just really weird sort of makes
like<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> drawing<00:03:01.569> look<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.230> really<00:03:02.379> good

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
like a drawing look it's really good

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.850 
like a drawing look it's really good
with<00:03:02.769> kids<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.340> outside<00:03:03.790> shots<00:03:04.209> this<00:03:05.140> is<00:03:05.349> HD

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
with kids and outside shots this is HD

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.130 
with kids and outside shots this is HD
or<00:03:06.010> R<00:03:06.310> which<00:03:06.610> is<00:03:06.640> high<00:03:06.940> dynamic<00:03:07.510> range<00:03:07.750> which

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
or R which is high dynamic range which

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.170 
or R which is high dynamic range which
is<00:03:08.709> sort<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:08.980> simulates<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.640> rich<00:03:09.879> dynamic

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
is sort of simulates that rich dynamic

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.440 
is sort of simulates that rich dynamic
range<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.930> get<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:12.069> special<00:03:12.640> software<00:03:12.909> and

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
range you get with special software and

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.780 
range you get with special software and
this<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.709> slim<00:03:14.980> thing<00:03:15.220> we<00:03:15.370> went<00:03:15.489> over

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
this is the slim thing we went over

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.970 
this is the slim thing we went over
before<00:03:15.939> and<00:03:16.420> that's<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:17.019> brightness<00:03:17.409> these

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
before and that's the brightness these

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.770 
before and that's the brightness these
are<00:03:18.099> all<00:03:18.189> the<00:03:18.370> usual<00:03:18.700> little<00:03:19.239> effects<00:03:19.569> that

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
are all the usual little effects that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.320 
are all the usual little effects that
you<00:03:19.900> can<00:03:20.080> do<00:03:20.230> with<00:03:20.379> the<00:03:20.500> K<00:03:20.680> 100d<00:03:21.519> after<00:03:22.239> you

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
you can do with the K 100d after you

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.910 
you can do with the K 100d after you
take<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.689> picture<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.260> remember<00:03:23.379> you<00:03:23.769> can

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
take the picture and remember you can

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:58.290 
take the picture and remember you can
save<00:03:24.280> them<00:03:24.549> as<00:03:24.790> new<00:03:25.689> pictures<00:03:26.230> in<00:03:26.769> your<00:03:26.799> camera

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.360
