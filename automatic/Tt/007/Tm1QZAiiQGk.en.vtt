00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.850 
the past that many patients actually
prefer<00:02:08.090> not<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.330> have<00:02:08.570> surgery<00:02:09.020> at<00:02:09.170> all<00:02:09.200> and

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
prefer not to have surgery at all and

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.470 
prefer not to have surgery at all and
choosing<00:02:10.280> instead<00:02:10.430> radiation<00:02:11.300> and

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
choosing instead radiation and

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.440 
choosing instead radiation and
chemotherapy<00:02:12.070> so<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.100> think<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.460> next<00:02:13.760> step<00:02:13.820> is

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
chemotherapy so I think the next step is

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.809 
chemotherapy so I think the next step is
having<00:02:15.349> patients<00:02:15.950> understand<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:16.700> is

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
having patients understand that this is

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.000 
having patients understand that this is
a<00:02:16.849> viable<00:02:17.120> option<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.930> find<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.709> lot<00:02:18.950> of

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
a viable option I find that a lot of

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.370 
a viable option I find that a lot of
patients<00:02:19.220> come<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:20.480> me<00:02:20.510> surprised

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
patients come in to see me surprised

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.770 
patients come in to see me surprised
that<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.860> even<00:02:22.370> available<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.360> them<00:02:23.569> as

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
that this is even available to them as

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.410 
that this is even available to them as
with<00:02:24.560> many<00:02:24.800> recent<00:02:25.520> successful<00:02:25.970> tours
