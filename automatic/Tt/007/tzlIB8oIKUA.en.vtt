00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.209 
they're having a financial crisis
because<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.750> their<00:01:54.960> real<00:01:55.140> estate<00:01:55.470> investments

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
because of their real estate investments

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.569 
because of their real estate investments
and<00:01:56.490> when<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.750> happens<00:01:57.780> what<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.829> try<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.189> get

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and when that happens what I try to get

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.179 
and when that happens what I try to get
them<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.850> do<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.840> about<00:02:01.170> whether<00:02:02.009> or

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
them to do is to think about whether or

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.850 
them to do is to think about whether or
not<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.790> investment<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.719> really<00:02:04.229> worth

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
not this investment is really worth

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.940 
not this investment is really worth
fighting<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.259> sure<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.740> real

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
fighting for because sure it's a real

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
fighting for because sure it's a real
estate<00:02:08.099> investment<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:09.569> know

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
estate investment and as we all know

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.229 
estate investment and as we all know
real<00:02:10.259> estate<00:02:10.679> will<00:02:10.920> always<00:02:11.430> increase<00:02:11.879> in

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
real estate will always increase in

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.750 
real estate will always increase in
value

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
value

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.170 
value
so<00:02:13.019> some<00:02:14.019> people<00:02:14.379> think<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.950> well<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.489> think<00:02:15.909> I

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
so some people think that well I think I

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.940 
so some people think that well I think I
want<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.420> hang<00:02:16.629> on<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.989> my<00:02:17.110> house<00:02:17.319> because<00:02:17.620> I

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
want to hang on to my house because I

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.009 
want to hang on to my house because I
know<00:02:18.069> it's<00:02:18.579> going<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.849> go<00:02:19.000> up<00:02:19.120> in<00:02:19.299> value<00:02:19.329> and

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
know it's going to go up in value and

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.080 
know it's going to go up in value and
that's<00:02:20.590> correct<00:02:20.950> they're<00:02:21.280> correct<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.879> will

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
that's correct they're correct it will

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.850 
that's correct they're correct it will
go<00:02:22.269> up<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:22.599> value<00:02:22.629> but<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.290> question<00:02:23.709> becomes

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
go up in value but the question becomes

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.850 
go up in value but the question becomes
how<00:02:24.730> many<00:02:24.939> years<00:02:25.269> would<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.720> take<00:02:25.989> for<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.739> to

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
how many years would it take for it to

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.030 
how many years would it take for it to
go<00:02:27.220> up<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.640> value<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:29.079> becomes<00:02:29.290> equal

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
go up in value so that it becomes equal

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.979 
go up in value so that it becomes equal
what<00:02:30.489> they<00:02:30.670> currently<00:02:30.940> owe<00:02:31.269> on<00:02:31.780> their

what they currently owe on their
mortgage<00:02:32.379> exactly<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.099> is<00:02:33.310> there<00:02:33.459> a

the last 50 years here in the United

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.280 
the last 50 years here in the United
States<00:03:03.120> residential<00:03:04.120> real<00:03:04.329> estate<00:03:04.359> has<00:03:05.019> gone

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
States residential real estate has gone

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.399 
States residential real estate has gone
up<00:03:05.560> an<00:03:05.769> average<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.340> about<00:03:06.459> three<00:03:06.970> percent

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
up an average of about three percent

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.869 
up an average of about three percent
three-point-four<00:03:08.409> percent<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:09.010> year<00:03:09.040> for<00:03:09.639> each

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
three-point-four percent a year for each

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.949 
three-point-four percent a year for each
of<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.209> last<00:03:10.359> 50<00:03:10.900> years<00:03:10.930> on<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.650> average<00:03:11.879> so

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
of the last 50 years on the average so

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.479 
of the last 50 years on the average so
sometimes<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.230> best<00:03:14.440> predictor<00:03:15.159> of<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
sometimes the best predictor of the

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.970 
sometimes the best predictor of the
future<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:16.389> the<00:03:16.629> past<00:03:16.659> so<00:03:17.349> this<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.739> one<00:03:17.949> of

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
future is the past so this is one of

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.759 
future is the past so this is one of
those<00:03:18.160> situations<00:03:18.459> where<00:03:19.109> if<00:03:20.109> we're<00:03:20.410> trying

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
those situations where if we're trying

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.740 
those situations where if we're trying

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
to determine what might happen to the

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
future of our real estate they may be

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.270 
future of our real estate they may be
two<00:03:25.030> three<00:03:25.419> years<00:03:25.629> four<00:03:25.989> years<00:03:26.019> from<00:03:26.349> now<00:03:26.590> you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
two three years four years from now you

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.189 
two three years four years from now you
compute<00:03:27.730> using<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.180> three<00:03:28.419> three-point-four

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
compute using the three three-point-four

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.280 
compute using the three three-point-four
percent<00:03:29.230> correct<00:03:29.949> right<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.329> might<00:03:32.019> look

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
percent correct right so you might look

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.800 
percent correct right so you might look
at<00:03:32.500> just<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.340> simple<00:03:33.790> compound<00:03:34.419> interest

at just a simple compound interest

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.530 
at just a simple compound interest
calculator<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.489> run<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.910> numbers<00:03:37.060> do

calculator and and run the numbers do
the<00:03:37.690> math<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.139> see<00:03:38.410> in<00:03:38.859> five<00:03:39.459> years<00:03:39.519> what

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
the math and see in five years what

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.420 
the math and see in five years what
would<00:03:40.359> be<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:41.019> value<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.470> my<00:03:41.500> real<00:03:41.859> estate<00:03:41.980> now

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
would be the value of my real estate now

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.520 
would be the value of my real estate now
we<00:03:42.730> have<00:03:42.879> a<00:03:42.910> typical<00:03:43.150> example<00:03:43.510> here<00:03:44.349> that

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
we have a typical example here that

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.890 
we have a typical example here that
there<00:03:44.799> maybe<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:45.280> could<00:03:45.459> we<00:03:45.699> could<00:03:45.849> look<00:03:46.690> at

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
there maybe we could we could look at

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.650 
there maybe we could we could look at
this<00:03:47.829> is<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.069> fairly<00:03:48.400> typical<00:03:48.730> case<00:03:49.180> for<00:03:49.480> many

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
this is a fairly typical case for many

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.720 
this is a fairly typical case for many
of<00:03:49.840> my<00:03:49.989> clients<00:03:50.290> let's<00:03:50.680> say<00:03:50.889> that<00:03:51.430> they<00:03:51.549> have<00:03:51.579> a

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
of my clients let's say that they have a

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.789 
of my clients let's say that they have a
mortgage<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.449> about<00:03:52.720> four<00:03:53.019> hundred<00:03:53.169> thousand

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
mortgage of about four hundred thousand

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.369 
mortgage of about four hundred thousand
dollars<00:03:53.829> that<00:03:54.519> might<00:03:54.790> be<00:03:54.819> a<00:03:55.120> first<00:03:55.659> and<00:03:55.930> second

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
dollars that might be a first and second

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.259 
dollars that might be a first and second
mortgage<00:03:56.799> or<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.190> may<00:03:57.430> be<00:03:57.489> just<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:57.970> first

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
mortgage or it may be just the first

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.449 
mortgage or it may be just the first
mortgage<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:59.409> really<00:03:59.620> doesn't<00:04:00.040> matter<00:04:00.159> for

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
mortgage it really doesn't matter for

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.210 
mortgage it really doesn't matter for
the<00:04:00.519> sake<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.819> our<00:04:01.060> example<00:04:01.599> today<00:04:01.780> so<00:04:02.680> let's

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
the sake of our example today so let's

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.580 
the sake of our example today so let's
say<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.609> fair<00:04:03.819> market<00:04:04.000> value<00:04:04.690> has<00:04:04.959> decreased

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
say the fair market value has decreased

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.470 
say the fair market value has decreased
and<00:04:05.859> it's<00:04:06.040> not<00:04:06.280> only<00:04:06.489> worth<00:04:06.849> two<00:04:06.879> hundred

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
and it's not only worth two hundred

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.050 
and it's not only worth two hundred
fifty<00:04:07.629> thousand<00:04:08.230> dollars<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:09.250> using<00:04:09.909> the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
fifty thousand dollars so using the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.420 
fifty thousand dollars so using the
calculations<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:10.989> we've<00:04:11.290> discussed<00:04:11.799> if<00:04:12.159> you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
calculations that we've discussed if you

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.539 
calculations that we've discussed if you
apply<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:13.199> three-point-four<00:04:14.199> percent

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
apply the three-point-four percent

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.129 
apply the three-point-four percent
calculation<00:04:15.549> you<00:04:16.209> can<00:04:16.419> see<00:04:16.659> that<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:17.019> would

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
calculation you can see that it would

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.189 
calculation you can see that it would
take<00:04:17.349> about<00:04:17.500> 14<00:04:18.190> years<00:04:18.449> for<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.570> value<00:04:20.019> of

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
take about 14 years for the value of

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.770 
take about 14 years for the value of
that<00:04:20.380> real<00:04:20.680> estate<00:04:20.829> asset<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.909> increase<00:04:22.450> to

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
that real estate asset to increase to

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.020 
that real estate asset to increase to
the<00:04:22.900> same<00:04:23.139> amount<00:04:23.550> roughly<00:04:24.550> that<00:04:24.820> they<00:04:25.000> owe

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
the same amount roughly that they owe

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.030 
the same amount roughly that they owe
currently

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
currently

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.820 
currently
and<00:04:26.160> that's<00:04:26.490> if<00:04:27.050> considering<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.290> it<00:04:28.620> would

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
and that's if considering that it would

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.740 
and that's if considering that it would
increase<00:04:29.100> every<00:04:29.400> year<00:04:29.670> because<00:04:30.000> as<00:04:30.270> they<00:04:30.450> safe

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
increase every year because as they safe

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.680 
increase every year because as they safe
