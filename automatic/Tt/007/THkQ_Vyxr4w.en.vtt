slide it towards one side and now it's

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.590

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.290 
just like regular flossing you'll floss
both<00:00:47.960> sides<00:00:48.260> of<00:00:48.440> each<00:00:48.530> contact<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.340> then<00:00:50.150> move

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
both sides of each contact and then move

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.110 
both sides of each contact and then move
from<00:00:50.510> each<00:00:50.630> contact<00:00:51.080> to<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.350> next<00:00:51.559> contact

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.369 

remember<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> practice<00:00:57.600> makes<00:00:57.780> perfect<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
remember the practice makes perfect and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.350 
remember the practice makes perfect and
with<00:00:59.040> enough<00:00:59.280> practice<00:00:59.700> we<00:01:00.000> should<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.300> able

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
with enough practice we should be able

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.350 
with enough practice we should be able
to<00:01:00.450> get<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.720> down<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.960> about<00:01:01.290> 30<00:01:01.500> seconds<00:01:01.980> if

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
to get this down to about 30 seconds if

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.790 
to get this down to about 30 seconds if
your<00:01:03.360> retainer<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.840> attached<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.290> each<00:01:04.350> tooth

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
your retainer is attached to each tooth

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.530 
your retainer is attached to each tooth
or<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> still<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.000> braces<00:01:06.390> on

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
or if you still have your braces on

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.149 
or if you still have your braces on
you'll<00:01:07.080> need<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> pass<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> floss<00:01:07.890> threader

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you'll need to pass the floss threader

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.149

through<00:01:08.490> each<00:01:08.610> contact<00:01:09.890> well<00:01:10.890> you're<00:01:11.040> done

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
through each contact well you're done

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710 
through each contact well you're done
pull<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> floss<00:01:11.760> through<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.330> gentle

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
pull the floss through it be gentle

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.790 
pull the floss through it be gentle
because<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.170> want<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:13.530> excessive

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.860 

so<00:01:19.640> we<00:01:19.760> intentionally<00:01:20.090> slowed<00:01:20.480> the<00:01:20.630> video

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
so we intentionally slowed the video

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.230 
so we intentionally slowed the video
down<00:01:21.140> for<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:22.370> wasn't<00:01:22.520> 30<00:01:22.820> seconds

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
down for you and it wasn't 30 seconds

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.360

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
but if you watch it again you check it

00:01:25.370 --> 00:02:00.789
