00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.870 
way to really beat him fast enough as if
he's<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> be

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
he's going to be

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.760 
he's going to be
knocked<00:01:28.360> out<00:01:28.540> and<00:01:28.750> incapacitated<00:01:29.470> I<00:01:29.560> don't

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
knocked out and incapacitated I don't

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.319 
knocked out and incapacitated I don't
have<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:29.920> get<00:01:30.070> off<00:01:30.159> all<00:01:30.280> those<00:01:30.399> free<00:01:30.579> hits<00:01:30.759> so

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
have to get off all those free hits so

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:32.880 
have to get off all those free hits so
you<00:01:31.420> see<00:01:31.540> there<00:01:31.720> he<00:01:31.899> really<00:01:32.380> timed<00:01:32.680> that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
you see there he really timed that

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.149 
you see there he really timed that
perfectly<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:34.030> had<00:01:34.689> already<00:01:34.810> paralyzed<00:01:35.380> him<00:01:35.590> at

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
perfectly I had already paralyzed him at

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.039 
perfectly I had already paralyzed him at
low<00:01:36.520> sharpness<00:01:37.090> but<00:01:37.240> I'm<00:01:37.360> not<00:01:37.479> sharpening

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
low sharpness but I'm not sharpening

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.289 
low sharpness but I'm not sharpening
because<00:01:38.740> while<00:01:38.890> he's<00:01:39.070> hopeless<00:01:39.460> like<00:01:39.610> this<00:01:39.790> if

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
because while he's hopeless like this if

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:41.789 
because while he's hopeless like this if
you<00:01:40.450> do<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.689> standard<00:01:41.049> combo<00:01:41.439> you<00:01:41.560> live<00:01:41.710> with

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799
