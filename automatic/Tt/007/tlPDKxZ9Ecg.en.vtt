with<00:00:06.790> iPad<00:00:07.149> tuned<00:00:07.479> we've<00:00:08.109> made<00:00:08.290> advances<00:00:08.980> in

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
with iPad tuned we've made advances in

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.760 
with iPad tuned we've made advances in

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
both form and function that is so

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.019 
both form and function that is so

think of a product that has defined an
entire<00:00:19.180> category<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.650> has<00:00:20.770> then<00:00:20.950> been

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
entire category and has then been

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.980

period<00:00:23.140> of<00:00:23.500> time<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:25.630> amazing<00:00:25.900> to<00:00:26.109> think

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
period of time it's amazing to think

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.679 
period of time it's amazing to think
that<00:00:26.439> just<00:00:26.619> a<00:00:26.859> year<00:00:27.010> ago<00:00:27.070> very<00:00:28.000> few<00:00:28.210> people<00:00:28.269> had

aluminium<00:01:32.860> we<00:01:33.790> want<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.180> figure<00:01:34.360> out<00:01:34.480> a

aluminium we want you to figure out a
way<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:34.960> protect<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.710> display<00:01:36.280> without

way to protect a display without
compromising<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.200> iPad<00:01:38.590> size<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.370> weight<00:01:39.520> so

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
compromising the iPad size and weight so

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.510 
compromising the iPad size and weight so
rather<00:01:40.570> than<00:01:40.840> developing<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.770> separate<00:01:42.280> case

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
rather than developing a separate case

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.600 
rather than developing a separate case
we<00:01:43.270> created<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.870> cover<00:01:44.230> at<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.800> same<00:01:45.070> time<00:01:45.310> that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
we created a cover at the same time that

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.760 
we created a cover at the same time that
we<00:01:45.700> were<00:01:45.820> actually<00:01:45.940> designing<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.840> iPad<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
we were actually designing the iPad the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.890 
we were actually designing the iPad the
two<00:01:47.950> are<00:01:48.100> made<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.550> work<00:01:48.729> together<00:01:48.940> it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
two are made to work together it

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.560 
two are made to work together it
attaches<00:01:50.200> magnetically<00:01:50.729> Airlines<00:01:51.729> perfectly

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
attaches magnetically Airlines perfectly

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.780 
attaches magnetically Airlines perfectly
and<00:01:52.780> it's<00:01:53.110> just<00:01:53.380> as<00:01:53.500> easy<00:01:53.620> to<00:01:53.770> remove<00:01:54.130> when<00:01:54.700> the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
and it's just as easy to remove when the

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.030 
and it's just as easy to remove when the
iPad<00:01:55.120> detects<00:01:55.600> you've<00:01:55.960> opened<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.350> cover<00:01:56.650> it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
iPad detects you've opened the cover it

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.100 
iPad detects you've opened the cover it
immediately<00:01:57.610> wakes<00:01:58.030> from<00:01:58.150> sleep<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:58.870> when

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
immediately wakes from sleep and when

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.870 
immediately wakes from sleep and when
you<00:01:59.140> close<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.650> cover<00:01:59.830> it<00:02:00.190> puts<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.520> back<00:02:00.670> to

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
you close the cover it puts it back to

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.910 
you close the cover it puts it back to
sleep<00:02:01.120> you<00:02:01.570> can<00:02:01.720> also<00:02:01.870> fold<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.440> cover<00:02:02.620> to

orientation and in full 1080p we've done

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.370 
orientation and in full 1080p we've done
things<00:04:23.130> for<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.520> iPad<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.479> we<00:04:24.630> never<00:04:25.110> could

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
things for this iPad that we never could

things for this iPad that we never could
have<00:04:25.440> done<00:04:25.620> before<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:26.340> it's<00:04:26.970> because

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
have done before and it's because

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.810 
have done before and it's because
there's<00:04:27.900> a<00:04:27.990> lot<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.229> new<00:04:28.590> innovation<00:04:29.250> driving

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
there's a lot of new innovation driving

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.020 
there's a lot of new innovation driving
it<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:31.500> starts<00:04:31.890> with<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.220> new<00:04:32.400> dual-core<00:04:32.970> a5

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.600 
it it starts with the new dual-core a5
chip<00:04:33.810> that's<00:04:34.200> added<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.650> lot<00:04:34.890> more<00:04:35.070> speed<00:04:35.400> to

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
chip that's added a lot more speed to

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.760 
chip that's added a lot more speed to
things<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:36.000> do<00:04:36.180> every<00:04:36.210> day<00:04:36.479> like<00:04:37.140> surfing<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.380 
fact it's up to twice as fast but the
place<00:04:43.680> with<00:04:43.890> me<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.220> biggest<00:04:44.490> chunk<00:04:44.910> is<00:04:45.090> with

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
nine times faster you'll really notice

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.030 
nine times faster you'll really notice
this<00:04:50.760> in<00:04:50.970> games<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.660> apps<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.229> use<00:04:52.350> a<00:04:52.380> lot<00:04:52.650> of

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
this in games and apps that use a lot of

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.610 
this in games and apps that use a lot of
and<00:04:53.250> for<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.300> first<00:04:54.510> time<00:04:54.810> we've<00:04:55.290> built<00:04:55.500> a

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
and for the first time we've built a

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.250 
and for the first time we've built a
gyro<00:04:56.070> in<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.370> design<00:04:56.730> head<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.870> gives<00:04:58.140> you

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
gyro in the design head that gives you

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.470 
gyro in the design head that gives you
very<00:04:58.590> precise<00:04:59.040> control<00:04:59.610> in<00:04:59.880> multiple

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
very precise control in multiple

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.780 
very precise control in multiple
dimensions<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.560> allows<00:05:01.830> us<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.460> really

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
dimensions and it allows us to really

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.150 
dimensions and it allows us to really
measure<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.570> orientation<00:05:04.350> of<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.500> iPad<00:05:05.010> in

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
measure the orientation of the iPad in

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.940 
measure the orientation of the iPad in
space<00:05:05.750> these<00:05:06.750> new<00:05:07.020> components<00:05:07.620> and<00:05:07.770> features

add all kinds of possibilities when it

add all kinds of possibilities when it

comes to apps and even though we boosted

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.110 
comes to apps and even though we boosted
the<00:05:13.290> performance<00:05:13.860> we<00:05:14.130> haven't<00:05:14.580> compromised

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
the performance we haven't compromised

on battery life the new ipad still gets
a<00:05:18.090> full<00:05:18.330> 10<00:05:18.600> hours<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.530> that's<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.890> major

the original iPad defined a category and

I think that I peg tube will really

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.850 
I think that I peg tube will really
define<00:05:42.600> that<00:05:42.780> category<00:05:43.350> for<00:05:43.650> years<00:05:43.890> to<00:05:43.980> come
