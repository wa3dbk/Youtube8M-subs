which<00:00:42.660> kind<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.140> confused<00:00:44.070> me<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:44.309> first<00:00:44.460> one

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
which kind of confused me at first one

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.450 
which kind of confused me at first one
is<00:00:44.850> blue<00:00:45.059> one<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.480> purple<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.829> thought<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
is blue one is purple and I thought that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.190 
is blue one is purple and I thought that
I'd<00:00:47.579> gone<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> multi<00:00:48.390> pack<00:00:48.570> by<00:00:48.750> accident

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I'd gone like a multi pack by accident

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.260 
I'd gone like a multi pack by accident
but<00:00:49.440> apparently<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.850> different

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
but apparently they just make different

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270 
but apparently they just make different
colors<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.840> don't<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.320> why<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:52.980> it's

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
colors I don't know why I think it's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.310 
colors I don't know why I think it's
confusing<00:00:53.690> anyway<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:54.960> those<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
confusing anyway so if those are the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.439 
confusing anyway so if those are the

on each side but if you can see the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.920 
on each side but if you can see the
difference<00:03:01.850> between<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.270> shiny<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.810> this

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
difference between the shiny and this

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.000 
difference between the shiny and this
matte<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.500> actually<00:03:03.860> like<00:03:04.010> rubber<00:03:04.989> so

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
matte this is actually like rubber so

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.150 
matte this is actually like rubber so
from<00:03:07.010> me<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.870> for<00:03:08.870> Jenna<00:03:09.110> we<00:03:09.380> both<00:03:09.590> agree<00:03:09.920> that

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
from me and for Jenna we both agree that

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.540 
from me and for Jenna we both agree that
this<00:03:10.940> cotext<00:03:11.600> is<00:03:11.690> much<00:03:11.959> easier<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.830> hold<00:03:13.130> when

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
this cotext is much easier to hold when

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.080 
this cotext is much easier to hold when
you're<00:03:13.760> putting<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.239> tampon<00:03:14.660> on<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:16.280> that's

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
you're putting the tampon on so that's

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.000 
you're putting the tampon on so that's
what<00:03:17.300> we<00:03:17.390> really<00:03:17.630> like<00:03:17.810> about<00:03:17.959> these<00:03:18.320> ones<00:03:18.650> and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
what we really like about these ones and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.729 
what we really like about these ones and
also<00:03:19.790> another<00:03:20.180> thing<00:03:20.480> is<00:03:20.810> even<00:03:21.530> though<00:03:21.590> these

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
also another thing is even though these

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.560 
also another thing is even though these
are<00:03:21.890> both<00:03:22.040> super<00:03:22.340> house<00:03:22.790> like<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.030> mentioned

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
are both super house like I mentioned

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.170 
are both super house like I mentioned
the<00:03:24.200> Tampax<00:03:24.890> is<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.190> lot<00:03:25.489> thicker<00:03:25.760> than<00:03:26.090> the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
the Tampax is a lot thicker than the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.470 
the Tampax is a lot thicker than the
Kotex<00:03:26.660> so<00:03:26.900> if<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.110> have<00:03:27.290> issues<00:03:27.830> with<00:03:28.480> the

Kotex so if you have issues with the
things<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.020> thickness<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.650> super<00:03:31.220> tampons<00:03:31.730> or

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
things the thickness of super tampons or

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.449 
things the thickness of super tampons or
bigger<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.650> protex<00:03:34.040> is<00:03:34.160> going<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.370> be<00:03:34.430> a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
bigger the protex is going to be a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.729 
bigger the protex is going to be a
little<00:03:34.550> bit<00:03:34.700> thinner<00:03:34.970> for<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.540> if<00:03:36.350> that's<00:03:36.500> an

little bit thinner for you if that's an

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.020 
little bit thinner for you if that's an
issue<00:03:36.920> for<00:03:37.489> you<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:39.440> way<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:40.340> can<00:03:40.670> use

issue for you and that way you can use

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.360 
issue for you and that way you can use
the<00:03:41.300> larger<00:03:41.750> size<00:03:41.780> tampons<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.890> hold<00:03:43.130> more

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
the larger size tampons that hold more

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.390 
Tampax does like it doesn't come apart
so<00:04:35.180> what<00:04:35.390> I'm<00:04:35.450> going<00:04:35.600> to<00:04:35.630> do<00:04:36.160> just<00:04:37.160> kind<00:04:37.370> of

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
so what I'm going to do just kind of

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.460 
so what I'm going to do just kind of
soap<00:04:37.640> it<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.880> little<00:04:38.150> bit<00:04:38.270> in<00:04:38.360> solution<00:04:38.960> of<00:04:39.260> some

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
soap it a little bit in solution of some

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.920 
soap it a little bit in solution of some
water<00:04:39.820> just<00:04:40.820> you<00:04:41.000> can<00:04:41.240> see<00:04:41.270> how<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.080> works<00:04:43.930> all

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
water just you can see how it works all

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.200 
water just you can see how it works all
right<00:04:45.169> okay<00:04:45.950> so<00:04:46.010> this<00:04:46.310> is<00:04:46.520> puffed<00:04:46.730> up<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:47.030> little

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
right okay so this is puffed up a little

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.390 
right okay so this is puffed up a little
bit<00:04:47.419> cuz<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.630> has<00:04:47.660> water<00:04:47.960> in<00:04:48.200> it<00:04:48.320> so<00:04:48.950> as<00:04:49.160> you<00:04:49.280> can

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
bit cuz it has water in it so as you can

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.130 
bit cuz it has water in it so as you can
see<00:04:49.460> there's<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.090> difference<00:04:50.540> here<00:04:50.630> between

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
see there's a difference here between

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.100 
see there's a difference here between
these<00:04:51.560> two<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:52.280> this<00:04:53.030> will<00:04:53.180> probably<00:04:53.330> maybe

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
these two and this will probably maybe

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.740 
these two and this will probably maybe
be<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.830> reason<00:04:55.160> why<00:04:55.370> what<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.030> say<00:04:56.270> later<00:04:56.510> makes

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
be the reason why what I say later makes

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.190 
be the reason why what I say later makes
sense

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
sense

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.700 
sense
this<00:04:57.860> one<00:04:58.130> comes<00:04:58.610> out<00:04:58.790> flat<00:04:59.390> like<00:04:59.990> this<00:05:00.290> and<00:05:00.560> it

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
this one comes out flat like this and it

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.159 
this one comes out flat like this and it
comes<00:05:00.919> apart<00:05:01.250> very<00:05:01.430> easily<00:05:01.780> so<00:05:02.780> as<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:02.960> can

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
comes apart very easily so as you can

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.590 
comes apart very easily so as you can
see<00:05:03.440> even<00:05:04.070> with<00:05:04.310> absorbed<00:05:04.940> water<00:05:05.090> this<00:05:05.390> one

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
see even with absorbed water this one

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.360 
see even with absorbed water this one
comes<00:05:05.810> out<00:05:05.990> very<00:05:06.200> poor<00:05:06.680> is<00:05:06.830> actually<00:05:07.250> not

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
comes out very poor is actually not

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.880 
comes out very poor is actually not
obviously<00:05:07.940> depending<00:05:08.810> you<00:05:09.320> know<00:05:09.440> how<00:05:09.650> your

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
obviously depending you know how your

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.950 
obviously depending you know how your
shape<00:05:10.250> it<00:05:10.760> you<00:05:11.000> know<00:05:11.090> it<00:05:11.210> could<00:05:11.390> be<00:05:11.419> this<00:05:11.660> wake

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
shape it you know it could be this wake

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.440 
shape it you know it could be this wake
of<00:05:12.260> a<00:05:12.350> let's<00:05:12.530> play<00:05:12.770> but<00:05:12.830> it<00:05:13.160> opens<00:05:13.610> up<00:05:13.850> this<00:05:14.150> way

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
of a let's play but it opens up this way

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.650 
of a let's play but it opens up this way
and<00:05:15.040> horizontally<00:05:16.040> the<00:05:16.669> Kotex<00:05:17.180> on<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.479> other

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
and horizontally the Kotex on the other

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.730 
and horizontally the Kotex on the other
hand<00:05:18.140> opens<00:05:18.950> up<00:05:19.570> like<00:05:20.570> a<00:05:20.600> circle<00:05:21.169> like<00:05:21.590> it

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
hand opens up like a circle like it

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.310 
hand opens up like a circle like it
opens<00:05:22.400> up<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:22.850> way<00:05:23.120> not<00:05:23.360> horizontally<00:05:24.169> so

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
opens up this way not horizontally so

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.520 
opens up this way not horizontally so
it's<00:05:24.440> still<00:05:24.650> very<00:05:24.919> circular<00:05:25.750> okay<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:27.020> then

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
it's still very circular okay and then

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.020 
it's still very circular okay and then
again<00:05:27.860> there's<00:05:28.130> a<00:05:28.190> difference<00:05:28.520> between<00:05:28.640> the

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
again there's a difference between the

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.330 
again there's a difference between the
strings<00:05:29.419> of<00:05:29.690> them<00:05:30.020> this<00:05:30.620> one<00:05:30.860> doesn't<00:05:31.160> have

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
strings of them this one doesn't have

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.909 
strings of them this one doesn't have
that<00:05:31.700> thick<00:05:32.000> braided<00:05:32.630> string<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:33.560> just<00:05:33.770> has<00:05:33.890> a

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
that thick braided string it just has a

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.060 
that thick braided string it just has a
regular<00:05:34.160> string<00:05:34.850> with<00:05:35.419> a<00:05:35.450> knot<00:05:35.810> on<00:05:36.200> the<00:05:36.890> end

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
regular string with a knot on the end

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.219 
regular string with a knot on the end
and<00:05:37.550> so<00:05:37.760> that's<00:05:37.940> what<00:05:38.120> you<00:05:38.150> can<00:05:38.419> grip<00:05:38.690> on<00:05:38.870> to

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
and so that's what you can grip on to

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:44.500 
and so that's what you can grip on to
pull<00:05:39.620> it<00:05:39.770> out<00:05:40.060> now<00:05:41.060> I<00:05:41.600> myself<00:05:42.760> between<00:05:43.760> these

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
pull it out now I myself between these

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.810 
pull it out now I myself between these
two<00:05:44.930> haven't<00:05:45.770> really<00:05:46.040> noticed<00:05:46.220> too<00:05:46.669> much

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
two haven't really noticed too much

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.029 
two haven't really noticed too much
difference<00:05:47.270> between

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
difference between

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.390 
difference between
like<00:05:48.249> leakage<00:05:48.819> per<00:05:49.180> se<00:05:49.419> um<00:05:49.830> but<00:05:50.830> I<00:05:50.860> did<00:05:51.189> speak

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
like leakage per se um but I did speak

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.700 
like leakage per se um but I did speak
with<00:05:51.460> Jenna<00:05:51.939> and<00:05:52.029> she<00:05:52.389> said<00:05:52.659> that<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.139> Kotex

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
with Jenna and she said that the Kotex

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.939 
with Jenna and she said that the Kotex
works<00:05:54.430> a<00:05:54.639> lot<00:05:54.789> better<00:05:55.199> um<00:05:56.199> I<00:05:56.289> don't<00:05:56.649> know<00:05:56.770> if

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
works a lot better um I don't know if

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.829 
works a lot better um I don't know if
that<00:05:57.099> has<00:05:57.279> to<00:05:57.309> do<00:05:57.610> with<00:05:57.639> just<00:05:58.119> our<00:05:58.419> personal

00:05:58.829 --> 00:05:58.839 
that has to do with just our personal

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:01.109 
that has to do with just our personal
bodies<00:05:59.259> or<00:05:59.680> she's<00:06:00.490> a<00:06:00.550> little<00:06:00.729> bit<00:06:00.819> heavier

00:06:01.109 --> 00:06:01.119 
bodies or she's a little bit heavier

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:02.609 
bodies or she's a little bit heavier
than<00:06:01.180> I<00:06:01.449> am<00:06:01.569> I<00:06:01.899> don't<00:06:02.050> know<00:06:02.139> if<00:06:02.229> that<00:06:02.409> has

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:02.619 
than I am I don't know if that has

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:04.980 
than I am I don't know if that has
anything<00:06:02.889> to<00:06:03.039> do<00:06:03.249> with<00:06:03.279> it<00:06:03.580> but<00:06:04.270> she<00:06:04.659> says<00:06:04.960> that

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
anything to do with it but she says that

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.399 
anything to do with it but she says that
the<00:06:05.469> Kotex<00:06:06.099> do<00:06:06.610> not<00:06:06.819> leak<00:06:07.089> compared<00:06:07.719> to<00:06:07.930> hurl

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
the Kotex do not leak compared to hurl

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:10.769 
the Kotex do not leak compared to hurl
the<00:06:08.680> cam<00:06:08.830> packs<00:06:09.069> pearl<00:06:09.339> do<00:06:09.759> leak

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:10.779 
the cam packs pearl do leak

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:13.739 
the cam packs pearl do leak
sometimes<00:06:11.469> for<00:06:11.800> her<00:06:11.979> which<00:06:12.580> would<00:06:13.180> make<00:06:13.509> sense

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:13.749 
sometimes for her which would make sense

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.119 
sometimes for her which would make sense
because<00:06:13.869> you<00:06:13.990> think<00:06:14.289> that<00:06:14.439> the<00:06:14.559> braided<00:06:14.919> part

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
because you think that the braided part

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.679 
because you think that the braided part
would<00:06:15.339> stop<00:06:15.610> it<00:06:15.849> and<00:06:16.059> this<00:06:16.119> one<00:06:16.330> doesn't<00:06:16.659> have

00:06:16.679 --> 00:06:16.689 
would stop it and this one doesn't have

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.109 
would stop it and this one doesn't have
it<00:06:16.869> but<00:06:17.499> that's<00:06:17.649> why<00:06:17.860> I<00:06:17.889> was<00:06:18.099> thinking<00:06:18.339> that

00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:19.119 
it but that's why I was thinking that

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:21.089 
it but that's why I was thinking that
the<00:06:19.539> way<00:06:19.689> that<00:06:19.960> the<00:06:20.229> difference<00:06:20.620> between<00:06:20.830> this

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
the way that the difference between this

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.670 
the way that the difference between this
being<00:06:21.339> horizontal<00:06:21.699> and<00:06:22.330> this<00:06:22.659> being<00:06:22.930> circular

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
being horizontal and this being circular

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.249 
being horizontal and this being circular
this<00:06:24.219> would<00:06:24.430> create<00:06:24.759> more<00:06:24.939> of<00:06:25.059> a<00:06:25.149> barrier<00:06:25.689> for

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
this would create more of a barrier for

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.409 
this would create more of a barrier for
the<00:06:26.529> leak<00:06:26.710> to<00:06:26.889> not<00:06:27.069> come<00:06:27.309> out<00:06:27.490> where<00:06:28.120> since

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
the leak to not come out where since

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.389 
the leak to not come out where since
this<00:06:28.629> is<00:06:28.779> being<00:06:28.930> horizontal<00:06:29.319> you<00:06:30.129> know<00:06:30.219> it

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:30.399 
this is being horizontal you know it

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:32.159 
this is being horizontal you know it
could<00:06:30.669> cause<00:06:30.969> like<00:06:31.180> weeks<00:06:31.419> to<00:06:31.599> come<00:06:31.809> through

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
could cause like weeks to come through

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.249 
could cause like weeks to come through
one<00:06:32.889> way<00:06:33.069> or<00:06:33.399> the<00:06:33.639> other

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 
one way or the other

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.769 
one way or the other
so<00:06:35.259> that<00:06:35.949> is<00:06:36.099> the<00:06:36.219> comparison<00:06:36.550> between<00:06:37.210> the

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:37.779 
so that is the comparison between the

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.790 
so that is the comparison between the
two<00:06:37.960> different<00:06:38.800> tampons<00:06:39.550> between

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
two different tampons between

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.859 
two different tampons between
the<00:06:42.509> Kotex<00:06:43.509> and<00:06:43.870> between<00:06:44.620> the<00:06:45.430> Tampax<00:06:45.939> pearl

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:46.869 
the Kotex and between the Tampax pearl

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:49.829 
the Kotex and between the Tampax pearl
so<00:06:47.800> again<00:06:48.279> it<00:06:48.490> is<00:06:48.610> up<00:06:48.819> to<00:06:49.029> you<00:06:49.209> which<00:06:49.539> one<00:06:49.809> you

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:49.839 
so again it is up to you which one you

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:52.379 
so again it is up to you which one you
want<00:06:50.139> to<00:06:50.259> use<00:06:50.339> we<00:06:51.339> personally<00:06:51.819> prefer<00:06:52.149> using

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:52.389 
want to use we personally prefer using

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:55.709 
want to use we personally prefer using
the<00:06:52.599> Kotex<00:06:53.050> but<00:06:53.770> either<00:06:54.580> one<00:06:54.939> work<00:06:55.389> really

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:55.719 
the Kotex but either one work really

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:57.449 
the Kotex but either one work really
well<00:06:56.020> I<00:06:56.439> just<00:06:56.589> thought<00:06:56.860> I<00:06:56.919> kind<00:06:57.189> of<00:06:57.249> give<00:06:57.370> you

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:57.459 
well I just thought I kind of give you

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.689 
well I just thought I kind of give you
comparison<00:06:58.240> on<00:06:58.509> them<00:06:58.949> the<00:06:59.949> lasting<00:07:00.459> time

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
comparison on them the lasting time

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.309 
comparison on them the lasting time
again<00:07:01.029> is<00:07:01.180> all<00:07:01.360> just<00:07:01.509> going<00:07:01.659> to<00:07:01.749> depend<00:07:02.050> on<00:07:02.139> how

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 
again is all just going to depend on how

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.499 
again is all just going to depend on how
many<00:07:02.529> you<00:07:02.709> are<00:07:02.740> and<00:07:03.339> all<00:07:03.699> that<00:07:03.759> type<00:07:04.180> of<00:07:04.330> things

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:04.509 
many you are and all that type of things

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:06.089 
many you are and all that type of things
so<00:07:04.659> can't<00:07:05.019> really<00:07:05.199> compare<00:07:05.499> on<00:07:05.649> that<00:07:05.860> that's

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
so can't really compare on that that's

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.699 
so can't really compare on that that's
very<00:07:06.309> personal<00:07:06.819> but<00:07:07.089> yeah<00:07:07.899> hopefully<00:07:08.409> this

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:08.709 
very personal but yeah hopefully this
