00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:15.389
 relaxation of deep structures and makkiee for the surface are these 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.099
 signs that we call altogether face aging 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.789
 signs that peroxides also insert attitudes 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.060
 expressions therefore also globally 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.720
 psychological situation too 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.120
 the psychological situation of the mood and then define our e 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.170
 aging 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.320
 generally 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.120
 if a correct diagnosis has been made and if the right motivation occurs 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.280
 satisfied 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.740
 being able to understand the true motivation is not always very simple indeed of 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.340
 a kind or psychological support and always 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.820
 it's advisable not to joke 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.000
 so they must know the terrible most different specialists 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.180
 i liked a simple reference rate 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.710
 yes, our approach is fundamental 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.440
 it is fundamental above all because the expectations are a lot 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.680
 mps degree of what really limits technology as much as targeted 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.020
 can be 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.080
 let's start today with blond news because the technology offers e 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.939
 so let's focus on the flaws 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.630
 that arise from the relaxation of deep structures 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.240
 in the case of sabin we want to summarize what are the imperfections to be corrected 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.390
 in the case of sabina it requires the raising of the eyebrow 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.770
 and in this case we go 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.170
 to visualize 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.130
 what is the structure 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.390
 need 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.240
 Pull 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.670
 by car 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.039
 here it is used episodes and the deep aponeurotic fascia 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.490
 where I feed I am going to rent with its energy density that determining 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.770
 of the micro 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.840
 contraction dots of refraction 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.639
 determine the raising of the eyebrow 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.759
 the image of an ultrasound of the skin to the one we see 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.349
 this is the image of a color that you can 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.909
 you the first time that a therapeutic device 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.550
 in defect also in the aesthetic field 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.740
 also performs in a correct view of the target to go 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.999
 to 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:35.099
 black label then acts is displayed 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.759
 the deep structure 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:41.439
 in this way we went to give these deep micro coagulations 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.879
 completely omitting all the overlying structures because this is 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.649
 Skin 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.779
 this is all the subcutaneous fat 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:53.589
 ecologically they had talked about spots that are all beautiful 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.189
 epidermal therefore all superficial level 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:00.770
 in this case the improvement that we will have will be only 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.039
 in the deep structure 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:07.959
 what is the biological effect of the ultrasound used the prostate 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.270
 this is 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.570
 the other is generally known that they do not create absolutely any kind of 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.830
 they give the technology also to the last developed and precisely one 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.499
 1 atm 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.480
 they concentrated at a depth 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.989
 d 3 mm at a frequency I doubt 7 megs without 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.299
 a visit of heat 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.629
 which concentrates in one point and determines this slight contraction this 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.679
 coagulation without damaging the overhanging structures 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:44.539
 non-surgical lifting technique that of ultrasounds applied to gigio 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.899
 face failure but what the results are 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:49.369
 the results are 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:52.559
 especially good in the upper district 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.769
 this siiim method 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.629
 we are going to interpose the lifting with the coronal nikon griffins 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.669
 surgical of all this are 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.180
 here the structures respond very well and therefore 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.029
 make optimal traction 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:11.169
 instead of cheek space the results are not 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.929
 superimposable above all for the cases where the surgical indication eve 

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:20.650
 the cost a tattoo with an important failure 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.260
 and the repetition would be minimal and therefore of puppet 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.610
 Ultrasounds against aging is a definitely effective technique 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.569
 marta dottor dancing we can say that it meets the patient's expectations 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.889
 if the indication is the right one if 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.930
 generally with aging it has not only a blemish 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.509
 and therefore we must trust yerme earthquake rome 11 30 to reach the maximum 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.240
 of the results of the last comment poll book then 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.729
 from the motivation 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.750
 oh well, the expectation is serious 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.719
 then rely on 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:59.080
 to the motivational advice that is very important 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.969
 he emphasized the importance of an intervention 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.159
 multispecialist 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.159
 yes intervention nutis price rise the fundamental 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.439
 because you need to vote carefully for what are the motivations of 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.580
 expectations and therefore logically psychology in this is fundamental 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.800
 importance and then to technically reach those that are the headquarters 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.739
 typical of imperfections and universities with mountain spots 

00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:26.530
 nails and aston yes 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.990
 and therefore with a reference specialist 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.059
 as an aesthetic dermatology, I have underlying structures of all 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:37.809
 see all those aponeurotic structures of the one spoken before and where the 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:39.580
 become a surgeon 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.580
 from predominant in resolution 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.290
 totalizing approach in aesthetic medicine and a new key that 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.090
 we will also deepen in the next episodes always offering you 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.850
 the latest news as we did this evening with the new hysteroscopy in 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.220
 domo opel and then with the lifting self-lifting so don't miss the 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.520
 next appointment led thanks for being with us and goodbye to 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.970
 soon
