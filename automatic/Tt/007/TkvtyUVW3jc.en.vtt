it is a place of reconciliation or a
reconciliation<00:00:22.970> place<00:00:23.660> and<00:00:24.020> this<00:00:24.619> project<00:00:24.919> is

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
reconciliation place and this project is

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.569 
reconciliation place and this project is
entirely<00:00:26.000> relevant<00:00:26.450> to<00:00:27.439> our<00:00:27.710> nation<00:00:28.340> and<00:00:28.520> to

this<00:00:57.970> is<00:00:58.180> not<00:00:58.480> a<00:00:58.510> project<00:00:58.870> about<00:00:59.410> building<00:01:00.160> a

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
this is not a project about building a

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.330 
this is not a project about building a
complex<00:01:01.150> that's<00:01:01.930> just<00:01:02.230> simply<00:01:02.500> I'm<00:01:02.920> going<00:01:03.250> to

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
complex that's just simply I'm going to

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.430 
complex that's just simply I'm going to
select<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.700> size<00:01:03.910> here<00:01:04.330> and<00:01:04.630> everything<00:01:05.350> is

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
select the size here and everything is

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.750 
select the size here and everything is
gonna<00:01:05.590> get<00:01:05.830> I'm<00:01:05.950> gonna<00:01:06.070> bring<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.370> cars<00:01:06.580> in

gonna get I'm gonna bring the cars in

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.280 
gonna get I'm gonna bring the cars in
here<00:01:06.940> it's<00:01:07.030> not<00:01:07.180> a<00:01:07.240> problem<00:01:07.510> to<00:01:07.780> bring<00:01:08.200> the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
here it's not a problem to bring the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.170 
here it's not a problem to bring the
cows<00:01:08.500> in<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:08.860> drive<00:01:09.100> off<00:01:09.340> here<00:01:09.550> yeah<00:01:09.910> I<00:01:09.940> can

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
cows in you drive off here yeah I can

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.460 
cows in you drive off here yeah I can
put<00:01:10.300> that<00:01:10.420> there<00:01:10.480> put<00:01:10.660> the<00:01:11.020> drainage<00:01:11.350> over

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
put that there put the drainage over

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.750 
put that there put the drainage over
that'll<00:01:11.830> go<00:01:11.950> down<00:01:11.979> in<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.250> rain<00:01:12.400> forest

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
that'll go down in the rain forest

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.590 
that'll go down in the rain forest
doesn't<00:01:13.030> matter<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.729> is<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:15.940> program

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
doesn't matter that this is a program

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:35.249 
doesn't matter that this is a program
about<00:01:17.100> sensitivity<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.490> say

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.499 

when<00:01:36.259> we<00:01:36.409> bring<00:01:36.619> them<00:01:36.799> out<00:01:36.950> here<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.579> this<00:01:38.180> area

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
when we bring them out here to this area

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.039 
when we bring them out here to this area
of<00:01:39.409> Riversdale<00:01:39.909> we're<00:01:40.909> into<00:01:41.180> landscapes<00:01:41.750> that

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
of Riversdale we're into landscapes that

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.340 
of Riversdale we're into landscapes that
are<00:01:42.399> entirely<00:01:43.399> different<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.780> anything<00:01:45.200> much

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
are entirely different to anything much

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.779 
are entirely different to anything much
of<00:01:45.470> these<00:01:45.590> people<00:01:45.920> have<00:01:46.009> ever<00:01:46.100> experienced

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
of these people have ever experienced

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:48.249 
of these people have ever experienced
we<00:01:46.880> look<00:01:47.030> at<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.210> strength<00:01:47.509> and<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.780> delicacy

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
we look at the strength and the delicacy

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.020 
we look at the strength and the delicacy
of<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:48.560> landscape<00:01:48.799> we<00:01:49.250> look<00:01:49.460> at<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:49.670> finesse

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
of this landscape we look at the finesse

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.819 
of this landscape we look at the finesse
of<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.299> flora<00:01:50.630> we<00:01:50.840> look<00:01:50.990> at<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.200> transparency

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
of the flora we look at the transparency

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:52.569 
of the flora we look at the transparency
of<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.100> flora

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
of the flora

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.730 
of the flora
we<00:01:53.030> look<00:01:53.299> at<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.509> translucency<00:01:54.259> of<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.530> light

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
we look at the translucency of the light

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.830 
we look at the translucency of the light
and<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.039> shadow<00:01:55.069> pens<00:01:55.610> we<00:01:56.270> look<00:01:56.450> at<00:01:56.569> the<00:01:56.659> way

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
and the shadow pens we look at the way

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.109 
and the shadow pens we look at the way
the<00:01:57.079> wind<00:01:57.319> acts<00:01:57.470> on<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.829> on<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.189> landscape<00:01:58.700> to

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
the wind acts on the on the landscape to

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.440 
the wind acts on the on the landscape to
see<00:01:59.299> how<00:01:59.479> nature<00:01:59.720> is<00:02:00.049> working<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.950> respond<00:02:01.460> to

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
see how nature is working to respond to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:36.740 
see how nature is working to respond to
those<00:02:02.659> factors<00:02:03.229> in<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:04.220> selection<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.819> site

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:03:10.490 

we<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.930> lotta<00:02:38.680> work<00:02:38.829> to<00:02:38.890> do

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.500 

we've<00:03:11.500> got<00:03:11.650> site<00:03:11.920> plans<00:03:12.280> with<00:03:12.670> but<00:03:12.879> drawings

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
we've got site plans with but drawings

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.809 
we've got site plans with but drawings
of<00:03:13.720> landscape<00:03:14.349> we've<00:03:14.650> got<00:03:14.830> sections<00:03:15.519> of

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
of landscape we've got sections of

things if we don't understand them we

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.680 
things if we don't understand them we
just<00:03:26.650> put<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.860> building<00:03:27.280> there<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.700> has<00:03:28.299> no
