00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Every day trucks are on the road and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.830
 provide us with countless books that 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.970
 big heavy loaded trucks safely 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.860
 to get to the goal 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.530
 for the driver a job with a lot 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.599
 responsibility the amazing many 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.449
 Security systems in modern trucks 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.970
 by emma in support him in case of emergency 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.260
 while burning situations too 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.760
 defuse the adaptive cruise control 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.789
 For example, with the help of a recognizes 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.099
 radar sensor preceding vehicles the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.719
 are slower when needed 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.670
 he independently reduces the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.559
 speed and then stops one 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.399
 constant safety distance to 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.120
 front congestion on highways are the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.379
 most common cause of rear-end collisions 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.170
 because driven braking maneuvers 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.579
 Vehicles driving in front often become too 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.010
 detected late the emergency brake assistant warns 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.109
 The driver when it gets tight and directs 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.670
 independently a full stop 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.480
 if this is not fast enough 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.489
 responding in extremely strong brake on 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.439
 slippery lane or if the driver 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.479
 suddenly another vehicle 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.369
 Dodge must attack 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.880
 stability program esp 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.850
 it prevents trucks and trailers from entering 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.640
 fling advised 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.600
 Balancing targeted brake interventions 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.350
 stabilize the vehicle without 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.330
 Engage the driver on long 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.000
 highway routes it is exhausting 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.360
 overtime to keep the track correct 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 the lane departure warning therefore covers with 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.380
 a video camera the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.360
 lane markings passes over 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.320
 drive it without flashing 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.210
 He warns him by a signal noises 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.240
 the driver assistance systems help 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.110
 truck drivers effectively accident-free to the destination 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.409
 so to come makes our roads 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.409
 secure
