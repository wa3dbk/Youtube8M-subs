00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
it's that big of a problem if you're I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.000 
it's that big of a problem if you're I
haven't<00:00:21.869> really<00:00:21.990> ran<00:00:22.260> into<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.619> unless<00:00:22.740> I

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
haven't really ran into it unless I

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.290 
haven't really ran into it unless I
actually<00:00:23.160> went<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.519> looks<00:00:23.760> for<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.119> certain

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
actually went and looks for this certain

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.240 
actually went and looks for this certain
problem<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:25.230> most<00:00:25.410> problems<00:00:25.830> will<00:00:25.980> happen

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
problem like most problems will happen

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.250 
problem like most problems will happen
like<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:28.050> think<00:00:28.109> it's

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
like that but I don't think it's

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.349 
like that but I don't think it's
something<00:00:28.380> anything<00:00:29.099> too<00:00:29.369> major<00:00:29.670> it'll<00:00:30.269> be

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
something anything too major it'll be

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.460 
something anything too major it'll be
something<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.840> they'll<00:00:30.990> probably<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.320> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
something that they'll probably have to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.049 
something that they'll probably have to
fix<00:00:31.650> yes<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.550> something<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:32.880> what

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
fix yes but it's not something that what

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.420 
fix yes but it's not something that what
should<00:00:33.420> stop<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.170> from<00:00:34.290> buying<00:00:34.530> an<00:00:34.739> ipad<00:00:34.980> 2<00:00:35.219> if
