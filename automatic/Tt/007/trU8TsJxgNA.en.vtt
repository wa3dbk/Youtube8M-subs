00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.069
 mobile 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:16.299
 for it 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.299
 let's open the keyboard in this case 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.739
 in the main menu month both the icons that we find fields 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.089
 physical not that gives us access 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.089
 direct to all of the lander's applications 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.260
 for it first you can first issue us 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.600
 what is the lazca and a blackberry identifier 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.770

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.999
 user and a password and it allows us to download what we want from 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.990
 in that case we are going to 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.340
 have a look 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.180
 it looks like inside the icons 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.590
 by category 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.620
 we can from aft theory the skein tiers 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.390
 if they are paid or not 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.670
 a series of filters for 2 where all the applications are or bondholders 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.670
 available in this case let's go to games 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.930
 now we go down with him 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.770
 touchpad 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.590
 I love you to know that they have 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.110
 for example within the category of pus 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.580
 even though 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.240
 its so much 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.400
 improsa of the listing 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.850
 in this case of 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.560
 because of the free ones we have free complications of points 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.630
 great 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.000
 well advanced 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.540
 one polo type we have left 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.460
 let's simply to 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.770
 to show you how bojan application 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.150
 we injured the application that we want to download 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.350
 in this case of this application that seems to be an afternoon 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.490
 i have space for criticism recommend a pib a series of screenshots 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.540
 of the application 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.380
 apart from rainfall 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.320
 from disarmament to vacate application 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080
 what he says that 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.720
 which includes the application 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.370
 comsa download 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.860
 we have screen message that joo has been installed correctly 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.139
 we used to accept another young man we were angry so you can see that we can 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.339
 'strain' applications we have previously left on purpose 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:23.139
 the demo paralyzed but it remains in the queue of the download queue now what 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.729
 what it does is that 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.389
 re-launch the download because we have left the application to 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.389
 teach application search filters from the beginning 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.339
 saizar the vices 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.889
 This is the plan 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:41.569
 the fact of applications 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.569
 filters preview images 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:48.299
 everything you need to 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.239
 give him 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.490
 boosted and productivity and use 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.179
 at its best the dog is great 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.710
 to the area very simple p once downloaded 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.870
 the applications are in the download tab or you can move the others to 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.109
 boston tojo 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.109
 the shortcuts 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.239
 we select a level of trust for the application 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.509
 we already have here 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:15.739
 this game 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.739
 free for 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.299
 for the prg being 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.389
 it's the typical east west of the typical game 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.179
 a good example of what we can not get off of 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.669
