 the authors of the study today more solutions he currently follows he 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.669
 get to know some patients 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.579
 I am convinced at the origin 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.300

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.240
 green but a fax 50 the title 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.170
 cottbus graphic artist if we were mobilized 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.010
 yet in front of the defense and especially the real environment 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.440
 for these facts by the hardest we finished further than the photos of 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 here we reproduced 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.070
 beat the environment how 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.700
 runners in the middle of an environment so far to put a

 upset this environment 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.040
 I have a lot of applications also playful for example to rehabilitate 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.680
 people for example happened in the green a problem had to be 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.000
 reeducated your shoulder needs to be educated and then the person like that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.180
 mentally not forget that she is rehabilitating herself and then is going 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.040
 raise more and more towards the game 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.740
 and then she'll get caught up in the game and she'll go a lot further than 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.980
 during a physiotherapy session for the standard the legislator must be 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.930
 reagent that is to say that the fingers by the exemption of the buttons a and 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.630
 business class 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.619
 certain movements precisely in relation to what appears on the screen 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.810
 either actively sprints 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.810
 to what's going on outside how to stay alert as in 2008 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.760
 we really have an evolution and stopped foot savate she will go home 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.400
 them in the house and we go on the red carpet percent and that me today 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.240
 people for a baker of the house% they're going to have a misfortune rug with 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.610
 a visual return 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.990
 dede in the environment just like people for the other stars of many

 will stay in the virtual stop buffer of users 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.759
 some applications to treat the fear of emptiness 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.939
