00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.840
 monaco sees a great price strong of 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.439
 the season with all its madness 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.630
 around 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.399
 now here we are we are we are in 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.920
 somehow in France so for me 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.839
 it's a bit of the grand prize at home 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.309
 the geographical situation is rather 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.960
 well the climate there can be some 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.329
 rain and monaco under the rain 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.010
 it's not easy we know that in Monaco and 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.510
 risks if we go out it's directly 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.980
 in the teeth the barriers in the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.479
 walls now we have to go get 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.879
 a little bit like a pilot of 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.340
 Rally the limits by playing with everything 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.840
 what we have in our hands one of the turns 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.920
 is more complicated than monaco so amazing 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.489
 it may seem like the time 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.260
 the first loft at 40 km huy 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.239
 yet it's complicated what we can 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.070
 waste a lot of time since we are 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.490
 it's really a speed bend 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.679
 very slow and if we lose 2 km in this sense 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.170
 the turn does not make a lost time 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:13.840
 pretty important I come I most 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.090
 fun monaco I want to say the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.399
 pool it's clermont arrives at 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.590
 springs from the chicane on to the first 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.630
 part of tabor office in 4th at 220 km 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.580
 hour and then then we go on there 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.849
 the pool attacking the war very 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.530
 strong and it's going really fast 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.090
 great memories of monaco 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.130
 I want to say 2011 the ascent 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.350
 crazy in gp2 where I left 26th and I 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.630
 then finish fourth on a circuit on 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.020
 is supposed to not be able to double that's true 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.509
 that it's always nice 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.400
 secret to monaco I like toys 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.590
 etc the rails in the limit of 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.560
 I like to feel reasonable here 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.790
 the car that will graze the rails and 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.790
 go get the best time
