00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.050
 so sorry what's up hotline is on the start 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.640
 and this time in hot wire mode but not 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.800
 as he probably already everywhere 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.040
 have seen with the cars and 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.740
 Rumcruisen etc but in transport 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.990
 helicopter every team has a transport 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.750
 helium and how should I say it is 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.720
 just really the strongest that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.640
 strongest vehicle in this mode it is 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.640
 An absolute kill machine you go 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.260
 especially in hot wire extremely off 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.689
 because you have to see her in her 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.819
 background gameplay the cars so the 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.719
 Opponents are highlighted all the time 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:38.769
 the map and also to look yes you 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.569
 I already know what I mean 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.519
 and you always have to go from car to car 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.289
 fly are mostly fully loaded 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.239
 you get in fat points flat for 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.339
 the hot wire takedown etc 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.679
 you make so many points in the transport 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.269
 eli so many kids in the transport heli because 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.510
 I am these bands I do not know how 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.789
 many fit in there 2 3 4 5 6 i know 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.109
 it does not know or five I do not know 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.139
 not exactly but definitely one 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.900
 Quantity and man so so from the transport 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:06.850
 Heli is such a small topic that I am 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.670
 very funny because for example 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.320
 Battlefield 3 or Battlefield 4 is here 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.820
 yes, always the teddy in battlefield 3 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.890
 and invest a lot of the scout helige 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.200
 flame of heard too strong and here and 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.790
 there and so on but the transport heli 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.250
 he was not engaged in any part 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.230
 great flame at least not like that 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.180
 got it or not so that 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.910
 I would have heard it in the battlefield 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.950
 3 was a mega strong weapon in 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.870
 Battlefield 4 was a mega strong one 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.060
 weapon and in battlefield hotline he is 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.820
 still damn strong just do not stop 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.400
 to fly from a to b because they are 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.320
 Most people use them from A to B. 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.460
 then come to jump off and up there 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.110
 to drop the ground 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.820
 No, if you say yes, I'll tell you 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.020
 there is at least two in it 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.520
 still a bit difficult I would say 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.590
 the gameplay we were now only too 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.300
 second in the transport eli and you see 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.510
 what has already come out at 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.580
 but if you 're there full-man squad in it 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.350
 So two ghana one pilot and two 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.440
 repair bitches then that's one 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.960
 unstoppable sweeper and the vogue 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.430
 was and will somehow never be missed 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.249
 because normally things like that become 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.379
 always filmed and not why 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:13.530
 because the early squad play is because you 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.240
 nothing can break alone 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.830
 not great for now 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.650
 For example, I do not quite understand it 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.450
 but in any case is working and 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.400
 It's a lot of fun, especially because 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.980
 you have to act together like this 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.630
 because of the pilot must fly properly and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.280
 You have to say you have to go right 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.360
 meet and you have a right one 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.370
 especially when you are a couple 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.050
 is now up as in the gameplay 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.550
 repairing the life repair fly away 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.500
 and so on has definitely one 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.400
 lots of fun made the round and her 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.330
 watch his gameplay 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.660
 one goes neatly off points kills really 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.370
 Crass now you could say okay that 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.190
 is overboard in the mode that it is too 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.130
 strong e mode and here and there as well 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.980
 but I always have to say 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.870
 the heli is like the scout elena 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.350
 has a damn easy to shut down 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.910
 to get 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.860
 let's just take the first 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.290
 sticker yes that is so bugged in 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.300
 Battlefield 3 was ecm and flers already 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.459
 I say a little bit bugged 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.470
 a little bit strong in operation four was ecm 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.530
 and flers even more packed and in 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.650
 Basically , it's kind of bugged, yes 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.110
 it never works but i dont know 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.630
 90 percent is always still 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.489
 by doing the ecm in perfect 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.500
 moment the flyers makes perfect 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.720
 sometimes even earlier because 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.920
 You know the sticker is going through 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.260
 if only in the perfect moment 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.980
 but she still goes through yes 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.470
 So ecm and fler flairs is in hallein 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.019
 still very much in need of improvement 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.060
 it's just a trifle okay though 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.320
 I die from a singer because of him 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.359
 has increased me and I have a mistake 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.900
 I've done everything okay 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.600
 with life 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.120
 but if you do everything right and 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.500
 Nevertheless, yes, everything is perfect 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.660
 right but you just die 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.079
 anyway due to a play 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.790
 error 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.640
 that is very depressing, I think 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.079
 bet recognizes that all that is always 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.239
 kinda depressing 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.350
 that's not nice because you can yes 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.900
 nothing for it has everything right 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.570
 made and you agree anyway and the 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.880
 Types of finger gets fat kills and 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.410
 could do it for it though 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.359
 definitely do not have to hit in any case 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.769
 first of all this thing that is also 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.500
 at the scout philosophy 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.800
 it is not possible at all 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.700
 be improved and otherwise clear 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.980
 can with the whole arms on the 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.450
 shoot heli shoot and go 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.700
 take it when you have the thumb 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.620
 I want to be very hard against one 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.990
 Film looks at the level of two epages 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.510
 there are two ghana in there and one can 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.580
 of course , heli would be good against 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.530
 the people are shooting at you though 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.660
 you also have to tell the heli flies 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.850
 really slow and for so long 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.940
 you do not fix this Ã¶rk I say 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.490
 Just sometimes you can even unlock 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.620
 It has also been repaired a lot 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.750
 slow and easy for the reason that 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.440
 the heli slowly flies the transport 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.510
 You can also do telesis fucking la mer 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.940
 very easy of so you will actually 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.250
 continuous when the opponents down 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.890
 want to have from 1 320 so 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.020
 hit and made the grenade launchers 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.940
 really good damage and if there are two 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.640
 then you are really relative 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.380
 fast in the ass but so is Battlefield 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.810
 that's also how it is in hardliner 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.910
 if you do everything right you go off 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.950
 if you make mistakes then you die 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.990
 and I can only do so much 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.240
 say if he has a few people like that 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.610
 to them with whom you are gambling or 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.479
 then try it out in 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.810
 the transporter 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.310
 clearly it may sound like the the 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.690
 fix the most sacred thing a bit 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.050
 lame but you can get out too 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.650
 Still repairing is very good 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.880
 Points 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.979
 You can also talk with the mentioned 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.050
 alternate less repaired now 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.050
 you and so on that is already clear 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.390
 only the pilot is always right you 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.729
 you have to end up on the score of 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.150
 my pilot of and creative 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.900
 look 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.430
 who I think 1,900 points is 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.020
 nothing really far and that 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.919
 scoreboard was with me all the time 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.660
 heli in there 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.770
 The pilot clearly gets a lot 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.570
 few points have to be much more 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.010
 get it from me is somehow 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.070
 half of the kids of those yes 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.900
 no or so because that's unfair 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.090
 nobody has the courage to fly that part 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.770
 absolutely must be prevented because 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.910
 I think many see this 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.919
 Never transport really only as 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.720
 transportable and not as absolute 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.760
 sweeper what he but in each part 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.919
 was in bed like 3 battlefield 4 and 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.140
 robert fiedler damn strong is part 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:32.210
 The pilot must be in battlefield 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.650
 line more points gets going even 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.990
 do not look at the sco 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.129
 that's really blatant that has to be changed 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.839
 then become 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.629
 It would also be fun for the pilot 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:44.360
 But I have to say that 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:46.849
 nobody has ford fly with us all 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.529
 Dugan or opera but no one wanted 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:50.509
 fly today that's the thing 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:52.669
 By the way you see it at the end like 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.139
 many have made cheesy in the round 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.059
 and I have to say right now 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:58.279
 that it is really little there it is still correct 

00:06:56.059 --> 00:07:01.429
 much more in it with kills 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:02.809
 transport helicopter in hot wire easy 

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:05.239
 because of that because I'm the fuck 

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:07.009
 could have had that is that's easy 

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:08.449
 the worst can be in the transport 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.999
 heli the third is in my opinion 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:14.240
 the best the overheating was very fast 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:15.740
 but if you give that the upgrade for 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.449
 anti overheating for me now 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.189
 Just go in then it works 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.479
 partly exaggerated and the cars are
