unlocks<00:01:55.800> the<00:01:55.800> next<00:01:56.220> one<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.399> then<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.880> one

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
unlocks the next one and then that one

unlocks the next one and then that one
unlocks<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.509> next<00:01:57.750> one<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.560> so

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
unlocks the next one and so on and so

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.510 
unlocks the next one and so on and so
forth<00:01:58.800> until<00:02:00.229> I'm<00:02:01.229> at<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.530> point<00:02:01.860> where<00:02:02.220> I'm

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
forth until I'm at this point where I'm

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.850 
forth until I'm at this point where I'm
getting<00:02:02.970> offensive<00:02:03.810> support<00:02:04.110> action<00:02:04.649> so

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
getting offensive support action so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.529 
getting offensive support action so
often<00:02:05.459> that<00:02:05.489> I'm<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.849> even<00:02:06.090> getting<00:02:06.209> any

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
often that I'm not even getting any

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.749 
often that I'm not even getting any
kills<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:07.050> my<00:02:07.200> actual<00:02:07.590> weapons

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
kills with my actual weapons

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.259 
kills with my actual weapons
and<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.390> just<00:02:10.569> made<00:02:10.750> me<00:02:10.929> think<00:02:11.200> about<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.610> the

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
and it just made me think about the the

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.910 
and it just made me think about the the
questions<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.810> kind<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.230> pop<00:02:14.439> them<00:02:14.620> them<00:02:14.799> up

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
questions that kind of pop them them up

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.380 
questions that kind of pop them them up
into<00:02:15.129> my<00:02:15.370> mind<00:02:15.549> the<00:02:15.760> first<00:02:16.000> time<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.239> played

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
into my mind the first time I played

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.690 
into my mind the first time I played
call<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.870> duty<00:02:17.230> for<00:02:17.470> which<00:02:17.500> as<00:02:17.920> far<00:02:18.430> as<00:02:18.579> I<00:02:18.640> know

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
call of duty for which as far as I know

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.660 
call of duty for which as far as I know
is<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.180> first<00:02:19.390> game<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:20.079> feature<00:02:20.920> killstreak

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
is the first game to feature killstreak

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.309 
is the first game to feature killstreak
rewards<00:02:22.209> or<00:02:22.390> something<00:02:22.750> similar<00:02:23.260> or

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
rewards or something similar or

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.539 
rewards or something similar or
something<00:02:23.739> of<00:02:23.829> that<00:02:23.860> nature<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:26.019> that<00:02:26.549> and

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
something of that nature and that and

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.149 
something of that nature and that and
that<00:02:27.579> question<00:02:28.239> is<00:02:28.629> is<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.620> really<00:02:30.129> necessary

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
that question is is it really necessary

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.289 
that question is is it really necessary
our<00:02:31.000> killstreak<00:02:31.510> rewards<00:02:31.930> really<00:02:32.319> necessary

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
our killstreak rewards really necessary

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.210 
our killstreak rewards really necessary
in<00:02:34.299> that<00:02:34.840> are<00:02:35.110> they<00:02:35.319> really<00:02:35.560> necessary

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
in that are they really necessary

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.289 
in that are they really necessary
because<00:02:36.670> what<00:02:37.480> they<00:02:37.599> do<00:02:37.659> is<00:02:38.549> they<00:02:39.549> reward<00:02:40.030> good

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
because what they do is they reward good

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.420 
because what they do is they reward good
players<00:02:40.659> for<00:02:41.140> being<00:02:41.379> good<00:02:41.590> by<00:02:41.890> making<00:02:42.310> them

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
players for being good by making them

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.240

even better you have a good player

support<00:06:09.960> actions<00:06:10.560> are<00:06:10.710> incredibly<00:06:11.400> powerful

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
support actions are incredibly powerful

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.480 
support actions are incredibly powerful
and<00:06:12.120> you'll<00:06:13.020> see<00:06:13.260> in<00:06:13.380> just<00:06:13.410> a<00:06:13.680> second<00:06:14.070> I<00:06:14.130> call

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
in my cruise missile and I call it in to

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.570 
in my cruise missile and I call it in to
like<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.200> middle<00:06:19.530> of<00:06:19.650> this<00:06:19.800> town<00:06:20.130> and<00:06:20.460> it

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
like the middle of this town and it

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.629 
like the middle of this town and it
kills<00:06:20.850> me

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
kills me

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.749 
kills me
on<00:06:21.699> the<00:06:22.120> far<00:06:22.360> end<00:06:22.599> in<00:06:22.840> my<00:06:22.990> spawn<00:06:23.400> or<00:06:24.400> at<00:06:24.490> least<00:06:24.639> I

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 
on the far end in my spawn or at least I

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:28.020 
on the far end in my spawn or at least I
think<00:06:24.819> that's<00:06:25.060> what<00:06:25.270> happened<00:06:25.479> I<00:06:26.969> if<00:06:27.969> you

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.820 
think that's what happened I if you
didn't<00:06:28.360> notice<00:06:28.509> the<00:06:29.050> last<00:06:29.199> time<00:06:29.469> I<00:06:29.499> dyed<00:06:29.800> it
