00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
if you know you're fishing crayfish

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.189 
if you know you're fishing crayfish
where<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> fish<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.809> what

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
where are you going to fish it what

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.049 
where are you going to fish it what
we're<00:00:49.320> gonna<00:00:49.410> beat<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.980> shallows<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.670> mean

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
we're gonna beat the shallows I mean

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.729 
we're gonna beat the shallows I mean
fine<00:00:51.239> more<00:00:51.600> time<00:00:51.870> I'd<00:00:52.110> probably<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:52.589> in

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
fine more time I'd probably go out in

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.009 
fine more time I'd probably go out in
the<00:00:52.800> middle<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.280> lake<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> try<00:00:54.390> find<00:00:54.690> an

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
the middle of this lake and try find an

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.140 
the middle of this lake and try find an
underwater<00:00:55.409> hum<00:00:55.830> for<00:00:56.040> some<00:00:56.519> area<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.089> lot

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
underwater hum for some area that a lot

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.299 
underwater hum for some area that a lot
of<00:00:57.390> anglers<00:00:57.720> don't<00:00:58.199> fish<00:00:58.530> well<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.220> gonna

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
of anglers don't fish well we're gonna

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.890 
of anglers don't fish well we're gonna
beat<00:00:59.580> the<00:00:59.790> bank<00:01:00.030> because<00:01:00.330> that's<00:01:00.690> for

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
beat the bank because that's for

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.960 
beat the bank because that's for
crayfish<00:01:01.290> live<00:01:01.589> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.519> think<00:01:02.729> about<00:01:02.760> it

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
crayfish live and then think about it

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.219 
crayfish live and then think about it
