what happens I'm going to use the XD 45
on<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.660> right<00:00:51.899> that's<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.320> 5<00:00:52.530> inch<00:00:52.559> barrel<00:00:53.250> in

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
on your right that's a 5 inch barrel in

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.239 
on your right that's a 5 inch barrel in
the<00:00:53.999> middle<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:55.199> glock<00:00:55.859> 27<00:00:56.609> and<00:00:57.109> 40<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> then

00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249 
the middle is a glock 27 and 40 and then

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:02.959 
the middle is a glock 27 and 40 and then
on<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.429> left<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.480> car<00:01:01.109> see<00:01:01.679> a<00:01:01.710> nine<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
on your left is a car see a nine and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.270 
on your left is a car see a nine and
nine<00:01:03.120> millimeter<00:01:03.650> then<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.010> regular

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
nine millimeter then you just regular

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.040 
nine millimeter then you just regular
federal<00:01:06.020> full<00:01:07.020> metal<00:01:07.260> jacket<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> each<00:01:09.050> let's

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
federal full metal jacket and each let's

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.710 
federal full metal jacket and each let's
see<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:10.260> happens<00:01:10.970> ok<00:01:11.970> I'm<00:01:12.060> about<00:01:12.330> 8<00:01:12.540> yards

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
see what happens ok I'm about 8 yards

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.390 
see what happens ok I'm about 8 yards
away<00:01:12.990> let's<00:01:13.320> start<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.800> dye<00:01:13.920> millimeter

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
away let's start with the dye millimeter

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:29.570 
away let's start with the dye millimeter
car<00:01:15.170> cm9

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.250 

well<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.700> certainly<00:01:30.909> went<00:01:31.270> through<00:01:31.690> but<00:01:32.050> it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
well it certainly went through but it

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.960 
well it certainly went through but it
didn't<00:01:32.560> go<00:01:32.680> through<00:01:32.950> any<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.400> internals<00:01:33.850> of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
didn't go through any the internals of

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.719 
didn't go through any the internals of
aiming<00:01:34.960> for<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.140> lower<00:01:35.380> corner<00:01:35.800> so<00:01:36.369> we're

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
aiming for that lower corner so we're

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.480 
aiming for that lower corner so we're
going<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.940> try<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.240> again<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.780> once<00:01:38.229> again

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
going to try that again and once again

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.859 
going to try that again and once again
move<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.610> over<00:01:39.700> a<00:01:39.880> little<00:01:40.030> bit<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.390> try<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.690> get

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
move it over a little bit and try to get

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:56.010 
move it over a little bit and try to get
that<00:01:41.020> area<00:01:41.320> right<00:01:41.380> there<00:01:54.780> let's<00:01:55.780> take<00:01:55.960> a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
that area right there let's take a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.320 
that area right there let's take a
closer<00:01:56.350> look<00:01:56.470> at<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:56.950> okay<00:01:57.850> there<00:01:58.119> are<00:01:58.149> the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
closer look at that okay there are the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.900 
closer look at that okay there are the
groupings<00:01:58.860> what<00:01:59.860> is<00:01:59.979> interesting<00:02:00.160> is<00:02:00.700> not

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
groupings what is interesting is not

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.359 
groupings what is interesting is not
only<00:02:01.149> did<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.450> go<00:02:01.630> through<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.570> front<00:02:05.369> but

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
only did it go through the front but

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.499 
only did it go through the front but
they<00:02:06.490> did<00:02:06.670> go<00:02:06.910> through<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.330> back<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:09.509> they

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
they did go through the back and they

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.590 
they did go through the back and they
even<00:02:10.600> went<00:02:10.929> through<00:02:11.140> my<00:02:11.350> wooden<00:02:12.220> fence<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:13.510> if

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
even went through my wooden fence so if

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.880 
even went through my wooden fence so if
I<00:02:13.660> take<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.050> on<00:02:14.110> their<00:02:14.320> side<00:02:15.390> you'll<00:02:16.390> see<00:02:16.890> that

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
I take you on their side you'll see that

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.680 
I take you on their side you'll see that
now<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.100> went<00:02:18.430> through<00:02:18.519> the<00:02:18.640> car<00:02:18.820> door<00:02:18.850> went

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
now I went through the car door went

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.900 
now I went through the car door went
through<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.959> beds<00:02:20.200> as<00:02:20.380> well<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.890> have<00:02:21.820> a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
through the beds as well I have a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.140 
through the beds as well I have a
feeling<00:02:22.090> where<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.450> is<00:02:22.510> going<00:02:22.870> alright<00:02:24.150> 40

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
ok there are my eight shots from the 40

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.869 
ok there are my eight shots from the 40
go<00:02:50.810> around<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.260> other<00:02:51.290> side<00:02:52.870> show<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:53.930> that

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
go around the other side show you that

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.190 
go around the other side show you that
in<00:02:55.879> fact<00:02:56.180> all<00:02:56.510> 8<00:02:56.840> went<00:02:57.140> through<00:02:57.489> as<00:02:58.959> well<00:02:59.959> head

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
in fact all 8 went through as well head

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.940 
in fact all 8 went through as well head
through<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.590> fence<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.910> out<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.269> other<00:03:05.329> side

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
through the fence and out the other side

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.520 
through the fence and out the other side
so<00:03:06.950> just<00:03:06.980> like<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.340> 9-millimeter<00:03:08.410> before<00:03:09.410> he

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
so just like the 9-millimeter before he

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.100 
so just like the 9-millimeter before he
went<00:03:09.620> through<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.099> car<00:03:10.310> door<00:03:10.989> through<00:03:11.989> the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
went through the car door through the
