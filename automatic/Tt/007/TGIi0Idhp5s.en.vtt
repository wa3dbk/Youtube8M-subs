00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hello Pachany today I want to talk 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.450
 on a topic like ssd, that is, some 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.610
 think to buy it or not than advantages 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.170
 what are the cons now you see on your 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.859
 screens how fast is allowed 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.480
 computer programs 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.779
 yes not only windows programs without no 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.369
 copying speed is allowed 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:28.650
 downloading is also faster if on regular ones 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.840
 Session is 105 on ssd in 450 days fighters 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.559
 there will be and with the difference is very large and this 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.260
 normal created site ssd rearranged to 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.200
 one and a half thousand and byte comes in a second 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.090
 but this is a separate topic 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.360
 that is, now I will show you how else 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.450
 windows does not start 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.329
 windows 8 and no ssd can posture with it 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.829
 light applying what you have here and just 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.050
 draw conclusions let's see the video 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.410
 for quality do not judge strictly that is my 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.690
 the phone just refuses to take 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.900
 later time when it is dark therefore 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.580
 the quality of this as the whole garden did not put 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.090
 cooling on bought out very satisfied 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.450
 turned on the computer bios but bios and such 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.430
 theme 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.830
 thou each have differently produced 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 bios but windows itself 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:29.250
 Went already loading Windows well and in principle 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.380
 it is over here and the fact that such 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.740
 there is a plus to him very much if you put 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.549
 on 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.100
 It is on the ssd game that much faster 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.590
 work because just recently 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.009
 put the battlefield 4 on the disk c game not 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.450
 mad 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:49.079
 and battlefield 3 downloaded to disk d and you 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.710
 You know, I was a little surprised to bomb 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.810
 start really some really 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 it takes me a long time to get used to it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.369
 Of course from the first time I left, they thought 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.159
 what was with the computer looking for reasons 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.799
 why is it disarming but then arguing 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.970
 that I have everything on the disk here it is to his 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.230
 the topic is shorter 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:15.080
 that is, look at the videos in the tube very 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.440
 a useful topic is an hour 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.440
 new computers which games you him without 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.660
 ssd have nowhere landed already should be 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.600
 every computer but there are comrades 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.000
 who claim it's not all 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.730
 the good thing is that he is faster 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.010
 so also no noise does not create 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.030
 only there is no mechanics she 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.090
 much more compact and power consumption 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.580
 they are much smaller 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.920
 plus a lot more than 1 article of guilt minus 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.840
 this is this price datsan package strike 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:55.010
 big but basically these options are possible 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.380
 non boxing i.e. the daguer process without 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.380
 all kinds of cords and bonds in paid off for 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.580
 kingston get i'll take off the link to my 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:12.860
 ssd who is from Ukraine 700 hryvnia gss diets 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:17.390
 nostalgia for this very little principle 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:21.590
 thanks for your all looked a lot 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.310
 dislaykam not start and brought for quality 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.310
 video excuse 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:35.610
 that is, eat back 6 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:36.830
 Cossack so wait until Bob has become 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.230
