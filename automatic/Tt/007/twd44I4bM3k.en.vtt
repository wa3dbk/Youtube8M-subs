00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
happened in the first film which I also

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.429 
happened in the first film which I also
love<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:06.299> when<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> read<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> comics<00:01:07.260> as

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
love because when you read the comics as

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.390 
love because when you read the comics as
well<00:01:07.500> Frank<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.520> go<00:01:08.640> back<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.090> do

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
well Frank would go back and do

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.010 
well Frank would go back and do
storylines<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.580> were<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> same<00:01:12.330> day<00:01:12.689> as

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
storylines that were on the same day as

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.590 
storylines that were on the same day as
like<00:01:13.350> really<00:01:13.890> epic<00:01:14.100> scenery<00:01:14.790> from<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.150> previous

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
like really epic scenery from a previous

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.020 
like really epic scenery from a previous
book<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.290> he<00:01:16.470> would<00:01:16.619> always<00:01:16.650> kind<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.430> keep

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
book and so he would always kind of keep

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.429 
book and so he would always kind of keep
flirting<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.780> idea<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.320> back

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
flirting with this idea of going back

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.109 
flirting with this idea of going back
and<00:01:19.799> playing<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.220> time<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.759> think<00:01:20.820> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and playing with time and I think this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.359 
and playing with time and I think this
film<00:01:21.450> does<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.590> plays<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.130> idea

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
film does that and plays with that idea

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:32.600 
film does that and plays with that idea
