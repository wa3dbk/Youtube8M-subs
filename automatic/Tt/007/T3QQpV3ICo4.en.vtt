share<00:00:31.640> center<00:00:32.270> of<00:00:32.509> sorts<00:00:32.989> basically<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.100> runs

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
share center of sorts basically it runs

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.310 
share center of sorts basically it runs
a<00:00:34.850> little<00:00:34.880> bit<00:00:35.180> like<00:00:35.360> Sonos<00:00:35.900> and<00:00:36.140> that<00:00:36.230> it

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
a little bit like Sonos and that it

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.200 
a little bit like Sonos and that it
gives<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:36.590> control<00:00:36.800> over<00:00:37.100> audio<00:00:37.910> in

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210

interface here to more of like a
controller<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:49.560> should<00:02:49.890> send<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.400> right<00:02:50.610> over

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
controller it should send it right over

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.550 
controller it should send it right over
and<00:02:51.239> there<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.569> goes<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.200> takes<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.440> little

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
and there it goes so it takes a little

and there it goes so it takes a little
second<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.700> over<00:02:53.940> Wi-Fi<00:02:54.120> we'll<00:02:54.599> see<00:02:54.750> how

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
second but so over Wi-Fi we'll see how

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.330 
second but so over Wi-Fi we'll see how
fast<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:59.209> and<00:03:00.530> in<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.860> second<00:03:02.250> it

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
fast this is and in just a second it

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.130 
fast this is and in just a second it
