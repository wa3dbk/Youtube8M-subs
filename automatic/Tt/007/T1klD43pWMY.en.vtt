Undertaker<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> return<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.580> said<00:01:20.909> if

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
Undertaker going to return and I said if

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.800 
Undertaker going to return and I said if
he<00:01:21.810> returns<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:22.890> probably<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.630> raw

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
he returns it would probably be the raw

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960 
he returns it would probably be the raw
after<00:01:25.110> elimination<00:01:25.770> chamber<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.640> would<00:01:26.820> make

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
after elimination chamber it would make

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.340 
after elimination chamber it would make
no<00:01:27.000> sense<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.570> him<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> return<00:01:28.170> before

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
no sense for him to return before

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.219 
no sense for him to return before
elimination<00:01:28.950> chamber<00:01:29.570> because<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> fact

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
elimination chamber because of the fact

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
elimination chamber because of the fact
that<00:01:31.439> um<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.520> you're<00:01:32.700> trying<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.970> build

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that um you know you're trying to build

up<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.450> Elimination<00:01:33.900> Chamber<00:01:34.079> an<00:01:34.380> undertaker

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
up to Elimination Chamber an undertaker

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.620 
up to Elimination Chamber an undertaker
appearing<00:01:35.490> before<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.909> pay-per-view<00:01:36.360> would

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
appearing before the pay-per-view would

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.719 
appearing before the pay-per-view would
kind<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> diversion<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.610> know

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
kind of be a diversion and you know

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.039 
kind of be a diversion and you know
would<00:01:38.970> get<00:01:39.119> people's<00:01:39.450> attention<00:01:39.509> away<00:01:39.930> from

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
would get people's attention away from

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.770 
would get people's attention away from
the<00:01:40.259> pay-per-view<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.820> Undertaker's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the pay-per-view so I'm if Undertaker's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.620 
the pay-per-view so I'm if Undertaker's
returning<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.590> think<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.399> next<00:01:45.210> Monday's<00:01:45.600> Raw

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
returning I think that next Monday's Raw

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.300 
returning I think that next Monday's Raw
will<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> night<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.470> he<00:01:46.649> returns<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.250> he

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
will be the night that he returns if he

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.960 
will be the night that he returns if he
doesn't<00:01:47.700> appear<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.210> Ron<00:01:48.990> next<00:01:49.320> week<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:49.970> it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
doesn't appear on Ron next week then it

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 
doesn't appear on Ron next week then it
very<00:01:51.329> well<00:01:51.420> could<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.020> possibility<00:01:52.530> that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
very well could be a possibility that

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.130 
very well could be a possibility that
he's<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.329> doing<00:01:54.509> WrestleMania

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
he's not going to be doing WrestleMania

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
he's not going to be doing WrestleMania
this<00:01:55.290> year<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.040> know<00:01:56.130> he<00:01:56.280> does<00:01:56.490> look<00:01:56.700> old

this year and you know he does look old

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.050 
this year and you know he does look old
in<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> pictures<00:01:57.509> being<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.189> he<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.219> do

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
in the pictures being a what he I do

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.289 
in the pictures being a what he I do
think<00:02:00.450> he<00:02:00.570> lost<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.960> bit<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.140> weight<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.299> I

think he lost a bit of weight and I I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.709 
think he lost a bit of weight and I I
think<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.200> um<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.680> his<00:02:05.579> body<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.240> allow<00:02:06.360> it

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
think that um if his body will allow it

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.479 
think that um if his body will allow it
he<00:02:06.899> will<00:02:07.079> do<00:02:07.229> WrestleMania<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.069> year<00:02:08.459> I

more<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.040> think<00:02:53.430> Brock<00:02:53.640> Lesnar's<00:02:54.210> return<00:02:54.600> was

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
more I think Brock Lesnar's return was

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.030 
more I think Brock Lesnar's return was
expected<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.310> mean<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.610> was<00:02:56.760> inevitable<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:58.170> I

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
expected I mean it was inevitable I I

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.030 
expected I mean it was inevitable I I
figured<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.060> night<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:01.080> he<00:03:01.110> lost<00:03:01.530> and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
figured the night that he lost and

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.390 
figured the night that he lost and
retired<00:03:02.850> from<00:03:03.060> UFC<00:03:03.720> right<00:03:04.590> there<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.920> figure

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
retired from UFC right there I figure

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.430 
retired from UFC right there I figure
you<00:03:05.550> know<00:03:05.670> he's<00:03:05.850> he's<00:03:05.880> gonna<00:03:06.330> go<00:03:06.510> back<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.720> WWE

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
you know he's he's gonna go back to WWE

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.610 
you know he's he's gonna go back to WWE
itself<00:03:07.860> at<00:03:08.040> some<00:03:08.310> point<00:03:08.780> so<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:10.080> wasn't<00:03:10.440> too

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
itself at some point so I wasn't too

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.950 
itself at some point so I wasn't too
surprised<00:03:11.160> when<00:03:11.460> he<00:03:11.490> showed<00:03:11.820> up<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.810> raw

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
surprised when he showed up the raw

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.750 
surprised when he showed up the raw
after<00:03:13.110> WrestleMania<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.010> figured<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.730> that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
after WrestleMania I figured that that

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.490 
after WrestleMania I figured that that
was<00:03:14.970> going<00:03:15.210> to<00:03:15.270> happen<00:03:15.420> sooner<00:03:16.020> or<00:03:16.050> later<00:03:16.260> you

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
was going to happen sooner or later you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.180 
was going to happen sooner or later you
know<00:03:16.530> WWE<00:03:17.130> would<00:03:17.370> make<00:03:18.060> him<00:03:18.270> an<00:03:18.390> offer<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:19.190> he

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
know WWE would make him an offer and he

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.680 
know WWE would make him an offer and he
would<00:03:20.340> accept<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.910> under<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.540> right

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
would accept it under the right

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.360 
would accept it under the right
circumstances<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.740> you<00:03:22.800> know<00:03:22.890> they<00:03:23.010> gave<00:03:23.190> him

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
circumstances and you know they gave him

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.760 
circumstances and you know they gave him
a<00:03:23.430> limited<00:03:23.850> schedule<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.720> lot<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.740> money

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
a limited schedule and a lot of money

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.760 
a limited schedule and a lot of money
and<00:03:26.190> he<00:03:26.550> took<00:03:27.540> them<00:03:27.750> up<00:03:27.870> on<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.140> offer<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.740> I

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
and he took them up on the offer so I

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.640 
and he took them up on the offer so I
mean<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.280> figured<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.330> what<00:03:30.510> happened<00:03:30.870> the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
mean I figured that what happened the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
two before that made it very clear he

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.830 
two before that made it very clear he
was<00:03:38.610> done<00:03:38.820> with<00:03:38.850> wrestling<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.570> he<00:03:39.630> wasn't

of that match I like to build up the

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.930 
of that match I like to build up the
concept<00:04:38.500> of<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:38.680> McMahon<00:04:39.009> in<00:04:39.130> every<00:04:39.340> corner<00:04:39.639> but

retirement match the Triple H that was a

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
retirement match the Triple H that was a
good<00:04:46.840> way<00:04:47.020> for<00:04:47.050> him<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.380> go<00:04:47.620> out<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:49.289> I<00:04:50.289> I

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
good way for him to go out and I I

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.200 
good way for him to go out and I I
didn't<00:04:51.070> see<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.310> point<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.699> bring<00:04:51.970> him<00:04:52.150> back

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210
