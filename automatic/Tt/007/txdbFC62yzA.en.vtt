00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.059
 you do not do something it escapes is impossible 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.059
 that has 70 years of history 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.320
 there can always be pieces of 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.439
 absences that you would like to have seen a 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.020
 played a goal that you remember but the 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.300
 essence 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.630
 what is the monterrey soccer club how 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.490
 when and where was it born to understand 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.070
 that the first decades were more about 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.320
 of a sacrifice for the love of a sport 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.239
 that it cost money to people who 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.460
 they were involved that the watershed 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.430
 historical of it is in the seventies 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.800
 when a business leader makes a 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.450
 constellation of stars and with it the 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.640
 that many consider the best striped 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.820
 of history the one of rubén romeo corbo or 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.280
 milton carlos luís rode and the bones the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.739
 scorpion jiménez huaraz and barbosa bueno 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.120
 that there it is and if it could have been is 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.850
 part of the conflicts that we have to 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.470
 solve there are many many stories 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.320
 stories of alejandro that there is 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.110
 count on it yes yes yes on the trip 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.630
 we have interviewed almost 70 people 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.840
 to be able to nourish the moment with the essence 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.600
 more dramatic sometimes even with 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.670
 romantic tragic situations like a thousand 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.770
 touch them that says that the only decision 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.950
 of which they most regret all their 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.409
 lifetime 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.380
 41 years ago not having stayed to live 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.750
 the world says that in the worst decision of 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.149
 his life I was very captivated by 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.770
 characters of the seventies because there 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.259
 something between the nostalgia of 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.079
 frustration and believing that they failed 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.080
 nothing since it helped us all to understand 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.360
 who achieved everything 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.250
 they managed to generate a massive hobby 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.410
 understand how it was is part of 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.630
 documentary they achieved a bigger trophy 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.280
 that of a single championship will see 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.040
 martelotto discuss with her frank 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.780
 who is a better 10 that I have one 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.120
 against the other one because it's very funny 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.920
 Very funny and you will see bertozzi enter 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.320
 scene and say to me from number 2 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.240
 what if you with the number 1 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.850
 Who you stay with are many decades and 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.010
 many characters 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.540
 proof I think the vision is 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.550
 including projecting it in some rooms 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.790
 cinema and definitely run 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.560
 commercially to dvd exactly in what 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.520
 formats and times I think the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.450
 institution will see the use and application 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.830
 well for the hundreds of thousands of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.940
 there are fans and maybe for the 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.460
 people who love sports at a level 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.750
 national or international to that we 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.430
 we dedicate if we should do the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.350
 documents in such a way that any 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.950
 person in any part of the world 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.950
 Can enjoy
