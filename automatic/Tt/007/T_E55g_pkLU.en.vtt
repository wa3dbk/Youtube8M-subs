00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
looking at her that you're probably

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.250 
looking at her that you're probably
looking<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> mirror<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:42.930> if<00:00:43.050> there's

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
looking in the mirror to see if there's

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.869 
looking in the mirror to see if there's
something<00:00:43.410> energy<00:00:43.829> number<00:00:44.280> three<00:00:44.610> she'll

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
something energy number three she'll

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.040 
something energy number three she'll
make<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.059> sudden<00:00:45.300> change<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.780> appearance

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
make a sudden change in appearance

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
make a sudden change in appearance
reason<00:00:46.860> why<00:00:46.950> she<00:00:47.100> changes<00:00:47.460> her<00:00:47.489> appearance<00:00:47.789> is

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
reason why she changes her appearance is

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.799 
reason why she changes her appearance is
because<00:00:48.210> she<00:00:48.300> wants<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> catch<00:00:48.660> your

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
because she wants to catch your

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.959 
because she wants to catch your
attention<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.860> she'll<00:00:50.129> probably<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.550> get<00:00:50.910> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
attention so she'll probably like get a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.779 
attention so she'll probably like get a
haircut<00:00:51.420> or<00:00:51.480> dye<00:00:51.960> her<00:00:52.140> hair<00:00:52.199> or<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.579> some

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
haircut or dye her hair or do some

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.840 
haircut or dye her hair or do some
pretty<00:00:54.000> makeup<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.660> stuff<00:00:55.550> number<00:00:56.550> four

she'll laugh at all your jokes maybe not

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.069 
she'll laugh at all your jokes maybe not
all<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.579> but<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.780> goes<00:01:00.960> along

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
all of them but like this goes along

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.420 
all of them but like this goes along
with<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> whole<00:01:01.559> smiling<00:01:02.129> while<00:01:02.250> she's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
with the whole smiling while she's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340 
with the whole smiling while she's
talking<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> thing<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.049> kind<00:01:04.320> of

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
talking to you thing like it's kind of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.719 
talking to you thing like it's kind of
weird<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.710> you're<00:01:04.860> smiling<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.580> whole<00:01:05.610> time

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
weird if you're smiling the whole time

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.670 
weird if you're smiling the whole time
and<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:06.299> really<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.630> laughing<00:01:07.350> or<00:01:07.470> giggling

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
and not really like laughing or giggling

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.060 
and not really like laughing or giggling
so<00:01:08.400> she'll<00:01:08.610> probably<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.210> oh<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.950> so

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
so she'll probably be like oh it's so

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.399 
so she'll probably be like oh it's so
funny<00:01:11.400> oh<00:01:11.760> my<00:01:12.060> god<00:01:12.299> really

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
funny oh my god really

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
funny oh my god really
number<00:01:13.619> five<00:01:13.920> she'll<00:01:14.280> make<00:01:14.430> time<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.909> hang<00:01:15.090> out

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
number five she'll make time to hang out

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.789 
number five she'll make time to hang out
with<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.570> maybe<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:16.650> as

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
with you maybe is not as much as

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.499 
with you maybe is not as much as
possible<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.729> ask<00:01:17.939> her<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.180> hang<00:01:18.330> out

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
possible but if you ask her to hang out

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.899 
possible but if you ask her to hang out
most<00:01:18.960> likely<00:01:19.200> she<00:01:19.380> will<00:01:19.530> say<00:01:19.710> yes<00:01:19.890> if<00:01:20.490> she<00:01:20.729> says

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
most likely she will say yes if she says

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.399 
most likely she will say yes if she says
no<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.479> probably<00:01:21.659> because<00:01:21.900> she<00:01:22.170> really

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
no that's probably because she really

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.230 
no that's probably because she really
does<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.770> something<00:01:22.950> important<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.700> but

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
does have something important to do but

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.730 
does have something important to do but
she<00:01:24.420> will<00:01:24.570> make<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.170> by<00:01:25.290> asking<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.680> you

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
the way that her friends act if you're

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.600 
the way that her friends act if you're
talking<00:02:59.830> to<00:02:59.920> her<00:03:00.010> friends<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.519> they<00:03:00.580> like

giggle and whisper each other that's

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.170 
giggle and whisper each other that's
most<00:03:02.920> likely<00:03:03.310> because<00:03:03.580> she<00:03:03.700> has<00:03:03.820> told<00:03:04.030> her

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
most likely because she has told her

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.150 
most likely because she has told her
friends<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.660> she<00:03:04.720> likes<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.650> they're

friends that she likes you and they're
all<00:03:06.280> like<00:03:06.580> oh<00:03:06.820> my<00:03:07.060> god<00:03:07.239> he's<00:03:07.690> talking<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.140> us

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
all like oh my god he's talking to us

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.470

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
and she likes him oh okay that's a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.940 
and she likes him oh okay that's a
little<00:03:10.690> exaggerated<00:03:11.200> but<00:03:11.410> yeah<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.769> get<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
little exaggerated but yeah you get the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.330 
little exaggerated but yeah you get the
idea

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
idea

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.460 
idea
another<00:03:13.299> way<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.660> if<00:03:13.780> you're<00:03:13.930> walking<00:03:14.080> up<00:03:14.380> to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
another way is if you're walking up to

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.720 
another way is if you're walking up to
her<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.739> her<00:03:14.860> friend<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.310> she<00:03:15.519> suddenly

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
her and her friend and she suddenly

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.310 
her and her friend and she suddenly
stops<00:03:16.120> talking<00:03:16.299> that's<00:03:16.870> probably<00:03:17.170> because

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
stops talking that's probably because

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.840 
stops talking that's probably because
the<00:03:17.500> conversation<00:03:18.070> was<00:03:18.220> about<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.549> some
