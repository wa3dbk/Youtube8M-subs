00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
and then the rock can get this now then

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.850 
and then the rock can get this now then
and<00:04:12.010> open<00:04:12.340> automatically<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.740> after<00:04:14.740> a<00:04:14.770> while

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
and open automatically and after a while

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.860 
and open automatically and after a while
you<00:04:15.070> came<00:04:15.250> close<00:04:15.490> with<00:04:15.790> more<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.209> more<00:04:16.239> and

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
also to just just have some panama's

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.730 
also to just just have some panama's
dogs<00:06:19.210> because<00:06:19.630> nothing<00:06:20.350> is<00:06:20.470> worse<00:06:20.650> than
