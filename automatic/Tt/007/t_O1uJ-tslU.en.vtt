our<00:04:10.810> gallery

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.910 

pretty<00:04:14.690> straightforward<00:04:15.230> isn't<00:04:15.650> it's<00:04:15.890> not

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
pretty straightforward isn't it's not

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.160 
pretty straightforward isn't it's not
really<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.310> whole<00:04:16.430> lot<00:04:16.459> going<00:04:16.850> on<00:04:16.940> here

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
really a whole lot going on here

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.159 
really a whole lot going on here
but<00:04:18.320> it<00:04:18.410> does<00:04:18.560> work<00:04:18.590> it's<00:04:18.980> very<00:04:19.160> powerful

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
but it does work it's very powerful

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.400 
but it does work it's very powerful
and<00:04:21.650> go<00:04:21.949> into<00:04:22.189> self<00:04:22.689> to<00:04:23.689> more<00:04:24.340> contact

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.410 

and<00:04:27.530> that's<00:04:28.160> another<00:04:28.400> reason<00:04:28.670> why<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:28.970> try<00:04:29.360> to

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
and that's another reason why I try to

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.380 
and that's another reason why I try to
name<00:04:29.780> my<00:04:30.290> pages<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:31.160> names<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.820> what<00:04:32.030> they<00:04:32.180> are

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
name my pages the names of what they are

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.839 
name my pages the names of what they are
makes<00:04:33.170> it<00:04:33.320> easy<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.590> find<00:04:33.890> them

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.119 

and<00:04:36.939> last<00:04:37.839> one<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.349> don't<00:04:38.589> think<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:38.830> did<00:04:39.009> the

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:39.129 
and last one I don't think I did the

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.239 
and last one I don't think I did the
target<00:04:39.639> on<00:04:39.729> that<00:04:39.759> one<00:04:39.999> we'll<00:04:40.179> come<00:04:40.360> back<00:04:40.509> to<00:04:40.659> it

available to the lite version so we

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.750 
available to the lite version so we

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
buy but even though we're not doing that

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.110 
buy but even though we're not doing that
even<00:05:17.949> though<00:05:18.190> we're<00:05:18.370> actually<00:05:18.610> creating

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
even though we're actually creating

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.629 
even though we're actually creating
something<00:05:19.360> rather<00:05:19.600> simple<00:05:20.169> it<00:05:20.350> is<00:05:21.070> free<00:05:21.400> I

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
something rather simple it is free I

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.070 
something rather simple it is free I
think<00:05:21.699> it's<00:05:22.000> pretty<00:05:22.090> powerful<00:05:22.360> for<00:05:22.780> something

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
think it's pretty powerful for something

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.810 
think it's pretty powerful for something
it's<00:05:23.229> free<00:05:23.470> we<00:05:24.130> can<00:05:24.160> come<00:05:24.340> down<00:05:24.460> here<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.700> look

it's free we can come down here and look

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.600 
it's free we can come down here and look
at<00:05:25.000> it<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:26.380> can<00:05:26.530> see<00:05:26.710> it<00:05:26.770> does<00:05:26.889> work

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
at it you can see it does work

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.490 
at it you can see it does work

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
now we have to save it because it's

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.710 
now we have to save it because it's

ahead and close this out
go<00:06:11.820> ahead<00:06:11.940> and<00:06:12.030> save<00:06:12.210> it<00:06:12.620> so<00:06:13.620> we<00:06:13.770> have<00:06:14.070> a<00:06:14.340> menu

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
go ahead and save it so we have a menu

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.270 
go ahead and save it so we have a menu
system<00:06:14.910> it<00:06:15.240> is<00:06:15.390> not<00:06:15.420> part<00:06:16.020> of<00:06:16.200> a<00:06:16.260> library<00:06:16.620> item

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
system it is not part of a library item

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.220 
system it is not part of a library item
but<00:06:18.030> we<00:06:18.180> need<00:06:18.390> to<00:06:18.480> bring<00:06:18.690> it<00:06:18.810> into<00:06:18.990> our

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
but we need to bring it into our

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.320 
but we need to bring it into our
templates<00:06:19.800> so<00:06:20.340> everything<00:06:20.700> will<00:06:20.850> work<00:06:20.880> that

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
templates so everything will work that

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.910 
templates so everything will work that
way<00:06:21.540> and<00:06:21.810> that's<00:06:22.140> what<00:06:22.290> we're<00:06:22.410> going<00:06:22.530> to<00:06:22.650> do<00:06:22.800> in

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
way and that's what we're going to do in

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.540 
way and that's what we're going to do in
the<00:06:22.980> next<00:06:23.190> lesson

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550
