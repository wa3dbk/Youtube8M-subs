00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
actually got sort of sections to it so

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.080 
actually got sort of sections to it so
there's<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.080> rhythm<00:01:10.080> dance<00:01:11.090> style

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090

game<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.570> its<00:01:12.689> got<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> detective<00:01:13.320> game<00:01:13.979> in

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
game in its got like a detective game in

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.179 
game in its got like a detective game in
it<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:15.180> has<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> visual<00:01:15.810> novel<00:01:16.500> element<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it as well but it isn't all about that

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.070 
it as well but it isn't all about that
so<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.280> actually<00:01:20.400> looking<00:01:20.880> pretty

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
so it's actually looking pretty

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.270 
so it's actually looking pretty
interesting<00:01:22.080> seen<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> couple<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.979> videos<00:01:23.250> on

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.090 
YouTube as well so i may get it but i'm
not<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> hundred<00:01:27.689> percent<00:01:27.869> sure<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.350> now

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
not a hundred percent sure on that now

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.310 
not a hundred percent sure on that now
the<00:01:29.189> next<00:01:29.369> game<00:01:29.670> i'm<00:01:29.909> almost<00:01:30.299> certainly<00:01:31.110> going

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the next game i'm almost certainly going

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.880 
the next game i'm almost certainly going
again<00:01:31.680> which<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.009> called<00:01:32.460> ho<00:01:33.119> tero<00:01:33.630> no<00:01:34.530> Nikki

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
again which is called ho tero no Nikki

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.289 
again which is called ho tero no Nikki
and<00:01:35.420> it's<00:01:36.420> looking<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.740> good

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
and it's looking really really good

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.990 
and it's looking really really good
really<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.750> visual<00:01:40.079> art<00:01:40.380> style<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.000> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
really like the visual art style and the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.399 
really like the visual art style and the
game<00:01:42.600> trailers<00:01:43.020> look<00:01:43.259> really<00:01:43.950> great<00:01:44.159> on

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
game trailers look really great on

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
game trailers look really great on
YouTube<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:47.070> may<00:01:47.490> actually<00:01:47.670> make<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
YouTube it may actually make it to the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.170 
YouTube it may actually make it to the
West<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.170> well<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:50.040> some<00:01:50.430> point<00:01:50.850> but

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
West this one as well at some point but

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.200 
West this one as well at some point but
no<00:01:51.659> guarantees<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.979> probably<00:01:53.729> will

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
no guarantees of that so I probably will

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.020 
no guarantees of that so I probably will
pick<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:54.990> up<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.860> apparently<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.790> may

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
pick this one up and apparently it may

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.380 
pick this one up and apparently it may
only<00:01:57.390> come<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.049> digital<00:01:58.619> download<00:01:59.189> but<00:02:00.119> I've

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
only come with digital download but I've

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149 
only come with digital download but I've
kind<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.869> looked<00:02:01.079> into<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.560> I'm<00:02:01.649> pretty

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
kind of looked into it and I'm pretty

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.109 
kind of looked into it and I'm pretty
certain<00:02:02.549> that<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:04.320> special<00:02:05.009> edition<00:02:05.119> version

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
certain that the special edition version

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.039 
certain that the special edition version
which<00:02:06.240> you're<00:02:06.390> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.600> pretty<00:02:06.719> well<00:02:06.869> have

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
which you're going to pretty well have

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.089 
which you're going to pretty well have
