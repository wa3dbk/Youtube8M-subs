00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.269
 this opel cycle and in a blame eyes of 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.639
 the city of saint denis there he must be 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.860
 one o'clock in the morning we do not see 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.279
 a lot moreover is to arrange that 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.449

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.430

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.840
 to rap a crazy thing 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.070

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.239

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.010

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.539
 a great night I believe on movies 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.379
 it shows a lot of rap because 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.379

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:03.480
