00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.529
 we have everything here is a little real that today I'm going to make you a little 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.179
 unpacking but the bottom of his thought 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.599
 in July already unpacked so you can configure it as for 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.709
 show an interface 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.460
 so any place to sÃ¨te the case of the boss succeed a net blow I could not 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.859
 take the lead 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.560
 so who can 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.660
 I start unpacking you have a little tab here for 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.689
 can ski ana 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.999
 no no if you have a little movie 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.440
 that you have to remove you can remove in addition to English 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.090
 to rush into the box 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.560
 so then we come across a plastic bag so for me I advise to 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.880
 leverage 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.520
 does it bind you in any other way to this? 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.910
 not feeling good 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.430
 his help 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.430
 then you remove the little 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.360
 the little tongue of the film 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.010
 julien sir of submissive movies 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.010
 so it's a trick 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
 so that makes me bubble motivated 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.140
 here 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.060
 who else here is a fan so I configured as I told you from 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.680
 way no 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.110
 a power 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.110
 you show 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.870
 so in the box you pulled the action of the to continue the 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.020
 help 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.020
 so you have everything that is stickers etc 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.770
 the configuration utility 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.680
 you have airpost headphones 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.890
 but as in the iphone 5 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.480
 nor even earphones 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.060
 ap you have the charger so I did not buy in France my i-phone from 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.650
 hit at paul beauchamp jr a champion of france it's not french 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.200
 for the economic crisis the twilight cable 2 foot the same as the iphone 5 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.910
 So here I come back soon to test the iphone 5 is put 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.890
 pressure 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.710
 so I think I'll put the video online in a week 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.549
 good day
