00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
now unfortunately not just yes but isn't

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.610 
now unfortunately not just yes but isn't
what<00:00:42.239> happens<00:00:42.539> with<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> player<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.499> it's

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
what happens with the player but it's

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.930 
what happens with the player but it's
actually<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.010> happens<00:00:44.249> with<00:00:44.370> two<00:00:44.550> mobs<00:00:44.789> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
actually what happens with two mobs and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.389 
actually what happens with two mobs and
that<00:00:45.179> is<00:00:45.269> the<00:00:45.420> pig<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.929> the<00:00:46.559> zombie<00:00:47.010> animal

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
career plans for this to happen to you

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.899 
career plans for this to happen to you
know<00:00:49.379> every<00:00:49.679> mob<00:00:49.859> and<00:00:50.100> maybe<00:00:50.309> even<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.670> player

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
know every mob and maybe even the player

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.069 
know every mob and maybe even the player
one<00:00:51.149> day<00:00:51.179> it<00:00:51.600> was<00:00:51.690> apparently<00:00:52.019> really

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
one day it was apparently really

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.389 
one day it was apparently really
difficult<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> chord<00:00:52.859> I<00:00:53.010> know<00:00:53.069> nothing<00:00:53.370> about

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
difficult to chord I know nothing about

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.869 
difficult to chord I know nothing about
that

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
that

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.729 
that
so<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:54.659> it<00:00:54.899> only<00:00:55.079> works<00:00:55.289> at<00:00:55.440> these<00:00:55.530> two

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
so right now it only works at these two

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.989 
so right now it only works at these two
months<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.219> without<00:00:56.489> further<00:00:56.699> ado<00:00:56.969> I

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
months so I think without further ado I

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.160 
months so I think without further ado I
should<00:00:57.239> probably<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.539> show<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.139> I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
should probably just show you what I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.840 
should probably just show you what I
mean<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.620> if<00:00:58.679> we<00:00:58.800> take<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.129> burning<00:00:59.370> zombie

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
mean so if we take this burning zombie

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.360 
mean so if we take this burning zombie
and<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.839> punch<00:01:01.109> him<00:01:01.350> oh<00:01:01.409> it<00:01:01.589> set<00:01:01.769> us<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:01.920> fire<00:01:01.979> we

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
and we punch him oh it set us on fire we

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.739 
and we punch him oh it set us on fire we
punch<00:01:02.670> him<00:01:02.819> off<00:01:02.909> this<00:01:03.030> cliff<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.539> off<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
punch him off this cliff get off the

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:10.370 
punch him off this cliff get off the
cliff<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.739> down<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:08.510> look<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.750> ages

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
cliff get down and look at that ages

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.650 
cliff get down and look at that ages
died<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.340> he's<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.670> flopped<00:01:12.270> all<00:01:12.450> over

zombies which i think is kind of cool
and<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:09.060> means<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.480> could<00:03:09.600> spawn<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.140> a

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
and it means that you could spawn like a

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.100 
and it means that you could spawn like a
whole<00:03:10.410> bunch<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.800> them<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:10.950> look<00:03:11.190> at<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:12.110> and

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
whole bunch of them so look at this and

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.720 
whole bunch of them so look at this and
then<00:03:13.290> if<00:03:13.440> you've<00:03:13.560> got<00:03:13.740> a<00:03:14.100> diamond<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.610> you're

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
then if you've got a diamond and you're

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.250 
then if you've got a diamond and you're
right<00:03:14.820> click<00:03:15.000> on<00:03:15.120> that<00:03:15.240> it<00:03:15.690> actually<00:03:15.840> gets<00:03:16.140> rid

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
right click on that it actually gets rid

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.630 
right click on that it actually gets rid
of<00:03:16.350> all<00:03:16.470> courses<00:03:16.920> in<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.070> world<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.460> think

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
of all courses in the world so I think

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.130 
of all courses in the world so I think
that's<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.940> really<00:03:18.150> handy<00:03:18.390> little<00:03:18.570> shortcut

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
that's a really handy little shortcut

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.510 
that's a really handy little shortcut
and<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.440> think<00:03:19.620> what<00:03:19.710> I<00:03:19.740> want<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:19.950> do<00:03:20.040> now<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.250> I

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
and I think what I want to do now is I

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.040 
and I think what I want to do now is I
just<00:03:20.940> want<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.120> push<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.300> bunch<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.660> zombies<00:03:21.930> off

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
just want to push a bunch of zombies off

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.570 
just want to push a bunch of zombies off
a<00:03:22.110> cliff<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.590> hopefully<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.010> guys<00:03:23.130> don't<00:03:23.430> mind

with<00:04:16.920> scales<00:04:17.190> as<00:04:17.400> well<00:04:17.549> even<00:04:17.850> though<00:04:17.940> it

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
with scales as well even though it
