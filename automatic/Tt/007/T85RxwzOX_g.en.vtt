00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.890 
colors you have in the matte palette and
the<00:02:16.900> shimmer<00:02:17.170> palette<00:02:17.380> they're<00:02:18.070> more<00:02:18.280> like

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
the shimmer palette they're more like

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.380 
the shimmer palette they're more like
winter<00:02:19.900> colors<00:02:20.380> i'd<00:02:20.530> say<00:02:20.800> like<00:02:21.700> rust<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
winter colors i'd say like rust the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.350 
winter colors i'd say like rust the
rustic<00:02:22.930> colors<00:02:23.320> I'm<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.710> bit<00:02:24.580> cleaner<00:02:24.850> probably

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
rustic colors I'm a bit cleaner probably

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.150 
rustic colors I'm a bit cleaner probably
plenty<00:02:25.920> but<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.790> me<00:02:28.030> they<00:02:28.450> look<00:02:28.650> shimmery<00:02:29.650> just

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
plenty but to me they look shimmery just

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.700 
plenty but to me they look shimmery just
like<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.490> shimmer<00:02:30.760> palette<00:02:31.170> um<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.680> only

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
like the shimmer palette um the only

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.950 
like the shimmer palette um the only
difference<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.490> i<00:02:33.640> can<00:02:34.000> tell<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.330> i<00:02:34.720> like

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
difference that i can tell that i like

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.570 
difference that i can tell that i like
is<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:36.160> seems<00:02:36.910> more<00:02:37.750> fine<00:02:38.200> than<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:39.250> shimmer

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
is it seems more fine than the shimmer

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.710 
is it seems more fine than the shimmer
palette<00:02:39.820> because<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.330> shimmer<00:02:40.540> palette

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
palette because the shimmer palette

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.020 
palette because the shimmer palette
could<00:02:40.990> be<00:02:41.110> like<00:02:41.350> honey<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.850> get<00:02:43.000> like

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
could be like honey and you get like

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.470 
could be like honey and you get like
lots<00:02:43.540> of<00:02:43.750> fallout<00:02:44.200> with<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.670> um<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:46.180> mean<00:02:46.360> you

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
lots of fallout with it um I mean you

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.810 
lots of fallout with it um I mean you
can<00:02:46.630> get<00:02:46.750> fallout<00:02:47.110> with<00:02:47.230> any<00:02:47.410> eyeshadow<00:02:47.740> but<00:02:48.550> I

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
can get fallout with any eyeshadow but I

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.240 
can get fallout with any eyeshadow but I
just<00:02:49.090> put<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.050> shimmer<00:02:50.290> powder<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.800> get<00:02:50.980> more

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
just put the shimmer powder you get more

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.390 
just put the shimmer powder you get more
fallout<00:02:51.840> then<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:53.080> one<00:02:53.290> because<00:02:53.440> it's<00:02:53.890> more

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
fallout then this one because it's more

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.090 
fallout then this one because it's more
finely<00:02:55.180> grated<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.990> it's<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.320> little<00:02:56.560> smoother

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
finely grated and it's a little smoother

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.180 
finely grated and it's a little smoother
which<00:02:57.460> is<00:02:57.640> good<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.210> I<00:02:59.080> guess<00:02:59.860> what<00:03:00.070> I<00:03:00.100> would

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
which is good and I guess what I would

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.960 
which is good and I guess what I would
say<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.710> a<00:03:02.740> shimmer<00:03:03.160> palette<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.760> my

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
say is this is a shimmer palette in my

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.300 
say is this is a shimmer palette in my
opinion<00:03:04.770> not<00:03:05.770> really<00:03:06.130> metallic<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:08.620> shimmer

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
opinion not really metallic it's shimmer

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.070 
opinion not really metallic it's shimmer
I<00:03:09.550> like<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.060> palette<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.510> love<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.930> though

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
I like the palette I love it though

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.170 
I like the palette I love it though
because<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.830> love<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.220> color<00:03:12.459> thing<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.120> i

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
because I love the color thing and i

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.850 
because I love the color thing and i
love<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.690> smoother<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.560> goes<00:03:14.680> on

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
love that is smoother and it goes on

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.920 
love that is smoother and it goes on
smoother<00:03:15.400> but<00:03:15.520> it's<00:03:15.700> still<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.209> my<00:03:16.360> opinion<00:03:16.720> is

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
smoother but it's still in my opinion is

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.570 
smoother but it's still in my opinion is
still<00:03:17.170> shimmery<00:03:17.680> like<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.100> shimmer<00:03:18.340> palette

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
still shimmery like the shimmer palette

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.180 
still shimmery like the shimmer palette
to<00:03:19.180> me<00:03:19.360> i<00:03:19.390> would<00:03:19.660> say<00:03:19.840> it's<00:03:20.200> an<00:03:20.500> upgraded

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
to me i would say it's an upgraded

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.250 
to me i would say it's an upgraded
version<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.850> shimmer<00:03:22.090> palette<00:03:22.330> so<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.110> is

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.020 
wait to use it but it's an upgraded
version<00:07:24.790> and<00:07:25.660> I<00:07:25.780> keep<00:07:26.020> saying<00:07:26.260> it

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.030 
version and I keep saying it

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.450 
version and I keep saying it
yeah<00:07:27.330> I<00:07:27.770> really<00:07:28.770> thought<00:07:29.010> it's<00:07:29.190> going<00:07:29.340> to<00:07:29.400> be

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 
yeah I really thought it's going to be

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.310 
yeah I really thought it's going to be
something<00:07:29.700> different<00:07:29.880> than<00:07:30.480> what<00:07:30.510> it<00:07:30.750> was<00:07:30.780> but

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:31.320 
something different than what it was but

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.960 
something different than what it was but
he<00:07:31.470> was<00:07:31.500> exactly<00:07:32.070> what<00:07:32.280> I<00:07:32.310> thought<00:07:32.550> and<00:07:32.880> I

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:32.970 
he was exactly what I thought and I

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.220 
he was exactly what I thought and I
thought<00:07:33.000> it<00:07:33.360> was<00:07:33.480> just<00:07:33.630> another<00:07:33.780> shimmer

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.230 
thought it was just another shimmer

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.040 
thought it was just another shimmer
palette<00:07:34.580> which<00:07:35.580> in<00:07:35.760> my<00:07:35.910> opinion<00:07:36.060> it<00:07:36.510> is<00:07:36.630> it's

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050 
palette which in my opinion it is it's

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.320 
palette which in my opinion it is it's
just<00:07:37.140> a<00:07:37.590> little<00:07:38.040> smoother<00:07:38.520> and<00:07:38.700> not<00:07:38.850> as<00:07:39.030> crummy

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 
just a little smoother and not as crummy

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.010 
just a little smoother and not as crummy
ER<00:07:39.540> as<00:07:39.750> the<00:07:40.080> regular<00:07:40.470> shipment<00:07:40.830> had<00:07:40.950> it<00:07:41.100> so<00:07:42.020> I
