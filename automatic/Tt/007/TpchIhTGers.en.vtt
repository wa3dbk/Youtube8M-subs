00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.780
 so this is another version of how i 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:13.920
 I make handles grooves in the side walls of cu 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.710
 here are the grooves of the radio on the drill 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
 There was no machine tooling , but here 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.170
 it made it happen much 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.220
 more productive 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.369
 this is my milling table again 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.490
 frezer Smolensk restrictive 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:34.460
 ruler end mill on 19 diameter 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.370
 set to a height of 10 millimeters here 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.319
 the bounding line is worth by which 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.239
 the workpiece will then move and here 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:49.559
 such two screws on the edges which 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.479
 determine the length of this handle who 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.549
 produces just over here 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:59.489
 I stack for ready ready with one edge 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:02.609
 I put in an emphasis and then gradually lowering 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.540
 I move there in a few movements 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.860
 it turns out even clean steam 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:16.200
 rests and here rests turns 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.470
 certain long pasture pig it 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.870
 already known by the diameter of the cutter 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:27.380
 the depth is set all much easier and 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.380
 faster it turns out 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:04.240
 that's when this groove turned out 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.240
 get the name sleep for seconds literally 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:15.410
 Well, it showed a defective 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:18.580
 billet he so here is easier does not happen 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.580
 faster probably too
