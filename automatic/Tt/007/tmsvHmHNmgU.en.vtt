00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.200
 greeting to friends from 32 point it 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.870
 we are here at the unique stand 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.420
 we are together with the family's star war 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.340
 it's velo pronunciations they don't have a little media 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.230
 the first exit is not called the stairway 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.510
 my exit is a very good smartphone 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.099
 which is actually already available 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.630
 available in various colors a little bit 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.359
 more sober than those of the 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.449
 family el this is the very idea 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:31.130
 of the smartphone is a smartphone that 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.260
 metallic like almost every week of 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.960
 medium and medium high in this case 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.350
 of metal there is the contour and there 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.210
 I show this is the smartphone 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.100
 see the metal profile 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.680
 the screen is glossy and slightly 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.760
 rounded by a beautiful effect 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.199
 so it reflects so much light here 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.730
 at the fair 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.699
 the effect is what the back is in 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.769
 plastic, however, with this satin effect 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.480
 very nice 13 megapixel camera 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:02.629
 with led flash screen 5 inch ips 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.269
 hd resolution therefore 1200 80 x 720 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.670
 pixel protected by gorilla corning glass 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.159
 glass two quad core processors medium 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.689
 tech 1.2 gigahertz 13 megapixel la 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.130
 you saw the camera 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.740
 5 megapixels and even to the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.430
 front camera 16 gigabytes of 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.530
 internal memory one gigabyte of ram slots 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.610
 for double sim and slots for 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.960
 memory expansion 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.000
 but let's move from stau and the other way 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.979
 this is the new model that we say 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.939
 the evolution of the previous one also here 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.040
 the aluminum outline is maintained 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.110
 and the back obviously in plastic 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.640
 always 13 megapixel camera 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.170
 what changes compared to the model 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.570
 previous good fundamentally is one 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.110
 then the designer is slightly evolving 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.000
 renewed 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.090
 we have android version this time 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.160
 4 2 2 instead 4 2 1 obviously little 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.930
 difference 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.690
 one of the most interesting things is the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.480
 fact that if I can open it without doing 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.480
 set off the alarm from the wico stand 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.179
 I know if something that is feasible for me in ninth 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.140
 kay does not open work for itself not 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.420
 removable 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.060
 correct me we have a slot here and one 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.760
 slots here are slightly different for a 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.850
 reason both slots for the sim but one 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.860
 of the two can also be used for 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.390
 answer the memory of your choice 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.850
 obviously the fact remains that it is 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.650
 we use 25 the second slot can not 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.590
 be used to expand the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.300
 memory for this quick preview of the 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.360
 new two products from the haven family 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.360
 it's all a greeting must come for 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.360
