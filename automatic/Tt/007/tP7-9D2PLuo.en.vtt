00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
are really high because of that we

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.779 
are really high because of that we
started<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.739> four<00:00:52.949> years<00:00:53.160> ago<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.550> wanted<00:00:53.760> to

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
started as four years ago we wanted to

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.700 
started as four years ago we wanted to
do<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> next-gen<00:00:54.360> combat<00:00:54.750> system<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.440> wanted<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
do a next-gen combat system we wanted a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
combat system that was easy to pick up

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.090 
combat system that was easy to pick up
but<00:00:57.750> had<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> lot<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> depth<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> one-on-one

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
but had a lot of depth like a one-on-one

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
but had a lot of depth like a one-on-one
fight<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.760> we<00:01:00.480> wanted<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.960> able<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
fight one on one with enemies but that's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.340 
fight one on one with enemies but that's
not<00:01:03.329> enough<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.809> wanted<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.049> integrate

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
not enough we wanted to integrate

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.490 
not enough we wanted to integrate
physics<00:01:04.979> into<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.930> integrate<00:01:06.930> cinematic

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
physics into it integrate cinematic

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950 
physics into it integrate cinematic
camera<00:01:07.680> angles<00:01:08.189> into<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.060> then<00:01:09.479> take<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
camera angles into it and then take it a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.050 
camera angles into it and then take it a
step<00:01:09.990> further<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> Jackie<00:01:11.520> Chan<00:01:11.610> movie

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
step further like a Jackie Chan movie

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
step further like a Jackie Chan movie
have<00:01:12.240> lots<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.570> enemies<00:01:12.689> around<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.860> have

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
have lots of enemies around you and have

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.859 
have lots of enemies around you and have
them<00:01:14.250> coordinate<00:01:14.820> their<00:01:15.030> attacks<00:01:15.119> against

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
them coordinate their attacks against

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.690 
them coordinate their attacks against
you<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.470> wanted<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> go<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.369> further

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you and then we wanted to go up further

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.870 
you and then we wanted to go up further
and<00:01:17.909> how<00:01:18.210> entire<00:01:18.990> army<00:01:19.439> section<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.850> are

and how entire army section so there are
sections<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.509> game<00:01:21.720> where<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.110> fight

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
sections in the game where you can fight

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
game when it releases you know I really

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.220 
game when it releases you know I really
don't<00:02:34.519> know<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.480> don't<00:02:35.510> think<00:02:35.900> about<00:02:36.079> it

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
don't know and I don't think about it

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.379 
don't know and I don't think about it
because<00:02:36.709> if<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.430> think<00:02:37.459> about<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:38.060> kind<00:02:38.329> of

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
because if you think about that kind of

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.420 
because if you think about that kind of
thing<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.630> don't<00:02:38.870> sleep<00:02:39.440> at<00:02:39.680> night<00:02:39.889> so<00:02:40.160> it's

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
thing you don't sleep at night so it's

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.220 
thing you don't sleep at night so it's
better<00:02:40.609> to<00:02:40.819> just<00:02:41.000> wrap<00:02:41.299> this<00:02:41.450> up<00:02:41.660> think<00:02:42.079> about

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
better to just wrap this up think about

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.750 
better to just wrap this up think about
the<00:02:42.380> next<00:02:42.500> thing<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:42.950> then<00:02:43.040> hope<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.609> it's

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
the next thing and then hope that it's

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.879 
the next thing and then hope that it's
well<00:02:44.180> received<00:02:44.690> with<00:02:44.959> your<00:02:45.350> comfort<00:02:45.769> then

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
well received with your comfort then

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.379 
well received with your comfort then
that<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.430> it's<00:02:46.760> going<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.030> be<00:02:47.120> all<00:02:47.239> you

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
that is so it's going to be all you

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.120 
that is so it's going to be all you
wanted<00:02:47.630> it's<00:02:47.870> never<00:02:48.109> all<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.650> honor<00:02:48.859> they

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
wanted it's never all you honor they

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.979 
wanted it's never all you honor they
can't<00:02:49.400> be<00:02:49.519> but<00:02:49.670> it's<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:50.150> think<00:02:50.420> it's<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.810> pretty

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
can't be but it's I think it's a pretty

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.319 
can't be but it's I think it's a pretty
amazing<00:02:51.280> achievement<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.519> you<00:02:52.880> know<00:02:53.000> for
