00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.539 

11:9<00:02:20.930> time<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.530> no<00:02:21.590> one<00:02:21.769> really<00:02:21.980> cares<00:02:22.189> okay

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
11:9 time I no one really cares okay

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.360 
11:9 time I no one really cares okay
well<00:02:23.269> it<00:02:23.420> says<00:02:23.599> Sally<00:02:23.900> maybe<00:02:24.829> that's<00:02:25.069> what<00:02:25.310> he

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
well it says Sally maybe that's what he

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.059 
well it says Sally maybe that's what he
calls<00:02:25.609> the<00:02:25.790> gun<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:27.049> maybe<00:02:27.349> that<00:02:27.680> might<00:02:27.859> be

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
calls the gun and maybe that might be

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.160 
calls the gun and maybe that might be
the<00:02:28.340> tally<00:02:28.579> of<00:02:28.790> people<00:02:29.180> he<00:02:29.450> killed<00:02:29.719> with<00:02:29.930> that

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
the tally of people he killed with that

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.679
