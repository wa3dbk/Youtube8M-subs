00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.859
 hello girls we present you an idea 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.500
 really fast it really is 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.769
 bracelets are very fast for summer 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.480
 in short, the weight will be a trait 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.970
 we use more during the summer e 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.850
 just for this bieber chosen line 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.550
 pizzerias the new bases of bracelets in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.949
 crazy brass found inside are 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 some of the latest bracelets that 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.240
 we have inserted all of them 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.600
 within the category bracelets in 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.260
 raw brass and are already bracelets 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.469
 closed and I want to give you a simple one 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.219
 idea for decorating a simple unit 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:49.800
 fast but very tasty, here they are like 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:55.250
 Here I used the soft tones of 4 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.289
 mm and the metal wire was Dallari 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.510
 so it does not remain you see here I have 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.260
 realized the kid to fix the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.040
 thread and then wrap all the pylons 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.700
 around the bracelet inserts the decoration 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.330
 and turns and so until the end then yes 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.560
 always stops at this point, stopping 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.520
 the wire with net parking for this 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.880
 to achieve this we used 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.799
 this base 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.320
 this death itself and then see to me 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.300
 loved this job because 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.280
 the bikini are positioned a little 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.210
 laterally so no manages to 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.800
 accentuate in my opinion the effect and of the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.010
 in short, their facets 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.320
 positioning itself in an oblique manner the 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:53.320
 I have dealt with the same work with i 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.320
 small by 3 mm this the zir with 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.549
 however with a pizzino thread from scratch 20 per 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:05.939
 go faster to fish even more 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.580
 comfortable here the usual climb for otranto 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.599
 of the wire and going to work 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.640
 with the 3 mm small ones used this phase 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.640
 that thinner leader 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.790
 and then always with the most basic one 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.690
 same I made birds instead 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.269
 with these Chinese crystal rods e 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.239
 then used the thread to recall the 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.640
 color of collusion with these 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.599
 have is the finish of the bosses and then a 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.730
 all these particular aspects 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.459
 here has created the very center with 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.640
 the wire so i worked with all e 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.769
 two ends of the wires and if to do 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.280
 so that the bead did not remain its own 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.620
 straight on on the basis for this if 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.239
 you don't know how to make it there is a video 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.480
 inside our youtube channel 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.329
 a tutorial made that is called 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.209
 turn on a cosmetic troubles in short 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.130
 an idea of the fanciful summer itself 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.910
 why 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.310
 you can realize how many how many 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.550
 you want you can choose naturally 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.830
 used individually or to combine them 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.830
 all together as in this case
