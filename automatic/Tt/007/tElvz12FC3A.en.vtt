00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
for digestion so add that in there we're

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.420 
for digestion so add that in there we're
going<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.520> close<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.940> up<00:02:35.709> give<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.860> good<00:02:37.100> mix

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
going to close it up give it a good mix

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.400 
going to close it up give it a good mix
and<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.600> going<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.840> make<00:02:39.020> some<00:02:39.260> noise

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
and this is going to make some noise

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:55.010 
and this is going to make some noise
here<00:02:39.830> so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.360 

at<00:02:56.020> this<00:02:56.260> point<00:02:56.590> we're<00:02:56.830> going<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.010> take<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.310> out

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
shake it up a bit more now this would be

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.520 
shake it up a bit more now this would be
a<00:03:06.819> good<00:03:07.150> time<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.569> do<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.720> taste<00:03:08.080> test<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:11.319> we
