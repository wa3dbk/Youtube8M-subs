00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.809
 the staff also with you the young 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.460
 leave a tip for you guys or even talk about 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.380
 a little something I'm using my 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.960
 hair and I'm realizing that it has 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.890
 helped in his development. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.840
 What's the cinnamon on the run? I do not know if you 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.760
 already know this tip if you already 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.670
 have experienced then if you will 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.529
 to confer only to continue existing it is the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.750
 What do I do with this cinnamon powder? 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.759
 I do a hair exfoliation on the leather 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.870
 hairy and that ends up leaving leather 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.739
 hairy ends up helping in the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.530
 hair growth only the leaves are 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.930
 itself helps if it is done in a way that 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.690
 correct if you do not overdo it because 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.230
 you start rubbing your leather 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.809
 hairy is dangerous injury leather 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.180
 and will help in the growth will 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.010
 end up doing with your hair have 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.350
 fall because the scalp will be 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.390
 finally bruised the cinnamon is a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.700
 ingredient that helps a lot to strengthen 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.220
 your hair helps to stimulate the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.799
 growth then this way that I am 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.250
 using it is not the only way to 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.040
 if used but is the way I found it 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.680
 that could help more than I do a 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.320
 Once in a week, you can not do more than 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 same week because I think it 's a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.150
 exaggeration is a bit dangerous to get exfoliated 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.619
 when the right hair like I do 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.990
 the use of the product 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.479
 I'll get some of the powder myself. 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.509
 first picks the poplar do not play here 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.369
 Right there in the shampoo video, is not it? 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.259
 I get the amount of shampoo I go 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.610
 to use in the palm of my hand 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.290
 then here is the one here. 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.899
 some little holes here 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.549
 and I play on my shampoo I go to 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.540
 put a little of what you see 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.229
 amount 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:59.440
 I play that amount over here. 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.170
 My show mixes well to be okay. 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.300
 mixed homogeneously well then people 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.060
 I do I apply on the scalp 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.400
 and leaves the cocaine in the first hair 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.200
 looks good hair and has been applying on 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.690
 scalp is not cool you stay 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.360
 rubbing the wire, it's all just leather 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.000
 and it is not rubbing you too 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.550
 put your hand so your fingers on the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.530
 scalp and will make movements 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.510
 Circulars, you do it more or less. 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.660
 five minutes the fact that you were 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.720
 will activate the circulation more 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.470
 the properties of cinnamon are already 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.930
 cause I had it but it's still 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.910
 active circulation 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.280
 will help in the growth of the way goes 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.910
 make it grow stronger 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.890
 also 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.570
 soon I'll meet all the people 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.310
 things I've done my hair 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.110
 to help you grow. 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.430
 Know that I'm in search of the hair 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.200
 I love the rapunzel project and I'm very 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.060
 well put with that you know what you want 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.160
 Grow up but I know it's growing. 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.590
 His time, I only do things to 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.260
 help it develop so well 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.510
 soon he makes a video together all 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.180
 these things that I have done every 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.640
 every day I do something little every day 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.739
 every day and not because it's not every day I 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.459
 I think about three times a week 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.709
 I usually put on a tonic sometimes I 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.100
 I went there when it 's on the day it 's once 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.750
 week the serve as shampoo, this is not it here 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.390
 with shampoo agent one thing very 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.910
 important that I can not stop talking 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.980
 whenever you use cinnamon once 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.269
 loose in the week we do not use more than 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.430
 this is not going to be very good for the 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.709
 hair and scalp or pro only 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.830
 After you do this, use a 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.709
 black mask or hair nutrition because 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.230
 It's usually to let the hair a little bit 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.230
 Dry know yourself and it looks like leaves 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.780
 end a little so a little dry 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.000
 not that they are 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.700
 It's a strange touch, so it's 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.610
 It's cool that you use a mask 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.220
 moisturizer then a mask on the 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.020
 nourishing mask to develop 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.540
 suppleness to the hair not to 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.970
 get that roughest touch that 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.420
 cinnamon since then it is not 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.819
 very nice to be using more than 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.680
 once a week and it's not very cool 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.930
 also because the scalp may 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.730
 suffer because of this 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.100
 Remembering can end up hurting 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.290
 Good people, this is it. I very much hope that 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.140
 the tip is useful to you, that's okay 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.200
 I'm really enjoying myself, I'm a fan of 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.900
 exfoliation capillary I find her very 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.480
 useful regardless of what product you 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.030
 I 'm using it but I 'm a fan of 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.340
 cinnamon because it really is very good 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.979
 It's even super affordable and you know 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.990
 that I'm a super product fan 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.910
 accessible then I very much hope that 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.650
