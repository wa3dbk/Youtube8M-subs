have a look at this printed image that I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.010 
have a look at this printed image that I
put<00:01:34.460> up<00:01:34.610> on<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.880> blog<00:01:35.120> here<00:01:35.390> so<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.750> we<00:01:35.870> could

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
put up on the blog here so that we could

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.280 
put up on the blog here so that we could
actually<00:01:36.290> get<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.920> live<00:01:37.580> eyes<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:38.210> live<00:01:38.690> eye<00:01:38.900> view

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
actually get a live eyes a live eye view

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
of what CMYK does and how it works so

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.360 
of what CMYK does and how it works so
this<00:01:43.700> is<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.880> 100%<00:01:44.659> view<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:46.100> business

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.280 
card and here we blow this up to 200%
I'm<00:01:50.840> gonna<00:01:51.320> magnify<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.100> again<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:53.060> 400%<00:01:53.990> at

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
I'm gonna magnify it again to 400% at

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.680 
I'm gonna magnify it again to 400% at
this<00:01:54.890> point<00:01:55.220> we<00:01:55.370> begin<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:56.000> see<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.270> dot

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
this point we begin to see the dot

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.310 
this point we begin to see the dot
structure<00:01:57.140> this<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.190> often<00:01:58.580> in<00:01:59.510> form<00:02:00.080> of<00:02:00.200> a

structure this is often in form of a

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.100 
structure this is often in form of a
honeycomb<00:02:00.890> structure<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:02.659> as<00:02:02.750> we<00:02:02.930> get<00:02:03.049> even

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
honeycomb structure and as we get even

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.110 
honeycomb structure and as we get even
closer<00:02:03.590> we<00:02:03.890> can<00:02:04.070> really<00:02:04.370> start<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.880> see<00:02:05.090> the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
closer we can really start to see the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.529 
closer we can really start to see the
dots<00:02:05.979> this<00:02:06.979> again<00:02:07.520> was<00:02:07.729> scanned<00:02:08.149> from<00:02:08.330> a

printed printed piece so it had gone

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.840 
printed printed piece so it had gone

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
if we really got close this is what we

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.550 
if we really got close this is what we
would<00:02:18.430> end<00:02:18.489> up<00:02:18.849> seeing<00:02:19.239> you<00:02:19.840> notice<00:02:20.200> how<00:02:20.349> these

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
would end up seeing you notice how these

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.990 
would end up seeing you notice how these
inks<00:02:21.400> these<00:02:21.640> four<00:02:22.030> CMYK<00:02:22.920> inks<00:02:23.920> overlay<00:02:24.730> each

inks these four CMYK inks overlay each
other<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.480> they<00:02:25.959> in<00:02:26.590> different<00:02:27.069> values<00:02:27.489> and

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
other and they in different values and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.580 
other and they in different values and
they<00:02:27.760> create<00:02:28.209> different<00:02:28.840> colors<00:02:29.170> just<00:02:29.200> by

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
they create different colors just by

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.699 
they create different colors just by
simple<00:02:30.040> dot<00:02:30.280> overlay<00:02:31.110> I'll<00:02:32.110> scroll<00:02:32.470> down<00:02:32.530> a

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
simple dot overlay I'll scroll down a

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.720 
simple dot overlay I'll scroll down a
little<00:02:32.830> further<00:02:33.069> here<00:02:33.640> now<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:36.250> what<00:02:36.400> we<00:02:36.519> just

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
little further here now so what we just

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.000 
little further here now so what we just
talked<00:02:37.120> about<00:02:37.300> now<00:02:37.630> was<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.989> first<00:02:38.319> basic

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
talked about now was the first basic

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.949 
talked about now was the first basic
option<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:40.090> choose<00:02:40.390> from<00:02:40.690> when

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
option that you can choose from when

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.140 
option that you can choose from when
you're<00:02:41.140> getting<00:02:41.290> your<00:02:41.500> order<00:02:42.040> printed<00:02:42.580> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
you're getting your order printed the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.120 
you're getting your order printed the
second<00:02:43.660> one<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:43.930> spot<00:02:44.260> color<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.830> that's<00:02:44.980> a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
second one is spot color and that's a

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.070 
second one is spot color and that's a
little<00:02:45.280> bit<00:02:45.550> different<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.660> have<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> look

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
little bit different I just have a look

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.170 
little bit different I just have a look
at<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.290> couple<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.709> spot<00:02:48.160> colors<00:02:48.640> again<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
at a couple of spot colors again the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.330 
at a couple of spot colors again the
colors<00:02:49.540> made<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.080> eye<00:02:50.110> appeared<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.069> same

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
colors made to the eye appeared the same

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.759 
colors made to the eye appeared the same
on<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.819> screen<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.900> fact<00:02:53.170> they<00:02:53.380> do<00:02:53.440> on

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
on the screen and in fact they do on

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.470 
on the screen and in fact they do on
screen<00:02:53.980> but<00:02:54.400> when<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:54.640> start<00:02:54.940> printing<00:02:55.360> on

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.990 
screen but when you start printing on
paper<00:02:55.709> here<00:02:56.709> there's<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.980> new<00:02:57.220> technique<00:02:57.700> that

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
paper here there's a new technique that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.390 
paper here there's a new technique that
we're<00:02:58.150> using<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.319> called<00:02:59.590> spot<00:03:00.099> color

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
we're using this is called spot color

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.780 
we're using this is called spot color
I'll<00:03:01.299> give<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:02.019> idea<00:03:02.349> or<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.590> concept

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
I'll give you the idea or the concept

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.030 
I'll give you the idea or the concept
it's<00:03:03.790> very<00:03:04.269> similar<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.530> way<00:03:05.680> an<00:03:05.799> artist

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
it's very similar to the way an artist

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.550 
it's very similar to the way an artist
would<00:03:06.430> mix<00:03:06.730> paint<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.840> can<00:03:08.049> see<00:03:08.319> on<00:03:08.349> this

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
would mix paint is you can see on this

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.309 
would mix paint is you can see on this
artists<00:03:09.040> canvas<00:03:09.610> here<00:03:09.910> there's<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.720> cobalt

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
artists canvas here there's a cobalt

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.570 
artists canvas here there's a cobalt
blue<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:12.250> cobalt<00:03:12.730> sorry<00:03:13.510> cobalt<00:03:14.260> yellow<00:03:14.769> by

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
blue and a cobalt sorry cobalt yellow by

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.670 
blue and a cobalt sorry cobalt yellow by
mixing<00:03:16.060> those<00:03:16.180> two<00:03:16.510> together<00:03:16.660> we<00:03:17.080> get<00:03:17.319> green

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
mixing those two together we get green

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.920 
mixing those two together we get green
and<00:03:18.069> this<00:03:18.459> is<00:03:18.610> how<00:03:18.760> spot<00:03:19.120> colors<00:03:19.540> are<00:03:19.750> made

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
and this is how spot colors are made

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.289

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
Pantone 198 red would be specified and

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.670 
Pantone 198 red would be specified and
if<00:04:14.680> we<00:04:15.010> opened<00:04:15.519> up<00:04:15.670> let's<00:04:16.510> just<00:04:16.600> go<00:04:17.260> back<00:04:17.440> up

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
if we opened up let's just go back up

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.740 
if we opened up let's just go back up
here<00:04:17.889> so<00:04:18.039> now<00:04:18.430> if<00:04:18.489> we<00:04:18.579> open<00:04:19.060> up<00:04:19.209> this<00:04:19.419> book

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
here so now if we open up this book

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.790 
here so now if we open up this book
numerically<00:04:20.560> we<00:04:20.709> could<00:04:20.889> find<00:04:21.930> Pantone<00:04:22.930> 198

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
numerically we could find Pantone 198

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.159 
numerically we could find Pantone 198
and<00:04:23.979> in<00:04:24.520> that<00:04:24.849> panel<00:04:25.300> where<00:04:25.479> we<00:04:25.510> see<00:04:25.870> it<00:04:25.960> it

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
and in that panel where we see it it

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.860 
and in that panel where we see it it
would<00:04:26.560> show<00:04:26.919> this<00:04:27.490> formula<00:04:28.180> of<00:04:28.300> how

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
would show this formula of how

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.660 
would show this formula of how
we<00:04:29.050> would<00:04:29.230> make<00:04:29.440> that<00:04:29.740> actual<00:04:30.220> color<00:04:30.460> and

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
we would make that actual color and

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.580 
we would make that actual color and
that's<00:04:30.820> simply<00:04:31.120> how<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.450> Pantone<00:04:32.020> matching

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
that's simply how the Pantone matching

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.430 
that's simply how the Pantone matching
system<00:04:32.830> works<00:04:33.600> that's<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.750> end<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:35.050> my<00:04:35.200> story

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
system works that's the end of my story

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.110 
system works that's the end of my story
today<00:04:35.680> folks<00:04:36.100> this<00:04:36.250> is<00:04:36.430> Robert<00:04:36.760> Kennedy

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
today folks this is Robert Kennedy

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.860 
today folks this is Robert Kennedy
signing<00:04:37.510> off<00:04:37.690> thanks<00:04:38.320> for<00:04:38.470> watching
