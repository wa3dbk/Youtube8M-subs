00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.969 

yeah<00:00:00.120> I<00:00:00.599> always<00:00:01.020> said<00:00:01.199> it<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.350> little<00:00:01.500> higher<00:00:01.709> um

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
yeah I always said it a little higher um

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.710 
yeah I always said it a little higher um
if<00:00:02.399> you're<00:00:02.520> moving<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:02.970> lot<00:00:03.149> then<00:00:03.360> it's<00:00:03.480> got<00:00:03.629> to

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
if you're moving a lot then it's got to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.360 
if you're moving a lot then it's got to
encode<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.230> lot<00:00:04.470> more<00:00:04.620> frames<00:00:04.920> when<00:00:05.130> it<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.339> a

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
encode a lot more frames when it is a

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.820 
encode a lot more frames when it is a
key<00:00:05.549> frame<00:00:06.230> do<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.290> know<00:00:07.410> what<00:00:07.500> those<00:00:07.589> key

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
key frame do you know what those key

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.310 
key frame do you know what those key
frames<00:00:08.099> are<00:00:08.420> no<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.450> don't<00:00:09.719> know<00:00:09.780> anything<00:00:10.050> on

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
frames are no I don't know anything on

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.530 
frames are no I don't know anything on
there<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.620> when<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.429> um<00:00:11.610> when<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.120> stream<00:00:12.389> it

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
there is when you um when you stream it

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.970 
there is when you um when you stream it
like<00:00:12.809> say<00:00:12.960> you're<00:00:13.110> streaming<00:00:13.380> at<00:00:13.530> ten<00:00:13.710> frames

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
like say you're streaming at ten frames

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.160 
like say you're streaming at ten frames
per<00:00:14.160> second<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.670> what<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> encoder<00:00:15.630> does<00:00:15.929> is

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
per second on what the encoder does is

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.570 
per second on what the encoder does is
it<00:00:16.260> goes<00:00:16.379> through<00:00:16.650> all<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.830> those<00:00:17.039> pixels<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
it goes through all of those pixels and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.250 
it goes through all of those pixels and
it<00:00:17.670> sees<00:00:17.820> what's<00:00:18.060> similar<00:00:18.359> from<00:00:18.690> from<00:00:19.020> frame

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it sees what's similar from from frame

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050 
it sees what's similar from from frame
to<00:00:19.289> frame<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.859> it'll<00:00:20.220> try<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> keep<00:00:20.730> as<00:00:20.939> many

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
to frame and it'll try to keep as many

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.960 
to frame and it'll try to keep as many
similar<00:00:21.570> pics<00:00:21.779> as<00:00:21.930> pixels<00:00:22.439> as<00:00:22.529> possible<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
similar pics as pixels as possible on a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.490 
similar pics as pixels as possible on a
key<00:00:24.269> frame<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> key<00:00:24.990> frame<00:00:25.199> does<00:00:25.350> say

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
key frame with the key frame does say

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.779 
key frame with the key frame does say
you<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.890> key<00:00:26.070> frame<00:00:26.310> every<00:00:26.580> three

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
you have one key frame every three

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.670 
you have one key frame every three
seconds<00:00:27.119> or<00:00:27.210> whatever<00:00:27.330> every<00:00:28.019> three<00:00:28.289> seconds

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
seconds or whatever every three seconds

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
seconds or whatever every three seconds
it<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:28.920> redraw<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.519> entire<00:00:30.060> screen

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
it will redraw the entire screen

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.910 
it will redraw the entire screen
regardless<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.560> what's<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.859> there<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:33.920> yeah

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
regardless of what's on there so on yeah

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
regardless of what's on there so on yeah
that's<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.219> key<00:00:35.370> frame<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.059> were<00:00:36.149> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that's what a key frame is what were you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.780 
that's what a key frame is what were you
asking<00:00:36.360> before<00:00:36.660> wait<00:00:37.260> why<00:00:38.219> are<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.610> trying

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
asking before wait why are we trying

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.630 
asking before wait why are we trying
look<00:00:39.000> here<00:00:39.180> set<00:00:39.420> go<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:40.280> what's<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:41.430> key

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
look here set go what what's your key

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.600 
look here set go what what's your key
frame<00:00:41.879> set<00:00:42.149> soon<00:00:42.390> um<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.800> think<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.430> one

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
frame set soon um I think it's it to one

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.330 
frame set soon um I think it's it to one
every<00:00:44.789> five<00:00:45.030> seconds<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.809> sure<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.340> had

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
every five seconds I'm not sure I had

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.910 
every five seconds I'm not sure I had
some<00:00:47.550> minor<00:00:47.879> set<00:00:48.300> Jim<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.840> remember<00:00:49.590> saying

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
some minor set Jim I remember saying

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.110 
some minor set Jim I remember saying
that<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.550> know<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.969> just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that I was like I don't know and I just

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.020 
that I was like I don't know and I just
left<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.870> beautiful<00:00:52.430> but<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:53.550> happens<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
left it a beautiful but what happens is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.400 
left it a beautiful but what happens is
as<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.270> move<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.600> screen<00:00:54.840> around<00:00:55.050> more<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
as you move the screen around more and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010 
as you move the screen around more and
more<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.280> encoder<00:00:57.120> finds<00:00:57.480> more<00:00:57.600> pixels

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
more the the encoder finds more pixels

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.680 
more the the encoder finds more pixels
that<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.320> has<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.680> re-encode<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.420> as

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
that it has to re-encode so that so as

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.810 
that it has to re-encode so that so as
you<00:01:01.020> move<00:01:01.199> around<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.590> lot<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:01.890> bandwidth<00:01:02.280> for

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you move around a lot your bandwidth for

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820 
you move around a lot your bandwidth for
broadcasting<00:01:03.449> will<00:01:03.629> rise<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.710> as

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
broadcasting will rise you know as

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.780 
broadcasting will rise you know as
opposed<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.280> you're<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.460> sitting<00:01:05.700> or

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
opposed to if you're just sitting or

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.660 
opposed to if you're just sitting or
staring<00:01:06.180> at<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.479> main<00:01:06.810> base<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.229> something

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
staring at your main base or something

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.480 
staring at your main base or something
that's<00:01:08.670> usually<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:13.220> feel<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.310> I'm

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that's usually what I do feel like I'm

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.670 
that's usually what I do feel like I'm
on<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.640> fucking<00:01:14.880> starship<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:16.080> start

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.510 
quantum physics or something just random
fucking<00:01:37.200> there's<00:01:37.590> no<00:01:37.799> way<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> cock<00:01:38.340> could

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
fucking there's no way the cock could

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.920 
fucking there's no way the cock could
only<00:01:38.670> ask<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.119> like<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.299> ask<00:01:39.479> many<00:01:39.750> ways

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
only ask you but I like to ask many ways

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.730 
only ask you but I like to ask many ways
little<00:01:40.229> bugs<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.560> okay<00:01:40.799> all<00:01:41.280> right<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.030> um<00:01:42.740> say

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
little bugs I'm okay all right so um say

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.359 
little bugs I'm okay all right so um say
you<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:45.080> magic<00:01:46.080> physics<00:01:46.470> tick<00:01:46.710> okay<00:01:47.159> um

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you have a magic physics tick okay um

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.430 
you have a magic physics tick okay um
you're<00:01:48.090> aware<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.509> if<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> waive<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> stick

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
you're aware that if you waive the stick

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.990 
you're aware that if you waive the stick
if<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.740> keep<00:01:49.950> your<00:01:50.100> wrist<00:01:50.369> straight<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.940> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
if you keep your wrist straight and you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.940 
if you keep your wrist straight and you
just<00:01:51.149> move<00:01:51.390> your<00:01:51.570> hand<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.710> tip<00:01:52.920> of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
just move your hand that the the tip of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.310 
just move your hand that the the tip of
the<00:01:53.159> skip<00:01:53.399> stick<00:01:53.880> has<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.270> move<00:01:54.509> faster<00:01:55.140> than

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the skip stick has to move faster than

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.169 
the skip stick has to move faster than
the<00:01:55.710> base<00:01:56.039> in<00:01:56.340> order<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.640> keep<00:01:56.789> up<00:01:56.940> with<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
the base in order to keep up with the

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.180 
the base in order to keep up with the
moment<00:01:57.509> right<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:58.080> centripetal<00:01:58.770> movement

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
moment right like centripetal movement

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.880 
moment right like centripetal movement
over<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.429> you<00:01:59.610> understand<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.060> okay<00:02:00.899> let's

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
over you you understand that okay let's

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.749 
over you you understand that okay let's
say<00:02:02.039> you<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> stick<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.179> approaches<00:02:03.710> an

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
say you have a stick that approaches an

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
say you have a stick that approaches an
almost<00:02:05.759> infinite<00:02:05.970> length<00:02:06.420> right<00:02:06.720> faster<00:02:07.560> than

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
almost infinite length right faster than

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.050 
almost infinite length right faster than
light<00:02:07.710> travel<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.250> impossible<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.940> what

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
light travel is impossible but what

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.309 
light travel is impossible but what
happens<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.509> move<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.899> base<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.289> that

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
happens if you move the base of that

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.070 
happens if you move the base of that
stick<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.640> tip<00:02:11.910> has<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.420> move<00:02:12.630> faster

what<00:02:14.430> happens<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.830> question<00:02:17.250> makes

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
what happens to that that question makes

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.330 
what happens to that that question makes
sense<00:02:17.610> at<00:02:17.760> all<00:02:21.200> look<00:02:22.200> I'm<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:22.680> Gary<00:02:23.100> what

sense at all look I'm just Gary what

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.800 
sense at all look I'm just Gary what
would<00:02:23.489> happen<00:02:23.819> at<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.000> tip<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.330> sting<00:02:24.569> if

would happen at a tip of the sting if

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.270 
would happen at a tip of the sting if
it's<00:02:24.959> forced<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.350> move<00:02:25.440> faster<00:02:25.860> than<00:02:25.980> light<00:02:26.130> to

it's forced to move faster than light to

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.190 
it's forced to move faster than light to
keep<00:02:26.459> up<00:02:26.670> with<00:02:26.810> what's<00:02:27.810> going<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.140> at<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> base

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
keep up with what's going on at the base

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.530 
keep up with what's going on at the base
well<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:31.410> happened<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.820> don't<00:02:33.150> know<00:02:33.269> man

question<00:02:37.760> that's<00:02:38.760> much<00:02:39.120> hold<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:39.959> guy

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
question that's much hold on this guy

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.180 
question that's much hold on this guy
just<00:02:40.170> called<00:02:40.410> me<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.620> think<00:02:40.709> he<00:02:40.920> wants<00:02:41.130> to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
just called me I think he wants to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.780 
just called me I think he wants to
answer<00:02:41.540> hey<00:02:42.540> what's<00:02:42.720> up<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:44.070> energy<00:02:44.430> required

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
answer hey what's up the energy required

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.009 
answer hey what's up the energy required
to<00:02:44.850> move<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:45.269> be<00:02:45.390> infinite<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:45.870> well

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
to move it would be infinite as well

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.520 
to move it would be infinite as well
really<00:02:46.470> oh<00:02:47.420> boy<00:02:48.420> now<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.600> chats<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.380> don't

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
really oh boy now the chats you don't

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.780 
really oh boy now the chats you don't
have<00:02:49.620> enough<00:02:49.709> energy<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.130> move<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> stick<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
have enough energy to move the stick I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.460 
have enough energy to move the stick I
didn't<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.150> didn't<00:02:51.359> pay<00:02:51.750> attention<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.200> quantum

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
didn't I didn't pay attention in quantum

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.520 
didn't I didn't pay attention in quantum
physics<00:02:52.560> at<00:02:52.799> all<00:02:52.950> actually<00:02:54.079> or<00:02:55.079> what<00:02:55.290> little

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
physics at all actually or what little

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.550 
physics at all actually or what little
bit<00:02:55.709> i<00:02:55.769> did<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.420> hey<00:02:57.420> fucking<00:02:58.109> hated

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
bit i did of it hey fucking hated

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.990 
bit i did of it hey fucking hated
physics<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:59.220> tried<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.430> get<00:02:59.519> through<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.730> with

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
physics and tried to get through it with

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.810 
physics and tried to get through it with
the<00:03:00.090> pasta

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.120 

there<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:11.940> no<00:03:12.090> spoon<00:03:15.500> nods<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.710> constants

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
there is no spoon nods to the constants

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.470 
there is no spoon nods to the constants
okay<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:17.460> the<00:03:17.640> energy<00:03:17.790> required<00:03:18.210> would<00:03:18.330> be<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
okay so the energy required would be the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.910 
okay so the energy required would be the
infinite<00:03:18.870> because<00:03:18.990> as<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.290> approach<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
infinite because as you approach the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.220 
infinite because as you approach the
speed<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.220> light<00:03:20.250> everything<00:03:20.880> comes<00:03:21.870> fucked

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
speed of light everything comes fucked

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:32.870 
speed of light everything comes fucked
up<00:03:30.140> okay<00:03:31.140> what<00:03:31.410> are<00:03:31.470> we<00:03:31.530> doing<00:03:31.800> why<00:03:32.640> am<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.820> the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
up okay what are we doing why am I the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.370 
up okay what are we doing why am I the
only<00:03:33.030> one<00:03:33.300> with<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.510> back<00:03:33.690> door<00:03:33.900> on<00:03:33.990> this<00:03:34.110> map

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
only one with the back door on this map

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.110 
only one with the back door on this map
I<00:03:34.710> think<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:35.430> because<00:03:35.520> you<00:03:35.790> didn't<00:03:35.970> waive

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
I think it's because you didn't waive

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.340 
I think it's because you didn't waive
the<00:03:36.330> stick<00:03:36.540> with<00:03:36.690> an<00:03:36.780> infinite<00:03:37.110> amount<00:03:37.170> of

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
the stick with an infinite amount of

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.680 
the stick with an infinite amount of
energy<00:03:37.940> you're<00:03:38.940> full<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.210> shit<00:03:39.450> right<00:03:39.510> now

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
energy you're full of shit right now
