00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
with invisibility put it on the back

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.320 
with invisibility put it on the back
burner<00:01:11.890> anyway<00:01:12.890> it<00:01:13.159> occurs<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.490> me<00:01:13.670> if<00:01:14.030> I<00:01:14.180> ever

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
burner anyway it occurs to me if I ever

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.330

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
did perfect a time machine I would just

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.590 
did perfect a time machine I would just
go<00:01:16.460> into<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.729> past<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.149> give<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.450> myself

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600

thus eliminating the need for me to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.139 
thus eliminating the need for me to
invent<00:01:19.789> it<00:01:20.000> in<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.180> first<00:01:20.360> place

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149
