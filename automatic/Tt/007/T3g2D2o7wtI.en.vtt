monitoring<00:01:06.820> socket<00:01:07.600> on<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.810> side<00:01:07.990> there<00:01:08.259> and

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
monitoring socket on the side there and

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.870 
monitoring socket on the side there and
you've<00:01:08.799> got<00:01:08.829> a<00:01:08.950> volume<00:01:09.220> control<00:01:09.549> on<00:01:09.579> the<00:01:09.759> mic

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
you've got a volume control on the mic

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.429 
you've got a volume control on the mic
itself<00:01:10.360> so<00:01:10.509> you<00:01:10.570> can<00:01:10.630> listen<00:01:11.079> while<00:01:11.290> you're

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
itself so you can listen while you're

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.630 
itself so you can listen while you're
working<00:01:11.530> on<00:01:11.799> your<00:01:11.920> laptop<00:01:12.040> something<00:01:12.520> like

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
working on your laptop something like

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.620 
working on your laptop something like
that<00:01:12.759> you<00:01:12.850> don't<00:01:12.939> have<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.180> be<00:01:13.270> monitoring

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
that you don't have to be monitoring

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.929 
that you don't have to be monitoring
through<00:01:13.810> speakers<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:20.740> 24-bit<00:01:21.399> conversion

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
through speakers with 24-bit conversion

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.789 
through speakers with 24-bit conversion
and<00:01:22.180> internal<00:01:22.600> processing<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.290> it's<00:01:23.439> you<00:01:23.710> know

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
and internal processing so it's you know

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.109 
and internal processing so it's you know
it's<00:01:24.070> state<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.399> art<00:01:24.490> in<00:01:24.700> terms<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:25.000> that

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
it's state of the art in terms of that

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.940 
it's state of the art in terms of that
we've<00:01:25.570> got<00:01:25.689> our<00:01:25.750> own<00:01:25.870> proprietary<00:01:26.110> software

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
we've got our own proprietary software

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.440 
we've got our own proprietary software
drivers<00:01:27.490> on<00:01:27.580> there<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:27.880> it's<00:01:27.970> plug<00:01:28.150> in<00:01:28.300> and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
drivers on there so it's plug in and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.240 
drivers on there so it's plug in and
play<00:01:28.510> for<00:01:28.780> all<00:01:28.840> platforms<00:01:29.080> as<00:01:29.470> well<00:01:32.220> exactly

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
play for all platforms as well exactly

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.700 
play for all platforms as well exactly
so<00:01:34.090> yeah<00:01:34.870> it's<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.170> same<00:01:35.320> kind<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.530> price

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
so yeah it's the same kind of price

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.399 
so yeah it's the same kind of price
point<00:01:35.740> is<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.159> x1<00:01:36.430> as<00:01:36.580> well<00:01:36.760> so<00:01:37.000> it's<00:01:37.120> about

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
point is the x1 as well so it's about

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.100 
point is the x1 as well so it's about
$199<00:01:38.409> 129<00:01:39.370> pounds<00:01:39.580> Inc<00:01:39.850> back<00:01:39.970> in<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.210> UK<00:01:40.540> so
