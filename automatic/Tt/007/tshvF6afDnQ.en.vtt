00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello gentlemen comrades others 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.630
 further continuation now 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.000
 deducted on the slope are reduced to this 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.930
 wall 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:25.740
 and today i'm starting to dig a niche under 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.449
 flap which will be a local flap exactly 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.449
 for the topic because there are so many 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.630
 consumer washing machine three 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.730
 pump bespereboynik sockets boiler all 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.730
 under your guns by Sasha it was possible 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:52.190
 operative let's say you need a pump of some kind 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:52.190
 win so so now we will cut 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 wax 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.689
 I 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.409
 we 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.170
 burned brick here 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.280
 moto wall see these places very 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:17.100
 strong just a lot of hard pouring 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:19.140
 even the most perforator is hard 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.730
 Of course this is not a bump here only 8 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:29.430
 joule there or 9 well tight enough 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.580
 brick so everything is fine squeezed like this 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.270
 wires about starting the wiring will go on 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.160
 the floor your tile will open here 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.840
 on the finished tile will be a little drop 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.910
 channels to rise pump power cable 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.570
 this 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.040
 the boiler and the three pumps i.e. the pumps are not 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.260
 there will be a direct connection 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.770
 be considered well here cement plaster in 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.190
 basis 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.220
 and on top smeared some plaster 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.460
 plaster which is unknown 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.530
 tried cadet can not be normal but 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.060
 something dumb to me if Che little 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.930
 glue will dry out can tear off 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:19.810
 shorter traditionally notch so here 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:25.450
 perform like this across the wall do 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:28.610
 for sure already everyone just beat already 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.580
 here is the main bundle of wires at all 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.430
 consumers will go to the floor in the floor 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.740
 will also work 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:43.040
 there will be a niche on it 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:47.840
 here too fines boiler on secrecy 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:52.030
 the walls will only be primed and 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.030
 everything and you can already lay tile
