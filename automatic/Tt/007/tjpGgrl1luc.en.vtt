00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 what do you know about gta chinatown wars 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.170
 personal until recently in general 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.269
 knew nothing about this game except 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.570
 occasionally ran across gameplay videos 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.830
 for this game but they are absolutely me 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.590
 not attracted 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.300
 I will not hide, I sincerely teased 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.820
 over cartoon graphics 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.760
 over the wretched not modern view from above 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.310
 Yes, and the game itself for a long time did not want 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.890
 take seriously though reviews about her 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.679
 heard totally different however today 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.410
 there was a keen desire to play it 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.540
 I really don't know why but the desire was 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.570
 very strong and I could not him 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.520
 oppose immediately say that while the version 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.950
 the game is not originally she 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.780
 developed on nintendo ds and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.230
 actually it is on this platform and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.780
 came out in 2009 passes somewhere 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.360
 half a year the game appears on the playstation 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.059
 portable all of us known beloved 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.980
 psp that bitch me in childhood was not 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.960
 because parents said they should 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.149
 culturally develop physically they 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.180
 play bloody games oh well 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.890
 another year passes and the game goes to ios 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.590
 devices on iPhones 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.990
 iPads and other apple products 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.990
 it would seem that this is the end of the game 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.049
 what will not work but literally half a year 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.420
 back at the end of 2014 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.150
 the game appeared on android devices 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.540
 the difference between the release of ios android version 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.490
 4 years cool yes anyway I'm glad 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.560
 that she appeared on android will not have to 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.689
 fuck with a poor peace emulator 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.210
 and just throw the game on the tablet and 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.030
 get acquainted not somewhere in the subway itself 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.340
 already read and ready to make your 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.520
 the verdict is not yet final 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.500
 for played just a couple of hours however 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.720
 I think you will be interested to listen 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.030
 my first opinion about this game 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.850
 who watched my vidos about android version 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.219
 Vitas Andraste know that my tablet 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.890
 nifiga not top it costs only 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.350
 1700 hryvnia, however, in principle, with its 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.590
 copes with functions and in games on it 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.229
 It is quite convenient to play and if in gta san 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.050
 once the cutters fall FPS though rarely well 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.060
 there were places to be in chinatown wars all 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.280
 just the same surprising circle 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.740
 food weighs the game relatively little 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.330
 only 500 megabytes so I think everyone 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.000
 of you can install it on your 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.830
 phone is important to be on android 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.350
 well, then just have fun in 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.420
 time boring trips to the subway immediately in 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.480
 eyes rush jamb and personally for 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.070
 i'm pretty serious and this absence 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.230
 Russifier personal English know 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.880
 insofar as therefore the crack 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.250
 I need at least to 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.020
 trite to understand everything that happens 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.000
 around me here so the plot will be 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.920
 it's pretty hard to understand that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.470
 Rokstarovtsy either did not want or did not 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.980
 were able to draw normal to the scene to us 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.530
 have to contemplate drawings of characters and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.630
 read the subtitles that are not written there 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.150
 even dubbed no cutscenes 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.250
 this way is also pretty serious cant 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.260
 watch drawn faces and read 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.230
 subtitles personal opinion fig not like 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.750
 or is it a feature of the game so if the feature is 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.280
 extremely worthless could at least 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.290
 engine games some cutscenes 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.330
 draw the rest for now 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.270
 satisfied with the first impression of the game 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.690
 rather positive and not negative 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.670
 Yes, the game is a bit peculiar, but all this 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.160
 kind of more likely to benefit 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.380
 rather than harm if the game is not yet 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.140
 familiar and strongly recommend just 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.290
 throw igruhu on the phone and enjoy 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.840
 for example when traveling by subway or 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.940
 in other public transport not 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.430
 say that straight will delay all the same it is not 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.420
 Of those games that delays 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:46.410
 however, you can kill time with benefit 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.720
 and it's good management is comfortable and not 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.350
 I know how there in other versions but on 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.720
 android more or less good minutes for 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.209
 5 you adapt and just continue 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.160
 Ebash in porridge really liked the fact that 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.670
 action games are not any out there 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.520
 god forgotten muhosranske and 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.310
 in liberty city â€‹â€‹in that liberty city 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.560
 those who played gta 4 will find out without any problems 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.080
 architecture of the city of freedom she is here 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.750
 almost the same hove beach 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.299
 all the same firefly island remember 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.410
 firefly island there michael faust angel 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.410
 until its not to 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.960
 not killed and here it is such a taxi fleet 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.360
 novel has not changed a single 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.960
 that the novel is not here yes and taxis 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.700
 closed it can not go in unfortunately I 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.740
 I don't know for sure whether the plot will be 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.620
 chinatown wars intertwined with 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.800
 familiar places in gta 4 rather 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.540
 all yes and that is to be good 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.090
 actually this video ends 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.060
 that was my first opinion gta chinatown 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.150
 wars how do you see the toy though 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.270
 peculiar but spend on it at least 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.760
 a couple of hours I think you can master 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.460
 Well, in the same place to decide whether to play or not 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.950
 worth it and yes maybe Japan will still sip 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.960
 any videos well, naturally if you 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.720
 want to write your opinion in the comments 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.360
 about this game and about whether you want more 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.750
 her videos we just like 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.960
 support me morally good luck everyone 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.960
 until
