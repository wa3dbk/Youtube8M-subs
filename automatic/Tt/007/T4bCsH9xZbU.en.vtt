what<00:01:47.590> Andy's<00:01:47.920> done<00:01:48.160> with<00:01:48.340> this<00:01:48.460> team<00:01:48.700> they're

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
what Andy's done with this team they're

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.690 
what Andy's done with this team they're
quick<00:01:49.509> they're<00:01:49.780> athletic<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.700> they

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
quick they're athletic and they

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.190

definitely<00:01:51.970> like<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.240> push<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.539> pace<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.110> I

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
definitely like to push the pace and I

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.990 
definitely like to push the pace and I
think<00:01:53.440> that<00:01:53.979> presents<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.369> huge<00:01:54.490> challenge<00:01:54.970> for

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
think that presents a huge challenge for

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.749 
think that presents a huge challenge for
us<00:01:55.149> because<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.920> have<00:01:57.190> been<00:01:57.340> working<00:01:57.460> all

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
us because we have been working all

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.820 
us because we have been working all
season<00:01:57.940> long<00:01:58.179> on<00:01:58.390> making<00:01:59.259> sure<00:01:59.380> our<00:01:59.500> paces

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
season long on making sure our paces

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.169 
season long on making sure our paces
efficient<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.520> think<00:02:00.789> that'll<00:02:00.970> be<00:02:01.030> great

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
efficient so I think that'll be great

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.359

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.880 
key things that our opponents like to do
and<00:02:34.720> we<00:02:34.810> make<00:02:34.989> sure<00:02:35.020> we<00:02:35.200> get<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.530> done

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
and we make sure we get that done

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.240 
and we make sure we get that done
toughness<00:02:36.580> has<00:02:36.700> been<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.849> huge<00:02:37.590> word<00:02:38.590> for<00:02:38.950> tar

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
toughness has been a huge word for tar

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.850 
toughness has been a huge word for tar
the<00:02:39.520> past<00:02:39.730> few<00:02:40.000> weeks<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:41.020> know<00:02:41.050> are<00:02:41.319> we<00:02:41.349> tough

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
the past few weeks you know are we tough

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.100 
the past few weeks you know are we tough
I<00:02:42.160> think<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.000> lot<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.150> times<00:02:43.390> Stanford<00:02:43.930> teams

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
I think a lot of times Stanford teams

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.650 
I think a lot of times Stanford teams
tend<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.099> see<00:02:45.580> like<00:02:45.730> oh<00:02:45.819> they're<00:02:46.000> offensive<00:02:46.330> so

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
tend to see like oh they're offensive so

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.449 
tend to see like oh they're offensive so
they're<00:02:46.810> not<00:02:46.930> really<00:02:47.050> tough<00:02:47.410> defensively<00:02:47.950> but

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
they're not really tough defensively but

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.070 
they're not really tough defensively but
i<00:02:48.520> think<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:48.910> are<00:02:48.940> tough<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.840> think

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
i think we are tough and I think

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.780 
i think we are tough and I think
especially<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.620> mean<00:02:50.830> there's<00:02:51.250> one<00:02:51.550> picture

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
especially I mean there's one picture

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.210 
especially I mean there's one picture
that<00:02:51.940> came<00:02:52.209> out<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.420> love<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.290> there's<00:02:54.160> a

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
that came out I love it there's a

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.680 
that came out I love it there's a
picture<00:02:54.430> that<00:02:54.550> came<00:02:54.640> out<00:02:54.849> was<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.599> couple
