00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.320
By the beginning of MWC 2013 LG has updated
its L-series product line. 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.840
 L-series is about design and is for those who don't want to overpay for it. 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.160
Let's start with the phone called L3 II, it's the low level model. 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.830
The device has a 3.2-inch display with 320 x 240 definition. 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.190
This is IPS matrix that why the picture (though it's grainy) looks good. 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.190
It's hard and bright and has good viewing angles. 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.640
The device is based on chipsets which include a single-core 1 GHz processor, 512 Mb of RAM and 4 Gb of ROM. 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.210
There is a slot for microSD cards up to 32 Gb. I can't take off the cover that's why I can't show you this slot. 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.210
On the upper side there is an audio jack and on/off button made of plastics. 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.250
On the whole, I would say the device
is too plastic. 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.250
But it's the initial level. On the left side there is a volume key

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.160
 and on the bottom side there is a microUSB port. The camera is 3.2 megapixel capable of shooting HD video. 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.679
The next model is called L5. It looks much more pleasant than L3 II.

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:03.679
 The display is 4-inch with 800 x 480 definition. 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.500
Home button is illuminated, I don't know on what it depends. 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.379
As well as the previous model,  this device is based on a single-core 1 GHz processor,

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.959
 it has 512 Mb of RAM and 4 GB of ROM. 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.650
There is also a slot for microSD cards
under the back cover. 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.239
The back cover has a nice metal texture though it's made of plastics.

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.540
There is a black and glossy version of the device. Unfortunately, fingerprints are seen here very clearly. 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.510
This one looks more gainful.  

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.510
On the upper side there is an audio jack and
the second mic for noise damping. On the right side there is on/off button. On the left side there is a volume key and quick memo button. On the bottom side there is a microUSB port and the main mic. 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:16.249
On the back panel there is a 5 megapixel camera capable of shooting HD video and a LED flash. 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:20.499
The battery is 1700 mA per hour

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:27.499
 which with a medium display and not very powerful hardware will give not very bad results.  

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.920
As well as the previous model, the device works on Android 4.1.2. It's  quite up-to-date version, nobody except for Google hasn't updated its devices to 4.2 yet. 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:57.639
The next model is called Optimus L7 II.
It's the most productive device in the product line. 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.459
The display is 4.3-inch though the definition
of IPS matrix is the same -- 800 x 480. Viewing  angles are good but brightness decreases. Color rendering is good. 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.810
The device increased its productivity -- it has a dual-core 1 GHz Qualcom processor, it's Cortex-A5.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.470
It has 768 Mb of RAM and 4 Gb of ROM 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.470
which you can enlarge using microSD cards up to 32 Gb. 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.720
The back panel has a 8 megapixel camera and a LED flash. It's very pleasant to touch the back cover in comparison with the previous
models. 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.450
It's very convenient to hold the device, it doesn't slips out of the hand. On the upper side there is an audio jack and the second mic for noise damping. 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:10.450
On the right side there is on/off button. On the left side there is quick memo button and a volume key. On the bottom side there is a microUSB port.  

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:41.040
How much will these devices cost? I've just
talked to Mr Ken Hong who told me that the prices were not set. But they won't be higher
than the prices for the previous product line. 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:51.130
So, the prices will range from 140-150 to
300 euro. It's very affordable. Besides, this year LG has presented another three phones
which are of the same product line but have two SIM cards. Let's have a look at them. 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:33.030
Everything is practically the same. The main difference is that L3 II Dual has a mat back cover and two slots for SIM cards. Hardware is the same but  the price may be higher. 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:45.390
L5 also has a textured back cover and rounded corners. It's convenient to hold the device. 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:04.900
The biggest model (with a 4.3-inch display) has also two SIM cards. One of them has 3G and the other 2G.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.080
