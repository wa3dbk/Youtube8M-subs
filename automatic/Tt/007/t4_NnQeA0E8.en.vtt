00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 and in the activity of Russian partners in 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.069
 Customs Union and Prospects 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.410
 conflict resolution in the east 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.000
 Ukraine by saying right now with our 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.650
 guest studio rbk 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.269
 Bogdan Bespalko Board Member 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.429
 interethnic relations with 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.650
 Russian President Bogdan too 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.500
 hello thank you for coming here 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.630
 I know interesting and the moment itself 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.189
 Why Lukashenko and Nazarbayev 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.560
 Now before visiting Moscow 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.080
 went to Kiev that is this 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.000
 it turns out a hint to the Kremlin that coming 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 allies are dissatisfied with ours 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.040
 Ukrainian course or still in Minsk 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.710
 the country has some of his own 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.960
 Coordination Moscow think here 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.730
 a whole range of reasons and for Minsk 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.440
 truths they are somewhat different types 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.000
 complexes for Minsk is important 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.739
 foreign policy diversification 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.809
 demonstration of loyalty to 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.700
 westward videos of such somewhat hysterical 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.710
 action statements by Lukashenko 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.840
 he did make statements much more 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.210
 sharp for example he asked directly 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 why did not you fight for the Crimea therefore 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.699
 his peacekeeping mission is so to speak 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.229
 somewhat exaggerated matter 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.200
 just provided a platform for 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.670
 negotiations as for Nazarbayev 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.290
 here I think he acts in terms of 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.840
 some lead in relation to 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.369
 kremlin to really 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.380
 take a stronger more profitable 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.049
 position and in turn demand or 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.869
 or perhaps just ask and talk 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.030
 some preferences benefits them from 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.069
 kremlin or so let's say strengthen your 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.020
 position again in relations with Moscow 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.259
 but with the help of respectively need 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.209
 native policy about Lukashenko 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.459
 I would like to talk a little more about 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:41.009
 the other day it happened itself as such 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.319
 political showman Russian ban on 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.810
 Belarusian meat called foolish and 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.970
 brainless and talked to Poroshenko in Kiev 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.649
 with revealing warmth and promised 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.750
 broadcast belarus first channel 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.969
 Ukraine's first TV channel 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.009
 probably no one expected this how it is 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.289
 Moscow I wonder is not gray 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.030
 Moscow has long been steps and general behavior 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.879
 Lukashenko is rated as clearly not 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.189
 friendly and this is true 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:06.989
 as for the statements, they are his 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.759
 always been pretty hysterical and 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:10.259
 general model Lukashenko in model 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.180
 behavior is a bit like 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.470
 Panikovsky everyone is considered miserable 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.590
 insignificant majestic at the same time 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.440
 constantly requires a million i can say 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.389
 that certainly in this situation is 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.130
 very annoying Russian elite is 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.720
 leads to the behavior pattern 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.870
 between Russia and Belarus will be 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.579
 revised accordingly i think 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.440
 that Alexander Lukashenko in any case 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.880
 will blame Russia if Russia 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.470
 it seems any pressure on Minsk then 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.280
 and here's to blame for what it takes 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.950
 of independence 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.420
 sovereign country if Russia is nothing 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.099
 will do then she will stay anyway 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.049
 blame because it does not render 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.540
 proper support and provides 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.639
 billions of dollars and so on so on 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.319
 free there is no free gas and other 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.480
 although in fact the conditions for 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.720
 Belarus they basically in some 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.400
 cases even more so 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.209
 favorable than on for many 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.730
 Russian businessmen 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.500
 manufacturers but this requirement 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.329
 Lukashenko to Russia to pay for the goods and 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.549
 hard currency it generally fits into 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.930
 Lukashenko's model of behavior in the model 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.760
 Lukashenko fit anything 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.890
 up to 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.900
 I do not know there the requirement of military officers 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.329
 give honor to your young son 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.159
 Well, he recently here in this that 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.680
 asked called Russian politics 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.930
 stupid brainless but when Russia 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.120
 tried to restrict re-exports but in 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.379
 the other side of the Belarusians themselves 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.030
 confiscated not even that not 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.099
 only detained even confiscated a number 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.750
 commodity four from Kaliningrad region 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.370
 as this behavior is also called well 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.560
 probably at least too stupid and 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.940
 brainless because russia 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.159
 provides economically and politically 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.959
 and yes and the military sovereignty of Belarus and and 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.920
 without Russian support for Lukashenko there 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.450
 won't last too 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.480
 good how is this requirement 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.220
 generally real and doable and then she 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.870
 significantly complicate integration 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.670
 processes in the post-Soviet space in 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.829
 framework of the customs Eurasian Union 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.690
 but I think that this will not happen 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.299
 rather I hope so but in principle 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.180
 Of course the right to demand he has but 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.950
 in itself is the essence of integration within 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.120
 of these alliances, it loses all meaning 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.769
 and here is how growing here in Russia 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.370
 currency crisis what kind of we influence 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.760
 on relations with belarus and kazakhstan 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.349
 we will certainly affect but the fact is 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.660
 Belarus basically exists now 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.010
 at the expense of Russia only therefore 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.650
 Russian risks 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.930
 state they must inevitably be 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.820
 adopted by the Belarusian side 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.979
 if Russia handles something Belarus simply 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.840
 crushes debris well, that's Lukashenko and 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.910
 Nazarbayev because they spoke openly to 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.280
 that countries are losing billions of dollars and 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.620
 due to the fact that Moscow can not situation 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.270
 it is necessary but they are somehow not 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.770
 talked about what they were getting 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.630
 billion dollars thanks precisely 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.090
 Russia at least let's say gas prices 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.740
 which belarus gets inside 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.800
 Russian prices are very disturbing 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.669
 many manufacturers not to mention 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.340
 dating actually belarusian 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.289
 agriculture so i think that 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.449
 if a 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.039
 accordingly, everything is good for some reason 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.660
 they are silent and if suddenly begins 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.610
 the crisis that they immediately begin to speak 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.199
 you know about your losses at Brodsky 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.349
 fine verse is on independence 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.389
 Ukraine together a loop so to speak, 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.949
 more often 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.020
 more comfortable but to nibble on chicken alone 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.090
 From borscht sweeter from this accurately determines 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.470
 position model as Minsk features 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.020
 to some extent astana 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.819
 both presidents offered one way or another 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.490
 cooperation in the Ukrainian crisis 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.289
 why could they help here if they 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.800
 read the readiness of Lukashenko to submit 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.780
 and in Minsk area for negotiations 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.880
 Lukashenko in quotes already helped when he 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.520
 made all sorts of statements put 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.949
 visits to Kiev and in every possible way demonstrated 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.690
 that he didn't care about Moscow he wanted to grow 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.880
 Nazarbayev there he has no such 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.080
 negative experiences at least 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.360
 Moscow will start surprisingly can 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.099
 serve as a mediator may be just 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.139
 for this he commits including 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.150
 visit to Kiev to announce 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.039
 that he can also be a mediator and 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.020
 announce a new negotiation format here 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.099
 have a ming norman norman now 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.289
 I will not know the Kazakhstan format 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.669
 thank you so much we discussed a 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.650
 complicated country relationships
