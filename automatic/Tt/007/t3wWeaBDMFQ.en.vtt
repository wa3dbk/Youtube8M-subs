00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.410
 the protests there comfort until 2070 and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.139
 I have the michael carrick in only 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.750
 this time 100 percent poultry 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.940
 There was a cry out there lately 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.270
 when i got the price of this pack 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.140
 he has actually called me 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:24.269
 really cost two euros 19 meant 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.810
 some of them would be much cheaper 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.810
 to get 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:37.530
 it's exactly this poultry sausage that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.730
 turkey meat and without pork 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.370
 look something here 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.100
 and the classic is like special 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:58.530
 probably the same as exactly one 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:01:02.010
 sting and get off to the microwave so that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.070
 finish it why they stick in the cracks 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.070
 remained 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:12.659
 well on growth 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.650
 I think I should steam it too 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:23.189
 nice I think I should also 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.180
 original pk take on all cases when 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.180
 forgot last time 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.280
 Of course that expensive special 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.490
 exactly as it was also a commentary to 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.320
 because of now curry under stir or 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.440
 not and then it was called privÃ© 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:54.860
 mutatis mutandis, only the former 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:58.670
 Curry, therefore, I take now 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.500
 this fully pollinated the parties and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.500
 It is not unaffected 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:21.360
 he'd rather have me a sissy 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.660
 tastes completely dusty like you do not 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.660
 is good 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.550
 your book later on all occasions 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.310
 The play my 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.270
 So here rinsed off I know her 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.880
 cut one again 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:13.760
 put on 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:15.380
 John is as healthy as the original 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.180
 with the pork taste though 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:23.180
 i might be better for people 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.300
 how pork like to eat 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.570
 then still a currywurst is yes 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.570
 not wrong 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.130
 first down under 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:05:32.350

 packaging frame wasting light of plastic 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:54.430
 three meters downhill 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:06:02.380
 schortens sncf shane byrne with the 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:08.800
 tracks of the bodies of plastic 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:13.180
 nations in the way to the net - it was 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.180
 So it was finishing times
