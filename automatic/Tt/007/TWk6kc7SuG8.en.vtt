00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
leaking right around the point here on

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.089 
leaking right around the point here on
the<00:02:21.390> copper<00:02:22.079> thread<00:02:22.349> so<00:02:22.590> we<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:22.829> a<00:02:22.860> little

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
the copper thread so we have a little

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.350 
the copper thread so we have a little
bit<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.250> old<00:02:23.400> plumber's<00:02:23.730> tape<00:02:23.880> I'm<00:02:24.060> just<00:02:24.239> going

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
bit of old plumber's tape I'm just going

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.870 
bit of old plumber's tape I'm just going
to<00:02:24.390> leave<00:02:24.569> that<00:02:24.599> here<00:02:24.989> for<00:02:25.019> this<00:02:25.260> test<00:02:25.730> let<00:02:26.730> me

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to leave that here for this test let me

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.949 
to leave that here for this test let me
zoom<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> little<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.920> show<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.340> hookup<00:02:32.959> this

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
zoom in a little to show the hookup this

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.130 
zoom in a little to show the hookup this
side<00:02:34.560> right<00:02:34.799> here<00:02:35.239> it's<00:02:36.239> all<00:02:36.360> plastic<00:02:36.930> there's

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
side right here it's all plastic there's

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.699 
side right here it's all plastic there's
no<00:02:37.260> metal

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
no metal

there's no washer there's no plumber's
tape<00:02:42.090> or<00:02:42.420> silicone<00:02:42.930> or<00:02:43.170> anything<00:02:43.850> all<00:02:44.850> right

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
tape or silicone or anything all right

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.800 
tape or silicone or anything all right
that's<00:02:45.299> reasonably<00:02:45.989> tight<00:02:46.310> okay<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.340> want<00:02:47.700> to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
that's reasonably tight okay I want to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.750 
that's reasonably tight okay I want to
simultaneously<00:02:48.810> check<00:02:49.170> for<00:02:49.470> leaks<00:02:50.310> here<00:02:50.639> at

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
simultaneously check for leaks here at

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.580 
simultaneously check for leaks here at
the<00:02:50.880> faucet<00:02:51.090> well<00:02:51.720> seeing<00:02:52.019> how<00:02:52.170> fast<00:02:52.440> it

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the faucet well seeing how fast it

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.110 
the faucet well seeing how fast it
expands<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.190> other<00:02:53.400> end<00:02:53.609> has<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.970> little

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
expands the other end has that little

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.849 
expands the other end has that little
switch<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.630> I've<00:02:54.780> turned<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.260> close<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.709> so

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
switch and I've turned it to close it so

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.069 
switch and I've turned it to close it so
I<00:02:56.310> assume<00:02:56.639> the<00:02:56.940> water<00:02:57.150> pressure<00:02:57.480> should<00:02:57.810> shoot

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
I assume the water pressure should shoot

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.390 
I assume the water pressure should shoot
it<00:02:58.170> out<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.440> its<00:02:58.560> full<00:02:58.769> length<00:02:58.799> there<00:02:59.160> pretty

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
it out to its full length there pretty

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.589 
it out to its full length there pretty
quick<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.540> let's<00:03:01.470> see<00:03:01.739> what<00:03:01.889> happens

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.860 

well<00:03:06.599> it's<00:03:06.780> moving<00:03:07.549> it's<00:03:08.549> coiling<00:03:09.120> oh<00:03:09.359> it's

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
well it's moving it's coiling oh it's

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.520 
well it's moving it's coiling oh it's
alive<00:03:11.120> we<00:03:12.120> do<00:03:12.239> have<00:03:12.389> some<00:03:12.630> leak<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.139> yeah<00:03:13.290> it

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
alive we do have some leak but yeah it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.009 
alive we do have some leak but yeah it
always<00:03:13.680> leaks<00:03:14.040> there<00:03:14.310> at<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.549> handle<00:03:15.019> well

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
always leaks there at the handle well

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.940 
always leaks there at the handle well
all<00:03:16.319> the<00:03:16.500> accordian<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.280> has<00:03:17.489> disappeared

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
all the accordian this has disappeared

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.199 
all the accordian this has disappeared
this<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.220> now<00:03:20.459> very<00:03:21.269> tight<00:03:21.630> and<00:03:21.840> taut<00:03:23.060> yeah<00:03:24.060> and

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
this is now very tight and taut yeah and

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.479 
this is now very tight and taut yeah and
it's<00:03:24.329> holding<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.599> water<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.470> seal<00:03:26.340> at

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
it's holding the water in the seal at

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.690 
it's holding the water in the seal at
that<00:03:26.639> end<00:03:26.819> is<00:03:26.940> good<00:03:27.180> let's<00:03:27.540> stretch<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.840> out

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
that end is good let's stretch it out

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.849 
that end is good let's stretch it out
see<00:03:29.700> what<00:03:29.880> it's<00:03:30.000> going<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.239> do<00:03:30.419> well<00:03:30.900> let's<00:03:31.680> see

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
see what it's going to do well let's see

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.640 
see what it's going to do well let's see
if<00:03:31.950> we<00:03:32.010> can<00:03:32.220> reach<00:03:32.370> over<00:03:32.700> here<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:34.319> get<00:03:34.470> to

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
if we can reach over here to get to

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.090 
if we can reach over here to get to
these<00:03:34.769> flowers

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.250 

note<00:03:40.100> doesn't<00:03:40.490> quite<00:03:40.610> make<00:03:40.850> it<00:03:40.990> the<00:03:41.990> leak<00:03:42.140> is

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
note doesn't quite make it the leak is

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.450 
note doesn't quite make it the leak is
definitely<00:03:42.590> come<00:03:42.680> from<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:42.890> handle<00:03:43.220> which<00:03:43.340> is

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
definitely come from the handle which is

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.290 
definitely come from the handle which is
always<00:03:43.610> leak

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
always leak

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.780 
always leak
I<00:03:44.330> don't<00:03:45.170> however<00:03:45.500> see<00:03:45.800> anything<00:03:46.340> leaking

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
I don't however see anything leaking

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.200 
I don't however see anything leaking
from<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.860> from<00:03:48.860> either<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.280> connector<00:03:49.790> here

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
from the from either the connector here

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.860 
from the from either the connector here
or<00:03:50.390> from<00:03:51.320> this<00:03:52.360> connection<00:03:53.360> right<00:03:53.510> here<00:03:53.720> it

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
or from this connection right here it

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.300 
or from this connection right here it
seems<00:03:54.080> to<00:03:54.170> be<00:03:54.320> good<00:03:54.500> it's<00:03:54.770> definitely<00:03:55.250> not

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
seems to be good it's definitely not

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.490 
seems to be good it's definitely not
leaking<00:03:55.640> there's<00:03:55.820> no<00:03:55.910> water<00:03:56.150> coming<00:03:56.420> out<00:03:56.600> it's

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
leaking there's no water coming out it's

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.840 
leaking there's no water coming out it's
all<00:03:57.620> right<00:03:57.830> we've<00:03:58.130> got<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.400> stretched<00:03:58.670> out

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
all right we've got it stretched out

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.670 
all right we've got it stretched out
here<00:03:59.150> pretty<00:03:59.810> much<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.990> straight<00:04:00.230> line<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.560> its

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
here pretty much a straight line to its

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.670 
here pretty much a straight line to its
full<00:04:00.860> length<00:04:00.890> I'm<00:04:01.310> gonna<00:04:01.520> open<00:04:01.640> a<00:04:02.680> little

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
full length I'm gonna open a little

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.920 
full length I'm gonna open a little
switch<00:04:03.980> on<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.340> end<00:04:04.490> here<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.090> see<00:04:05.720> what

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
switch on the end here and see what

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.140 
switch on the end here and see what
happens<00:04:06.320> to<00:04:06.620> it

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
happens to it

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.410 
happens to it
whoa<00:04:08.630> yes<00:04:09.580> that's<00:04:10.580> nice<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.880> water<00:04:11.090> pressure

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
whoa yes that's nice the water pressure

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.400 
whoa yes that's nice the water pressure
there<00:04:12.700> it's<00:04:13.700> getting<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.120> little<00:04:14.750> bit<00:04:14.900> shorter

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
there it's getting a little bit shorter

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.580 
there it's getting a little bit shorter
I<00:04:15.590> see<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.100> pulling<00:04:16.430> back<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.640> few<00:04:16.970> inches<00:04:17.590> but

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
I see it pulling back a few inches but

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.030 
I see it pulling back a few inches but
it's<00:04:18.739> not<00:04:18.920> a<00:04:19.100> cordoning<00:04:20.090> back<00:04:20.739> that's<00:04:21.739> good

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
it's not a cordoning back that's good

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.410 
it's not a cordoning back that's good
I'm<00:04:22.310> guessing<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:22.700> sort<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.090> as<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.210> function

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
I'm guessing that sort of as a function

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:30.580 
I'm guessing that sort of as a function
of<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.900> water<00:04:24.050> pressure<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:24.830> have<00:04:29.590> and

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
of the water pressure that you have and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.580 
of the water pressure that you have and
it's<00:04:31.690> yeah<00:04:32.690> I<00:04:32.720> would<00:04:32.990> not<00:04:33.170> more<00:04:33.290> than<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.410> few

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
it's yeah I would not more than a few

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.380 
it's yeah I would not more than a few
inches<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:34.220> three<00:04:34.460> inches<00:04:34.700> I<00:04:34.850> would<00:04:34.880> say<00:04:35.120> got

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
inches to three inches I would say got

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.910 
inches to three inches I would say got
shorter<00:04:35.780> or<00:04:35.900> longer<00:04:35.930> depending<00:04:36.230> on<00:04:36.710> whether

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
shorter or longer depending on whether

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.970 
shorter or longer depending on whether
that<00:04:37.060> valve<00:04:38.060> was<00:04:38.240> closed<00:04:38.540> at<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.750> end<00:04:38.920> okay<00:04:39.920> to

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
that valve was closed at the end okay to

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.200 
that valve was closed at the end okay to
measure<00:04:40.250> out<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.520> length<00:04:40.670> see<00:04:41.030> if<00:04:41.090> it's

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
measure out the length see if it's

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.670 
measure out the length see if it's
really<00:04:41.330> 25<00:04:41.780> feet<00:04:41.990> I've<00:04:42.170> got<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.410> end<00:04:42.530> of<00:04:42.620> the

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
really 25 feet I've got the end of the

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.750 
really 25 feet I've got the end of the
tape<00:04:42.830> measure<00:04:43.040> here<00:04:43.340> right<00:04:43.580> where<00:04:43.700> the

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
tape measure here right where the

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.970 
tape measure here right where the
faucets<00:04:44.180> at<00:04:44.360> of<00:04:44.810> course<00:04:45.140> the<00:04:45.320> faucets<00:04:45.740> about<00:04:45.950> a

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
faucets at of course the faucets about a

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.220 
faucets at of course the faucets about a
foot<00:04:46.250> and<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.400> half<00:04:46.520> up<00:04:46.790> so<00:04:47.030> I've<00:04:47.150> got<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.330> figure

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
foot and a half up so I've got a figure

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.840 
foot and a half up so I've got a figure
the<00:04:48.350> hose<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:48.710> a<00:04:48.740> little<00:04:49.070> longer<00:04:49.430> than<00:04:49.580> what<00:04:49.700> it

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
the hose is a little longer than what it

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.180 
the hose is a little longer than what it
shows<00:04:50.120> based<00:04:50.540> on<00:04:50.780> this<00:04:51.020> and<00:04:51.320> we'll<00:04:51.680> walk<00:04:51.860> along

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
shows based on this and we'll walk along

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.440 
shows based on this and we'll walk along

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
here this is of course under pressure

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.030 
here this is of course under pressure
with<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.570> valve<00:04:56.750> closed<00:04:57.050> at<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.440> end<00:04:57.560> and<00:04:57.919> we

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
with the valve closed at the end and we

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.420 
with the valve closed at the end and we
come<00:04:58.310> in<00:04:58.520> at<00:04:58.790> 25<00:04:59.510> feet<00:04:59.990> four<00:05:00.350> inches<00:05:00.380> plus<00:05:01.190> you

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
come in at 25 feet four inches plus you

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.340 
come in at 25 feet four inches plus you
got<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:01.610> add<00:05:01.820> probably<00:05:02.240> 7<00:05:02.720> or<00:05:02.810> 8<00:05:02.900> inches<00:05:03.110> at

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
got to add probably 7 or 8 inches at

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.590 
got to add probably 7 or 8 inches at
least<00:05:03.530> to<00:05:03.710> make<00:05:03.860> up<00:05:04.010> for<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.460> hose<00:05:05.120> going<00:05:05.419> up

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
least to make up for the hose going up

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.780 
least to make up for the hose going up
to<00:05:05.720> the<00:05:05.810> faucet<00:05:05.990> so<00:05:06.380> probably<00:05:06.890> close<00:05:07.070> to<00:05:07.100> 26

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
to the faucet so probably close to 26

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.330 
to the faucet so probably close to 26
feet<00:05:08.030> you<00:05:08.810> do<00:05:08.930> really<00:05:09.140> get<00:05:09.320> a<00:05:09.380> 25<00:05:09.919> foot<00:05:10.190> hose

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
feet you do really get a 25 foot hose

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.170 
feet you do really get a 25 foot hose
that's<00:05:10.669> true

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
that's true

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.990 
that's true
all<00:05:11.990> right<00:05:12.230> time<00:05:12.710> to<00:05:12.740> test<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.370> cleanup<00:05:13.700> and

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
all right time to test the cleanup and

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.640 
all right time to test the cleanup and
see<00:05:14.180> how<00:05:14.330> much<00:05:14.630> it's<00:05:14.870> going<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.080> accordion

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
see how much it's going to accordion

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.560 
see how much it's going to accordion
back<00:05:15.860> together<00:05:16.040> and<00:05:16.460> how<00:05:17.000> easy<00:05:17.180> it's<00:05:17.390> going<00:05:17.510> to

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
back together and how easy it's going to

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.700 
back together and how easy it's going to
be<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.780> put<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.050> away<00:05:18.110> compared<00:05:18.530> to<00:05:18.590> my<00:05:18.680> old

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
be to put it away compared to my old

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.920 
be to put it away compared to my old
many<00:05:19.070> other<00:05:19.250> hose<00:05:19.490> got<00:05:20.090> a<00:05:20.150> view<00:05:20.390> here<00:05:20.630> I<00:05:20.660> think

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
many other hose got a view here I think

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.110 
many other hose got a view here I think
you<00:05:21.020> can<00:05:21.169> see<00:05:21.350> most<00:05:21.560> of<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.800> hose<00:05:21.979> and<00:05:22.700> I'm

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
you can see most of the hose and I'm

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.300 
you can see most of the hose and I'm
simply<00:05:23.419> going<00:05:23.600> to<00:05:23.690> turn<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.140> water<00:05:24.320> off<00:05:24.680> here

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.010 

water<00:05:28.310> is<00:05:28.460> off<00:05:28.790> and<00:05:29.030> then<00:05:29.120> open<00:05:29.419> the<00:05:29.510> valve<00:05:29.720> and

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
water is off and then open the valve and

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:39.040 
water is off and then open the valve and
see<00:05:30.260> what<00:05:30.380> happens

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.770 

much<00:05:39.560> to<00:05:39.770> my<00:05:39.800> surprise<00:05:40.270> it's<00:05:41.270> doing<00:05:41.539> what<00:05:41.660> it's

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
much to my surprise it's doing what it's

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.260 
much to my surprise it's doing what it's
supposed<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:42.639> okay<00:05:43.639> there's<00:05:43.940> still<00:05:44.060> some

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
supposed to okay there's still some

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.480 
supposed to okay there's still some
water<00:05:44.419> in<00:05:44.600> it<00:05:44.690> I<00:05:44.780> can<00:05:44.960> feel<00:05:45.169> that<00:05:45.350> I've<00:05:46.160> got<00:05:46.340> it

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
water in it I can feel that I've got it

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.159 
water in it I can feel that I've got it
folded<00:05:47.150> in<00:05:47.270> half<00:05:47.449> here<00:05:47.720> with<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:47.930> bottom

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
folded in half here with the bottom

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.520 
folded in half here with the bottom
touching<00:05:48.470> the<00:05:48.560> ground<00:05:48.650> and<00:05:49.300> it's<00:05:50.440> maybe<00:05:51.440> a

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
touching the ground and it's maybe a

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.870 
touching the ground and it's maybe a
couple<00:05:51.889> inches<00:05:52.009> longer<00:05:52.310> but<00:05:52.550> it's<00:05:52.639> pretty

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
couple inches longer but it's pretty

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.180 
couple inches longer but it's pretty
much<00:05:53.000> gone<00:05:53.240> back<00:05:53.419> to<00:05:53.599> the<00:05:53.690> same<00:05:53.900> height<00:05:54.199> this

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
much gone back to the same height this

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.750 
much gone back to the same height this
water<00:05:56.030> out

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:08.260 

down<00:06:00.420> to<00:06:00.570> just<00:06:00.780> some<00:06:00.930> drips<00:06:01.200> now

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.210 

pretty<00:06:08.870> good<00:06:09.080> actually<00:06:09.260> went<00:06:09.740> back<00:06:09.860> to<00:06:10.010> just

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
pretty good actually went back to just

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.100 
pretty good actually went back to just
about<00:06:10.460> the<00:06:10.700> length<00:06:10.940> that<00:06:11.120> it<00:06:11.240> was<00:06:11.390> before<00:06:11.840> in

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
about the length that it was before in

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:22.129 
about the length that it was before in
pretty<00:06:12.890> quick<00:06:13.190> fashion

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.559 

that's<00:06:22.590> nice<00:06:22.800> and<00:06:23.009> small<00:06:23.210> let's<00:06:24.210> see<00:06:24.330> if<00:06:24.449> it'll

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
that's nice and small let's see if it'll

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.810 
that's nice and small let's see if it'll
fit<00:06:24.810> on<00:06:24.840> the<00:06:25.020> facet

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
what do you know it really works well

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.460 
what do you know it really works well
I've<00:06:35.090> taken<00:06:35.300> the<00:06:35.449> hose<00:06:35.599> off<00:06:35.810> the<00:06:36.020> faucet<00:06:36.440> and

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
I've taken the hose off the faucet and

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.930

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
leave it on the faucet but really unless

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.649 
leave it on the faucet but really unless
it's<00:06:43.220> wintertime<00:06:43.580> when<00:06:43.970> you<00:06:44.060> do<00:06:44.240> take<00:06:44.539> the

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659 
it's wintertime when you do take the

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:46.390 
it's wintertime when you do take the

from<00:06:46.580> getting<00:06:46.729> frozen<00:06:47.030> pipes<00:06:47.479> I<00:06:47.780> would<00:06:48.440> think

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
from getting frozen pipes I would think

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.439 
from getting frozen pipes I would think
most<00:06:48.830> people<00:06:49.250> would<00:06:49.400> intend<00:06:49.879> to<00:06:50.060> just<00:06:50.240> leave

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
most people would intend to just leave

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.420 
most people would intend to just leave
this<00:06:50.629> out<00:06:50.810> there<00:06:51.020> all<00:06:51.110> the<00:06:51.199> time<00:06:51.379> if<00:06:51.560> you<00:06:51.710> water

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
this out there all the time if you water

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.670 
this out there all the time if you water
regularly<00:06:53.000> or<00:06:53.270> need<00:06:53.479> the<00:06:53.629> hose<00:06:53.810> out<00:06:54.229> front<00:06:54.530> at

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
regularly or need the hose out front at

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.779 
regularly or need the hose out front at
least<00:06:54.830> once<00:06:55.039> a<00:06:55.159> week<00:06:55.280> you're<00:06:55.460> probably<00:06:55.610> on

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
least once a week you're probably on

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:58.689 
least once a week you're probably on
leave<00:06:55.940> it<00:06:56.060> up<00:06:56.180> top<00:06:56.330> but<00:06:57.139> to<00:06:57.409> preserve<00:06:58.009> the<00:06:58.430> life

00:06:58.689 --> 00:06:58.699 
leave it up top but to preserve the life

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:00.100 
leave it up top but to preserve the life
of<00:06:59.000> your<00:06:59.150> product<00:06:59.389> you're<00:06:59.690> supposed<00:07:00.020> to

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
of your product you're supposed to

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.839 
of your product you're supposed to
disconnect<00:07:00.590> it<00:07:00.770> when<00:07:00.830> you<00:07:01.220> don't<00:07:01.340> use<00:07:01.580> it<00:07:01.729> and

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:01.849 
disconnect it when you don't use it and

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:03.790 
disconnect it when you don't use it and
bring<00:07:01.970> it<00:07:02.000> in<00:07:02.240> let<00:07:02.750> it<00:07:02.840> dry<00:07:03.050> out<00:07:03.080> I<00:07:03.289> suppose

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
bring it in let it dry out I suppose

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.649 
bring it in let it dry out I suppose
that<00:07:03.979> probably<00:07:04.250> would<00:07:04.430> help<00:07:04.610> so<00:07:05.090> I<00:07:05.120> really

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:05.659 
that probably would help so I really

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.920 
that probably would help so I really
can't<00:07:05.900> tell<00:07:06.020> you<00:07:06.080> anything<00:07:06.500> about<00:07:06.620> it<00:07:07.099> some

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:17.569 
mildew whether it will get kinks in it

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:20.620 
mildew whether it will get kinks in it
that's<00:07:18.139> supposed<00:07:18.650> to<00:07:18.800> be<00:07:19.130> kink<00:07:19.699> resistant<00:07:20.300> but

that's supposed to be kink resistant but
I<00:07:20.690> can<00:07:20.930> tell<00:07:21.169> you<00:07:21.319> that<00:07:21.620> the<00:07:21.919> first<00:07:22.280> impression
