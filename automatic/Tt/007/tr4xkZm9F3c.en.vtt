the<00:01:20.950> scene<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:22.210> now<00:01:22.390> let's<00:01:22.539> get<00:01:22.690> into<00:01:22.899> what

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
the scene and now let's get into what

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.490 
the scene and now let's get into what
all<00:01:23.440> comes<00:01:23.830> in<00:01:24.009> then<00:01:24.159> you<00:01:24.310> have<00:01:24.520> your<00:01:25.500> power

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
all comes in then you have your power

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.999 
all comes in then you have your power
cord<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.210> that's<00:01:28.630> about<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:29.200> there<00:01:29.619> should<00:01:29.860> be

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
cord and that's about it there should be

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
maybe not and as you can see as I take

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.330 
maybe not and as you can see as I take
this<00:01:36.310> out<00:01:36.550> that<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.409> not<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.890> modular

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
this out that this is not a modular

let's go ahead and get these cables
undone<00:02:42.749> when<00:02:43.749> we<00:02:43.870> do<00:02:44.049> that

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
undone when we do that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.820 
undone when we do that
can<00:02:46.280> see<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:48.170> only<00:02:48.440> one<00:02:48.680> that's<00:02:50.440> wrapped<00:02:51.440> here

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
can see the only one that's wrapped here

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.729 
can see the only one that's wrapped here
is<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.640> actual<00:02:53.620> motherboard<00:02:54.620> connector
