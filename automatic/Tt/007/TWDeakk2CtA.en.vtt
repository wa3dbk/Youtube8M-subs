00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
Irish population and we did it from the

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.619 
Irish population and we did it from the
beginning<00:00:36.520> we<00:00:36.610> applied<00:00:36.879> our<00:00:36.910> first<00:00:37.360> face

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
beginning we applied our first face

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.570 
beginning we applied our first face
basically<00:00:38.290> which<00:00:38.500> is<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.710> molding<00:00:39.070> face<00:00:39.250> with

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
basically which is the molding face with

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.670 
basically which is the molding face with
molds<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.510> hair<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:40.930> kind<00:00:41.080> of<00:00:41.140> what<00:00:41.290> way<00:00:41.410> that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
molds the hair to kind of what way that

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.860 
molds the hair to kind of what way that
the<00:00:42.550> finished<00:00:42.850> moisture<00:00:43.239> that<00:00:43.360> you<00:00:43.420> want<00:00:43.690> on

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
the finished moisture that you want on

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.390 
the finished moisture that you want on
it<00:00:43.900> so<00:00:44.379> tell<00:00:44.530> us<00:00:44.559> what<00:00:44.830> are<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:45.100> key

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
it so tell us what are the key

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.060 
it so tell us what are the key
ingredients<00:00:45.760> for<00:00:46.479> this<00:00:46.870> formula<00:00:47.350> okay<00:00:48.010> so

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
ingredients for this formula okay so

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.619 
ingredients for this formula okay so
basically<00:00:48.370> it's<00:00:48.729> been<00:00:48.850> proven<00:00:49.089> by<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.360> skin

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
basically it's been proven by the skin

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.160 
basically it's been proven by the skin
cosmetics<00:00:49.870> -<00:00:50.760> carrier<00:00:51.760> collagen<00:00:52.299> glycolic

acid<00:00:53.589> and<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:54.610> organic<00:00:55.059> possible<00:00:55.720> are<00:00:56.229> all

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
acid and the organic possible are all

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.530 
acid and the organic possible are all
within<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.250> formula<00:00:57.549> that<00:00:57.879> creates<00:00:58.239> the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
within the formula that creates the

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.899 
within the formula that creates the
alpha<00:00:59.320> 5<00:00:59.500> signature<00:00:59.949> blow-dry<00:01:00.280> here<00:01:00.489> today

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.340 

Flatirons<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:06.119> vital<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.600> locking<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.259> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
Flatirons are vital for locking in the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.709 
Flatirons are vital for locking in the
formula<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.920> create<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.490> sleek<00:01:08.909> look<00:01:09.210> but

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:09.719 
formula to create a sleek look but

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.749 
formula to create a sleek look but
alternatively<00:01:10.289> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.649> go<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:11.009> a<00:01:11.039> more<00:01:11.369> wavy

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
alternatively you can go for a more wavy

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.660 
alternatively you can go for a more wavy
finish<00:01:12.329> so<00:01:12.869> we've<00:01:13.140> kind<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.469> worked<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
finish so we've kind of worked with the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.039 
finish so we've kind of worked with the
treatment<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:15.899> nice

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
treatment to get at that really nice

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.050 
treatment to get at that really nice
smooth<00:01:16.380> glossy<00:01:16.649> hair<00:01:17.039> and<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.819> simply

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
smooth glossy hair and then just simply

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.190 
smooth glossy hair and then just simply
put<00:01:18.240> away<00:01:18.420> through<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.750> ends<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
put away through the ends of it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
put away through the ends of it
afterwards<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.679> it's<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.100> important<00:01:20.609> as<00:01:20.700> well

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
afterwards so it's all important as well

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.039 
afterwards so it's all important as well
for<00:01:21.000> people<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.569> they're<00:01:21.719> gonna<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
for people is that they're gonna get a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.899 
for people is that they're gonna get a
little<00:01:22.289> bit<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.469> mileage<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
little bit of mileage out of the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.639 
little bit of mileage out of the
blow-dry<00:01:24.329> because<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.289> people<00:01:25.560> come

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
blow-dry because you know people come

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.139 
blow-dry because you know people come
into<00:01:25.799> salons<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.459> then<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.670> sleep<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.000> their

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
into salons and then they sleep in their

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.699 
into salons and then they sleep in their
hair<00:01:27.329> and<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> next<00:01:27.810> day<00:01:27.929> it's<00:01:28.049> all<00:01:28.170> ruined

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
hair and the next day it's all ruined

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:31.219 
hair and the next day it's all ruined
but<00:01:29.240> hopefully<00:01:30.240> anyway<00:01:30.450> with<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.780> blow-dry

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
but hopefully anyway with this blow-dry

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.959 
but hopefully anyway with this blow-dry
you're<00:01:31.409> gonna<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.709> more<00:01:31.950> time<00:01:32.219> oh<00:01:32.429> absolutely

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
you're gonna get more time oh absolutely

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.029 
you're gonna get more time oh absolutely
like<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.750> said<00:01:33.959> from<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> first<00:01:34.319> treatment<00:01:34.799> you

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
like I said from the first treatment you

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.709 
like I said from the first treatment you
can<00:01:35.219> get<00:01:35.340> anything<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:35.880> four<00:01:36.209> to<00:01:36.240> six<00:01:36.509> weeks

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
can get anything from four to six weeks

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.690 
can get anything from four to six weeks
out<00:01:36.899> of<00:01:36.929> it<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.860> by<00:01:37.979> repeating<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
out of it and then by repeating the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.029 
out of it and then by repeating the
treatment<00:01:39.149> we<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.450> get<00:01:39.750> 12<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.229> 16<00:01:40.590> weeks<00:01:40.679> out

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
treatment we can get 12 to 16 weeks out

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.190 
treatment we can get 12 to 16 weeks out
of<00:01:41.069> it<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.239> be<00:01:42.329> done<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.599> often<00:01:42.929> as<00:01:43.079> you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
of it so it can be done as often as you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.229 
of it so it can be done as often as you
