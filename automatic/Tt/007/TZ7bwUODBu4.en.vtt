of birds of prey with several unique
adaptations<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.410> make<00:00:25.529> them<00:00:25.769> extremely

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
adaptations to make them extremely

adaptations to make them extremely
successful<00:00:26.789> hunters<00:00:27.890> most<00:00:28.890> species<00:00:29.340> are

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
successful hunters most species are

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.070 
successful hunters most species are
nocturnal<00:00:30.000> which<00:00:30.420> means<00:00:30.480> they're<00:00:30.840> gonna<00:00:30.960> be

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
nocturnal which means they're gonna be

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.560 
nocturnal which means they're gonna be
mostly<00:00:31.529> active<00:00:31.679> at<00:00:31.920> night<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.360> this<00:00:33.360> makes

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
mostly active at night and this makes

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.709 
mostly active at night and this makes
them<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> find<00:00:34.320> their<00:00:34.500> prey<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.860> dark

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
them have to find their prey in the dark

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.110 
them have to find their prey in the dark
to<00:00:36.719> do<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.050> they<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.920> incredible<00:00:38.790> vision

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
to do this they have incredible vision

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.810 
to do this they have incredible vision
they<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.020> see<00:00:40.260> into<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.530> UV<00:00:40.800> spectrum<00:00:41.399> which

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
they can see into the UV spectrum which

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.779 
they can see into the UV spectrum which
is<00:00:41.850> what<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.210> can't<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:43.129> if<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.280> were<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> hold<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
is what we can't do if I were to hold a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.970 
is what we can't do if I were to hold a
black<00:00:45.030> light<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> Tessa<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.620> would<00:00:46.739> see

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
black light up to Tessa you would see

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.160 
black light up to Tessa you would see
amazing<00:00:47.280> coloration<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.270> other<00:00:48.629> owls<00:00:48.899> can

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
amazing coloration that other owls can

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.970 
amazing coloration that other owls can
see<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.309> can't<00:00:51.379> in<00:00:52.379> addition<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.860> this

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
see that we can't in addition to this

her eyes are actually fixed into their

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.930 
her eyes are actually fixed into their
sockets<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.309> can't<00:00:56.550> move<00:00:56.699> their

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
sockets so they can't move their

sockets so they can't move their
eyeballs<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.899> actually<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.500> move

their head in the direction they want to
look<00:01:00.660> their<00:01:01.820> hearing<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:03.629> helps

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
look their hearing is what really helps

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.320 
look their hearing is what really helps
them<00:01:04.019> find<00:01:04.199> their<00:01:04.379> prey<00:01:04.700> around<00:01:05.700> her<00:01:05.850> face<00:01:06.060> is

them find their prey around her face is
a<00:01:06.360> facial<00:01:06.750> disc<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.740> outline<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.280> see

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
a facial disc that outline you can see

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.890 
a facial disc that outline you can see
this<00:01:10.490> combined<00:01:11.490> with<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.880> fleshy<00:01:12.330> protrusion

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
this combined with the fleshy protrusion

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.469 
this combined with the fleshy protrusion
above<00:01:13.170> her<00:01:13.290> beak<00:01:13.500> helped<00:01:14.310> funnel<00:01:14.580> sound<00:01:14.970> into

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
above her beak helped funnel sound into

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.749 
above her beak helped funnel sound into
her<00:01:15.630> ears<00:01:16.130> now<00:01:17.130> her<00:01:17.280> ears<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.670> actually

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
her ears now her ears are actually

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.940 
her ears now her ears are actually
asymmetrical<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:19.380> means<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.770> they<00:01:19.920> are

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
asymmetrical which means that they are

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.140 
asymmetrical which means that they are
not<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> same<00:01:20.880> side<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.360> ours<00:01:21.860> but

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
not on the same side like ours but

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
not on the same side like ours but
they're<00:01:24.150> actually<00:01:24.770> at<00:01:25.770> different<00:01:26.159> locations

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
they're actually at different locations

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.880 
they're actually at different locations
one<00:01:27.060> will<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:28.500> will<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.710> down

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
one will be up here and one will be down

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.539 
one will be up here and one will be down
here<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.630> she'll<00:01:30.630> Bob<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> head<00:01:31.140> around<00:01:31.549> trying

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
here and she'll Bob a head around trying

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.179 
here and she'll Bob a head around trying
to<00:01:32.640> pinpoint<00:01:32.850> exactly<00:01:33.150> where<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.600> sound<00:01:33.900> is

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
to pinpoint exactly where the sound is

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.969 
to pinpoint exactly where the sound is
called<00:01:35.189> triangulation<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:39.560> they<00:01:40.560> also<00:01:40.710> have

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
called triangulation and they also have

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.370 
called triangulation and they also have
several<00:01:41.700> morphological<00:01:42.450> features<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:43.170> help

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
several morphological features that help

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.719 
several morphological features that help
them<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.799> such<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.070> successful<00:01:44.340> hunters

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
them to be such a successful hunters

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.990 
them to be such a successful hunters
besides<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> hearing<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> vision<00:01:47.000> if

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
besides the hearing and the vision if

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.600 
besides the hearing and the vision if
you<00:01:48.149> look<00:01:48.299> closely<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.720> their<00:01:48.869> wings<00:01:49.610> they're

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you look closely at their wings they're

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.340 
you look closely at their wings they're
very<00:01:50.820> soft<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.890> they<00:01:52.890> actually<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:54.350> little

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
very soft and they actually have little

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.719 
very soft and they actually have little
pieces<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> feather<00:01:56.100> let's<00:01:56.340> stick<00:01:56.549> out

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
pieces of the feather let's stick out

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.090 
pieces of the feather let's stick out
then<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.750> reduces<00:01:58.229> turbulence<00:01:58.829> when

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
then this reduces turbulence when

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.069 
then this reduces turbulence when
they're<00:01:59.219> flying<00:01:59.509> this<00:02:00.509> makes<00:02:00.750> them<00:02:00.930> almost

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
they're flying this makes them almost

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.969 
they're flying this makes them almost
silent<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:02.460> flight<00:02:03.590> unlike<00:02:04.590> other<00:02:04.770> birds

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
silent in flight unlike other birds

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
silent in flight unlike other birds
where<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.280> could<00:02:05.399> hear<00:02:05.579> them<00:02:05.729> flapping<00:02:06.180> owls

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
where you could hear them flapping owls

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.070 
where you could hear them flapping owls
are<00:02:07.380> dead<00:02:08.220> quiet<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.970> prey<00:02:09.599> usually<00:02:09.720> don't

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
are dead quiet and prey usually don't
