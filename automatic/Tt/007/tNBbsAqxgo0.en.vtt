00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and then this as a highlight I tried

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.399 
and then this as a highlight I tried
mixing<00:01:24.000> them<00:01:24.270> together<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.960> first<00:01:25.170> time

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
mixing them together like the first time

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.440 
mixing them together like the first time
and<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.130> highlight<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.210> gold

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and then it the highlight with the gold

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.750 
and then it the highlight with the gold
really<00:01:27.780> didn't<00:01:28.110> show<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.549> really

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
really didn't show up and I was really

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.310 
really didn't show up and I was really
upset<00:01:29.880> about<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.330> and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:30.690> I<00:01:30.780> realized

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
upset about that and then I realized

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960 
upset about that and then I realized
that<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.560> could<00:01:31.799> use<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> highlight<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.940> I

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that I could use this to highlight so I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.539 
that I could use this to highlight so I
decided<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.450> use<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.020> I'd<00:01:34.170> stay<00:01:34.549> so

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
decided to use it like that I'd stay so

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:46.680 
decided to use it like that I'd stay so
this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.979> really<00:01:37.979> pretty
