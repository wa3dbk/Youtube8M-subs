00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.790
 public health care 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.910
 right of all Brazilians 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.119
 but we follow the ordeal that many people go through 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.749
 for breast 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:12.579
 this elect guaranteed 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:18.189
 are long trips hours of waiting every kind of difficulty 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.960
 the problem is not new, it is already known that specialized medical care 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.199
 practically nonexistent outside the major centers 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.100
 What's new is that this new problem we're going to São Paulo talk to a 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.899
 tie and mariana often 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.520
 serious patients have to travel hundreds of kilometers in search of 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:37.330
 treatment 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.650
 patients who are already debilitated renata who just completed here are 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.069
 very tired 

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:47.059
 to stay at dawn still in this city says to look for care 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.999
 is a problem that is repeated all over the country and that makes it even more 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.389
 difficult the health treatment that is already enough suffering 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.900
 before the night would pass, the queue was already forming in the doorway of many 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.820
 great brazilian cities 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.480
 the names of ambulances buses and vans 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.900
 reveal the variety of origin 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.170
 in search of a cure chance many people faced hours of travel every time 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.960
 what the profile 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.120
 I'll make a full exam appear 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.570
 I travel 83 billion 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.400
 I have done is eight times someone 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.520
 his nickname 79 years 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.000
 I leave caxambu in minas gerais' sometime in the morning 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.270
 will be answered in são paulo some 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.800
 a wait too long for those who have branding step in the heart is good to know 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.850
 she has lancet doctor 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.230
 for this work in a service team 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.630
 do not have to wait standing in the square 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.750
 next to the evil enough to face the day away from home 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.520
 the commendation is an impromptu snack even standing 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.100
 It is more tiring to my mother, who already has 1 81m for me and would use a child 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.009
 of 6 years were 1 200 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.960
 road moments the work done by the student 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.330
 in search of treatment for the girl today she will do chemotherapy one 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.679
 not tiring like that 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.069
 - rn does not have 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.850
 No way for the sixth season out of hospital 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.239
 does not have many resources 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.239
 lack of structure for transplants outside large cities 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.870
 overloads hospitals that do this type of surgery 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:31.079
 the even bigger grass for those who have already faced a painful queue 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.319
 Divine mistress had to leave Brasilia to do a liver transplant in 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.559
 fortress 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.749
 The serious thing is that we do not try to plant our crops. 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:43.619
 for example in araraquara as incredible as it seems to bring to the capital 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.519
 this was you do not have 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.509
 still recovering from the bone marrow transplant he did in Belo horizonte 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.989
 and still remembers the suffering he faced every time he had to 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.189
 to travel almost 200 km to take patient striker Savio 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:04.959
 and still have to vote to return Dona Maria Cecilia is still waiting for a 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.730
 every month you have to take the already tight budget 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.999
 five hundred reais for a bus trip in which round trip in the river 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:17.339
 in the hospital of the clinics in são paulo she did not get a place in the change that 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.279
 the city hall used to transport the patients 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.789
 very tired very exhausted since March 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:25.809
 it's impossible 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:29.629
 who has come from so far to have to have courage and exposure 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.480
 to face the treatment and also 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.560
 patience 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.879
 are several hours on the road and then more waiting time 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.270
 to get care 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.350
 here are people who come and go at all times I only go central institutes of the 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.400
 hospital of the clinics in são paulo are 85 thousand consultations per month 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:48.639
 twelve thousand people come from other states and other cities in the region 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.539
 when it rains the suffering of these people is aggravated 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:55.519
 and not a few are already trapped in congestion 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.229
 caused by floods when I returned was 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:01.750
 raining all flooded 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.980
 I worked 20 6 hours today said today in the city 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.469
 I leave the government and arrive at all times. 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.479
 and anyone who faces hours on the road is still exposed to another request 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:16.389
 At the beginning of the month six patients from the interior of são paulo died 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.639
 when they were transported to the city where they undergo hemodialysis. 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.309
 the problem that is repeated in every country is caused by the disease 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:29.169
 unequal dismissal of doctors and hospitals in são paulo for example 60% 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.229
 of physicians are concentrated where 40% of the population lives 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.889
 big and attractive 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.599
 the doctor fixing physician 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.809
 they are real in infrastructure for some medical performance 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:48.069
 the second element undoubtedly some hammer action 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.139
 so it is a migration of doctors to large centers 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.879
 hospital 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.219
 and also to places where there is economic power capable of remunerating the 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:58.520
 medical work 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.440
 what is the problem is the same work 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.880
 of these physicians in São Paulo are almost four physicians per group of 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.080
 thousand inhabitants 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.680
 and it is our a sco that is a big city benzema são paulo this rate falls 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.139
 years of one doctor for each group of one thousand inhabitants and 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.870
 state of são paulo renata is still a place with one of those who has 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.449
 the country's best practices aside from doctors is considered one of the most 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.640
 world high filming in other states marina maybe the obligatoriedad 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.559
 of doctors trained by the network 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:34.569
 perhaps for a given time at least aquarium provide services outside 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.479
 of the capitals force
