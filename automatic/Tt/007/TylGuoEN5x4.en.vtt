00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:03.010
 in 1814 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.310
 Once the war of independence is over, Goya paints this triumph 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.409
 on request from the region 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.929
 the painter presents the culmination of the episode that occurred the previous day 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.699
 when the Madrilenians revolt against the French troops they occupied 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:19.650
 the capital 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.050
 now we see what are the consequences of that fierce 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.669
 resistance 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.300
 the way of composing the scene certain characteristics of the two 

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:32.750
 protagonist groups on the one hand those executed offering their face to the 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.370
 spectator and the group of the executioners vulgar faces frightened and 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.720
 desperate in a gallery of portraits of fear that goya offers us 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.700
 each one is gathered in a different position according to their attitude towards the 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.010
 death 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.630
 who covers his face because he can not stand it or who opens his arms in 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.320
 cross offering his chest to the bullets 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.100
 this character in particular is a terribly dramatic element put 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.610
 who looks directly at the soldiers and his white shirt attracts the spotlight of 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.890
 the lamp that stands beside him as a wake-up call to death that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.740
 approaches 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.740
 At his feet 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 the bodies of those executed previously fall into disarray 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.859
 behind the other sentenced await their turn to be shot 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.079
 the other group parallel to the previous 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.119
 it is made up of the French soldiers who are going to execute the patriots 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.800
 the soldiers have their backs to the viewer who can not see their faces 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.170
 since they do not matter 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.420
 they are seeing anonymous tubes executing an order like hulu that in which each machine 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.290
 of kill 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.380
 all the characters are in an undefined night outside but that 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.240
 historically it is known was the mountain of prince pÃ­o where according to the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.540
 chronicles was passed by arms to the insurgents of the previous day 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.299
 the brushstroke used by the teacher that is absolutely loose 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.909
 independent of the drawing which facilitates the creation of a gloomy atmosphere 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.739
 through the lights 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.119
 colors and fumes 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:15.589
 the faces enjoy tremendous is perceived anticipating goya at 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:19.499
 Expressionism that characterizes a pictorial stage of the 20th century
