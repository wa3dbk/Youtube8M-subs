00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
most cases anyway you would

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.179 
most cases anyway you would
want<00:02:13.629> to<00:02:13.689> have<00:02:13.870> some<00:02:13.900> advice<00:02:14.439> before<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:15.010> went

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
want to have some advice before you went

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.190 
want to have some advice before you went
into<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.489> step<00:02:15.849> and<00:02:16.269> what's<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.569> benefit<00:02:17.019> of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
into that step and what's the benefit of

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.589 
into that step and what's the benefit of
voluntary<00:02:17.799> disclosure<00:02:18.340> well<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.450> when

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
voluntary disclosure well I think when

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.000 
voluntary disclosure well I think when
you're<00:02:19.719> alive<00:02:20.019> it<00:02:20.379> makes<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.709> lot<00:02:20.859> of<00:02:20.890> sense

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
you're alive it makes a lot of sense

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.740 
you're alive it makes a lot of sense
because<00:02:21.549> you<00:02:21.670> want<00:02:21.879> to<00:02:21.969> stay<00:02:22.150> current<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.629> you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
because you want to stay current and you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.929 
because you want to stay current and you
also<00:02:22.930> want<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.379> say<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.159> tax<00:02:24.400> authority

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
also want to say to the tax authority

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.399
