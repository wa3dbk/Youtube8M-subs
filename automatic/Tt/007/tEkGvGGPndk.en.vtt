 you will live on palacio, however, what is not 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.980
 very well known to have a little something special 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.019
 this series ae New Zealand has been 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.420
 written and directed by a woman of 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.099
 intent also the card to rest of and the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.570
 in short, garzelli tells the story 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.040
 story of robin and that goes in new 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.210
 sick woman specialized in child abuse 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.030
 He is a former detective and stand there 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.950
 a case in which a 12-year-old girl is 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.989
 pregnant attempted suicide e 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.980
 they want to understand who the father is 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.809
 victim of abuse 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.160
 You make a silent scene as if it were below 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.930
 shock and disappears 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.460
 we are in a small community at all 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.050
 they have something to hide a bit like 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.430
 in twin peaks and it seems that everyone 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.860
 want to liquidate this business of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.780
 a missing child who was pregnant only 12 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.730
 years as if it were nothing stuff then 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.379
 robin will literally collide 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.579
 against the community and against it 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.989
 police District 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.760
 I thought as if it could 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.990
 please because half of the new 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.490
 of the year so there is need instead of 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.350
 landscapes of the lord of the rings 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.060
 you might also like this series is 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.250
 what nature so strong and lived mine 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.590
 characters for a way to key there for 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.390
 medicare or just to fight 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.740
 their against nature 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.119
 all this had contrasted with the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.369
 small town where everyone is 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.740
 they all know and I say no, that's one 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.840
 good person mainly great 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.720
 da bra is also an English co-production 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.400
 and US and Australian is one thing 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.189
 practically the company is very strange 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.579
 Australian to Australian broadcasting 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.229
 corporation 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.750
 when I learned that for the role 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.400
 the lead actress had been 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.350
 engaged elizabeth moved with 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.780
 an American actress from the era 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.790
 behind and act all the funds because not 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.259
 was an Australian actress is true as well 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.909
 that elizabeth but if it hadn't been there 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.619
 first choice practically before gen 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.810
 change wants to vote for the role of 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.210
 protagonist to derna pasching that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.350
 on the blog already gave work with her 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.090
 so to give it to him only that the try 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.979
 about and therefore had to find one 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.080
 substitute they did indeed was 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.820
 New Zealand Canadian our believe that 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.160
 he had understood this serious that was 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.680
 projected at the sundance film festival for 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.569
 it was projected as seven episodes 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.459
 instead the northern went not only 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.080
 six episodes do not feel you are not 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.000
 redemption to say which one they face and why 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.170
 boh I think in New Zealand projects 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.390
 always winks at 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.760
 supernatural though a direction 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.920
 effective in which valid the story however 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.560
 there is always this mystery that could 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.630
 not be something material of 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.100
 this almost maybe the most famous faces 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.470
 evening against the detectives because second 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.540
 it is very interesting to me to contrast them 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.290
 one to the other and above all to see 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.170
 as a female director of the director 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.940
 a female protagonist can change 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.019
 very much what actually looks like a 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.430
 very similar product 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.170
 you probably have already seen more 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.610
 selective in case it were not so 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.290
 I don't spoil myself 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.959
 otherwise martin fluent active there is one thing 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.090
 very much a very romance friendship from 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.340
 this part we have an actress one 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.170
 solo detective who works in a case 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.090
 the machine guns that there are sex scenes there 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.519
 they make even more monster than there are nudes 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.980
 however, female nudes are shown in two 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.560
 extremely different forms for example 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.690
 let's take the sex scenes of this one 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.340
 beautiful girl completely rutelli 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.500
 has yet seen that they have sex at 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.299
 maximum we see a player seat though 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.730
 the thing cascading once every 3 thousand 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.070
 read years that make you laugh the most are 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.470
 those in which the woman is completely 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.150
 nude and the actor who instead has 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.609
 fully dressed yet that physical 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.739
 once born and unbuttoned only from the 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.120
 pants fight have sex so a 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.709
 it makes me laugh because you imagine the 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.840
 contrary type a man completely 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.510
 naked is a woman when the pants a 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.519
 which fanning and I know a hole in the horse 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.959
 and for this the idea is a ridiculous barrel 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.000
 then you will understand that this 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.459
 representation of naked bodies of the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.420
 Sex scenes of eroticism is not 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.459
 neutral 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.800
 I don't know, let's say that there is the offensive 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.860
 simply saying that it is not a rare one 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.870
 imagine even if it is not the explicit idea 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.720
 the director etcetera etcetera lead 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.820
 forward a certain idea whether he wants or not the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.100
 director prove it and in my opinion 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.140
 compare negotiation top of the her that 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.110
 it's perfect because in both we have a 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.510
 case to be solved by superiors who 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.959
 they oppose these investigations but they are there 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.830
 of the detectives who are extremely 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.200
 convinced of being able to find the network 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.080
 truth is that they have excellent reasons 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.200
 to make it the point is not obvious you see 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.000
 see it is unfair that is not the point 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.590
 because here also under portal that there 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.540
 there are so many nude scenes there 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.360
 lots of choice sex scene system 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.250
 also perhaps much stronger we say e 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.770
 so body is something to center the 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.110
 pregnancy referred to the passage of the body 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.240
 of robin or dna of another 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.580
 character can center is not the nude 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.080
 different but it is how it is represented e 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.090
 how it is inserted inside the 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.650
 narration as the nude of a body 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.240
 it can be functional and therefore it is 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.890
 for both of them both 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.750
 they have sex are useless there are 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.610
 there is a lot of female naturism 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.650
 or naked women so they go 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.040
 quiet for nature and so on 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.500
 etc 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.900
 but this nude was not made there 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.940
 we don't see the actress undressing and doing 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.460
 the beauty of trying to seduce the 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.080
 male character but do it alone 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.330
 this hour tourism has expressed how 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.680
 symbol of personal freedom on the part of 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.320
 these women involved in these 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.790
 characters and in harmony with nature 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.800
 moreover, here there is a very large one 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.600
 difference is also that it was the 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.510
 feminine we see are not those 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.220
 typically erotic or typically that 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.040
 we see in the movies here we see naked of 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.320
 50-year-old woman we see albino girls 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.910
 of bodies that are not typical 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.790
 let's say they are categories that 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.170
 area come 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.060
 for me to ignore the TV series 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.920
 traditional to a little like those photographers 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.840
 poracci that are not real photographers 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.160
 they have a reflex and shooting different 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.830
 give up some cunt talking about 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.350
 photos that go to contact only girls 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.630
 very nice to do nudes etc. 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.730
 etc. but not to calculate what I know 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.640
 that guys that don't fit into that 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.870
 canonical beauty older girls 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.450
 30 years old women or people with a body 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.980
 particular the use and psychological of here and 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.500
 from there and then a photographer never another 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.930
 male a photographer who never makes one 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.060
 very fleshy girl a bit from Capri but 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.560
 she is a girl with a disability but there is one 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.540
 there are so many girls with disabilities 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.190
 extremely beautiful so you will understand that 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.200
 if yes but not just a certain type of body 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.630
 and a certain kind of nude message 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.000
 in short, it is not very clear 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.860
 that naked and functional will leave but is that 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.840
 naked or but great power over the 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.610
 scene as you see there are many 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.100
 sex scenes inside the fingers what 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.200
 the lake however are very particular that 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.300
 we are not used to managing second 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.850
 me because they are less typical we see them 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.590
 less often and therefore they affect us a lot 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.030
 more for example a carla scene 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.190
 competes impressed a lot 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.600
 robin who is the detective as i have you 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.910
 said protagonist of this series that 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.890
 he goes in the beard in the bathroom he washes his hands sta 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.110
 to exit turns to the door and there 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.120
 a boy a man he bars the 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.490
 door and are about to kiss 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.560
 in short, we understand that there is something between 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.930
 of them they are almost to kiss you when 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.710
 he slips down is practically the stage 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.510
 national 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.340
 he sees absolutely nothing in 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.780
 detail for these scenes that is really 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.610
 hit a lot because it's a lot 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.280
 difficult to see things like that 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.770
 within a series of good or 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.090
 even for a film we are much more inclined 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.640
 to see what I know about the girl who does 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.160
 knock it down and make it personal to the guy 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.889
 for various reasons, however, something of the 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.180
 gender 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.860
 much rarer than we see it then 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.620
 for this reason in my opinion has a 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.960
 much stronger potential to move 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.180
 the public what you are self-contained 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.189
 though sincerely though they have 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.259
 assured that there will be no follow-up 

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:35.969
 to me, however, he has not convinced many 

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:38.490
 aspects that the final was a bit done 

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:41.189
 on the 4th side the goal character is 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:44.039
 very much jj character friend too 

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:46.110
 instead we had many many expectations 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:48.270
 in his character this mother 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.129
 matriarch first genya also the way 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.779
 of the paradise community I am not 

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:53.310
 succeeded well is classified therefore me 

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:55.199
 left a little bitter taste in the mouth below 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.969
 some questions for now come back questions 

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:59.340
 true state I wanted to talk about it even if 

00:07:56.969 --> 00:08:01.050
 you polibio for christ let me know 

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:04.550
 they are to have introduced a series 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.550
