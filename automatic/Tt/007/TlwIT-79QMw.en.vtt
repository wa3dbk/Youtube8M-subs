it's<00:00:13.030> very<00:00:13.210> impressed<00:00:13.690> with<00:00:13.870> the<00:00:14.020> the<00:00:14.050> 800<00:00:14.980> and

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.130 
it's very impressed with the the 800 and

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.740 
it's very impressed with the the 800 and
the<00:00:15.250> 1000<00:00:15.820> machine<00:00:16.090> they<00:00:16.299> had<00:00:16.480> what<00:00:16.660> I

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
the 1000 machine they had what I

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.359 
the 1000 machine they had what I
consider<00:00:17.110> to<00:00:17.170> be<00:00:17.290> the<00:00:17.410> most<00:00:17.529> significant

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
consider to be the most significant

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.760 
consider to be the most significant
capability<00:00:19.029> which<00:00:19.450> was<00:00:19.690> the<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:20.410> clear

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
capability which was the the clear

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.440 
capability which was the the clear
coating<00:00:21.250> that<00:00:21.400> they<00:00:21.550> put<00:00:21.760> down<00:00:21.790> on<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.270> sheet

coating that they put down on the sheet

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.350 
coating that they put down on the sheet
I<00:00:22.720> consider<00:00:23.470> that<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.710> be<00:00:24.150> amazing<00:00:25.150> in<00:00:25.330> terms

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
I consider that to be amazing in terms

I consider that to be amazing in terms
of<00:00:25.689> capability<00:00:26.259> for<00:00:26.410> printers<00:00:26.770> that<00:00:27.279> coating

anymore I really don't care about
bit-depth<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.800> only<00:00:42.160> thing<00:00:42.309> I<00:00:42.430> care<00:00:42.700> about<00:00:42.730> is

bit-depth the only thing I care about is

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.700 
bit-depth the only thing I care about is
what<00:00:43.360> you<00:00:43.450> put<00:00:43.600> on<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.750> piece<00:00:43.989> of<00:00:44.110> paper<00:00:44.260> and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
what you put on the piece of paper and

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.889 
what you put on the piece of paper and
what<00:00:45.579> you<00:00:45.670> put<00:00:45.820> on<00:00:45.969> the<00:00:46.090> piece<00:00:46.239> of<00:00:46.269> paper<00:00:46.539> is<00:00:46.870> a

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
what you put on the piece of paper is a

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.319 
what you put on the piece of paper is a
new<00:00:47.109> standard<00:00:47.559> because<00:00:48.399> it's<00:00:48.579> no<00:00:48.760> longer<00:00:48.789> the

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
new standard because it's no longer the

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.029 
new standard because it's no longer the
halftone<00:00:49.750> dot<00:00:49.960> that<00:00:50.230> we're<00:00:50.379> familiar<00:00:50.500> with<00:00:50.769> in

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
halftone dot that we're familiar with in

halftone dot that we're familiar with in
the<00:00:51.129> offset<00:00:51.460> lithographic<00:00:51.699> world<00:00:52.269> so<00:00:53.170> perhaps

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
the offset lithographic world so perhaps

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.200 
the offset lithographic world so perhaps
in<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:53.920> future<00:00:54.039> we<00:00:54.339> have<00:00:54.519> to<00:00:54.640> start<00:00:54.820> thinking

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
in the future we have to start thinking

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.239 
in the future we have to start thinking
of<00:00:55.390> digital<00:00:56.019> quality<00:00:56.260> as<00:00:56.530> being<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.829> standard

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
of digital quality as being the standard

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.099 
of digital quality as being the standard
and<00:00:57.399> offset<00:00:58.149> now<00:00:58.300> talking<00:00:58.570> about<00:00:58.690> how<00:00:58.960> it

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
and offset now talking about how it

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.259 
and offset now talking about how it
matches<00:00:59.399> what<00:01:00.399> set<00:01:00.579> lithography<00:01:01.059> is<00:01:01.149> now

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
matches what set lithography is now

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.720 
matches what set lithography is now
going<00:01:01.480> through<00:01:01.629> this<00:01:01.960> this<00:01:02.410> this<00:01:02.739> painstaking

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
going through this this this painstaking

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.000 
going through this this this painstaking
process<00:01:03.940> of<00:01:04.420> trying<00:01:04.900> to<00:01:04.930> defend<00:01:05.320> itself<00:01:05.680> and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
process of trying to defend itself and

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.120 
process of trying to defend itself and
it<00:01:06.310> has<00:01:06.340> niches<00:01:06.909> where<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.360> belongs<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.710> today

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
it has niches where it belongs but today

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.930 
it has niches where it belongs but today
because<00:01:09.370> of<00:01:09.550> short<00:01:09.909> runs<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:11.170> variable<00:01:11.650> data

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
because of short runs and variable data

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.490 
because of short runs and variable data
digital<00:01:12.940> has<00:01:13.060> become<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.510> standard<00:01:13.750> so<00:01:14.470> I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
digital has become the standard so I

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.560 
digital has become the standard so I
think<00:01:14.680> that<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.310> quality<00:01:15.520> that<00:01:15.940> digital<00:01:16.360> is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
think that the quality that digital is

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.960 
think that the quality that digital is
now<00:01:16.930> producing<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.890> really<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.369> standard<00:01:18.640> for

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
now producing is really the standard for

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.770 
now producing is really the standard for
printing<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.329> we're<00:01:19.450> going<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.600> have<00:01:19.720> to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
printing that we're going to have to

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.889 
printing that we're going to have to
deal<00:01:19.930> with<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:21.189> image<00:01:21.970> quality<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:22.659> just

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
deal with the image quality is just

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.389 
deal with the image quality is just
absolutely<00:01:23.680> superb

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
absolutely superb

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.580 
absolutely superb
I'm<00:01:24.729> a<00:01:24.850> big<00:01:25.180> proponent<00:01:25.540> of<00:01:25.780> anything<00:01:26.560> that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
I'm a big proponent of anything that

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.950 
I'm a big proponent of anything that
adds<00:01:26.890> value<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.460> sheet<00:01:27.790> and<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.450> reason<00:01:28.780> for

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
adds value to a sheet and the reason for

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.260 
adds value to a sheet and the reason for
that<00:01:29.079> is<00:01:29.320> that<00:01:29.350> print<00:01:29.860> becomes<00:01:30.520> commoditized

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
that is that print becomes commoditized

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.749 
that is that print becomes commoditized
and<00:01:31.740> coding<00:01:32.740> has<00:01:32.860> become<00:01:33.219> one<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.610> those

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
and coding has become one of those

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.999 
and coding has become one of those
value-added<00:01:34.600> areas<00:01:35.049> where<00:01:35.259> I<00:01:35.290> can<00:01:35.439> increase

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
value-added areas where I can increase

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.249 
value-added areas where I can increase
the<00:01:36.159> value<00:01:36.549> of<00:01:36.759> that<00:01:36.880> sheet<00:01:37.299> and<00:01:37.509> sell<00:01:38.079> it<00:01:38.200> for

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
the value of that sheet and sell it for

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.830 
the value of that sheet and sell it for
more<00:01:38.409> and<00:01:38.590> make<00:01:38.890> more<00:01:39.070> profit<00:01:39.549> so<00:01:40.299> anything

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
more and make more profit so anything

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.600 
more and make more profit so anything
that<00:01:40.960> helps<00:01:41.200> me<00:01:41.289> to<00:01:41.409> do<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.799> is<00:01:42.039> an<00:01:42.280> advantage

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
that helps me to do that is an advantage

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.700 
that helps me to do that is an advantage
