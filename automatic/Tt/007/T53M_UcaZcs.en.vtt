00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
of songs it's good in the in that one if

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.299 
of songs it's good in the in that one if
you<00:00:54.979> look<00:00:55.159> at<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.479> strum<00:00:56.479> pattern<00:00:56.749> diagram

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
you look at the strum pattern diagram

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.219 
you look at the strum pattern diagram
beside<00:00:58.309> me<00:00:58.519> here<00:00:58.789> you'll<00:00:59.269> see<00:00:59.539> there<00:00:59.749> are<00:00:59.780> four

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
beside me here you'll see there are four

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.520 
beside me here you'll see there are four
arrows<00:01:01.039> pointing<00:01:01.519> down<00:01:01.729> and<00:01:02.199> account<00:01:03.199> one<00:01:03.409> two

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
arrows pointing down and account one two

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.730 
arrows pointing down and account one two
three<00:01:03.829> four<00:01:04.100> underneath<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:06.229> idea<00:01:06.530> is

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
three four underneath and the idea is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.980 
three four underneath and the idea is
that<00:01:07.010> each<00:01:07.220> down<00:01:07.670> arrow<00:01:08.000> means<00:01:08.390> a<00:01:08.600> downward

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
that each down arrow means a downward

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.740 
that each down arrow means a downward
strum<00:01:09.969> playing<00:01:10.969> a<00:01:11.060> D<00:01:11.270> chord<00:01:11.540> here<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:13.540> so<00:01:14.540> if

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
strum playing a D chord here and so if

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.459 
strum playing a D chord here and so if
we<00:01:14.899> were<00:01:14.990> counting<00:01:15.439> one<00:01:15.950> two<00:01:16.670> three<00:01:17.479> four<00:01:18.229> we

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
we were counting one two three four we

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:28.540 
we were counting one two three four we
play<00:01:18.820> two

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.690 

pretty<00:01:29.150> simple<00:01:29.360> huh

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.690 

now<00:01:33.170> notice<00:01:34.170> we've<00:01:34.410> now<00:01:34.680> added<00:01:34.920> some<00:01:35.490> dots

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
now notice we've now added some dots

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.900 
now notice we've now added some dots
over<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> arrows<00:01:37.040> but<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.190> dots<00:01:38.370> mean<00:01:38.670> is

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
over the arrows but the dots mean is

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.000 
over the arrows but the dots mean is
they<00:01:39.180> mean<00:01:39.420> staccato<00:01:39.900> don't<00:01:40.380> let<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.830> note

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
they mean staccato don't let the note

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.090 
they mean staccato don't let the note
ring<00:01:41.510> forever<00:01:42.510> but<00:01:42.810> mute<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:43.650> after

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
ring forever but mute it out after

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.190 
ring forever but mute it out after
you've<00:01:44.220> played<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.940> I'm<00:01:45.690> gonna<00:01:45.900> do<00:01:46.170> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you've played it so I'm gonna do that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200 
you've played it so I'm gonna do that
with<00:01:46.530> what's<00:01:46.770> called<00:01:47.010> palm<00:01:47.550> muting<00:01:48.030> by

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
with what's called palm muting by

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.320 
with what's called palm muting by
letting<00:01:48.870> my<00:01:49.140> hand<00:01:49.470> touch<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.610> string<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:51.090> near

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
letting my hand touch the string is near

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.270 
letting my hand touch the string is near
the<00:01:51.450> bridge<00:01:51.660> now<00:01:52.290> we<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.620> whole<00:01:52.860> bunch<00:01:53.040> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the bridge now we have a whole bunch of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
the bridge now we have a whole bunch of
we<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.730> a<00:01:53.760> lesson<00:01:54.480> in<00:01:54.600> our<00:01:54.690> technique

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
we have a lesson in our technique

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.290 
we have a lesson in our technique
library<00:01:55.560> all<00:01:55.740> about<00:01:56.130> palm<00:01:56.550> muting<00:01:56.970> so<00:01:57.150> if<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
library all about palm muting so if you

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.790 
library all about palm muting so if you
want<00:01:57.480> to<00:01:57.510> know<00:01:57.630> about<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.440> can<00:01:58.590> check

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
want to know about that you can check

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800 
want to know about that you can check
that<00:01:58.830> for<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.730> moment<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> idea<00:02:00.510> is<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.780> just

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
that for the moment the idea is you just

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.380 
that for the moment the idea is you just
go<00:02:01.410> from<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:02.670> touch<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> strings<00:02:05.390> so

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
go from and then touch the strings so

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.609 
go from and then touch the strings so
now<00:02:06.570> with<00:02:06.810> those<00:02:06.990> dots<00:02:07.290> we<00:02:07.920> count<00:02:08.250> one<00:02:09.000> two

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
now with those dots we count one two

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:23.660 
now with those dots we count one two
three<00:02:10.619> four<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.580> strum<00:02:22.280> lot<00:02:23.280> crisper

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
three four and strum lot crisper

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.790 
three four and strum lot crisper
sounding<00:02:24.360> when<00:02:24.480> they<00:02:24.600> do<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:30.590> that's<00:02:31.590> great

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
sounding when they do this that's great

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.940 
sounding when they do this that's great
okay<00:02:32.700> now<00:02:33.390> we've<00:02:33.990> added<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.440> tricky<00:02:34.709> part

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
okay now we've added the tricky part

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.390 
okay now we've added the tricky part
we've<00:02:35.730> added<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.709> pattern<00:02:37.980> we've

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
we've added to the to this pattern we've

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.120 
we've added to the to this pattern we've
added<00:02:38.640> some<00:02:39.540> arrows<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> bee<00:02:40.860> over

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
added some arrows that have a bee over

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.940 
added some arrows that have a bee over
them<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.640> they<00:02:42.630> come<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.170> between<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.769> beats

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
them and they come in between the beats

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.210 
them and they come in between the beats
one<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.390> end<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.959> two<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.380> one<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.130> on

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
one is on the end of two and one is on

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.229 
one is on the end of two and one is on
the<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.910> four<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.560> these<00:02:49.890> represents<00:02:50.580> bass

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
the and of four so these represents bass

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.300 
the and of four so these represents bass
notes<00:02:51.540> doesn't<00:02:52.260> matter<00:02:52.410> specifically<00:02:53.130> what

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
notes doesn't matter specifically what

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.610 
notes doesn't matter specifically what
bass<00:02:53.580> note<00:02:53.790> just<00:02:54.120> kind<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.900> low<00:02:55.080> note<00:02:55.320> as

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
bass note just kind of a low note as

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.699 
bass note just kind of a low note as
opposed<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.430> whole<00:02:56.670> strum<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.330> court<00:02:57.709> so

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
opposed to a whole strum of the court so

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:19.430 
opposed to a whole strum of the court so
this<00:02:59.370> means<00:02:59.700> we're<00:03:00.090> playing<00:03:01.640> strong<00:03:17.450> one<00:03:18.450> two

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
this means we're playing strong one two

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:46.300 
this means we're playing strong one two
and<00:03:19.769> three

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.700 

you<00:03:47.310> can<00:03:47.460> imagine<00:03:47.840> how<00:03:48.840> this<00:03:48.990> might<00:03:49.260> be<00:03:49.290> played

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
you can imagine how this might be played

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.430 
you can imagine how this might be played
in<00:03:49.980> any<00:03:50.490> number<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:50.910> songs<00:03:52.490> but<00:03:53.490> now

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
in any number of songs but now

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.530 
in any number of songs but now
interesting<00:03:55.440> thing<00:03:55.470> comes<00:03:56.010> about<00:03:56.250> what<00:03:57.240> about

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
interesting thing comes about what about

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.850 
interesting thing comes about what about
chord<00:03:58.110> changes<00:03:58.880> when<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.030> chords<00:04:00.390> change

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
chord changes when the chords change

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.490 
chord changes when the chords change
what<00:04:01.860> bass<00:04:02.310> notes<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:03.390> hit<00:04:03.660> bass<00:04:04.020> notes<00:04:04.290> from

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
what bass notes you hit bass notes from

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.650 
what bass notes you hit bass notes from
what<00:04:04.710> chord<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:05.700> can<00:04:05.850> hit<00:04:05.970> pretty<00:04:06.240> much<00:04:06.420> any

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
what chord you can hit pretty much any

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.090 
what chord you can hit pretty much any
of<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.900> bass<00:04:07.050> notes<00:04:07.350> that<00:04:07.530> are<00:04:07.620> in<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:07.830> chord

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
of the bass notes that are in the chord

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.840 
of the bass notes that are in the chord
but<00:04:08.370> what<00:04:09.060> chord<00:04:09.330> well<00:04:10.320> it<00:04:11.160> turns<00:04:11.460> out<00:04:11.640> that

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
but what chord well it turns out that

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.850 
but what chord well it turns out that
what<00:04:12.030> really<00:04:12.270> works<00:04:12.630> is<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.350> play<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.680> bass

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
what really works is to play the bass

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.610 
what really works is to play the bass
note<00:04:14.130> from<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.700> chord<00:04:14.970> that's<00:04:15.180> coming<00:04:15.630> so<00:04:16.350> for

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
note from the chord that's coming so for

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.320 
note from the chord that's coming so for
instance<00:04:17.010> if<00:04:17.160> we<00:04:17.340> were<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.609> have<00:04:17.820> something

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
instance if we were to have something

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.470 
instance if we were to have something
where<00:04:18.630> we're<00:04:18.780> playing<00:04:19.730> two<00:04:20.730> chords<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.269> a<00:04:21.359> row

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
where we're playing two chords in a row

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.080 
where we're playing two chords in a row
like<00:04:21.720> say<00:04:22.080> we're<00:04:22.230> playing<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.680> D<00:04:23.580> chord<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:24.030> the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
like say we're playing a D chord in the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.710 
like say we're playing a D chord in the
C<00:04:24.300> chord<00:04:24.540> and<00:04:24.720> we<00:04:24.870> were<00:04:25.020> playing<00:04:29.419> and<00:04:30.419> we<00:04:30.510> want

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
C chord and we were playing and we want

that to do this I'm changing the quarter

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:14.030 
that to do this I'm changing the quarter
earlier<00:04:54.570> than<00:04:54.930> otherwise<00:05:12.620> so<00:05:13.620> let's<00:05:13.800> try<00:05:14.010> that

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
earlier than otherwise so let's try that

earlier than otherwise so let's try that
let's<00:05:14.370> try<00:05:14.669> just<00:05:14.790> a<00:05:15.090> little<00:05:15.360> bit<00:05:15.570> of<00:05:16.640> the<00:05:17.640> song
