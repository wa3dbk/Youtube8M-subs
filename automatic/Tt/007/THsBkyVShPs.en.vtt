00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.929 

I<00:00:27.630> need<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.779> raise<00:00:29.020> here<00:00:29.380> for<00:00:29.710> three<00:00:30.130> basic

I need to raise here for three basic

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.440 
I need to raise here for three basic
reasons<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:32.349> first<00:00:32.619> reason<00:00:32.800> is<00:00:33.250> I<00:00:33.489> know<00:00:33.910> that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
reasons the first reason is I know that

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.560 
reasons the first reason is I know that
I<00:00:34.480> have<00:00:34.780> the<00:00:34.930> best<00:00:35.110> hand<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.760> second<00:00:37.210> benefit

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
I have the best hand the second benefit

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.860 
I have the best hand the second benefit
of<00:00:37.690> raising<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.290> that<00:00:38.950> I'm<00:00:39.070> sure<00:00:39.370> or

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
of raising is that I'm sure or

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.049 
of raising is that I'm sure or
reasonably<00:00:40.870> sure<00:00:41.199> that<00:00:41.500> by<00:00:42.220> raising<00:00:42.489> I<00:00:42.879> can

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
reasonably sure that by raising I can

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.270 
reasonably sure that by raising I can
get<00:00:43.239> the<00:00:43.360> button<00:00:43.660> to<00:00:43.780> fold<00:00:44.129> therefore<00:00:45.129> I'll

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
get the button to fold therefore I'll

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.430 
get the button to fold therefore I'll
have<00:00:45.489> positioned<00:00:46.150> throughout<00:00:46.780> this<00:00:47.199> entire

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
have positioned throughout this entire

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.600 
have positioned throughout this entire
hand<00:00:47.949> and<00:00:48.840> finally<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:50.470> third<00:00:50.710> reason<00:00:51.070> I<00:00:51.400> need

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
hand and finally the third reason I need

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.579 
hand and finally the third reason I need
to<00:00:51.760> raise<00:00:51.970> is<00:00:52.210> I<00:00:52.660> want<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:52.960> limit<00:00:53.199> the<00:00:53.440> number

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
to raise is I want to limit the number

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.369 
to raise is I want to limit the number
of<00:00:53.769> players<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.670> ensure<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.089> i<00:00:55.449> actually<00:00:55.720> do

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
of players to ensure that i actually do

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.630 
of players to ensure that i actually do
win<00:00:56.650> this<00:00:56.830> hand

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.100 

you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.740 

this<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.350> very<00:01:06.740> strong<00:01:07.340> re<00:01:07.940> race<00:01:08.210> I've

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
this is a very strong re race I've

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.870 
this is a very strong re race I've
played<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.409> hundred<00:01:09.800> and<00:01:09.920> forty<00:01:10.250> hands<00:01:10.430> against

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
played a hundred and forty hands against

played a hundred and forty hands against
this<00:01:11.000> player<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.570> he<00:01:12.080> only<00:01:12.260> plays<00:01:12.620> about

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
this player and he only plays about

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.040 
this player and he only plays about
twenty-five<00:01:13.490> percent<00:01:13.790> of<00:01:14.150> his<00:01:14.240> hands<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.020> he

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
twenty-five percent of his hands so he

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.700 
twenty-five percent of his hands so he
is<00:01:15.380> very<00:01:15.680> selective<00:01:16.390> overall<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:17.869> looks<00:01:18.380> to

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
this player did not raise with pocket

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.000 
this player did not raise with pocket
kings<00:02:46.280> then<00:02:47.269> definitely<00:02:47.870> pocket<00:02:48.769> queens

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
kings then definitely pocket queens

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.560 
kings then definitely pocket queens
could<00:02:49.609> be<00:02:49.760> in<00:02:49.909> his<00:02:50.120> mix

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.990 

my<00:02:55.570> main<00:02:55.810> concern<00:02:56.320> right<00:02:56.350> now<00:02:56.650> is<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.880> I'm

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
my main concern right now is that I'm

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.810 
my main concern right now is that I'm
worried<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.420> if<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.810> bet<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.410> may<00:02:59.980> face<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.310> check

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
worried that if I bet I may face a check

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.930 
worried that if I bet I may face a check
race<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.450> think<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.590> better<00:03:02.800> play<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.400> to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
race I think that the better play is to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.180 
race I think that the better play is to
check<00:03:04.210> right<00:03:04.450> behind<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:04.990> player<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.980> way

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
check right behind this player this way

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.460 
check right behind this player this way
I<00:03:06.220> don't<00:03:06.490> lose<00:03:06.910> multiple<00:03:07.540> bets<00:03:07.780> on<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.200> turn

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
I don't lose multiple bets on the turn

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.640 
I don't lose multiple bets on the turn
when<00:03:09.070> facing<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.640> scary<00:03:09.970> board<00:03:10.330> but<00:03:11.170> my<00:03:11.350> check

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
when facing a scary board but my check

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.770 
when facing a scary board but my check
may<00:03:11.950> allow<00:03:12.250> me<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:12.640> pick<00:03:12.820> off<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.030> bluff<00:03:13.390> on<00:03:13.600> the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
may allow me to pick off a bluff on the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.910 
may allow me to pick off a bluff on the
river<00:03:13.960> as<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:15.790> result<00:03:16.390> I've<00:03:16.660> decided<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.620> check

river as a result I've decided to check

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
it right back to my opponent even though

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.100 
it right back to my opponent even though
I<00:03:22.810> started<00:03:23.170> with<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.710> best<00:03:23.920> hand<00:03:24.040> preflop<00:03:24.790> I

I started with the best hand preflop I
definitely<00:03:26.110> have<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.530> lot<00:03:26.860> of<00:03:26.920> ways<00:03:27.310> of<00:03:27.640> losing

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300

definitely have a lot of ways of losing
the<00:03:28.420> hand<00:03:28.630> at<00:03:28.810> this<00:03:28.960> point<00:03:31.320> my<00:03:32.320> main<00:03:32.530> intention

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
the hand at this point my main intention

the hand at this point my main intention
when<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.340> checked<00:03:33.730> on<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.060> turn<00:03:34.330> was<00:03:34.990> to<00:03:35.170> try

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
when I checked on the turn was to try

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.920 
when I checked on the turn was to try
and<00:03:35.410> pick<00:03:35.710> off<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.890> bluff<00:03:36.220> on<00:03:36.460> the<00:03:36.610> river<00:03:36.930> well

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
and pick off a bluff on the river well

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.560 
and pick off a bluff on the river well
now<00:03:38.170> I've<00:03:38.380> got<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.740> bet<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.100> I<00:03:39.130> wanted<00:03:39.670> the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
now I've got the bet that I wanted the

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.280 
now I've got the bet that I wanted the
pot<00:03:41.050> is<00:03:41.350> currently<00:03:42.030> $23<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.270> it<00:03:43.660> cost<00:03:43.840> me<00:03:44.020> four

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
pot is currently $23 and it cost me four

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.340 
pot is currently $23 and it cost me four
dollars<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.680> call<00:03:45.070> so<00:03:45.580> that's<00:03:45.760> 23<00:03:46.450> 24<00:03:47.020> or

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
dollars to call so that's 23 24 or

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.850 
dollars to call so that's 23 24 or
almost<00:03:48.070> 6<00:03:48.370> 21<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.030> I'm<00:03:49.690> reasonably<00:03:50.230> sure<00:03:50.350> that

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
almost 6 21 and I'm reasonably sure that

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.430 
almost 6 21 and I'm reasonably sure that
my<00:03:51.340> opponent<00:03:51.700> would<00:03:52.420> Bluff<00:03:52.810> at<00:03:53.050> a<00:03:53.110> higher

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
my opponent would Bluff at a higher

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.940 
my opponent would Bluff at a higher
frequency<00:03:53.470> than<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.640> as<00:03:54.930> such<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:56.230> decide<00:03:56.920> to

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
frequency than that as such I decide to

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.820 
frequency than that as such I decide to
call

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.160 

well<00:04:05.070> that's<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.270> hand<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.690> was<00:04:06.780> most

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
well that's the hand that I was most

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.870 
well that's the hand that I was most
worried<00:04:07.620> about<00:04:09.740> overall<00:04:10.740> I<00:04:11.100> think<00:04:11.520> that<00:04:11.850> I

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
worried about overall I think that I

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.780 
worried about overall I think that I
played<00:04:12.210> this<00:04:12.450> hand<00:04:12.510> reasonably<00:04:13.440> well<00:04:13.710> I<00:04:14.010> could

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
played this hand reasonably well I could

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.240 
played this hand reasonably well I could
have<00:04:14.910> invested<00:04:15.480> a<00:04:15.570> bet<00:04:15.780> on<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.140> turn<00:04:16.440> but

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
have invested a bet on the turn but

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.120 
have invested a bet on the turn but
instead<00:04:17.670> I<00:04:18.000> checked<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:18.959> saved<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.860> bet

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
instead I checked it and saved that bet

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.620 
instead I checked it and saved that bet
to<00:04:20.400> invest<00:04:20.760> on<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.150> river<00:04:22.910> it's<00:04:23.910> important<00:04:24.540> to

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
to invest on the river it's important to

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.200 
to invest on the river it's important to
have<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.900> good<00:04:24.990> feel<00:04:25.710> for<00:04:26.400> when<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.640> play<00:04:27.000> your

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
least one bed because I'm sure that if I

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.140 
least one bed because I'm sure that if I
would<00:04:40.260> have<00:04:40.350> bet<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.950> turn<00:04:41.220> I<00:04:41.490> would<00:04:42.030> have

would have bet the turn I would have

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.520 
would have bet the turn I would have
faced<00:04:42.390> a<00:04:42.600> raise
