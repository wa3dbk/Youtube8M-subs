00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.900
 theme 4 stage diagnosis 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.519
 this second stage of the country focuses on 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.840
 the analysis of the collected data 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.269
 during the valuation and its 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.939
 interpretation that results in the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.859
 nursing diagnoses these will guide 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.480
 planning execution and evaluation 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.550
 of nursing care 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.019
 remember that the objective of nursing 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.030
 is to identify the answers 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.370
 specific to the patient 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.890
 clinical situation determined from the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.300
 2010 is legislated in Spain 'the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.280
 obligation to use the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.559
 nursing diagnoses of the ananda 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.990
 as an expression of the practice judgment 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.000
 clinic 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.800
 there are different definitions about the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.630
 Nursing diagnosis concept 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.520
 however the most commonly 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.010
 accepted corresponds to the one given by 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.440
 nothing 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.239
 the nursing diagnosis is a judgment 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.460
 clinical about the response of a 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.840
 individual family or community to their 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.490
 real or potential health problems 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.040
 and to life processes 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.869
 the nursing diagnosis provides the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.600
 basis for the selection of interventions 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.860
 for the achievement of objectives for which 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.140
 the nurse is responsible 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.200
 The main characteristics of 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.120
 nursing diagnoses are the 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.470
 Nursing diagnoses focus on 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.870
 the problems arising from the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.420
 human responses that occurred after a 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.980
 this particular health alteration 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.410
 means that it is necessary to value 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.990
 each individual independently since 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.330
 the fact that two different patients 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.670
 suffer the same clinical situation can 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.960
 provoke different answers being 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.840
 Therefore, it is necessary to use 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.550
 different diagnoses so the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.080
 human responses are the acts of 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.940
 adaptation that occur in a 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.130
 person in a clinical situation 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.050
 specific considering this 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.729
 concept can be said that the object 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.979
 of nursing and therefore that of 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.320
 his diagnoses is not the disease 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.810
 but the patient's response to that 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.460
 disease the diagnoses of 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.470
 nursing describe the answers of 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.630
 patients in clinical situations 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.940
 that can be treated or addressed by 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.709
 the nurses in case there is not 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.959
 no nursing intervention that can 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.730
 solve the health problem 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.770
 we would talk about a problem 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.019
 interdependent that is to say a problem 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.770
 that focuses on the answer 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.210
 physiopathological of the body 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.620
 and that must be stopped with the 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.920
 collaboration of other professionals 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.920
 health 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.010
 to be able to diagnose is necessary 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.460
 develop a series of competences 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.650
 diagnostic these are competencies 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.570
 intellectuals since it is necessary 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.550
 know the diagnoses 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.500
 definitions and their characteristics 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.870
 defining competencies 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.700
 interpersonal understood as the 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.490
 ability to develop a bond of 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.980
 Trust with patient competence 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.480
 technique in this case are related 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.370
 with the knowledge and skill of 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.730
 perform a good nurse evaluation 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.200
 where the diagnosis is sustained 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.790
 tolerance for ambiguity since it is 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.950
 necessary to adapt to the conditions 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.720
 particular of each patient in order 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.660
 to be able to establish the diagnostics of 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.180
 More precise practice nursing 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.040
 reflexive is defined as ability to 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.790
 examine introspectively our 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.739
 own behaviors 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.230
 to select a specific diagnosis 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.730
 for a particular patient first is 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.769
 necessary to analyze the information 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.530
 collected and organized during the phases 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.209
 of valuation the objective will be to recognize 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.640
 a series of keys or units of 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.579
 information related to the process 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.040
 that the patient is suffering these 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.870
 keys will be the basis for generating 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.280
 mentally a diagnostic hypothesis 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.040
 that will have to be contrasted with the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.989
 data collected in certain cases 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.030
 mainly when there is no certainty 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.430
 total on the choice of diagnosis 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.950
 a focused collection of 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.569
 data in order to validate the data and 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.990
 agree with between the nurse and the 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.750
 patient nursing diagnoses 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.000
 in its formulation the diagnosis not only 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.560
 include the problem but also the two 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.420
 markers that will define the objectives 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.030
 of interventions nurses is 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.819
 say the causes of the problem and its 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.680
 symptomatology 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.269
 for the construction of a diagnosis 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.389
 of nursing the nanda recommends 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:23.360
 use the pets format developed by 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.620
 major and Gordon in 1982 these acronyms ps 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.030
 specify the order that you must follow the 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.500
 formulation of a diagnosis of 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.930
 nursing this is etiology problem 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.180
 Signs and symptoms are first determined 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.770
 the problem or diagnostic label 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.509
 later this will be related 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.930
 label with its related factor or 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.820
 cause is to say with its etiology and by 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.480
 last will be specified the signs and 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.900
 symptoms that heritage presents 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.420
 problem as such is the part that would 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.390
 and defines the rest of the diagnosis 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.280
 etiology will define the different 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.810
 related factors or causal agents 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.420
 that may have caused the response 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.880
 altered in the patient the etiology or 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.820
 the one related to is usually expressed with 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.590
 the brief action ereba robert la 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.850
 etiology will be the first objective of 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.430
 nurses interventions 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.980
 for this reason the more accurate it is 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.820
 the choice of the most effective etiology 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.070
 will be nursing interventions 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.540
 symptomatology refers to the signs and 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.400
 symptoms that the patient has 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.230
 which specify the magnitude of the 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.210
 response produced 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.680
 Nursing interventions in case of 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.600
 can not attack the etiology of 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.389
 problem will focus on the decrease 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.710
 or elimination of symptoms an example 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.470
 of correct formulation of a 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.780
 nursing diagnosis could be a 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:46.340
 acute pain as a related problem 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:51.390
 with agent harmful physical etiology and 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.280
 manifested by verbal report symptom 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.640
 the nanda diagnostics can be 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.890
 categorize as follows 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.930
 real nursing diagnosis is the one that 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.510
 describes human responses to processes 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.150
 vital health states that exist in 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.910
 an individual family or community is 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.620
 supported by defining characteristics 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.870
 Signs and symptoms that are grouped in 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.540
 key patterns or interference 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.940
 related is composed of the three 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.960
 Top shape components is problem 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:24.180
 etiology and signs and symptoms 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.710
 risk nurse diagnosis describes 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.780
 human responses to health states 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.520
 vital processes that can 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.070
 develop in an individual family or 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.930
 community is supported by factors of 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.120
 risk that contribute to the increase of 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.890
 vulnerability in this case the 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.680
 diagnosis is formed by the problem 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.750
 and because of the etiology 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.240
 still produced the alterations of the 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.100
 state of health there are no signs 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.290
 my symptoms 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.170
 nursing diagnosis of promotion of 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.940
 health is a clinical judgment about 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.130
 motivation and desire of a person 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.620
 family or community to increase their 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.340
 wellness update your human potential 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.800
 of health and improve specific behaviors 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.900
 all labels start with 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.310
 willingness to improve this kind of 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.990
 diagnosis does not have factors 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.580
 related so the formulation 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.360
 of the diagnosis will be made with the 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.550
 problem and with the signs and symptoms 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.260
 health nurse diagnosis describes 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.360
 human responses at the health level of 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.030
 an individual family or community that 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.920
 are in a position to improve the 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.540
 formulation will be done in the same way 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.260
 that in the case of diagnostics of 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.260
 Health promotion
