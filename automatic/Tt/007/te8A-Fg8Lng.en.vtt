00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
Photoshop osseous in cinema 4d but it's

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.360

more<00:04:11.739> noticeable<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.780> Photoshop<00:04:13.780> so<00:04:14.769> you<00:04:15.220> go

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
more noticeable in Photoshop so you go

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.099 
more noticeable in Photoshop so you go
over<00:04:15.430> to<00:04:15.549> performance<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:16.720> shows<00:04:16.930> you're

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
over to performance and it shows you're

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.080 
over to performance and it shows you're
available<00:04:17.409> ramp<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:18.039> only<00:04:18.370> have<00:04:18.579> three<00:04:18.849> point

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
available ramp I only have three point

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.649 
available ramp I only have three point
two<00:04:19.269> thick<00:04:19.570> is<00:04:19.720> available<00:04:20.229> on<00:04:20.440> this<00:04:20.560> laptop

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
two thick is available on this laptop

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:26.580 
two thick is available on this laptop
but<00:04:22.659> you<00:04:23.260> can<00:04:23.529> change<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.870> amount<00:04:26.169> where<00:04:26.440> you

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
but you can change the amount where you

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.590 
but you can change the amount where you
use<00:04:26.800> so

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
use so

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.680 
use so
if<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.780> wanted<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.170> put<00:04:28.350> it<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.740> maybe<00:04:29.690> 2,500

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
if I wanted to put it to maybe 2,500

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.720 
if I wanted to put it to maybe 2,500
instead<00:04:31.500> of<00:04:31.730> 1920<00:04:33.410> 2,500<00:04:34.410> MV<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.340> takes<00:04:35.520> up

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
instead of 1920 2,500 MV so it takes up

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.840 
instead of 1920 2,500 MV so it takes up
seventy-eight<00:04:36.270> percent<00:04:36.300> of<00:04:36.750> my<00:04:36.840> cpu<00:04:37.850> and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
seventy-eight percent of my cpu and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.080 
seventy-eight percent of my cpu and
it'll<00:04:39.600> eventually<00:04:40.140> run<00:04:40.680> smoother<00:04:41.220> than<00:04:41.760> what

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
it'll eventually run smoother than what

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.150 
it'll eventually run smoother than what
it<00:04:42.180> normally<00:04:42.210> would<00:04:44.510> um<00:04:45.510> your<00:04:46.080> catch<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:46.950> need

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
it normally would um your catch you need

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.360 
it normally would um your catch you need
to<00:04:47.220> worry<00:04:47.400> really<00:04:47.730> about<00:04:47.940> left<00:04:48.680> then<00:04:49.680> if<00:04:50.190> you

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
to worry really about left then if you

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.420 
to worry really about left then if you
have<00:04:50.580> extra<00:04:51.060> discs<00:04:51.720> and<00:04:53.000> change<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.210> then<00:04:55.430> use

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
have extra discs and change it then use

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.700 
have extra discs and change it then use
a<00:04:56.460> graphics<00:04:57.090> processor<00:04:57.330> that's<00:04:58.050> probably<00:04:58.620> a

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
a graphics processor that's probably a

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.510 
a graphics processor that's probably a
good<00:04:58.740> thing<00:04:58.950> to<00:04:59.280> do<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.750> yeah<00:05:01.200> that's<00:05:02.040> how<00:05:02.460> you
