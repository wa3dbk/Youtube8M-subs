00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.120
 i 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.380
 hello friends of only p we are here in 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.870
 my fac glam boutique because today 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.550
 let's talk about the arguments 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.250
 what can you wear for this 14 of 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.800
 february super important if your boyfriend 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.730
 directed to breakfast that you put to 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.869
 to have lunch 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.279
 that you wear or have dinner or dinner and dance 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.670
 so now let's learn what 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.670
 power 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.180
 for example, they invite you to take a 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.890
 breakfast you go to a summer not then 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.540
 who does not wear a short black dress 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.400
 basic then now what I did was 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.769
 I complemented it with a capita 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.960
 Delgada for the summer I love how 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.460
 they always look at the champagne and you're at the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.680
 shoulder because they make you see I do not know about 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.059
 Miss delicate and also if you go to a 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.890
 site that has air conditioning 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.360
 body of seville because sometimes outside 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.009
 it's a barbaric heat but inside it 's a 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.000
 horrible cold is not now I'm going to 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.000
 try so you can see how 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.740
 and Skype 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.720
 another outfit can be this one piece that 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.780
 It comes if I do not mikel this light 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.960
 but has a belt quoted here then 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.970
 there he squeezes it and that's going to be that you're going to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.680
 get upright and you're going to put the belly 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.540
 what I have done that combined it with 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.759
 some high clogs because of all 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.950
 ways are no longer very high then so 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.560
 it is disguised and it suits all of them 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.330
 with a white portfolio of costadito and 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.510
 you can complement them with some earrings 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.220
 and that's what I have longer than 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.040
 the other because it is also trend 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.530
 right now and some super fashion lenses 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.830
 and in the form of a heart because it is 14 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.830
 February 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.240
 another option for lunch 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.680
 can be this this seems perfect 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.720
 for a girl for example who works 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.010
 in an office in some company 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.380
 then it has to always go 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.510
 pretty little girl and she's going to escape to the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.480
 lunch time with the boyfriend who can 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.760
 putting a pleated skirt of these 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.890
 Scottish and accompanies it with a top 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.150
 cute then by the time you enter 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.120
 to the office suddenly you put on a 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.400
 blazer over a white or black color 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.600
 everything is presentable for the office 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.150
 but sexy for your man another option 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.510
 for the morning that I think is fabulous is 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.910
 It was not a relaxed dress 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.800
 example without cleaning was to take 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.660
 breakfast to your house or if you already live together 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.030
 then you will wake up if you want to be 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.890
 nice because it 's February 14th what 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.989
 Only thing is that you wear this style 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.630
 so it's more with nothing down and you stay 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.760
 perfect you do not need a bra art no 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.530
 you need nothing is not more now I look 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.110
 without shoes but with the world 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.150
 Sandinistas that already combine this these 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.430
 dresses I love because you have left 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.079
 While everyone if you're a little 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.770
 your view of weights and stays and media 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.340
 hip 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.870
 the black and is recontra queen can be 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.720
 use the white the good thing about this that is going to 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.520
 look like a goddess and walking and I 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.130
 love because the detail you have here 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.870
 of the flower because it was a canvas 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.120
 it seems that it was a true picture then 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.980
 you're going to get where they take you and from 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.560
 every way everyone is going to flip 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.870
 to see you now I combine them with the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.330
 artists like that and little ones 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.110
 because I think that they do not need anything else 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.110
 this dress 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.330
 7a 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.980
 this is my favorite attire is more this 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.380
 is the one that I'm going to put on for the 14th 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.440
 February I love it because it has a cut 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.590
 at the waist then he's going to put you there 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.140
 Little skirt comes loose skirt 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.110
 porte makes you a good girl 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.500
 Miss but that's ahead because 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.290
 when you turn around you have your whole back 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.340
 calaca because I love it because it's super 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.260
 sexy but elegant at the same time 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.940
 that since I still do not even have 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.040
 talked about the detail you have here in the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.340
 chest I combined it with a pair of earrings 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.010
 and from the quotes also super cute and a 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.780
 ring has been strass this for example 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.790
 that you can put a lunch 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.580
 or you can wear it for dinner you 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.070
 serves for both is and is a 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.580
 option to go out at night that's a 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.479
 little smarter is black besides look 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.810
 has gauze here showed a short little skirt 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.960
 inside then it can be sexy 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.210
 and tapadita at the same time and I love it because 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.730
 the whole part of the chest also has 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.350
 like studs then you're smart but 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.000
 it's still a little rocker not now 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.130
 I look with my hair loose so 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.990
 give a style a little bit more crazy and not 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.550
 I put accessories on him because I thought that 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.169
 it was enough with everything I had to 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.229
 on the chest 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.150
 another option to go out at night is this 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.319
 wonderful dress that looks like 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.639
 glove 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:17.259
 I also love it because it's super sexy 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.659
 here the beads that like these dresses 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:21.490
 they are bands 3 that they mean bandage 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.860
 you do not need a bra 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.960
 only the dress grabs you that you saw 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.729
 then you do not need and back the 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.099
 neckline is also super pronounced 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.080
 Apart from that the colors are cute they are 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.300
 vibrant colors of summer making 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.819
 combination of a lilac with a medium red 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.830
 orange that I love 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.499
 if you did not reserve anything for valentine 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.999
 and everything is full well you are the 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:46.889
 people that you do not like to go out in that 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.300
 date because everything bustles you prefer 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.120
 stay home from being a scene 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.490
 romantic what better to wait for your 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.650
 couple dressed like this 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.160
 This desire I love because it's super 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.080
 sexy but does not teach anything was without 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.990
 bra to start you can not do it 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.419
 put but the trick is that in the end the 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.449
 You dress like a bikini because you 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.030

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.039

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.650

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:20.340
 the time you will be super sexy protected 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.380

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:26.900
 if you want because if not also what 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.900
 you can cover there is this 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.250
