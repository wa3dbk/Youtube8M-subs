00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
this partner tutorial is why not to wrap

this partner tutorial is why not to wrap
your<00:00:43.250> laces<00:00:43.610> around<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:43.940> back<00:00:44.090> of<00:00:44.120> your

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
your laces around the back of your

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.000 
your laces around the back of your
skates<00:00:44.570> as<00:00:44.870> I<00:00:44.930> heard<00:00:45.170> a<00:00:45.380> lot<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:45.559> you<00:00:45.680> skaters

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
skates as I heard a lot of you skaters

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.180 
skates as I heard a lot of you skaters
out<00:00:46.100> there<00:00:46.309> it's<00:00:46.460> still<00:00:46.640> doing<00:00:47.980> so<00:00:48.980> what<00:00:49.070> we

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
out there it's still doing so what we

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.830 
out there it's still doing so what we
have<00:00:49.280> here<00:00:49.309> isn't<00:00:50.059> meantime<00:00:50.300> my<00:00:50.420> skates<00:00:50.629> up

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
have here isn't meantime my skates up

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.340 
have here isn't meantime my skates up
and<00:00:51.050> if<00:00:51.590> I<00:00:51.710> wrap<00:00:51.920> them<00:00:52.100> towards<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.059> back<00:00:53.350> like

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
and if I wrap them towards the back like

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.560 
and if I wrap them towards the back like
a<00:00:54.379> lot<00:00:54.559> of<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:54.739> do<00:00:54.920> I'll<00:00:55.790> quickly<00:00:56.090> run<00:00:56.330> through

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
a lot of you do I'll quickly run through

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.939

the<00:00:56.870> disadvantages<00:00:57.440> of<00:00:57.559> doing<00:00:57.710> that

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
the disadvantages of doing that

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.530 
the disadvantages of doing that
obviously<00:00:58.370> I'm<00:00:58.699> not<00:00:58.760> them<00:00:58.879> tie<00:00:59.059> them<00:00:59.239> properly

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
obviously I'm not them tie them properly

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
the skate here is now stuck to my foot

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.140 
the skate here is now stuck to my foot
because<00:01:09.470> I'll<00:01:09.590> wrap<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:09.860> skate<00:01:10.130> laces<00:01:10.700> around

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
because I'll wrap the skate laces around

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.030 
because I'll wrap the skate laces around
it<00:01:11.299> which<00:01:11.450> means<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:11.870> can't<00:01:12.170> move<00:01:12.590> my<00:01:12.830> foot

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
it which means I can't move my foot

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.640 
it which means I can't move my foot
forwards<00:01:13.490> I<00:01:13.580> can't<00:01:13.790> move<00:01:14.030> lands<00:01:14.840> as<00:01:15.229> freely<00:01:15.620> as

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
forwards I can't move lands as freely as

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.620 
forwards I can't move lands as freely as
they<00:01:15.799> should<00:01:15.860> be<00:01:16.070> able<00:01:16.190> to<00:01:16.370> so<00:01:17.180> Tyler<00:01:17.420> this

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
they should be able to so Tyler this

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.300 
they should be able to so Tyler this
weight<00:01:17.840> increases<00:01:18.440> your<00:01:18.710> range<00:01:19.070> of<00:01:19.250> motion

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
weight increases your range of motion

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.830

inside<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.000> skate<00:01:20.210> which<00:01:20.390> is<00:01:20.570> the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
inside the skate which is the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.180 
inside the skate which is the
flexibility<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.409> yong-chol<00:01:21.770> being<00:01:21.950> able<00:01:22.070> to

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
flexibility of yong-chol being able to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.660 
flexibility of yong-chol being able to
move<00:01:22.430> back<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:22.940> forth<00:01:23.470> so<00:01:24.470> as<00:01:24.590> we<00:01:24.740> said<00:01:24.950> tying

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
move back and forth so as we said tying

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.950 
move back and forth so as we said tying
the<00:01:25.880> laces<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:26.390> back<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.720> skate

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
the laces to the back of the skate

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.080 
the laces to the back of the skate
reduces<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.590> range<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:27.979> motion<00:01:28.340> because<00:01:29.000> it

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
reduces the range of motion because it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.240 
reduces the range of motion because it
means<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:29.390> your<00:01:29.780> ankle<00:01:30.470> part<00:01:30.680> move<00:01:30.860> forwards

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
means that your ankle part move forwards

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.620 
means that your ankle part move forwards
while<00:01:31.369> you're<00:01:31.520> telling<00:01:31.670> God<00:01:31.940> is<00:01:32.060> back<00:01:32.270> that's

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
while you're telling God is back that's

while you're telling God is back that's

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
the position it needs to be in not bent

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.039 
the position it needs to be in not bent
forward<00:01:34.760> with<00:01:34.940> you<00:01:35.090> because<00:01:35.570> all<00:01:35.780> that<00:01:35.869> will

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
forward with you because all that will

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.660 
forward with you because all that will
do<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:36.350> just<00:01:36.560> accelerate<00:01:37.039> the<00:01:37.159> breakdown<00:01:37.520> and

do is just accelerate the breakdown and

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
on the side they're only designed to

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
take you from that side as you can see

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.389 
take you from that side as you can see
it's<00:01:45.170> really<00:01:45.560> strong<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:45.920> way<00:01:46.070> but<00:01:46.219> if<00:01:46.310> I

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
it's really strong that way but if I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.800 
it's really strong that way but if I
bend<00:01:46.609> it<00:01:46.670> forward<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.030> can<00:01:47.179> do<00:01:47.240> it<00:01:47.329> one<00:01:47.509> thing<00:01:47.539> -

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
bend it forward I can do it one thing -

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.090 
bend it forward I can do it one thing -
bending<00:01:48.079> it<00:01:48.170> forward<00:01:48.439> they're<00:01:48.619> not<00:01:48.799> supposed

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
bending it forward they're not supposed

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.440 
bending it forward they're not supposed
to<00:01:49.159> move<00:01:49.369> in<00:01:49.609> that<00:01:49.670> direction<00:01:49.850> they're<00:01:50.329> only

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
to move in that direction they're only

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.569 
to move in that direction they're only
meant<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.659> move<00:01:50.840> back<00:01:51.259> as<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:51.679> can<00:01:51.799> see<00:01:51.979> it's

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
meant to move back as you can see it's

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:53.830 
meant to move back as you can see it's
really<00:01:52.820> stiff<00:01:53.060> if<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.329> try<00:01:53.509> and<00:01:53.570> move<00:01:53.689> it

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
really stiff if I try and move it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.530 
really stiff if I try and move it
backwards

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.940 

so<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.780> said<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.050> main<00:01:58.200> points<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.860> not

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
so as we said the main points for not

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.140 
so as we said the main points for not
tying<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.340> laces<00:01:59.640> around<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.850> back<00:02:00.000> here

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
tying the laces around the back here

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.120

skates<00:02:00.450> are<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.380> restrict<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
skates are that if you restrict the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.649 
skates are that if you restrict the
range<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.430> motion<00:02:02.580> for<00:02:02.880> your<00:02:03.000> ankle<00:02:03.300> if<00:02:03.540> you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
range of motion for your ankle if you

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.240 
range of motion for your ankle if you
can't<00:02:03.870> bend<00:02:04.050> your<00:02:04.200> ankle<00:02:04.500> because<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> laces

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
can't bend your ankle because the laces

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.469 
can't bend your ankle because the laces
are<00:02:05.430> strapped<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.880> back<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.210> skate

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
are strapped in the back of the skate

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.180 
are strapped in the back of the skate
you<00:02:06.960> can't<00:02:07.170> bend<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.470> knees<00:02:07.590> which<00:02:07.860> limits

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you can't bend your knees which limits

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.440 
you can't bend your knees which limits
your<00:02:08.369> performance<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:08.880> ice<00:02:09.060> will

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
your performance on the ice will

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.180 
your performance on the ice will
restricts<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.990> and<00:02:10.560> other<00:02:10.709> reason<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.070> it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
restricts it and other reason is it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.740 
restricts it and other reason is it
accelerates<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.910> breakdown<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.390> your<00:02:12.510> skates

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
accelerates the breakdown in your skates

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.240 
accelerates the breakdown in your skates
which<00:02:13.080> means<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.440> they'll<00:02:13.590> wear<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:14.010> you'll

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
which means that they'll wear out you'll

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.620 
which means that they'll wear out you'll
have<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.400> spend<00:02:14.700> more<00:02:14.820> money<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.150> another<00:02:15.420> pair

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
have to spend more money on another pair

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.330 
have to spend more money on another pair
of<00:02:15.660> skates<00:02:15.870> sooner<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.770> also<00:02:16.890> means<00:02:17.220> that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
of skates sooner and it also means that

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.800 
of skates sooner and it also means that
your<00:02:17.640> overall<00:02:17.790> performance<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.420> hindered<00:02:18.690> in

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
your overall performance is hindered in

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.360 
your overall performance is hindered in
the<00:02:18.930> art<00:02:19.020> because<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.470> don't<00:02:19.650> have<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:20.010> full

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
the art because you don't have a full

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.830 
the art because you don't have a full
range<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.670> motion<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.060> I'd<00:02:21.270> escape<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> way

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
range of motion so I'd escape the way

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.440 
range of motion so I'd escape the way
