Miller's<00:01:10.590> were<00:01:10.710> started<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.270> they're

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
Miller's were started there and they're

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.600 
Miller's were started there and they're
not<00:01:12.510> quite<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.170> close<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> championship<00:01:14.430> as

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
not quite as close to a championship as

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.480

these<00:01:15.240> other<00:01:15.450> three<00:01:15.780> teams<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.320> Miami<00:01:17.189> would

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
these other three teams so Miami would

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
these other three teams so Miami would
seem<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.850> make<00:01:18.000> sense<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.570> whether<00:01:19.080> he

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
seem to make sense because whether he

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.410 
seem to make sense because whether he
would<00:01:19.409> start<00:01:19.830> or<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.159> he<00:01:20.310> certainly<00:01:20.549> would

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
would start or not he certainly would

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.539 
would start or not he certainly would
would<00:01:21.810> look<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.439> he'd<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.979> shot<00:01:23.280> at

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
would look like he'd have a shot at

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.580 
would look like he'd have a shot at
breaking<00:01:23.790> into<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.240> starting<00:01:24.840> five<00:01:25.049> Mario

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
breaking into that starting five Mario

breaking into that starting five Mario
Chalmers<00:01:25.860> was<00:01:26.250> started<00:01:26.580> right<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.759> but

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
Chalmers was started right now but

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.740 
Chalmers was started right now but

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
struggles and that would perhaps be a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.620 
struggles and that would perhaps be a
problem<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> Heat<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.640> right<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:39.180> they

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
problem for the Heat but right now they

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.200 
problem for the Heat but right now they
would<00:01:39.840> welcome<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.500> floor<00:01:40.829> general<00:01:41.250> who<00:01:41.939> could
