thing about this track honestly is that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.430 
thing about this track honestly is that
it's<00:00:39.870> difficult<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:41.719> I'd<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.870> lying<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.320> I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it's difficult I I'd be lying if I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.990 
it's difficult I I'd be lying if I
didn't<00:00:43.590> say<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.550> track<00:00:44.820> has

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
didn't say this but this track has

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.080 
didn't say this but this track has
pissed<00:00:45.450> me<00:00:45.780> off<00:00:45.809> at<00:00:46.350> times<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:47.039> can't<00:00:47.910> believe<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
pissed me off at times I can't believe a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.670 
pissed me off at times I can't believe a
messing<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.140> rhythm<00:00:49.410> doesn't

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
messing this up but this rhythm doesn't

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.100 
messing this up but this rhythm doesn't
matter<00:00:49.800> off<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> start<00:00:50.660> because<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.840> actually

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
matter off the start because it actually

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.500 
matter off the start because it actually
changes<00:00:52.590> once<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.949> get<00:00:53.100> around<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.670> full

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
changes once you get around the full

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.959 
changes once you get around the full
track<00:00:54.780> mainly<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.410> due<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.039> firm<00:00:56.640> that's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
track mainly just due to a firm that's

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.430 
track mainly just due to a firm that's
excluded<00:00:57.629> off<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.899> start

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
excluded off the start

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.549 
excluded off the start
but<00:00:59.129> it's<00:01:00.059> an<00:01:00.180> awesome<00:01:00.390> track<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> has

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
but it's an awesome track but it has

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.319 
but it's an awesome track but it has
pissed<00:01:01.980> me<00:01:02.250> off<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.879> couple<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
pissed me off just a couple of the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.880 
pissed me off just a couple of the
rhythms<00:01:03.690> are<00:01:03.870> pretty<00:01:04.110> difficult<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.710> they're

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
rhythms are pretty difficult and they're

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.399 
rhythms are pretty difficult and they're
really<00:01:05.100> hard<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> hit<00:01:05.460> consistently<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:07.229> can

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
really hard to hit consistently it can

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.750 
really hard to hit consistently it can
happen<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.010> really<00:01:08.189> have<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.610> kind

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
happen but you really have to just kind

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420 
happen but you really have to just kind
of<00:01:08.820> put<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.210> handful<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.780> laps<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.320> before<00:01:11.220> you

play this just to be able to hit things
right<00:01:13.880> for<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> most<00:01:15.210> part<00:01:15.540> whoops<00:01:16.280> I've<00:01:17.280> had

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
right for the most part whoops I've had

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
right for the most part whoops I've had
it<00:01:17.729> down<00:01:17.970> may<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:19.020> look<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.680> this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it down may not look like it on this

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.039 
it down may not look like it on this
first<00:01:20.189> lap<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:22.159> it's<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.250> hard<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.049> it

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
first lap but it's a hard one and it

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.780 
first lap but it's a hard one and it
takes<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.650> lot<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.830> patience<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.580> able<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
takes a lot of patience to be able to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.399 
takes a lot of patience to be able to
figure<00:01:26.970> out<00:01:27.090> some<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> rhythms<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.140> hit

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
figure out some of the rhythms and hit

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
figure out some of the rhythms and hit
them<00:01:28.530> smoothly<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.640> biggest<00:01:30.000> thing<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
them smoothly and the biggest thing that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.020 
them smoothly and the biggest thing that
makes<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.780> hard<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.549> really<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.880> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
makes it hard is that you really have to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.789 
makes it hard is that you really have to
hit<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.479> landings<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> perfect

example here you want to hit this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.810 
example here you want to hit this
landing<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.829> triple<00:01:38.250> first<00:01:38.460> triple

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
landing on this triple first triple

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.249 
landing on this triple first triple
perfectly<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.659> case<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> little

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
perfectly you can turn that little

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.219 
perfectly you can turn that little
double-double<00:01:44.790> into<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> quad<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.689> that's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
double-double into a quad and that's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.200 
double-double into a quad and that's
obviously<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> fast<00:01:47.130> line<00:01:47.399> through<00:01:47.640> there<00:01:47.790> so

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
obviously the fast line through there so

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.940 
obviously the fast line through there so
it's<00:01:48.689> all<00:01:48.930> about<00:01:49.170> hitting<00:01:49.409> those<00:01:49.530> landings

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it's all about hitting those landings

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.800 
it's all about hitting those landings
just<00:01:50.159> go<00:01:50.250> nice<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.820> perfect<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.390> love<00:01:51.689> this

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
just go nice and perfect I love this

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.920 
just go nice and perfect I love this
line<00:01:52.049> cut<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> inside<00:01:53.119> hit<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.270> triple<00:01:54.570> I

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
line cut to the inside hit the triple I

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.749 
line cut to the inside hit the triple I
do<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.409> every<00:01:55.860> time<00:01:55.890> let's<00:01:56.399> play<00:01:56.549> with<00:01:56.670> this

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
do that every time let's play with this

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.200 
do that every time let's play with this
inside<00:01:57.240> line<00:01:57.479> through<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:59.000> think<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.060> can

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
inside line through here I think you can

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.760 
inside line through here I think you can
make<00:02:00.360> each<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.990> these<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.439> split

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
make each one of these this like split

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.039 
make each one of these this like split
lane<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.579> make<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.030> just<00:02:03.869> as

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
lane I think you can make it just as

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.670 
lane I think you can make it just as
fast<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> other<00:02:05.719> just<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:07.380> depends<00:02:07.649> on

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
fast as the other just just depends on

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.229 
fast as the other just just depends on
what<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.890> want<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.069> do<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:08.879> see<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> hit

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
what you want to do so you can see I hit

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.790 
what you want to do so you can see I hit
that<00:02:09.330> landing<00:02:09.690> pretty<00:02:09.929> good<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.590> then<00:02:10.679> you're

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that landing pretty good and then you're

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.580 
that landing pretty good and then you're
able<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.039> jump<00:02:11.370> all<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.610> way<00:02:11.940> over<00:02:12.390> there

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
able to jump all the way over there

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.530 
able to jump all the way over there
step<00:02:12.830> on<00:02:13.010> step<00:02:13.250> off<00:02:13.459> that's<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.970> fast<00:02:14.209> line

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
step on step off that's the fast line

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.360 
step on step off that's the fast line
through<00:02:14.810> there<00:02:14.989> but<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.349> is<00:02:15.590> really<00:02:16.010> difficult

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
through there but it is really difficult

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.670 
through there but it is really difficult
to<00:02:16.700> hit<00:02:16.910> those<00:02:17.060> downsides<00:02:17.569> pretty<00:02:18.470> cool

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
to hit those downsides pretty cool

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.320 
to hit those downsides pretty cool
there's<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.980> little<00:02:19.310> inside<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.940> outside<00:02:20.090> I

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
there's a little inside and outside I

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.320 
there's a little inside and outside I
pretty<00:02:21.200> much<00:02:21.290> always<00:02:21.650> take<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.370> inside<00:02:22.819> but

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
pretty much always take the inside but

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.880 
pretty much always take the inside but
it's<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.019> good<00:02:24.230> setup<00:02:24.500> spot<00:02:25.040> for<00:02:25.340> passes<00:02:29.890> okay

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
it's a good setup spot for passes okay

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.490 
it's a good setup spot for passes okay
so<00:02:30.950> not<00:02:31.310> getting<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.670> once<00:02:31.940> again<00:02:32.500> hopefully

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
so not getting that once again hopefully

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.250 
so not getting that once again hopefully
I'll<00:02:34.340> hit<00:02:34.489> that<00:02:34.640> quad<00:02:34.910> here<00:02:35.209> soon<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.720> usually

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
I'll hit that quad here soon I usually

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.920 
I'll hit that quad here soon I usually
have<00:02:36.379> it<00:02:36.500> down<00:02:36.730> decently<00:02:37.730> not<00:02:38.150> every<00:02:38.450> lap<00:02:38.629> but

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
have it down decently not every lap but

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.710 
have it down decently not every lap but
probably<00:02:39.459> four<00:02:40.459> out<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.730> five<00:02:40.910> laps<00:02:41.209> I'd<00:02:41.480> say

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
probably four out of five laps I'd say

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.640 
probably four out of five laps I'd say
typically<00:02:42.819> but<00:02:44.049> that's<00:02:45.049> the<00:02:45.319> that's<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
typically but that's the that's the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.949 
typically but that's the that's the
other<00:02:45.829> hard<00:02:46.069> rhythm<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.269> rest<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.569> this<00:02:47.630> is

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
other hard rhythm so the rest of this is

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.259 
other hard rhythm so the rest of this is
somewhat<00:02:48.680> easy<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:49.400> can<00:02:49.549> catch<00:02:49.760> yourself<00:02:49.880> out

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
somewhat easy you can catch yourself out

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.479 
somewhat easy you can catch yourself out
and<00:02:50.510> push<00:02:50.720> wide<00:02:50.959> and<00:02:51.349> go<00:02:51.920> off<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.220> track

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
and push wide and go off the track

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.729 
and push wide and go off the track
before<00:02:53.180> this<00:02:53.450> loop<00:02:53.900> section<00:02:54.170> if<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.470> take<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
before this loop section if you take the

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.670 
before this loop section if you take the
outside<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:56.569> this<00:02:56.810> rhythm<00:02:57.170> is<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.530> other

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
outside and this rhythm is the other

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.410 
outside and this rhythm is the other
difficult<00:02:58.190> one<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.489> can<00:02:58.610> see<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.790> over<00:02:59.150> jumped

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
difficult one you can see I over jumped

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.699 
difficult one you can see I over jumped
it<00:02:59.510> there<00:02:59.690> so<00:02:59.900> you're<00:03:00.049> better<00:03:00.230> off<00:03:00.290> just

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
it there so you're better off just

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.430 
it there so you're better off just
hitting<00:03:01.579> this<00:03:01.670> double<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.360> then<00:03:02.690> jump<00:03:03.019> over

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
hitting this double and then jump over

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.020 
hitting this double and then jump over
or<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.829> can<00:03:03.950> end<00:03:04.129> up<00:03:04.220> with<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.400> step<00:03:04.670> on<00:03:04.790> step

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
or you can end up with a step on step

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.979 
or you can end up with a step on step
off<00:03:05.829> both<00:03:06.829> work<00:03:07.190> but<00:03:07.640> it's<00:03:07.970> if<00:03:08.599> you're<00:03:08.720> trying

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
off both work but it's if you're trying

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.800 
off both work but it's if you're trying
to<00:03:09.049> throw<00:03:09.170> hot<00:03:09.799> laps<00:03:10.069> down<00:03:10.340> you<00:03:11.000> gotta<00:03:11.569> hit<00:03:11.690> the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
to throw hot laps down you gotta hit the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.559 
to throw hot laps down you gotta hit the
big<00:03:11.959> lines<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.530> know<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:13.760> this<00:03:14.090> track<00:03:14.269> can<00:03:14.510> be

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
big lines you know so this track can be

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.170 
big lines you know so this track can be
frustrating<00:03:15.319> don't<00:03:15.739> get<00:03:15.860> me<00:03:16.010> wrong<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:17.060> I

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
frustrating don't get me wrong and I

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.030 
frustrating don't get me wrong and I
think<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.630> lot<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.049> people<00:03:18.319> struggle<00:03:18.769> with

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
think a lot of people struggle with

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.770 
think a lot of people struggle with
hitting<00:03:19.519> these<00:03:19.609> lines<00:03:19.850> consistently<00:03:20.569> and

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
hitting these lines consistently and

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.750 
hitting these lines consistently and
that's<00:03:21.230> cool<00:03:21.500> but<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.340> one<00:03:22.459> of<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.609> big

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
that's cool but this is one of the big

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.490 
that's cool but this is one of the big
lines<00:03:23.000> you've<00:03:23.359> got<00:03:23.630> to<00:03:23.840> hit<00:03:23.930> this<00:03:24.109> quad<00:03:24.470> you

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
lines you've got to hit this quad you

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.140 
lines you've got to hit this quad you
can<00:03:24.799> see<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.069> little<00:03:25.340> bit<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.609> a<00:03:25.670> case<00:03:25.880> I'm

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
can see a little bit of a case I'm

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.670 
can see a little bit of a case I'm
actually<00:03:26.359> cool<00:03:26.720> with<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.139> because<00:03:27.380> it's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
actually cool with that because it's

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
actually cool with that because it's
just<00:03:27.829> that<00:03:28.010> difficult

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
just that difficult

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.129 
just that difficult
and<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.090> didn't<00:03:29.329> take<00:03:29.450> away<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:29.900> much

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
and it didn't take away that much

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.720 
and it didn't take away that much
momentum<00:03:30.440> from<00:03:30.829> me<00:03:30.950> but<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.250> can<00:03:31.370> see<00:03:31.549> that's

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
momentum from me but you can see that's

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.370 
momentum from me but you can see that's
the<00:03:32.030> fast<00:03:32.209> line<00:03:32.510> through<00:03:32.780> there<00:03:32.930> you've<00:03:33.349> got

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
the fast line through there you've got

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.210 
the fast line through there you've got
to<00:03:33.739> hit<00:03:33.799> that<00:03:33.859> quar<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:35.620> love<00:03:36.620> scrubbing<00:03:37.099> this

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
to hit that quar I love scrubbing this

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.039 
to hit that quar I love scrubbing this
triple<00:03:37.579> that<00:03:37.730> wasn't<00:03:37.970> a<00:03:38.030> very<00:03:38.209> very<00:03:38.750> pretty

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
triple that wasn't a very very pretty

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.949 
triple that wasn't a very very pretty
scrub<00:03:39.530> by<00:03:39.709> any<00:03:39.889> means<00:03:40.160> but<00:03:40.630> there's<00:03:41.630> so<00:03:41.810> much

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
scrub by any means but there's so much

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.949 
scrub by any means but there's so much
fun<00:03:42.319> so<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:43.310> can<00:03:43.459> see<00:03:43.639> hopefully<00:03:43.970> I'm<00:03:44.720> glad

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
fun so so you can see hopefully I'm glad

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.360 
fun so so you can see hopefully I'm glad
that<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:45.169> hit<00:03:45.290> those<00:03:45.440> lines<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:45.980> can<00:03:46.160> just

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
that I hit those lines so you can just

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.940 
that I hit those lines so you can just
kind<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:46.519> see<00:03:46.730> what<00:03:46.970> I'm<00:03:47.180> talking<00:03:47.510> about<00:03:47.569> I<00:03:47.989> was

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
kind of see what I'm talking about I was

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.010 
kind of see what I'm talking about I was
gonna<00:03:49.250> try<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.489> square<00:03:49.819> that<00:03:50.060> up

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
gonna try to square that up

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.310 
gonna try to square that up
I<00:03:52.120> love<00:03:53.120> how<00:03:53.210> it<00:03:53.270> resets<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:53.900> right<00:03:54.170> when

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
I love how it resets you right when

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.260 
I love how it resets you right when
you're<00:03:54.440> about<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.650> get<00:03:54.830> back<00:03:54.980> on<00:03:55.130> track<00:03:55.270> you

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
you're about to get back on track you

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.390 
you're about to get back on track you
can<00:03:56.480> go<00:03:56.600> slow<00:03:56.960> here<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.530> hit<00:03:57.710> this<00:03:57.830> downside

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
can go slow here and hit this downside

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.310 
can go slow here and hit this downside
and<00:03:58.700> actually<00:03:59.150> jump<00:03:59.450> all<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.690> way<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.080> where

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
and actually jump all the way to where

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.260 
and actually jump all the way to where
you<00:04:00.410> want<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.620> be<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:01.670> that's<00:04:01.790> another<00:04:02.030> option

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
you want to be and that's another option

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.180 
you want to be and that's another option
you<00:04:02.510> can<00:04:02.630> go<00:04:02.720> inside<00:04:03.110> and<00:04:03.170> just<00:04:03.530> go<00:04:03.620> slow<00:04:03.920> over

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
you can go inside and just go slow over

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.640 
you can go inside and just go slow over
that<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.520> focus<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.150> your<00:04:05.270> landings<00:04:05.690> but<00:04:05.990> like

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
that and focus on your landings but like

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.560 
that and focus on your landings but like
I<00:04:06.770> said<00:04:06.830> again<00:04:07.370> if<00:04:07.790> you're<00:04:07.970> gonna<00:04:08.120> be<00:04:08.270> worrying

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
I said again if you're gonna be worrying

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.630 
I said again if you're gonna be worrying
about<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.900> stuff<00:04:09.200> you're<00:04:09.800> gonna<00:04:10.010> be<00:04:10.190> at<00:04:10.340> full

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
about that stuff you're gonna be at full

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.310 
about that stuff you're gonna be at full
speed<00:04:10.970> trying<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.510> get<00:04:11.630> that<00:04:11.750> perfect<00:04:12.020> lap

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
speed trying to get that perfect lap

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.040 
speed trying to get that perfect lap
time<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.970> you<00:04:14.060> may<00:04:14.210> as<00:04:14.270> well<00:04:14.390> do<00:04:14.660> it<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.900> right

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
time so you may as well do it the right

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.820 
time so you may as well do it the right
way<00:04:15.489> you<00:04:16.489> can<00:04:16.520> square<00:04:17.000> this<00:04:17.239> up<00:04:17.540> get<00:04:18.500> a<00:04:18.530> little

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
way you can square this up get a little

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.830 
way you can square this up get a little
bit<00:04:18.920> farther<00:04:19.040> in<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.400> inside<00:04:19.760> but<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:20.750> can

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
bit farther in the inside but you can

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.540 
bit farther in the inside but you can
see<00:04:21.080> it's<00:04:21.530> just<00:04:21.739> really<00:04:22.040> hard<00:04:22.220> to<00:04:22.280> hit<00:04:22.370> that

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
see it's just really hard to hit that

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.490 
see it's just really hard to hit that
middle<00:04:22.700> triple<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.630> set<00:04:23.840> you<00:04:23.930> up<00:04:23.990> perfectly

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
middle triple to set you up perfectly

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.410 
middle triple to set you up perfectly
for<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.800> quad<00:04:25.040> out<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:25.790> that's<00:04:26.000> probably<00:04:26.300> the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
for the quad out so that's probably the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.270 
for the quad out so that's probably the
hardest<00:04:26.450> rhythm<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.200> be<00:04:27.260> dead<00:04:27.500> honest<00:04:27.860> the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
hardest rhythm to be dead honest the

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.020 
hardest rhythm to be dead honest the
other<00:04:28.400> one's<00:04:28.610> difficult<00:04:29.060> but<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.360> has<00:04:30.970> not<00:04:31.970> a

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
other one's difficult but it has not a

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.970 
other one's difficult but it has not a
safety<00:04:32.360> but<00:04:32.810> something<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.530> can<00:04:33.680> fall<00:04:33.950> back

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
safety but something you can fall back

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.650 
safety but something you can fall back
on<00:04:34.550> I<00:04:34.610> guess<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:36.310> don't<00:04:37.310> know<00:04:37.490> it's<00:04:37.940> it's<00:04:38.360> really

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
on I guess I don't know it's it's really

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.170 
on I guess I don't know it's it's really
cool<00:04:39.020> how<00:04:39.290> how<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:39.830> have<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.460> be<00:04:40.580> on<00:04:40.760> your<00:04:41.000> game

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
cool how how you have to be on your game

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.480 
cool how how you have to be on your game
to<00:04:41.720> go<00:04:41.840> fast<00:04:42.080> on<00:04:42.290> this<00:04:42.410> track<00:04:42.680> but<00:04:43.010> admittedly

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
to go fast on this track but admittedly

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.810 
to go fast on this track but admittedly
it<00:04:43.880> can<00:04:44.150> piss<00:04:44.510> you<00:04:44.630> off<00:04:45.130> tracks<00:04:46.130> like<00:04:46.310> this<00:04:46.520> can

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
it can piss you off tracks like this can

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.150 
it can piss you off tracks like this can
be<00:04:47.120> fun<00:04:47.750> one<00:04:48.020> day<00:04:48.230> and<00:04:48.500> then<00:04:48.590> you<00:04:48.620> just<00:04:48.860> can't

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
be fun one day and then you just can't

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.640 
be fun one day and then you just can't
hit<00:04:49.340> it<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.550> next<00:04:49.760> day<00:04:50.000> and<00:04:50.240> you<00:04:50.810> just<00:04:51.020> want<00:04:51.320> to

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
hit it the next day and you just want to

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.280 
hit it the next day and you just want to
kill<00:04:52.520> moto<00:04:52.850> a<00:04:52.940> go<00:04:53.180> go<00:04:53.360> for<00:04:53.570> make<00:04:53.720> it<00:04:53.870> but<00:04:54.200> you

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
kill moto a go go for make it but you

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.440 
kill moto a go go for make it but you
can<00:04:54.410> see<00:04:54.590> there<00:04:55.280> is<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.970> rhythm<00:04:56.120> that<00:04:56.330> you

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
can see there is the rhythm that you

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
can see there is the rhythm that you
want<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.750> be<00:04:56.810> hitting<00:04:56.990> through<00:04:57.200> there<00:04:57.350> it's

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
want to be hitting through there it's

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.510 
want to be hitting through there it's
always<00:04:57.620> fun<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.890> throw<00:04:57.980> try<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.340> throw<00:04:58.490> a

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
always fun to throw try to throw a

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.940 
always fun to throw try to throw a
little<00:04:58.640> bit<00:04:58.730> of<00:04:58.880> style<00:04:59.180> through<00:04:59.570> it<00:04:59.920> again<00:05:00.920> I

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
little bit of style through it again I

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.200 
little bit of style through it again I
usually<00:05:01.340> hit<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.580> inside<00:05:02.500> see<00:05:03.500> why<00:05:03.680> not<00:05:04.210> you

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
usually hit the inside see why not you

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.790 
usually hit the inside see why not you
can<00:05:05.360> see<00:05:05.600> a<00:05:05.630> scrubbed<00:05:06.080> a<00:05:06.170> little<00:05:06.440> bit<00:05:06.590> there<00:05:06.770> so

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
can see a scrubbed a little bit there so

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.890 
can see a scrubbed a little bit there so
tiny<00:05:07.340> bit<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.640> case<00:05:07.880> but<00:05:08.270> let's<00:05:08.510> try<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.690> just

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
tiny bit of a case but let's try to just

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.750 
tiny bit of a case but let's try to just
carry<00:05:09.140> as<00:05:09.260> much<00:05:09.410> momentum<00:05:09.770> through<00:05:10.400> here<00:05:10.670> as

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
carry as much momentum through here as

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.040 
carry as much momentum through here as
possible<00:05:11.270> a<00:05:12.850> little<00:05:13.850> bit<00:05:14.090> of<00:05:14.180> a<00:05:14.240> case<00:05:14.450> still<00:05:14.780> so

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
possible a little bit of a case still so

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.660 
possible a little bit of a case still so
I'll<00:05:15.140> do<00:05:15.350> this<00:05:15.470> little<00:05:15.680> triple<00:05:16.070> single<00:05:16.490> but

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
I'll do this little triple single but

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.490 
I'll do this little triple single but
it's<00:05:16.790> not<00:05:16.940> really<00:05:17.180> what<00:05:17.330> you<00:05:17.360> want<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.750> do<00:05:17.930> but

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
it's not really what you want to do but

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.560 
it's not really what you want to do but
I<00:05:18.560> think<00:05:18.650> I've<00:05:18.860> shown<00:05:19.070> that<00:05:19.130> I<00:05:19.670> don't<00:05:20.480> know<00:05:20.540> I

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
I think I've shown that I don't know I

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.270 
I think I've shown that I don't know I
usually<00:05:20.900> feel<00:05:21.230> pretty<00:05:21.500> confident<00:05:22.010> on<00:05:22.040> a<00:05:22.100> lot

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
usually feel pretty confident on a lot

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.240 
usually feel pretty confident on a lot
of<00:05:22.370> these<00:05:22.460> tracks<00:05:22.730> and<00:05:23.380> this<00:05:24.380> one<00:05:24.620> this<00:05:25.040> one

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
of these tracks and this one this one

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.090 
of these tracks and this one this one
can<00:05:25.430> catch<00:05:25.580> you<00:05:25.730> out<00:05:25.820> sometimes<00:05:26.650> so<00:05:27.650> I<00:05:27.950> don't

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
can catch you out sometimes so I don't

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.940 
can catch you out sometimes so I don't
