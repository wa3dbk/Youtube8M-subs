see in a doc and even if we could eating

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.539 
see in a doc and even if we could eating
would<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.379> the<00:02:37.500> last<00:02:37.680> thing<00:02:37.829> on<00:02:38.099> our<00:02:38.129> mind

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
would be the last thing on our mind

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.910 
would be the last thing on our mind
because<00:02:39.359> when<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.599> Sun<00:02:39.840> Goes<00:02:40.079> Down<00:02:40.109> we<00:02:40.349> know

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
because when the Sun Goes Down we know

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.039 
because when the Sun Goes Down we know
that<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.430> time<00:02:41.609> to<00:02:41.640> go<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.030> sleep<00:02:42.359> this<00:02:42.989> is

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
that it's time to go to sleep this is

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.319 
that it's time to go to sleep this is
why<00:02:43.379> US<00:02:43.560> monkeys<00:02:44.040> are<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.430> healthy<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.000> strong

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
why US monkeys are so healthy and strong

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.069 
why US monkeys are so healthy and strong
and<00:02:45.980> we<00:02:46.980> don't<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.639> same<00:02:47.849> diseases<00:02:48.329> that

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
and we don't have the same diseases that

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.559 
and we don't have the same diseases that
humans<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.670> why<00:02:50.849> we're<00:02:51.180> not<00:02:51.209> so

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
humans get and this is why we're not so

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.740 
humans get and this is why we're not so
obese<00:02:52.069> that<00:02:53.069> we<00:02:53.280> need<00:02:53.879> to<00:02:54.030> read<00:02:54.209> diet<00:02:54.450> books

and<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.480> didn't<00:03:39.690> work<00:03:39.810> out<00:03:39.989> too<00:03:40.230> well<00:03:40.260> for<00:03:40.590> him

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
and it didn't work out too well for him

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.750 
and it didn't work out too well for him
he<00:03:42.299> was<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.599> hippopotamus<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.709> we<00:03:44.489> used<00:03:44.669> to

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
he was a hippopotamus and we used to

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.640 
he was a hippopotamus and we used to
ride<00:03:44.970> him<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.599> play<00:03:45.750> with<00:03:45.780> him<00:03:45.989> all<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.409> time

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
ride him and play with him all the time

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.339 
ride him and play with him all the time
and<00:03:47.040> he<00:03:47.430> was<00:03:47.549> very<00:03:47.790> healthy<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.389> fit<00:03:48.659> and<00:03:48.870> we

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
and he was very healthy and fit and we

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.830 
and he was very healthy and fit and we
used<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.530> love<00:03:49.769> playing<00:03:49.829> around<00:03:50.370> with<00:03:50.639> him<00:03:50.909> but

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
used to love playing around with him but

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.599 
used to love playing around with him but
then<00:03:52.049> slowly<00:03:52.349> but<00:03:52.709> surely<00:03:52.739> he<00:03:53.250> started

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
then slowly but surely he started

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.490 
then slowly but surely he started
putting<00:03:53.879> on<00:03:54.000> weight<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.540> we<00:03:55.019> couldn't<00:03:55.319> figure

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
putting on weight and we couldn't figure

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.089 
putting on weight and we couldn't figure
