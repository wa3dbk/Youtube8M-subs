00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
I'm on the fence so I'm building up a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.270 
I'm on the fence so I'm building up a
little<00:01:20.009> army<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:21.950> rucksacks<00:01:23.479> feel<00:01:24.479> cots<00:01:25.250> but<00:01:26.250> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
little army of rucksacks feel cots but I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
little army of rucksacks feel cots but I
just<00:01:26.550> call<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.820> Coleman<00:01:28.490> icebox<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.390> stuff

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930

like<00:01:31.080> that<00:01:31.229> I'm<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.380> gathering<00:01:31.770> stuff<00:01:32.400> from

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
like that I'm just gathering stuff from

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.380 
like that I'm just gathering stuff from
what<00:01:32.820> my<00:01:33.090> spare<00:01:33.390> boxes<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.110> donor<00:01:34.950> kits<00:01:35.390> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
what my spare boxes and donor kits and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.090 
what my spare boxes and donor kits and
I'm<00:01:36.540> building<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:37.020> enough<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.920> fill<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
I'm building up enough to fill the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.280 
I'm building up enough to fill the
bustles<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.360> should<00:01:39.509> keep<00:01:39.750> me<00:01:39.870> busy<00:01:40.020> for

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
bustles so that should keep me busy for

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.180 
bustles so that should keep me busy for
the<00:01:40.350> next<00:01:40.380> couple<00:01:40.830> of<00:01:40.860> weeks

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
the next couple of weeks

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.490 
the next couple of weeks
painting<00:01:42.030> those<00:01:42.240> weathering<00:01:42.870> dough's<00:01:43.080> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
painting those weathering dough's and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.469 
painting those weathering dough's and
hopefully<00:01:44.220> build<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.700> some<00:01:45.270> sort<00:01:45.420> of

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
hopefully build up some sort of

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.950 
hopefully build up some sort of
confidence<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.620> attack<00:01:47.400> this<00:01:47.960> weathering

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
confidence and in attack this weathering

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.010 
confidence and in attack this weathering
project<00:01:49.500> head-on<00:01:50.159> because<00:01:51.020> it's<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.750> sad

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
project head-on because it's it is sad

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.149 
project head-on because it's it is sad
in<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.290> way<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.500> actually<00:01:56.600> wash<00:01:57.600> off<00:01:57.960> an<00:01:58.290> entire

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
in a way to actually wash off an entire

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.969 
in a way to actually wash off an entire
NATO<00:01:59.700> 3<00:02:00.120> tone<00:02:00.330> scheme<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:01.770> hard

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
NATO 3 tone scheme because it's so hard

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.550 
NATO 3 tone scheme because it's so hard
to<00:02:02.130> actually<00:02:02.700> replicate<00:02:02.940> well<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.810> I'm

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
to actually replicate well and I'm

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.469 
to actually replicate well and I'm
pretty<00:02:04.830> happy<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.090> would<00:02:06.270> really

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
pretty happy with it and I would really

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.840 
pretty happy with it and I would really
hate<00:02:06.720> myself<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:08.010> just<00:02:08.280> cover<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.700> whole

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
hate myself to to just cover the whole

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
hate myself to to just cover the whole
thing<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.830> dust<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:12.600> lose<00:02:12.840> it

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
going or not so I got a couple decals to

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.930 
going or not so I got a couple decals to
put<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:18.989> mostly<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.920> CIP<00:02:20.340> panels<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.880> you
