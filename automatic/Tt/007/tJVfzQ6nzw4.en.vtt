00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.650
 hello everybody says whats Christ 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.300
 Forgiven I was caught bringing me one more 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.259
 This time I'll teach you how to do the 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.320
 hdr effect in two ways a difficult vote 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.689
 and an easy way I find an easy way 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.150
 more beautiful than it is difficult but the most 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.119
 difficult is more customizable say 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.100
 so let's here first unlock 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.460
 the background becomes a sound of 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.360
 funk layer i'll start with a mode 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:46.760
 I easily came here with the settings and 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.649
 iac hdr tonalization will tell you that it will 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.019
 need to call if you have more 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.969
 a layer that will find them all if you click 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.870
 in yes 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.829
 hence her presence here the image tea 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.019
 with weak hdr effect 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.519
 here you will have this field of pre 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.220
 definitions that will be made 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:16.870
 city ​​dusk type is 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:21.530
 saturated and passes the contrast surrealist 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:29.210
 Monochrome is pretty cool also goes 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:32.180
 I'm going to use the example here and 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:39.470
 here we can do the adaptation 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:54.170
 place can choose an exhibition of 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:56.420
 range the darker image local time I 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.170
 I'm going to lower it a little, it's too much. 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.170
 burst here 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:08.180
 find a little 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:10.940
 and the intensity is also equal to 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:15.860
 cool height is done 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:19.480
 tone and detail is new range exposure 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.000
 only in this case did I increase the range of the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.520
 detail tones you can see the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.390
 difference of the clouds I'll leave or 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.650
 maximum exposure can take up 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.840
 dark 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.500
 if I put too much history the brightness 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.240
 so this one I'm going to leave not even 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.110
 strong and not so weak here in the middle is the 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.550
 detail can see details of the image that 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.860
 I'll leave at the maximum 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.010
 I will not take away a little case of brightness 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.370
 of the clouds of buildings here crying I 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:01.130
 little advanced shooting shadows 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:06.430
 I know the world is nothing here 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.880
 world world's enhancement is a good thing 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.310
 discreet 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.270
 But this here changes the vibrations a lot 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.040
 activity 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.870
 I took effective when you see images 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.239
 in saturation 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.200
 if I put the image very alive then 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:25.250
 I'll put it in the middle and here 's the 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.670
 saturation that I'm going to put in the middle 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.670
 also 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.900
 and here are the curves I'm going to download a 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.379
 little here to do this curvature with her 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.909
 and pull the other one here I'll do it there 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:45.620
 this peak effect is unknown name 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.620
 in the picture and I'll give you an okay 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:54.090
 This is an easy way to serve here. 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:04:01.230
 image adjustment effects here to update 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:05.540
 hdr and now I'm going to teach the other module to 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:10.459
 dengue with that car picture 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.459
 come on first turn into layer 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:18.090
 three times to do 3 which is called 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.630
 comes in the first view taken 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:26.400
 of the other two here on the first I came 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:32.849
 images fit shadows and real if I go 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:34.860
 put 60 and 61 difference here 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:42.000
 enough of the brightness since it had on the screen 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.919
 Car in natural color takes the 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.860
 and comes to the layer of 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:56.840
 copy 2 can place direct light and 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.220
 squeeze against the alt the saturation patch 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.139
 automatically goes to 0 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.370
 not here and has already given this effect well 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.550
 different right 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.340
 now we go in the copy layer 3 to 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:18.620
 first layer from above come here light 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.620
 direct filter blur gause year 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.210
 put 30 ac 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.410
 but 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:34.500
 does not put 30 with very strong there and was 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:37.300
 34 and I'm going to hit all the layers 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.220
 hold the shift press the last 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:44.639
 call to have control for the xata 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:49.139
 all then this is the manual hdr effect 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.139
 It's very cool, you can see it too. 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.110
 so that's it folks liked and subscribe 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.539

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.590
 video leave your like if you liked it 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.150
 like you can leave the dislike comments

 it is 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.680
 a hug until the next video and Czech
