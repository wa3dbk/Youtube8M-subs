 and postpone friend and neighbor I hope 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.230
 that are very well bundled and gathered at 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.900
 gameplay that from then I had is 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.820
 waiting a lot for the Atlantic 1 this 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.619
 secret that you are therefore the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.380
 memories of his little childhood that 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.570
 they played it at some time and then almost 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.429
 all of us gamers play them in 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.130
 some time is our childhood 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.470
 revived this is reincarnation of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.909
 our childhood I do not know how to say it but 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.130
 good welcome to this new gameplay 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.680
 I hope you like it because in a video 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.539
 in a comment I asked this that they have 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.149
 since if it went up from type of games 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.769
 that exists if they would like to see them and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.019
 They said yes and no problem that 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.739
 It was chingón and so good to see us 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:49.199
 here I have planned to upload many games 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.570
 retro games play 1 I know that that is not 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.550
 the theme of my channel but good is what 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 that I like and I do not only like them 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.550
 I like these pods but I do not like 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.469
 a lot of playing it because as you know it's from 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.090
 scares I would like more to focus on 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.020
 this type of games 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.340
 that are pink happy chingones that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.750
 also make me review for a while the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.940
 true to not be as easy as 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.290
 I am 100% sure that many of 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.720
 you will know that it is not the easiest 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.640
 of the world that they actually say from the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.140
 crash bandicoot more difficult and well then 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.690
 we'll be about to see that 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.880
 I would also like to ask you to stay 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.950
 until the end so that they see what they 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.780
 I'm going to say why there's going to be a hashtag 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.750
 a hashtag that they will be able to use in their 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.760
 small means 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.610
 Washington is going to see this one a hamster 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.100
 in which they will press on the small 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.509
 comments and well that hashtag is going 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.119
 to be so that they have a voice of vote and 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.920
 reactive to comment on this video 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.009
 this male to the wta can comment what 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.210
 they can put poop and not fart but good 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.360
 this what will allow this 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.700
 comment is good that hashtag rather 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.050
 is this to say how is it 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.660
 appearing what they thought the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.539
 gameplay like this these first 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.950
 levels are relatively easy and a 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.729
 little shorts we are going to lengthen a bit 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:10.000
 we are going to do it as of this one that 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.820
 like 3 nothing 2 2 levels only 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.800
 air in this same episode also that 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.150
 tell them that it is not a 100% gameplay or 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.950
 either can not complete that at the level of 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.220
 that breaks all the numerous charges not 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.350
 is going to be the case and well yes, welcome to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.630
 his childhood 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.430
 I also want to touch a topic a bit 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.700
 delicate is then also if they want 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.430
 you what would be recommend topics 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.840
 for the next gameplay they leave the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.220
 comments also that if you do not need 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.550
 show hashtag in turn and at the end 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.930
 but if many of you do not 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.300
 they want me to do this kind of 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.310
 comments of gameplay if that because 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.230
 they just want to see capture forgiveness 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.410
 vanessa paradis and the stupid tasks 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.730
 that I have to goal that they are bullshit 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:58.340
 but what happened is that 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.390
 blacks in a video of 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.690
 well that says of gameplay deivid fredys 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.300
 Well, they end up, they dedicated this to things 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.769
 that you comment on the cock is a criticism 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.989
 constructive I do not want you to be offended and 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.760
 sorry I was not offended but 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.540
 good if they did not want to see the video 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.220
 they could have removed not then this one 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.140
 They do not like how they comment they do not like it 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.930
 Do not make videos that are not theories 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.549
 this I guess they say that I saw myself very 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.290
 stupid the comment is the video and 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.840
 Well, that's my way of being and 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.640
 you will know what data of laughter 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.519
 you are and sometimes not laughing it's because I'm 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.380
 a black'm an asshole but good 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.150
 Most of the time I try to laugh 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.579
 to be able to bring you are a bit of 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.280
 entertainment a bit of good time he 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.860
 They know that I'm always saying something 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.620
 god something like that chingón like this 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.440
 since it is beautiful and that thanks to him 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.930
 there is what we can bring this day to 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.459
 channel a different gameplay a gameplay 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.860
 in which we're going to put a little more 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.299
 variety to the channel because also many 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.620
 friends that I have a fact as bidders 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.389
 by parenthesis that you are going to do when 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.940
 pay for those planned new claims or 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.740
 when there is nothing else to do 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.630
 and that's what I'm doing by moving 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.930
 towards the future 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:18.359
 let's go up retro games we're not going to 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.820
 well as it is said and passwords that I do 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.380
 here now we will not stop climbing 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.560
 videos just because they were super no longer 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.389
 have nothing to offer us and then I 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.160
 I think this is going to be one of the new 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.210
 thematic of the retro chromos channel in what 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.430
 that we can this fucking mother in what 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.500
 we can this 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.630
 have a captive and be able to capture 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.680
 Xbox things and be able to play with you 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.540
 a call of duty this type I hope so it goes 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.340
 to be this the new theme we are going to 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.530
 upload several games well that this does not 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.180
 planned several this pro person this 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.850
 we are going to talk in other videos 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.820
 also in fact this is the hashtag 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.300
 einhorn discards that they are going to use that for 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.430
 what by the way is coming because they are going to 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.650
 can tell us to scale be instructed the 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.390
 series I did not like I want you not to follow 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.650
 with doing and the truth is that although neither 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.880
 If you want, even if you do not want to continue 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.930
 I will continue because it is one of my games 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.259
 childhood favorites 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.120
 and then if I have several games 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:20.110
 planned before finishing the video 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.960

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.490
 we will also see is going to continue 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.460

 Stay tuned I know that many would like 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.930
 for this shores but the time that I was 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.660

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.840
 leave them to a special expression 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.090
 for something like that if you look at 63 and then 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.919
 let's get other theories but good 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.960
 then the hashtag that they will use to 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.060
