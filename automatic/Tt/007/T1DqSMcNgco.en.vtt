earning<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.220> goes<00:01:14.369> well<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.600> do

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
earning it goes well what you can do

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.940 
earning it goes well what you can do
with<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> multi<00:01:16.320> Pro<00:01:16.500> which<00:01:16.619> takes<00:01:16.830> about

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
with a multi Pro which takes about

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.399 
with a multi Pro which takes about
compromise<00:01:17.580> away<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> lose<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> tiny<00:01:19.200> bit

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
compromise away so you lose a tiny bit

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.960 
compromise away so you lose a tiny bit
of<00:01:19.500> ride<00:01:19.680> comfort<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> handling<00:01:20.729> will<00:01:20.850> be

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
of ride comfort but the handling will be

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
of ride comfort but the handling will be
utterly<00:01:21.330> focused<00:01:22.080> feel<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.040> colour<00:01:23.250> driver

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
utterly focused feel that colour driver

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:40.410 
utterly focused feel that colour driver
definitely<00:01:24.479> kid<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.179 

so<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.020> multi<00:01:42.289> pro<00:01:42.439> r2<00:01:42.859> it's<00:01:43.070> got

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
so this is the multi pro r2 it's got

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.770 
so this is the multi pro r2 it's got
some<00:01:43.340> other<00:01:43.490> lovely<00:01:43.850> design<00:01:44.090> features<00:01:44.569> and<00:01:44.719> it

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
some other lovely design features and it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.359 
some other lovely design features and it
all<00:01:44.840> starts<00:01:45.200> here<00:01:45.229> this<00:01:45.979> remote<00:01:46.219> from

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
all starts here this remote from

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.219 
all starts here this remote from
reservoir<00:01:46.789> it's<00:01:47.240> got<00:01:47.359> its<00:01:47.479> own<00:01:47.630> separate<00:01:48.020> bump

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
reservoir it's got its own separate bump

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.690 
reservoir it's got its own separate bump
adjustment<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:49.130> also<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.460> fight<00:01:49.609> you're

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
adjustment and also the fight you're

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.190 
adjustment and also the fight you're

running all this extra all volume means

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.990 
running all this extra all volume means
that<00:01:51.439> when<00:01:51.770> you're<00:01:51.860> pressing<00:01:52.069> on<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.819> all<00:01:52.939> is

that when you're pressing on the all is

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.399 
that when you're pressing on the all is
not<00:01:53.119> going<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.299> get<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:53.539> hot<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.959> damping<00:01:54.259> rate

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
not going to get so hot the damping rate

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.749 
not going to get so hot the damping rate
it's<00:01:54.500> gonna<00:01:54.619> remain<00:01:54.829> more<00:01:55.009> consistent

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
it's gonna remain more consistent

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.699 
it's gonna remain more consistent
we've<00:01:56.149> got<00:01:56.299> stainless<00:01:56.750> steel<00:01:56.899> braided<00:01:57.200> teflon

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
we've got stainless steel braided teflon

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:59.319 
we've got stainless steel braided teflon
lines<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.429> going<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.850> damper<00:01:59.119> unit

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
lines and going to the damper unit

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.809 
lines and going to the damper unit
itself<00:01:59.659> this<00:02:00.380> is<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.590> mono<00:02:00.890> tube<00:02:01.130> unit<00:02:01.429> so<00:02:01.549> again

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
itself this is a mono tube unit so again

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.279 
itself this is a mono tube unit so again
that<00:02:02.270> helps<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.539> key<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:02.780> also<00:02:02.929> temperature

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
that helps to key that also temperature

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.809 
that helps to key that also temperature
far<00:02:03.619> more<00:02:03.770> consistent<00:02:04.069> when<00:02:04.340> you're<00:02:04.490> lapping

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
far more consistent when you're lapping

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.969 
far more consistent when you're lapping
lap<00:02:05.000> after<00:02:05.179> lap<00:02:05.390> cars<00:02:06.259> gonna<00:02:06.469> feel<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.770> same

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
lap after lap cars gonna feel the same

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.969 
lap after lap cars gonna feel the same
this<00:02:07.849> brings<00:02:08.149> these<00:02:08.780> RI<00:02:08.959> back<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.470> RS<00:02:09.709> spring

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
this brings these RI back in RS spring

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.680 
this brings these RI back in RS spring
so<00:02:10.099> you<00:02:10.130> can<00:02:10.340> choose<00:02:10.610> softer<00:02:11.360> or<00:02:11.480> stiffer

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
so you can choose softer or stiffer

specialist

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.410 

it's<00:02:55.310> not<00:02:55.490> only<00:02:55.640> handling<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.150> can<00:02:56.330> be

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
it's not only handling that can be

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.210 
it's not only handling that can be

there<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:03.920> go<00:03:04.010> multi<00:03:04.370> Pro<00:03:04.550> kick<00:03:04.790> fitted<00:03:05.240> fully

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
there you go multi Pro kick fitted fully

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.780 
there you go multi Pro kick fitted fully
aligned<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.530> properly<00:03:06.950> corner<00:03:07.310> waiting

so<00:03:08.030> our<00:03:08.150> SGI<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.600> equipped<00:03:08.960> like<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.140> race<00:03:09.380> car

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
so our SGI is equipped like a race car

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680 
so our SGI is equipped like a race car
but<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.160> question<00:03:10.490> is<00:03:10.580> does<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.000> handle<00:03:11.540> like

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
but the question is does it handle like

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:40.580 
but the question is does it handle like
the<00:03:11.810> race<00:03:11.960> car<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.640> answer<00:03:22.970> oh<00:03:23.320> yes

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.960 

so<00:03:41.590> it's<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.769> disability<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.340> multi<00:03:42.670> Pro<00:03:42.790> that

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
so it's the disability of multi Pro that

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.979 
so it's the disability of multi Pro that
makes<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.209> so<00:03:43.330> easy<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.659> live<00:03:43.780> with

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
makes it so easy to live with

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.839 
makes it so easy to live with

expect when I about kit handling really

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.130 
expect when I about kit handling really
is<00:04:12.340> he<00:04:12.430> strongest<00:04:12.940> soon<00:04:13.150> as<00:04:13.660> we<00:04:13.780> come<00:04:13.930> up<00:04:14.019> the

so after an afternoon of playing with a
multi<00:04:48.220> pro<00:04:48.370> kit<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.730> think<00:04:49.030> it's<00:04:49.120> pretty

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
multi pro kit I think it's pretty

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.390 
multi pro kit I think it's pretty
immense<00:04:49.600> but<00:04:50.140> then<00:04:50.260> what<00:04:50.740> do<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:50.890> know<00:04:51.130> I'm<00:04:51.310> not

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
immense but then what do I know I'm not

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.590
