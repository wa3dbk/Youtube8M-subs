00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.370 
you know like the switch was pretty
heavy<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.960> if<00:01:58.050> you<00:01:58.110> wanna<00:01:58.260> do

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
heavy on you and so if you wanna do

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.850 
heavy on you and so if you wanna do
freestyle

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
freestyle

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.960 
freestyle
I<00:01:59.010> guess<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.370> could<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.580> you<00:01:59.640> want<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> do

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
I guess you could if you want to do

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.680 
I guess you could if you want to do
that's<00:02:00.810> not<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.229> my<00:02:01.320> thing<00:02:01.580> but<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.690> sliding

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
that's not really my thing but a sliding

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.660 
that's not really my thing but a sliding
in<00:02:03.900> general<00:02:04.260> for<00:02:05.070> um<00:02:05.720> for<00:02:06.720> sliding<00:02:06.990> like

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
in general for um for sliding like

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.039 
in general for um for sliding like
Coleman's<00:02:08.670> laid-back<00:02:09.000> stuff<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.810> push

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
Coleman's laid-back stuff like that push

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.620 
Coleman's laid-back stuff like that push
up<00:02:10.200> slides<00:02:10.459> it's<00:02:11.459> really<00:02:11.700> good<00:02:11.879> because<00:02:12.150> like

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
up slides it's really good because like

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.530 
up slides it's really good because like
I<00:02:12.750> said<00:02:12.810> earlier<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:13.500> concave<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.160> really

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
I said earlier this concave is really

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.500 
I said earlier this concave is really
in<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.140> end<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.739> know<00:02:15.860> but<00:02:16.760> that's<00:02:16.849> hard<00:02:17.480> to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
in the end you know but that's hard to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.979 
in the end you know but that's hard to
discuss<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.579> carving<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:19.870> names<00:02:20.870> a

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
discuss that and carving the names a

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.589 
discuss that and carving the names a
drop<00:02:21.200> card<00:02:21.439> it's<00:02:21.620> pretty<00:02:21.829> obvious<00:02:22.129> so<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.760> guess

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
drop card it's pretty obvious so I guess

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.830 
drop card it's pretty obvious so I guess
if<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.900> don't<00:02:24.079> run<00:02:24.290> like<00:02:25.099> teeny<00:02:25.939> tight<00:02:26.180> you

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
if you don't run like teeny tight you

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.630 
if you don't run like teeny tight you
know<00:02:26.959> trucks<00:02:27.409> you're<00:02:28.189> gonna<00:02:28.280> be<00:02:28.430> carving

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
know trucks you're gonna be carving

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.420 
know trucks you're gonna be carving
pretty<00:02:28.970> well<00:02:29.150> on<00:02:29.299> that<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:31.040> know<00:02:31.159> and<00:02:31.310> it's

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
pretty well on that you know and it's

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.830 
pretty well on that you know and it's
drop<00:02:31.640> there<00:02:31.790> too<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.209> kind<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.390> adds<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.629> it

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
drop there too so it kind of adds to it

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.430 
drop there too so it kind of adds to it
so<00:02:33.739> that<00:02:34.010> was<00:02:34.310> my<00:02:34.459> take<00:02:34.730> on<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.239> UM<00:02:35.420> laying<00:02:36.319> out

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
so that was my take on the UM laying out

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.890 
so that was my take on the UM laying out
shop<00:02:36.650> car<00:02:36.860> forty<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.519> hope<00:02:38.299> it<00:02:38.450> helped<00:02:38.629> you<00:02:38.690> dog

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
this is comparing it to be a load of tan

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.780 
this is comparing it to be a load of tan
