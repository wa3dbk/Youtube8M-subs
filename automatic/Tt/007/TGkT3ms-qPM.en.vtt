Chelsea<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.859> Chelsea<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.160> like<00:00:23.340> Chelsea

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
Chelsea I like Chelsea I like Chelsea

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040 
Chelsea I like Chelsea I like Chelsea
from<00:00:23.760> last<00:00:23.939> season<00:00:24.269> though<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.600> they

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
from last season though and they

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.689 
from last season though and they
underachieved<00:00:25.890> dramatically<00:00:26.580> because

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
underachieved dramatically because

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.429 
underachieved dramatically because
Mourinho<00:00:27.150> lowered<00:00:27.480> everyone's<00:00:27.750> expectations

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
Mourinho lowered everyone's expectations

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.140 
Mourinho lowered everyone's expectations
and<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.279> they<00:00:29.580> could<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:29.820> done<00:00:30.000> much

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and I think they could have done much

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.880 
and I think they could have done much
better<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.750> probably<00:00:30.990> will<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.800> as

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
better and they probably will do just as

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.080 
better and they probably will do just as
well<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.189> season<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.550> think<00:00:32.700> they<00:00:32.759> will<00:00:32.910> chat

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
well this season I think they will chat

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.880 
well this season I think they will chat
they'll<00:00:33.239> challenge<00:00:33.390> City<00:00:33.930> much<00:00:34.200> further<00:00:34.559> I

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
they'll challenge City much further I

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.160 
they'll challenge City much further I
think<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.700> they've<00:00:36.000> certainly<00:00:36.210> got<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.480> few

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
think so and they've certainly got a few

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.619 
think so and they've certainly got a few
more<00:00:37.320> attacking<00:00:37.829> options<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.430> think<00:00:38.640> Mourinho

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
more attacking options I think Mourinho

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.080 
more attacking options I think Mourinho
seven<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> little<00:00:40.290> bit<00:00:40.410> trouble<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
seven a little bit trouble with the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.580 
seven a little bit trouble with the
under-21<00:00:42.090> British<00:00:42.570> rule<00:00:42.809> you've<00:00:43.260> got<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
under-21 British rule you've got have a

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.869 
under-21 British rule you've got have a
home<00:00:43.800> gone<00:00:44.149> squad<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:47.039> does<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.760> why

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
home gone squad and I just does and why

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.400 
home gone squad and I just does and why
he<00:00:48.059> didn't<00:00:48.300> bring<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.600> car<00:00:48.809> coup<00:00:48.960> back<00:00:49.200> he

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
he didn't bring the car coup back he

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
he didn't bring the car coup back he
would<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.620> counted<00:00:49.770> weirdly<00:00:50.610> enough<00:00:50.820> being

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
would have counted weirdly enough being

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.229 
would have counted weirdly enough being
Belgian<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> mongrel<00:00:52.170> yeah<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.309> he's<00:00:53.430> 20<00:00:53.820> 21

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
Belgian as a mongrel yeah and he's 20 21

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.549 
Belgian as a mongrel yeah and he's 20 21

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
so he's just on the cusp and that would

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.229 
so he's just on the cusp and that would
have<00:00:55.649> been<00:00:55.710> fine<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.190> he's<00:00:56.850> having<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> off

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
that role hold up the ball lay off and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
try and get yourself into a ghost

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
try and get yourself into a ghost
scoring<00:01:47.009> position<00:01:47.399> he's<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> heck<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
scoring position he's a heck of a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.999 
scoring position he's a heck of a
footballer<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.869> even<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.409> his<00:01:49.530> advanced

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
footballer and even at his advanced

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.770 
footballer and even at his advanced
years<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.909> he<00:01:50.970> showed<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> world<00:01:51.570> cup

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
years I think he showed in the world cup

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.210 
years I think he showed in the world cup
he<00:01:51.930> still<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:52.320> something<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> offer<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.040> think

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
he still got something to offer I think

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.440 
he still got something to offer I think
certainly<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> squad<00:01:53.850> player<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
certainly is a squad player and the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.510 
certainly is a squad player and the
weird<00:01:54.600> thing<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.810> obviously<00:01:55.170> as<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.070> striker

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
weird thing is obviously as a striker

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.740 
weird thing is obviously as a striker
most<00:01:56.850> people<00:01:57.090> expect<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.509> score<00:01:57.689> goals

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
most people expect you to score goals

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.929 
most people expect you to score goals
but<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.890> much<00:01:59.009> about<00:01:59.250> assists<00:01:59.759> now

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
but it is just as much about assists now

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.280 
but it is just as much about assists now
and<00:02:00.180> bringing<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> rest<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.869> team<00:02:01.020> into

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
and bringing the rest of the team into

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.749 
and bringing the rest of the team into
it<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.890> sense<00:02:02.130> his<00:02:02.340> role<00:02:02.579> is

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it and in that sense his role is

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.490 
it and in that sense his role is
changing<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.930> probably<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.229> good<00:02:04.320> thing

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
changing so it's probably a good thing

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.870 
changing so it's probably a good thing
he<00:02:04.590> looks<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.920> tribute<00:02:05.310> act<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:05.759> he's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
he looks like a tribute act because he's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.280 
he looks like a tribute act because he's
going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.240> helping<00:02:06.540> everyone<00:02:06.899> out<00:02:07.049> around

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
going to be helping everyone out around

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.600 
going to be helping everyone out around
him<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> things<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.489> can

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
him I think one of the things you can

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.710 
him I think one of the things you can
almost<00:02:08.729> guarantee<00:02:08.970> about<00:02:09.300> drug<00:02:09.539> where<00:02:09.660> is

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
almost guarantee about drug where is

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.520 
almost guarantee about drug where is
that<00:02:09.840> he's<00:02:09.959> going<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.170> start<00:02:10.349> two<00:02:10.500> games

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that he's going to start two games

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.619 
that he's going to start two games
against<00:02:10.979> Arsenal<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.489> season<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.030> it'll

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
against Arsenal this season and it'll

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.840 
against Arsenal this season and it'll
probably<00:02:12.780> score<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.170> both

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
probably score in both

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.270 
probably score in both
but<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.570> know<00:02:14.660> he<00:02:15.110> just<00:02:15.470> gives<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:15.890> sort<00:02:16.220> of

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
but you know he just gives that sort of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.580 
but you know he just gives that sort of
that<00:02:16.700> gravatar<00:02:17.210> gravitas<00:02:17.960> that<00:02:18.140> big<00:02:18.320> game
