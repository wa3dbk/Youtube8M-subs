00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:50.180 

fast<00:01:18.539> focus<00:01:19.539> a<00:01:19.659> speed<00:01:19.960> how's<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.319> speed

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.490 

I<00:01:56.630> don't<00:01:57.630> want<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> your<00:01:57.930> other<00:01:58.020> machines<00:01:58.440> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
I don't want to your other machines you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.140 
I don't want to your other machines you
used<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> Manitou<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.580> that's<00:01:59.700> its<00:01:59.880> to

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
used as a Manitou and that's its to

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.210 
used as a Manitou and that's its to
speed<00:02:00.450> as<00:02:00.660> opposed<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.350> our<00:02:01.500> single<00:02:01.980> speed

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
speed as opposed to our single speed

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.490 
speed as opposed to our single speed
here<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.670> ours<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.480> you<00:02:03.540> prefer<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.200> why

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
here on ours which do you prefer and why

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.430 
here on ours which do you prefer and why
I<00:02:04.770> like<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.400> single<00:02:05.790> speed<00:02:06.180> because<00:02:06.690> it's<00:02:06.930> on

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
I like the single speed because it's on

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.430 
I like the single speed because it's on
the<00:02:07.650> other<00:02:08.130> machine<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:09.570> first<00:02:09.840> gear<00:02:10.110> seems

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the other machine the first gear seems

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.730 
the other machine the first gear seems
to<00:02:10.890> slow<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.540> second<00:02:12.960> gear<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.410> don't

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
to slow and the second gear you don't

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.140 
to slow and the second gear you don't
have<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.070> power<00:02:14.250> you've<00:02:14.670> gotten<00:02:15.030> this

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
have the power you've gotten this

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.510 
have the power you've gotten this
machine<00:02:15.570> here<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.050> merlot<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.490> just

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
machine here the merlot it just it just

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.160 
machine here the merlot it just it just
takes<00:02:17.970> away<00:02:18.120> all<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.570> problems<00:02:18.990> like<00:02:19.140> that

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
takes away all the problems like that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.050 
takes away all the problems like that
didn't<00:02:19.650> do<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.860> job<00:02:20.070> just<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.580> fastest<00:02:20.970> you

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
didn't do the job just the fastest you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.960 
didn't do the job just the fastest you
won't<00:02:21.240> do<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.690> 22<00:02:22.380> max<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:23.130> plenty<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.790> speed

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
won't do that 22 max is plenty of speed

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.370 
won't do that 22 max is plenty of speed
but<00:02:24.240> oh<00:02:24.330> yeah<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.750> don't<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.260> you're

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380
