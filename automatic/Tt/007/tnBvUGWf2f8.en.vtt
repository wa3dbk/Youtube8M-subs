00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 good kids we are here in a new 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.620
 video as you can see we are 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.980
 playing in grand theft auto 5 play 3 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.130
 using online hack as you can 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.529
 check good we are here in the water 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.539
 we can walk we can breathe we can 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.430
 do everything we can basically eat 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.619
 these mushrooms that are here now you are going to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.289
 see to buy good to teach you 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.000
 that is a freighter you also have here 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.000
 the psychotic this is a hack 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.520
 Well now they kill to clean and I'm going to 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.950
 teach so you can prove that you are a 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.080
 hack is to say that yes it is a hack that 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.820
 it's not a text I'm going to press a 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.950
 combination of buttons that you are not going to 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:52.510
 see you on screen but good is 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:56.230
 baby and ekiza meaning this is on xbox 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:00.290
 baby and ekiza 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.980
 and the risks tics and now you put 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.920
 so check 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.370
 let's go for your car that obviously not 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.250
 we are going to kill him 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:17.050
 let's go to the seabed effectively 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.050
 look at the club this 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 and maybe we can get in and the hole 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.060
 hears 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.119
 and do not throw yourself 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.630
 at the time like at the end of the movie 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.630
 we have 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.600
 can do the video teaching the the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.369
 the depths starts on 5 to 2 and 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.880
 then it occurred to him or was it true 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.880
 depths 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.160
 was in Spain at the bottom and we're 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.420
 going back if I am 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.780
 following as in this that has the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.780
 point 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.670
 and at these prices 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.130
 there will be some shark around here will say if the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.500
 future 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.050
 and so we have to get very deep 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.410
 you know that used when you're where you are 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.120
 the sharks you understand me that there are things 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.980
 quite 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.019
 but good that a pretty deep 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.230
 great to know because we have to see 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.230
 there 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.950
 there will be some mountain ranges there will be emptiness 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.150
 the sharks you imagine instead of going 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.060
 very down there is a moment that there is a 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.330
 empty and you fall below the map of 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.330
 sky 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.870
 here and certainly they had flown the wave 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.870
 Super jump 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.330
 then he is floating here and 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.330
 viewed 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.160
 do not look at me look where I'm going to go and 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.830
 now you are going to go through here you go as straight 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.750
 Uncle instead of falling you go as you walk 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.750
 above the water 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.550
 but if you just did what you've done 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:27.480
 very little before I've done it a lot for 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.480
 that left me here a good fall 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.850
 of the fall towards you is in the air 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.360
 there are sand 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.460
 now do not be a magnitude shit 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.840
 I follow you because, but because 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:16.030
 we tell you this the pressure of a 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.810
 normal person does not survive this or with 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.010
 to get there but it is not even with chocolate 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.520
 this depth of pressure you 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.330
 busting inside you 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.330
 but the experts 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.380
 but now how we came out uncles decided by 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.380
 the suicide button 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.930
 and a cancer super mountaineer who does not 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:45.080
 has a doll fell 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.270
 over here but here I have fun 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.020
 But God seems to me also 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.960
 Depth of expectation stops you for now 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.210
 a little towards us and behind you 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.539
 to our left we go more to 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.150
 background where are you drake here and you 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.400
 mouth that one has overcome now island are 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.159
 is the depth of the psychological sea 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.729
 under the crisis and then we throw ourselves when 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.729
 this 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.680
 the same as indiscriminate that you see 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.680
 all black uncle I do not look 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.350
 I already god 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.740
 but no 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.420
 do not 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.390
 it's a ship and floating eshkol and that 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.100
 helicopter is an uncle so that we 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.100
 let's wait 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.830
 kill it is spinning it is spinning by 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.930
 my mind 20 guilty passive sites that 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.520
 you want me to be trying to catch or if 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.340
 was that I take off as a passive 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.970
 travel 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.449
 I spoke grenade launcher do not go vetete 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.449
 go Go 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.440
 if he loves you he is dead 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.180
 is under 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.830
 it seems that he has moved to see it 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:37.390
 you do not have much palate that after 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:43.690
 you know what happens 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:46.360
 You see super rare aggravated if indeed 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:49.550
 is the most normal thing in the world from which 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.440
 we cross the sun water 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.020
 we are going under water with the 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.789
 ship 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.789
 by the parasites 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.500
 but sometimes only 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.500
 but I say now 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:08.009
 lets go 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.160
 but slow down the boat and we go down to the 

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:10.160
 two 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:19.370
 with the age 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:22.419
 let's throw now to the one of 33 21 already 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.419
 no no 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:36.680
 of this return generate the marks 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:39.220
 let's go to a motivator 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.220
 wait
