00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:15.509
 this is not a beautiful flower field 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.279
 Today I tell you in my station 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.769
 tutorials about the wonderful fabric 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:27.570
 small of these plants after the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:31.489
 Although photo is produced from the flax 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.710
 they already dried and so on 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.390
 and the flex plan plant has the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.829
 advantage that it is insanely long 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.860
 So it can be between 45 to 90 cm long 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.730
 his and is just a super super long 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.440
 phase you are also very easy 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:58.980
 can gamble on what one recognizes 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.719
 the slackliner first time at the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.850
 beyenburger with it must be different 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.870
 can 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.870
 It's burning 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.530
 like papers 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.340
 so has a choice a bright fly ash 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.540
 can complete series to put 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.189
 I'll get that a little bit 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.130
 continue to determine or papers are 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.720
 next to just the same cotton 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.280
 question what the difference is 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.340
 someday it smells like her and 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.549
 burns the most obvious difference to 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.140
 It is thunderstruck on the cotton 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.979
 he has made the slogan "airline industry" 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.200
 made and said little wrinkles noble 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.450
 that one can now is in the eye of the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.709
 beholder 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.380
 it looks pretty fast then 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.990
 criticism from music this wrinkles the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.539
 Play do valleys and mountains are real 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.440
 like, so to speak, the pre-Alps or that 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.030
 right one 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.440
 the mountains was build in comparison 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.750
 which also rented so far not 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.119
 so strong that they have two disadvantages 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.069
 cotton but the biggest before that 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.750
 linen but the biggest advantage of 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.700
 it's the coolest thing in the world 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.849
 carry sum ever I could have 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.019
 today also such a small chelsea t 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.569
 shirt on 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.500
 that's a lot cooler if it's special 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.910
 hot and that's why if you have one 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.670
 drops of water on the skin 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.620
 it stays for a moment while it sinks 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.900
 but immediately there you will say it 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.000
 yes makes the cotton out but that 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.670
 linen by the fact that this flax was so 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.989
 extremely smooth and long that evaporates 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.400
 also the same as that means if you 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.200
 It does not just sweat 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.660
 transported away from the body of switzerland 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.400
 like the cotton but the steam 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.690
 also right back and one again 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.319
 she feels her clothes even when he is 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.950
 When it's hot, it's especially dry 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.680
 Approach us 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.390
 that is, if you do that if you have one 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.640
 little ones in summer wear you become on 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.270
 at least stand 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.580
 feel relatively fresh little disadvantage 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.440
 It is one that is not 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.240
 that the linen is usually not very special 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.270
 skifest is that means if you 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.580
 together can not do that 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.260
 especially easy to pull apart 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.000
 but that just means yours 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.890
 Clothing not up to not super tight 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.570
 should be so mainly step or 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.620
 under the armpits that can be very 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.209
 tear easily 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.160
 borrow a charity t-shirt 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.200
 be is but care less if their 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.450
 Halter does not think his clothes too tight 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.580
 Buy or they tear too quickly to the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.959
 sewed and one more to conclude 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.690
 small tip an by-product of 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.470
 the flax is the leyen wants on 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.510
 the flaxseed that it is super rich 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.910
 unsaturated fatty acids I am now 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.000
 burn more cosmetics in one 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.730
 beauty salon this time thematically and 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.800
 Although you can do that for a simple 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.320
 like a cream or her body fullness 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.760
 Apply and you get just for the 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.140
 Nails really beautiful fingernails 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.870
 you can look into that in the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.700
 take a spoon early 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.230
 due to the unsaturated fatty acids 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.450
 You can also face it hard and 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.540
 Every now and then I'm speechless as well as how 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.299
 so beautiful the skin of lion will not 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.060
 only small not only the perfect summer 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:18.510
 the wall but also the oil for the 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:19.590
 beauty for you not to keep 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.260
