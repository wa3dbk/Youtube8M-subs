00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 what if nicholas fichman surpasses 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.339
 pixel dotcom and today we are going to do the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.290
 full analysis of the headphones and 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.290
 nor hermes 11 deco 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.470
 Seeing the technical specifications 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.990
 we have 8 mm speakers 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.630
 in diameter with neodymium magnets with 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.330
 a frequency response of 17 hertz 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.619
 at 25 kilos hertz these basically a 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.590
 little more than you can hear the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.119
 human ear with a sensitivity of 101 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.580
 decibeles about two decibels 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.559
 means obviously at one kilo to hertz per 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.379
 a thousand watts later we have an impedance 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.699
 of 14 or more the connector is 35 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.320
 millimeters so they will be able to 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.540
 use quietly with any 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.059
 smartphone tablet or some player 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.739
 mp3 like we saw with the 11 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.110
 classics here the 11 of ccoo also 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.059
 They come with a pau with keys or as you 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.280
 they want to call a box where the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.629
 headphones that are barbaric because they do not 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.370
 it is only very good quality but 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.809
 also comes in justito are values 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.340
 to erase the headphones we're going to 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.480
 take what we have inside that first 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.770
 obviously the headphones 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.140
 let's see what we have 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.610
 we have here a hook to be able 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.869
 hang this from the belt to what 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.759
 let's feel like we leave it there 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.770
 and then we also have other gummies 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.050
 of silicone of different sizes that are 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.399
 a little larger than the standard that 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.810
 come here bet the headphones and 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:20.260
 ones that are a little bit smaller 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.970
 just like we saw with the 11 classics ago 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.950
 Let's talk about the design of the 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.540
 headphones we're going to find that 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.970
 we also have the ebony cups of 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.200
 wood that we had seen with the 11 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.570
 classics only that now have as 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.310
 if it were a semi-conical shape pulling 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.410
 towards a paraboloid in the part of 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.600
 back where we also meet with 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.920
 a hard plastic insert color 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.100
 silver where we also have here 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.960
 printed or semi-engraved the isologotype of 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.370
 months it was very good I do not know 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.260
 He did not use all the use I gave him 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.960
 we passed the nail , we did not take it out 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.360
 reality is that I loved in designs 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.130
 they are very very attractive to me the truth 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.140
 They are very nice they are well done 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.940
 they feel very and nothing hand is also 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.170
 say they are well built do not 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.790
 feels like it's going to unscrew or 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.380
 cut in one thing the only thing I have 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.880
 to criticize is exactly what 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.210
 same as I said with the classics onces is 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.970
 that here the juncture between the cable and the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.380
 ebony cup let's see what could be 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.940
 get to start if we start to touch 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.709
 once in a while we say in we have a 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.360
 keeps cable but well this is subject 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.920
 design question the truth that I do not 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.170
 I play too much whenever I catch the 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.910
 I was talking about headphones from the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.620
 part of wood and I do not know of the cable that 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.209
 obviously you never have to do it like that 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.980
 I do not complain too much about that because 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.900
 it is not a part that is touched too much 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.069
 obviously these silicone cups 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.450
 we can take out is they have to be a 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.670
 little bit of strength to take them out 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.709
 like to put them and the silicone this is 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.390
 a very minor detail but that for me 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.370
 it 's worth mentioning it especially 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.080
 for the price that silicone has 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.209
 have these headphones is a little bit 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.400
 softer than other headphones and 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.080
 Niger that I was trying to say is a 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.910
 little more comfortable to the ear thing that I 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.590
 It seems barbarous and important for 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.090
 highlight on the other hand a detail that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.129
 It is also very good we have the button 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.360
 to stop or continue with the 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.860
 music that we are listening to our 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.269
 phone and that also serves to 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.799
 answer or cut a call and 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.640
 obviously it 's a little hole that you get to 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.019
 see there 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.209
 This is the microphone is we say we will 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.709
 to be able to understand and talk for a few 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.450
 calls with the headphones on is 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.220
 a free hands was very good if we 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.200
 we fix below is directly the 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.220
 juncture that I am made of wood here 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.959
 we also find the same 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.640
 plastic that we saw in the back 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.140
 of the headphones that is purely the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.329
 culture almost in cable guard thing thing that 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.250
 it's good and something that you see in this 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.590
 white cable if we do not get to notice it 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.200
 I say unfortunately they went from what 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.810
 that it was a cable covered in a cloth 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.670
 interwoven of the 11 classics months that 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.540
 here we have the difference that 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.860
 we have fabric 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.239
 that is good national is good but 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.099
 Believe me that this if you did not see is 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.810
 analysis go see it here we have 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.909
 directly from a coma that maybe some 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.709
 people do not change them at all but 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.629
 for me for example that I use the 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.829
 orioles underneath the clothes is mean 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.750
 all this cable below the shirt 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.670
 It can be a little annoying when it does 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.439
 that is, it can be stuck to the body 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.420
 and all the ball all you already know that 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.890
 happens and also in addition the 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.359
 white gets dirty more easily is 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.129
 say it can be stained with color 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.200
 black if we support any surface 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.180
 that can get to stain but good 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.680
 subject of trifles that such some 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.930
 people are not interested we also have 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.609
 here the oblique connector of four poles 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.049
 that is, this enables the microphone 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.599
 the solution is different from the connector that 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.829
 it's totally straight and here you can 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.750
 help that for example when we have 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.430
 the phone stored in your pocket 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.019
 cable is not totally with the pressure 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.340
 that comes from above to be cut 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.289
 of the cable thing that is good I thought 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.539
 quite comfortable and more than anything 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.340
 it seemed that in the world it was uncomfortable to 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.670
 use thing that is important to highlight 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.850
 as well 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.220
 talking a bit about comfort on 11 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.500
 ccoo are recontra comfortable what happens by 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.730
 more than two or three hours and the reality is 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.430
 I did not have any problems in the 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.720
 ears I felt no pressure or annoying 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.490
 I wanted to take them out because it hurt me not 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.410
 I'm dominated by style in what 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.240
 regards to comfort they are still recontra 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.490
 light the reality that they are very similar 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.380
 in general to others and niger that is if 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.000
 they tried some common cnr the 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.530
 sensation is going to be more or less the same 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.210
 in regards to having them a lot 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.040
 time in the ears but yes it is good 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.180
 highlight that they are super light this 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.070
 surely it 's because of the issue that 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.080
 wood helps a lot to this 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.350
 talking a little bit of isolation these 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.790
 headphones isolate very very well and this 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.440
 it's something to be careful how we are 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.080
 on the street because we're listening 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.790
 music the reality is that we can get there 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.310
 to be run over by a car that does not 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.440
 we hear so well is what they insulate 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.240
 these headphones are very very good 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.130
 in that sense they are headphones so that 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.570
 we can calmly change by 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.220
 the street or on a collective trip without 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.990
 have to compensate with a lot of volume 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.440
 thing that hurts our ears thing that 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.820
 he is barbaric and as I always tell you 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.590
 let's go to the topic of sound quality 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.730
 because if you do not listen well so that 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.670
 we want them for what we are going to spend 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.620
 money really listen to barbarian's 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.990
 10 I love that simple ie 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.330
 they are the planes without the one that provides 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.520
 basically equal in audio quality 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.190
 that the 11 classics that is to say are 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.380
 purely excellent are worth every penny 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.970
 of what they are worth, maybe it's not a 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.460
 very cheap price very accessible but 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.350
 really if you take good care of them they are worth a lot 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.930
 worth it now speaking purely what 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.880
 it's audio quality if we have Carlos 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.500
 11 classics next let's say that 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.910
 basically they are heard the same is to say 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.010
 they are the same drivers that is to say they are the 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.849
 same speakers the only difference if 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.869
 they realized 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.939
 site when we said the 

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:10.289
 technical specifications is that maybe 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.599
 the frequency response is a 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.399
 little bit different but the reality is 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.719
 that for practical purposes we are not going to give 

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:18.389
 account of that difference you hear 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:20.490
 exactly the same so you hear very 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:23.399
 well the lows are controlled régine 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.020
 the media are very very good they are re 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.219
 well present and the treble also very 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.959
 controlled ones we get to do 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.449
 strident is to say they have one more tone 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:31.860
 sweet than anything else so in quality 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.319
 audio no longer I can be another way 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.330
 of you hear very very well besides 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.009
 other side the speakers is to say the 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.080
 drivers are super sensitive so 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.119
 It's easy to move them with a phone with 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.439
 an old mp3 of whatever an 

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:45.449
 three Chinese is the bancar will also 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:47.069
 so do not be afraid with that they're going to 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.110
 can lift quite high volume 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:50.879
 which I do not recommend but know that 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.319
 they are very sensitive and we are not going to 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.269
 be able to bring them to saturate unless 

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:56.309
 we bring with some equalizer everything to 

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:57.479
 maximum thing that never works like that 

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:59.279
 that in general are not going to saturate 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.950
 no way less than we force them to 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:03.140
 I do it 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.700
 If you do not know which of the two I will choose 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.680
 are determined to buy sometime 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.270
 all as much the 11 of ccoo as the 11 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.250
 classics my suggestions that it's going to 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.770
 to do hard in appearance is to go 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.770
 in aesthetic design because in the end and 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.630
 out both sound almost nearly equal the 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.040
 difference are basically no 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.030
 appreciable you have to have the ear very 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.100
 trained you have to be in a 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.860
 room with very low volume 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.420
 it's really basically the same thing 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.830
 which is audio quality so I do not know 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.120
 worry about that choose based on the 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.470
 aesthetics of course we also 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.540
 forget to leave it down in the comments 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.860
 which the two would choose or because if 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.970
 liked the video do not forget to leave a 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.710
