00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.309
 man uses wood as 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.420
 energy source from time immemorial 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.950
 today advanced technology allows 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.789
 turn the tree and several species 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.140
 energy carriers 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.390
 we are in austria 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.009
 european renewable center 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.310
 energy sources 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.920
 peasant women led by chief jam smashed 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.199
 we get the machine for wood processing 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.060
 mind is warm electricity and 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.060
 liquid fuel 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.000
 does it affect and if just expected 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.010
 the tree you seek the minimum 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.820
 efficiency is much more 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.180
 productive way to turn wood 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.960
 chips in special gas 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.880
 technology allows you to convert a mixture 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.340
 of gases 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.300
 ticket that can be heated at home 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.940
 or take it to the car 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.690
 engines 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.380
 there is a pilot plant here 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.830
 producing synthetic 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.620
 natural gas from wood 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.030
 he himself and heat 27 thousand 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.800
 residents of the CIS as well as joint 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.840
 enterprises 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.390
 at the end of 2011 and commons half 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.530
 the region of burgenland is covered 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.000
 by the forest 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.430
 the process itself takes place in two stages first 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.490
 the game has things it heats up steam 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.540
 eight hundred and fifty degrees then 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.900
 turns into gas 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.180
 the gas rotates the turbine which produces 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.800
 electricity excess heat 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.540
 used for home heating 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.780
 drawings 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.750
 ha then translates liquid 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.350
 cherry installation in an hour can 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.909
 turn 360 kilograms counts 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.490
 120 cubic meters of gas equivalent to thousands 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.740
 two mill kilowatt hours 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.100
 electric power industry 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.830
 angel on tets works on 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.040
 improvement tactic 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.190
 british columbia on study 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.240
 the heart of our installation if possible 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.980
 put it fisher tropsh reactor 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.390
 action aid was not we can produce 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.390
 wax voice gasoline 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.840
 if such technologies have long been known 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.560
 our innovation is that 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.789
 we can produce fuel 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.250
 and knocked down a mass assessment from 8 russia 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.690
 feast time with us so as to exclude 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.030
 enterprise competition 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.490
 use only waste 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.440
 wood industry a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.769
 also in armenia however remember libya 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.840
 in conversations with a small house then what are you 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.029
 of fluidity he weighs he began to shoot we 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.389
 convinced that this technology is great 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.980
 the future from the forest can produce heat and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.819
 Belgrade liquid electricity 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.249
 fuel and what's most interesting is all on 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:31.879
 one factory person 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.419
 he is extremely right 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:35.869
 for example, here it is necessary to show that 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:37.469
 primitive can be the basis 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.309
 zero emission technologies 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:40.309
 carbon dioxide
