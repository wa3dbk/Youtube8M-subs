00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.609 

so<00:01:59.619> from<00:01:59.859> what<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.039> can<00:02:00.159> see<00:02:01.109> from<00:02:02.109> Klein<00:02:02.409> the

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
so from what I can see from Klein the

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.790 
so from what I can see from Klein the
foundation<00:02:03.189> it<00:02:03.399> is<00:02:03.429> a<00:02:03.850> medium<00:02:04.859> coverage<00:02:07.800> just

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
foundation it is a medium coverage just

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.440 
foundation it is a medium coverage just
like<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:09.459> original<00:02:09.819> version<00:02:11.580> version<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:13.180> out

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
like the original version version is out

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.850 
like the original version version is out
i<00:02:13.510> said<00:02:13.900> version<00:02:14.670> version<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.090> foundation

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.309 

it<00:02:20.970> seems<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.090> have<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.620> nice<00:02:23.910> natural<00:02:25.319> satiny

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
it seems to have a nice natural satiny

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.720 
it seems to have a nice natural satiny
finish<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:29.560> lends<00:02:29.860> out<00:02:30.099> pretty

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
finish to it and it lends out pretty

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.850 
finish to it and it lends out pretty
easily<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:34.049> so<00:02:35.049> this<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.349> what<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.620> first

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
easily and so this is what the first

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.500 
easily and so this is what the first
layer<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.489> maker<00:02:36.790> forever<00:02:37.120> Ultra<00:02:37.480> HD

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510
