00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.140
 from sony 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.719
 The first point is that a device that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.960
 has been much mentioned in rumors and 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.990
 has been considered the z-4 in fact 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 can be another model the profile vise 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.950
 links on twitter states that 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.049
 leaks and rumors that have circulated 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.320
 respect to z-4 are actually 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.750
 referring to an updated version of c3 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.020
 which would have the neo name and the biggest change 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.040
 this device would be to have bands lt 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.159
 an enhanced 4g connection uses 4 same 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.460
 would be released later this year 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.470
 with very strong technical specifications 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.439
 sony has a scheduled event for the day 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.189
 April 20 and she must disclose the plans 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.320
 her on that day but there is no information 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.960
 about the c4 only that it already has 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.659
 rumors about his successor that same 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.049
 or the blood goodness of the android site 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.460
 states that the c5 will be released at the end 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.640
 2015 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.520
 by January 2016 and will have a 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.840
 a more compact compact version, plus a 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.200
 version with biometric sensor 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.920
 this series would design her new 4k 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.260
 new camera sensors and 4gb of ram 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.060
 Is the confusion there armed? 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.220
 because a disc of four will be 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.739
 released at the end of the year the other says that 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.680
 it will be 1 65 and 1 year for three 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.950
 launches is because we have and 3,000 c4 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.650
 c5 there is something strange so let's see if 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.739
 the event on April 20 clarifies 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.840
 this timeline today's video follows 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.250
 with an important warning for who owns 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.440
 of a nexus 5 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.019
 pay attention to the king 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.569
 android police site if several 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.489
 owners of nexus five are complaining that 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.400
 the camera became gaga after the 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.810
 device updated for lollipop 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.610
 it seems that the smartphone forces the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.250
 closing the camera process 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.470
 whenever it is triggered and does not give 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.329
 to use third-party applications to 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.160
 camera according to users 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.769
 some people have been able to 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.230
 operate after restarting the camera. 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.510
 the blog has already been cut to the 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.100
 google that should not take long to launch 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.180
 a correction 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.160
 now let's talk about s because the version 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.739
 8.4 system is now available in 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.180
 beta according to the metro sites in Mercy 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.340
 night makes mec 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.660
 the music app is the one that most passed 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.790
 by changes 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.160
 it is more beautiful more easy to use 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.680
 and with new features 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.170
 the design makes better use of the library 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.090
 a network is more functional and the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.010
 the mini player controls are 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.819
 improved and this among other 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.819
 the new 8.4 s must be more changes 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.280
 and will probably be released in June 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.470
 and taking advantage of the fact that we 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.569
 subject apple looks only the artist 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.849
 Brazilian Romero Britto opened a 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.579
 against the company 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.130
 second site information to initialing 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.530

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.389
 creations of him only that these works are 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.989
 attributed to a pair of artists 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.609
 formed by reid hoffman and calm er and 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.470
 they have a style similar to that of 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.739
 romero britto why the brazilian 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.260
 decided to sue the two also citing 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.840
 infringement of copyright which also 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.220
 unfair competition 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.519
 We're going to finish today's video. 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.280

 of dota 2 and the global counter strike 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.750
 offensive and a curiosity of it is that

 according to the pc gamer site the name of 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.490
 windows user can prevent the

 rockstar has a list of characters and 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.940
 if a windows user name has 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.330
 a character not on this list 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.030
 The game installation does not roll there.
