00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.280 

now<00:00:08.220> let's<00:00:08.400> paint<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:09.000> head<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:10.050> what<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
now let's paint the head so what the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.530 
now let's paint the head so what the
head<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.620> stand<00:00:11.010> out<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.580> little<00:00:12.179> bit<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:12.420> I

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
head to stand out a little bit so I

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.509 
head to stand out a little bit so I
don't<00:00:12.570> want<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.929> be<00:00:13.049> exactly<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:14.490> same

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
don't want it to be exactly the same

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.349 
don't want it to be exactly the same
sort<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.089> metal<00:00:16.080> as<00:00:16.460> these<00:00:17.460> rough<00:00:17.730> horns<00:00:18.150> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
sort of metal as these rough horns and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.950 
sort of metal as these rough horns and
so<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.199> use<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.650> different<00:00:20.510> image<00:00:21.510> ink<00:00:21.750> if

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
so we can use a different image ink if

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.519 
so we can use a different image ink if
we<00:00:22.109> want<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
we want to

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.540 
we want to
so<00:00:22.859> let's<00:00:23.760> come<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.029> here<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.600> let's<00:00:25.380> grab<00:00:26.010> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
so let's come in here and let's grab and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.740 
so let's come in here and let's grab and
be<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.820> metal<00:00:28.220> 11<00:00:31.460> okay<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.630> can

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
be this metal 11 okay and then we can

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.010 
be this metal 11 okay and then we can
come<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.110> maybe<00:00:34.350> from<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.739> UV<00:00:35.100> view<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:37.760> just

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
come in maybe from the UV view and just

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.220 
come in maybe from the UV view and just
start<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:41.149> got<00:00:42.149> our<00:00:42.239> image<00:00:42.390> ink<00:00:42.780> okay

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
start to got our image ink okay

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.520 
start to got our image ink okay
got<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.649> selected<00:00:45.110> start<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> drop<00:00:46.379> this

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
got all that selected start to drop this

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.420 
got all that selected start to drop this
in<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> base<00:00:49.800> will<00:00:50.160> kind<00:00:50.399> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
in and so just as a base will kind of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.209 
in and so just as a base will kind of
bring<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.629> I'm<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.559> getting<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
bring this up here I'm just getting the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
bring this up here I'm just getting the
scale<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.879> way<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.149> want<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> then<00:00:55.829> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
scale the way that I want it and then I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.670 
scale the way that I want it and then I
can<00:00:56.070> come<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.550> start<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.480> bring<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.469> in

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
can come in and start to bring this in

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.260 
can come in and start to bring this in
so<00:00:58.890> let<00:00:59.039> me<00:00:59.129> set<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> hundred<00:01:00.149> percent

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
so let me set this to a hundred percent

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.740 
so let me set this to a hundred percent
opacity<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.180> want<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.390> make<00:01:03.480> sure<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.660> I

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
opacity and I want to make sure that I

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.620 
opacity and I want to make sure that I
set<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> color<00:01:05.060> set<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.150> color<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> white

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.240 

okay<00:01:09.630> there<00:01:10.619> we<00:01:10.740> go<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.320> start<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> kind

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
okay there we go and I can start to kind

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.320 
okay there we go and I can start to kind
of<00:01:14.280> paint<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:16.310> across<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.490> surface<00:01:17.700> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
of paint this in across the surface it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.149 
of paint this in across the surface it
just<00:01:18.360> gives<00:01:18.689> us<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.960> kind<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.380> finer<00:01:22.100> kind<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
just gives us a kind of a finer kind of

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.749 
just gives us a kind of a finer kind of
a<00:01:23.250> flake<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:24.210> detail<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> can

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
a flake or or detail in it and so I can

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:35.679 
a flake or or detail in it and so I can
just<00:01:26.939> paint<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.270> across<00:01:28.130> here<00:01:32.360> come<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
just paint this across here come in and

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.819 
just paint this across here come in and
there's<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:36.900> bit<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.079> shading<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.650> this

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
there's a little bit of shading in this

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.640 
there's a little bit of shading in this
so<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> tiling<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.689> kind<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.350> move

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
so the tiling we can kind of just move

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.080 
so the tiling we can kind of just move
this<00:01:40.860> around<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.280> little<00:01:41.400> bit<00:01:41.579> more<00:01:41.790> than<00:01:42.000> we

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
this around a little bit more than we

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.399 
this around a little bit more than we
did<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> other<00:01:42.450> piece<00:01:45.770> okay<00:01:48.170> again<00:01:49.170> whatever

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
did the other piece okay again whatever

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.350 
did the other piece okay again whatever
we<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:49.829> here<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.310> want<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.520> make<00:01:50.579> sure<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.970> do<00:01:51.149> on

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
we do here we want to make sure to do on

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.639 
we do here we want to make sure to do on
the<00:01:51.479> other<00:01:51.509> side<00:01:51.869> if<00:01:52.049> we're<00:01:52.170> not<00:01:52.259> painting<00:01:52.470> in

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the other side if we're not painting in

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.480 
the other side if we're not painting in
our<00:01:52.770> 3d<00:01:53.070> view<00:01:54.680> we're<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:55.829> using<00:01:56.009> symmetry

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
our 3d view we're not using symmetry

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.260 
our 3d view we're not using symmetry
here<00:01:58.219> you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.340> go<00:01:59.460> ahead<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.820> paint

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
here you can go ahead and just paint

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.139 
here you can go ahead and just paint
over<00:02:00.420> any<00:02:01.170> openings<00:02:01.680> like<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.060> it's<00:02:03.060> not

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
over any openings like this it's not

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.130 
over any openings like this it's not
going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.390> matter<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.719> don't<00:02:03.990> want<00:02:04.110> to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
going to matter you just don't want to

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.690 
going to matter you just don't want to
concentrate<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> open<00:02:05.280> areas<00:02:05.520> because

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
concentrate on the open areas because

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.029 
concentrate on the open areas because
that's<00:02:05.969> not<00:02:06.299> gonna<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.659> applied<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.140> anything

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.900 

so<00:02:11.039> come<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.610> here

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
so come in here

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:21.030 
so come in here
and<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:17.230> paint<00:02:17.590> through<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:19.680> if<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.860> want

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
and just paint through this if you want

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.070 
and just paint through this if you want
to<00:02:21.100> get<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.220> bigger<00:02:21.460> brush<00:02:22.270> size<00:02:22.480> make<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.930> go<00:02:23.050> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
to get a bigger brush size make it go a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.530 
to get a bigger brush size make it go a
little<00:02:23.290> bit<00:02:23.440> faster<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.120> certainly<00:02:25.270> do

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
little bit faster you can certainly do

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.650 
little bit faster you can certainly do
that<00:02:25.660> I'm<00:02:25.780> gonna<00:02:25.870> go<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.110> do<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.380> side<00:02:26.620> now

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
that I'm gonna go and do this side now

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.420 
that I'm gonna go and do this side now
all<00:02:28.660> right<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.020> I've<00:02:29.680> got<00:02:29.830> that<00:02:29.950> painted<00:02:30.310> up

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
all right so I've got that painted up

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.360 
all right so I've got that painted up
and<00:02:30.610> go<00:02:30.850> back<00:02:31.030> in<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.830> it's<00:02:32.830> kind<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.190> take<00:02:33.340> a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
and go back in and it's kind of take a

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
look here in some of these areas on the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.590 
look here in some of these areas on the
seams<00:02:35.710> we<00:02:36.520> can<00:02:36.670> come<00:02:36.850> back<00:02:36.970> in<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.360> kind<00:02:37.540> of

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
seams we can come back in and kind of

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.630 
seams we can come back in and kind of
fill<00:02:37.840> those<00:02:38.020> in<00:02:38.290> from<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.770> front<00:02:41.460> just<00:02:42.460> kind

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
fill those in from the front just kind

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.420 
fill those in from the front just kind
of<00:02:42.700> dropping<00:02:43.060> down<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.360> a<00:02:43.810> base<00:02:44.770> coat<00:02:45.070> here

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
of dropping down to a base coat here

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.190 
of dropping down to a base coat here
kind<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.490> come<00:02:48.670> across<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.300> top<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.900> kind<00:02:50.170> of

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
kind of come across the top and kind of

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.230 
kind of come across the top and kind of
do<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.410> same<00:02:50.440> thing<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:53.850> down<00:02:54.850> across<00:02:55.120> the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
do the same thing and down across the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.090 
do the same thing and down across the
back<00:02:55.630> just<00:02:55.960> where<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.200> seam<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:58.860> gonna<00:02:59.860> come

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
back just where the seam is gonna come

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.480 
back just where the seam is gonna come
around<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.610> back

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.180 

yeah<00:03:06.490> just<00:03:06.790> paint<00:03:07.060> through<00:03:07.300> this<00:03:10.380> okay<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.590> can

yeah just paint through this okay I can
start<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.550> kind<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.300> darken<00:03:13.570> up<00:03:13.660> areas<00:03:13.990> so<00:03:14.170> go

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
start to kind of darken up areas so go

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.630 
start to kind of darken up areas so go
to<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:14.500> paint<00:03:14.710> brush<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:15.070> just<00:03:15.250> get<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.400> soft

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
to the paint brush so just get a soft

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.870 
to the paint brush so just get a soft
brush<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.210> we'll<00:03:17.200> choose<00:03:17.380> black<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:20.850> get<00:03:21.850> a

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
brush and we'll choose black and get a

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.080 
brush and we'll choose black and get a
lower<00:03:22.150> intensity<00:03:22.690> maybe<00:03:23.580> come<00:03:24.580> in<00:03:24.700> here<00:03:25.000> I'm

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
lower intensity maybe come in here I'm

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.199 
lower intensity maybe come in here I'm
gonna<00:03:25.209> start<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:26.280> add<00:03:27.280> some<00:03:27.370> detail<00:03:27.910> for

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
gonna start to add some detail for

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.490 
gonna start to add some detail for
instance<00:03:28.510> under<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.680> eyes<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.110> want<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.350> be

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
instance under the eyes and I want to be

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.470 
instance under the eyes and I want to be
the<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.860> want<00:03:33.160> those<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.490> be<00:03:33.520> blacked<00:03:34.390> out<00:03:36.480> so

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
the I want those to be blacked out so

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.380 
the I want those to be blacked out so
I'll<00:03:37.600> come<00:03:37.810> in<00:03:37.990> actually<00:03:38.230> paint<00:03:38.800> those<00:03:39.070> black

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.199 

right<00:03:43.390> along<00:03:43.720> that<00:03:44.280> detail<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.940> normal

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
right along that detail in the normal

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.640 
right along that detail in the normal
bat<00:03:47.370> okay<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:49.030> we<00:03:49.090> can<00:03:49.209> start<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.570> layer<00:03:49.840> on

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
bat okay and we can start to layer on

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.680 
bat okay and we can start to layer on
here<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.550> we<00:03:51.760> could<00:03:51.940> use<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.270> procedural

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
here so we could use the procedural

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.970 
here so we could use the procedural
brush<00:03:53.050> get<00:03:53.860> kind<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.070> a<00:03:54.190> gray<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:57.060> maybe<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.150> low

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
brush get kind of a gray and maybe a low

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.979 
brush get kind of a gray and maybe a low
opacity<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:03.430> be<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.330> little<00:04:04.420> bit<00:04:04.630> lower<00:04:04.810> than

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
opacity and be a little bit lower than

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.979 
opacity and be a little bit lower than
that<00:04:06.060> if<00:04:07.060> we<00:04:07.209> wanted<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.510> make<00:04:07.660> this<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.840> little

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
that if we wanted to make this a little

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.860 
that if we wanted to make this a little
bit<00:04:08.170> more<00:04:08.320> gray<00:04:08.709> I<00:04:09.270> start<00:04:10.270> to<00:04:10.330> come<00:04:10.480> in<00:04:10.570> here

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
bit more gray I start to come in here

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:17.789 
bit more gray I start to come in here
and<00:04:10.989> knock<00:04:11.170> this<00:04:11.350> down<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.650> little<00:04:11.860> bit<00:04:12.750> okay

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.240 

same<00:04:18.759> thing<00:04:19.000> down<00:04:19.180> here<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.710> then<00:04:24.069> we<00:04:24.160> could

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
same thing down here and then we could

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.110 
same thing down here and then we could
also<00:04:24.370> start<00:04:24.789> to<00:04:24.910> layer<00:04:25.120> on<00:04:25.419> more<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:25.870> those

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
also start to layer on more of those

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.710 
also start to layer on more of those
Imaging's<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.930> we<00:04:29.050> had<00:04:29.229> there<00:04:30.389> so<00:04:31.389> it<00:04:31.690> just

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
Imaging's that we had there so it just

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.240 
Imaging's that we had there so it just
depends<00:04:32.169> on<00:04:32.289> the<00:04:32.410> look<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.620> you<00:04:32.830> want<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.069> get

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
depends on the look that you want to get

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.110 
depends on the look that you want to get
we<00:04:33.460> could<00:04:33.610> go<00:04:33.729> back<00:04:33.849> here<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.470> choose<00:04:35.470> another

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
we could go back here and choose another

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.969 
we could go back here and choose another
image<00:04:37.120> Inc<00:04:37.330> make<00:04:38.259> sure<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.440> have<00:04:38.530> your<00:04:38.620> nozzle

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
image Inc make sure you have your nozzle

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.550 
image Inc make sure you have your nozzle
on<00:04:39.130> by<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.340> way<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.930> so<00:04:40.930> we<00:04:41.050> can<00:04:41.199> come<00:04:41.349> in<00:04:41.530> and

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
on by the way and so we can come in and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.180 
on by the way and so we can come in and
select<00:04:43.229> maybe<00:04:44.229> this<00:04:44.500> metal<00:04:44.830> tin<00:04:45.069> that<00:04:45.160> we<00:04:45.280> used

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
select maybe this metal tin that we used

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:55.080 
select maybe this metal tin that we used
and<00:04:49.020> add<00:04:50.020> a<00:04:50.080> lower<00:04:50.440> percentage<00:04:53.400> here<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.580> could

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
and add a lower percentage here I could

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.499 
and add a lower percentage here I could
start<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:55.419> add<00:04:55.870> that<00:04:56.669> into<00:04:57.669> the<00:04:57.970> mix<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.389> little

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
start to add that into the mix a little

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:07.649 
start to add that into the mix a little
bit<00:05:03.150> come<00:05:04.150> in<00:05:04.330> around<00:05:04.630> here<00:05:05.849> and<00:05:06.849> just<00:05:07.569> start

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
bit come in around here and just start

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:10.980 
bit come in around here and just start
to<00:05:07.810> blend<00:05:08.280> these<00:05:09.280> together<00:05:09.599> so<00:05:10.599> you<00:05:10.690> can<00:05:10.840> use<00:05:10.960> a

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
to blend these together so you can use a

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.230 
to blend these together so you can use a
combination<00:05:11.349> of<00:05:11.889> images<00:05:12.039> or<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.520> can<00:05:12.759> use<00:05:12.970> if

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
combination of images or you can use if

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.550 
combination of images or you can use if
you<00:05:13.330> have<00:05:13.449> one<00:05:13.659> image<00:05:13.840> that<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.229> want<00:05:14.380> to<00:05:14.470> just

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
you have one image that you want to just

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.499 
you have one image that you want to just
use<00:05:15.630> completely<00:05:17.639> then<00:05:18.639> you<00:05:18.880> could<00:05:19.030> do<00:05:19.180> that<00:05:19.330> as

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
use completely then you could do that as

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.620 
use completely then you could do that as
well<00:05:20.340> let<00:05:21.340> me<00:05:21.430> undo<00:05:21.729> that<00:05:21.759> so<00:05:22.120> I'm<00:05:22.210> not<00:05:22.270> having

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
well let me undo that so I'm not having

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.089 
well let me undo that so I'm not having
to<00:05:22.750> cover<00:05:22.930> up<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.139> line<00:05:23.680> that<00:05:23.979> I<00:05:24.009> made<00:05:24.250> there

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.890

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
up a little bit more again paying just

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:41.219 
up a little bit more again paying just
paying<00:05:34.930> attention<00:05:35.289> to<00:05:35.409> the<00:05:35.530> scale<00:05:35.860> of<00:05:35.889> it<00:05:40.229> come

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
paying attention to the scale of it come

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:48.650 
paying attention to the scale of it come
in<00:05:41.380> across<00:05:41.710> here

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:55.790 

again<00:05:49.260> here<00:05:49.710> where<00:05:49.950> the<00:05:50.130> tiling<00:05:54.620> okay

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
again here where the tiling okay

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.470 
again here where the tiling okay
and<00:05:55.920> just<00:05:56.160> get<00:05:56.310> it<00:05:56.430> I'm<00:05:56.910> not<00:05:57.030> looking<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.390> way

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
and just get it I'm not looking the way

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.210 
and just get it I'm not looking the way
that<00:05:57.630> you<00:05:57.750> want<00:05:57.990> it<00:06:00.740> and<00:06:01.740> make<00:06:01.950> it<00:06:01.980> a<00:06:02.100> little

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
that you want it and make it a little

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.540 
that you want it and make it a little
bit<00:06:02.400> more<00:06:02.610> on<00:06:02.670> the<00:06:02.760> gray<00:06:03.000> side<00:06:03.270> than<00:06:03.570> that<00:06:03.600> tan

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.920 

maybe<00:06:08.550> add<00:06:08.730> some<00:06:08.910> little<00:06:09.090> scratches<00:06:09.540> from<00:06:09.690> one

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
maybe add some little scratches from one

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.540 
maybe add some little scratches from one
of<00:06:10.020> those<00:06:10.080> over<00:06:10.350> other<00:06:10.590> image<00:06:10.980> inks<00:06:11.280> and<00:06:11.400> so

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
of those over other image inks and so

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.640 
of those over other image inks and so
forth<00:06:11.790> and<00:06:12.030> then<00:06:12.390> come<00:06:12.540> in<00:06:12.690> and<00:06:12.900> start<00:06:13.410> to<00:06:13.470> add

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
forth and then come in and start to add

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.760 
forth and then come in and start to add
the<00:06:14.580> dirt<00:06:14.910> and<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.660> grime<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.440> things<00:06:16.620> like

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
the dirt and the grime and things like

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.540 
the dirt and the grime and things like
that<00:06:18.380> again<00:06:19.380> just<00:06:19.410> thinking<00:06:19.830> about<00:06:19.980> the<00:06:20.220> scale

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
that again just thinking about the scale

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.930 
that again just thinking about the scale
as<00:06:20.790> far<00:06:20.820> as<00:06:21.060> how<00:06:21.240> big<00:06:21.480> your<00:06:21.720> image<00:06:22.020> is<00:06:22.940> related

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
as far as how big your image is related

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:33.050 
as far as how big your image is related
to<00:06:24.120> your<00:06:24.350> model<00:06:25.350> here<00:06:31.460> so<00:06:32.460> we<00:06:32.550> can<00:06:32.670> come<00:06:32.760> in<00:06:32.880> and

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
to your model here so we can come in and

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.510 
to your model here so we can come in and
just<00:06:33.150> kind<00:06:33.330> of<00:06:33.360> paint<00:06:33.570> through<00:06:33.840> this<00:06:34.490> with<00:06:35.490> a

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
just kind of paint through this with a

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.210 
just kind of paint through this with a
couple<00:06:35.760> of<00:06:35.880> different<00:06:35.970> image<00:06:36.390> inks<00:06:37.220> blending

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
couple of different image inks blending

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:45.260 
couple of different image inks blending
them<00:06:39.890> together<00:06:43.130> this<00:06:44.130> is<00:06:44.310> a<00:06:44.340> projection<00:06:44.820> so<00:06:45.150> we

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
them together this is a projection so we

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.830 
them together this is a projection so we
want<00:06:45.450> to<00:06:45.540> stay<00:06:45.810> pretty<00:06:46.200> straight<00:06:46.890> on<00:06:47.360> with<00:06:48.360> the

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
want to stay pretty straight on with the

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.050 
want to stay pretty straight on with the
you<00:06:49.710> know<00:06:49.770> when<00:06:49.950> we're<00:06:50.160> painting<00:06:50.760> through

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
you know when we're painting through

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.330 
you know when we're painting through
this<00:06:51.500> we<00:06:52.500> don't<00:06:52.620> really<00:06:52.740> want<00:06:53.070> to<00:06:53.130> paint

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
this we don't really want to paint

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.970 
this we don't really want to paint
through<00:06:53.580> anything<00:06:53.940> that's<00:06:54.770> sort<00:06:55.770> of<00:06:55.830> at<00:06:55.950> a

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
through anything that's sort of at a

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.680 
through anything that's sort of at a
shallow<00:06:56.400> angle<00:06:58.580> or<00:06:59.580> a<00:06:59.640> greater<00:07:00.030> angle<00:07:00.420> away

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
shallow angle or a greater angle away

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.460 
shallow angle or a greater angle away
from<00:07:00.900> us

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.610 

so<00:07:04.470> you<00:07:04.530> don't<00:07:04.620> want<00:07:04.830> it<00:07:04.890> to<00:07:05.040> sort<00:07:05.310> of<00:07:05.430> streak

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
so you don't want it to sort of streak

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.700 
so you don't want it to sort of streak
okay<00:07:07.620> if<00:07:07.920> you<00:07:08.280> want<00:07:08.460> to<00:07:08.640> and<00:07:09.030> come<00:07:09.330> in<00:07:09.530> in<00:07:10.530> your

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:10.710 
okay if you want to and come in in your

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.280 
okay if you want to and come in in your
UV<00:07:11.040> view<00:07:11.340> once<00:07:11.910> you've<00:07:12.060> got<00:07:12.330> kind<00:07:12.840> of<00:07:12.930> started

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
UV view once you've got kind of started

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:19.280 
UV view once you've got kind of started
there<00:07:13.500> and<00:07:17.540> go<00:07:18.540> ahead<00:07:18.660> and<00:07:18.810> continue<00:07:19.170> that

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290 
there and go ahead and continue that

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.120 
there and go ahead and continue that
process<00:07:19.530> here<00:07:21.440> in<00:07:22.440> those<00:07:22.650> areas<00:07:22.980> that<00:07:23.010> you

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.130 
process here in those areas that you

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.760 
process here in those areas that you
can't<00:07:23.430> really<00:07:23.610> see<00:07:23.880> as<00:07:24.000> well

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:26.770 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.159 

move<00:07:27.160> it<00:07:27.250> up<00:07:27.340> here<00:07:27.400> when<00:07:28.030> you<00:07:28.120> do<00:07:28.240> it<00:07:28.389> same

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:29.169 
move it up here when you do it same

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:31.410 
move it up here when you do it same
thing
