believers<00:05:49.960> in<00:05:50.080> following<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.650> power<00:05:50.890> lines

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
believers in following the power lines

00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:08.670 
believers in following the power lines
because<00:05:51.490> they<00:05:51.610> cut<00:05:51.850> deep<00:05:52.090> in<00:05:52.300> their<00:05:52.480> areas

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.610 

I<00:06:08.800> made<00:06:09.520> my<00:06:09.699> way<00:06:09.880> to<00:06:09.940> the<00:06:10.090> power<00:06:10.330> line<00:06:10.690> area<00:06:11.520> and

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
I made my way to the power line area and

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.050 
I made my way to the power line area and
something<00:06:14.620> earlier<00:06:15.130> is<00:06:15.810> pretty<00:06:16.810> historical

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
something earlier is pretty historical

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:28.830 
something earlier is pretty historical
and<00:06:19.060> rather<00:06:19.240> interesting

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.379 

there's<00:06:29.440> the<00:06:29.590> paralyzed<00:06:30.270> they've<00:06:31.270> been

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
there's the paralyzed they've been

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:32.760 
there's the paralyzed they've been
wanting<00:06:31.480> to<00:06:31.690> follow<00:06:31.870> them<00:06:32.139> all<00:06:32.320> the<00:06:32.350> way<00:06:32.530> back

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
wanting to follow them all the way back

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.420 
wanting to follow them all the way back
in<00:06:33.010> there

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
in there

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.890 
in there
but<00:06:34.330> I'm<00:06:34.450> tired<00:06:34.750> how<00:06:35.260> would<00:06:35.410> I<00:06:35.440> get<00:06:35.650> back

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:59.880 

there's<00:06:40.900> a<00:06:43.830> structure<00:06:53.280> this<00:06:54.280> is

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.600 

I<00:06:59.920> believe<00:07:00.730> that's<00:07:00.880> an<00:07:01.090> old<00:07:01.240> railroad<00:07:01.630> trestle

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
I believe that's an old railroad trestle

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.720 
I believe that's an old railroad trestle
the<00:07:03.610> auto-fire<00:07:04.060> River<00:07:04.300> is<00:07:04.450> on<00:07:04.570> the<00:07:04.690> other<00:07:04.840> side

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:05.730 
the auto-fire River is on the other side

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.810 
the auto-fire River is on the other side
and<00:07:06.960> the<00:07:07.960> powerlines<00:07:08.500> modern-day<00:07:09.280> power<00:07:09.550> line

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
and the powerlines modern-day power line

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.650 
and the powerlines modern-day power line
this<00:07:10.000> is<00:07:10.060> probably<00:07:10.570> from<00:07:10.780> a<00:07:10.980> century<00:07:11.980> ago

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
this is probably from a century ago

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.840 
this is probably from a century ago
that's<00:07:13.660> how<00:07:13.840> they<00:07:13.990> ran<00:07:14.260> the<00:07:14.470> railroad<00:07:14.860> over

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850 
that's how they ran the railroad over

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.320 
that's how they ran the railroad over
the<00:07:16.000> river<00:07:16.240> and<00:07:16.570> they<00:07:17.640> they<00:07:18.640> used<00:07:18.940> a<00:07:19.060> power

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
the river and they they used a power

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.480 
the river and they they used a power
line<00:07:19.630> where<00:07:20.560> they<00:07:20.650> use<00:07:20.890> where<00:07:21.190> the<00:07:21.310> old

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490 
line where they use where the old

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:28.760 
line where they use where the old
railroad<00:07:21.790> was<00:07:22.770> to<00:07:24.720> to<00:07:26.820> just<00:07:27.820> go<00:07:28.030> ahead<00:07:28.120> and<00:07:28.300> run

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:28.770 
railroad was to to just go ahead and run

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.370 
railroad was to to just go ahead and run
run<00:07:29.770> those<00:07:29.950> power<00:07:30.220> lines<00:07:30.340> so<00:07:30.960> that<00:07:31.960> gives<00:07:32.290> you

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.380 
run those power lines so that gives you

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.290 
run those power lines so that gives you
an<00:07:32.440> idea<00:07:35.160> well<00:07:36.160> I<00:07:36.190> got<00:07:36.460> to<00:07:36.580> check<00:07:36.610> in<00:07:36.790> history

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:37.300 
an idea well I got to check in history

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.600 
an idea well I got to check in history
see<00:07:37.570> if<00:07:37.690> railroad<00:07:37.990> workers<00:07:38.380> reported<00:07:38.860> hearing

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.610 
see if railroad workers reported hearing

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:44.220 
see if railroad workers reported hearing
things<00:07:40.000> or<00:07:40.770> that's<00:07:41.770> a<00:07:41.860> pretty<00:07:42.070> sky<00:07:42.690> or<00:07:43.690> seeing

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:44.230 
things or that's a pretty sky or seeing

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.760 
things or that's a pretty sky or seeing
things

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:46.770 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.800 

reports<00:07:47.770> of<00:07:47.860> stuff

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:48.810 
reports of stuff

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:53.000 
reports of stuff
let's<00:07:49.810> trip<00:07:50.110> those<00:07:50.440> vines<00:07:51.210> and<00:07:52.210> reports<00:07:52.630> of

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.010 
let's trip those vines and reports of

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.760 
let's trip those vines and reports of
skunk<00:07:54.010> ape<00:07:54.160> sightings<00:07:54.190> going<00:07:54.850> way<00:07:55.000> back<00:07:55.770> so

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:56.770 
skunk ape sightings going way back so

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:03.129 
skunk ape sightings going way back so
yeah<00:07:57.490> that's<00:07:57.730> pretty<00:07:59.010> sunny

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:03.139 

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:07.089 

but<00:08:03.740> that's<00:08:04.159> probably<00:08:04.400> what<00:08:04.699> that<00:08:04.879> is<00:08:06.099> old

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:07.099 
but that's probably what that is old

00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:09.879 
but that's probably what that is old
