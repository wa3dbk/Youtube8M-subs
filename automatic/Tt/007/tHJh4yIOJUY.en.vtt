00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
when infancy in terms of success at the
club<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:09.900> an<00:01:09.960> upward<00:01:10.260> curve<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.799> I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
club I think or an upward curve and I

club I think or an upward curve and I
think<00:01:11.040> there's<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.310> much<00:01:11.430> more<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> come<00:01:11.909> from

think there's so much more to come from
the<00:01:12.150> squadron<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.900> being<00:01:13.350> apart<00:01:13.590> this

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the squadron and being apart this

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
the squadron and being apart this
order's<00:01:14.130> huge<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.520> me<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.299> long<00:01:15.479> as<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
