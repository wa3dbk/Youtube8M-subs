00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
some search and I love search so yeah I

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.109 
some search and I love search so yeah I
use<00:00:28.140> some<00:00:28.289> scorpion<00:00:28.830> today<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.880> gun

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
use some scorpion today and this gun

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.479 
use some scorpion today and this gun
pretty<00:00:30.630> much<00:00:30.810> has<00:00:30.990> no<00:00:31.260> recoil<00:00:31.740> whatsoever

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
pretty much has no recoil whatsoever

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.340 
pretty much has no recoil whatsoever
like<00:00:33.149> most<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> guns<00:00:33.660> modern<00:00:34.020> warfare<00:00:34.170> 2

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
like most of the guns modern warfare 2

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.130 
like most of the guns modern warfare 2
but<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.489> gun<00:00:35.730> has<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.600> small<00:00:36.840> clip

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
but this gun has a really small clip

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.170 
but this gun has a really small clip
only<00:00:37.410> 20<00:00:37.710> rounds<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:38.879> weak

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
only 20 rounds and then it's really weak

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.840 
only 20 rounds and then it's really weak
so<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.559> challenge<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> use<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.730> it's

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
so it's a challenge to use but it's

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.250 
so it's a challenge to use but it's
pretty<00:00:41.969> satisfying<00:00:42.270> when<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.870> get<00:00:43.020> kills

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
pretty satisfying when you get kills

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.680 
pretty satisfying when you get kills
with<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.910> but<00:00:44.910> I'm<00:00:45.000> not<00:00:45.090> gonna<00:00:45.270> really<00:00:45.539> be

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
with it but I'm not gonna really be

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.000 
with it but I'm not gonna really be
talking<00:00:46.079> too<00:00:46.200> much<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> game<00:00:46.770> well

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
person and I never played halo so I'd

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.510
