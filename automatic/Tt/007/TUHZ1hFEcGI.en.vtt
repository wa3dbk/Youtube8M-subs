 and lets you paste in the folder made of 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.100
 platform with asking us to replace 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.140
 age 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.140
 and now we start the game 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.540
 for which branch is directed 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.540
 father 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.250
 here 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:29.289
 I have tried a fairly cheap computer 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:34.780
 to what good that computer for 258 euros 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:37.049
 exactly and the truth is that it's not going 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.049
 nothing bad 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.630
 It's worth comment now, it 's 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.980
 find server and internet and how 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.690
 you will see already going to start updating 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.990
 and then we give this for example 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.090
 that you do not have to leave 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.540
 but what to find there is proof 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:01.810
 pretty cheap computer for the good 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:04.369
 which is better than there are 50 258 euros more 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.259
 another 100 more or less that I'll spend on 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.210
 the screen or less I will try that less 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.910
 and have hdmi and on the play 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.910
 to play better and good 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.150
 it's a shit highlights the loser of 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.150
 all the shit 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.349
 - I'll put it in the critical nothing of 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.180
 four to have four gigas of ram 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.639
 that the truth is that it is not much but 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.959
 it's good enough life is compared 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.269
 so I had this at first that 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.420

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.819
 integrated video that I only bad that what 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.520
 I see right now but you can spend good 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:50.160
 can be used has been gigas 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.160
 the video card passing it from ram 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.700
 butt graphics and also nacho and 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.700
 recording the games 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.120
 I was recording the game also me 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.990
 they left here for fact so that they do not 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.490
 note a lot and that this works 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.530
 I'm going to leave here because he's going slow 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.360
 you put a pretty good computer 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.310
 how cheap you can play 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.150
 surely good then I have to try 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.750
 today 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.670
 today not tomorrow tomorrow when I'm going to try 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.190
 the computer that is hyper elite 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.440
 v2 if it works for me the safest thing 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.680
 completes it and if not also because it is 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.260
 that they are brings me 500 gigas of 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.240
 ministrations on hard disk 512 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.330
 megas of normal videos the plane will 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.440
 you can put up to 2 gigas with internet 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.440
 no lie nothing 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:06.180
 king of 8.470 I think it was bars the 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:08.440
 37-gigahertz dual-core processor 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.540
 very well 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.870
 and the ati radeon graphics card 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.100
 also but I do not remember 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.860
 hd I do not know what it is 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.639
 and integrated so as you can ask 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.150
 a lot, but 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.999
 I think it holds up pretty good you go to a 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:40.289
 Torro computer was pretty good 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:42.300

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:46.040
 minecraft and pro to record additional 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.440
 well I will try to record some gameplay 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.530
 and I can upload it I do not know if they let me 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.550
 so long to do that but good and nothing 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.030
