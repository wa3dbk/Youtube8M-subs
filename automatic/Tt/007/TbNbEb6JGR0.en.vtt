00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
entirely as fast as you would think he

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.429 
entirely as fast as you would think he
is<00:01:29.400> awesome<00:01:30.000> agility<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.780> balance<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.259> is

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
is awesome agility and balance this is

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.200 
is awesome agility and balance this is
what<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.220> gonna<00:01:32.520> keep<00:01:32.820> him<00:01:33.000> up

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
what I think is gonna keep him up

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.520 
what I think is gonna keep him up
against<00:01:33.540> defenders<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.140> will<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.409> him<00:01:34.500> just

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
against defenders you will see him just

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440 
against defenders you will see him just
even<00:01:35.400> though<00:01:35.520> he's<00:01:35.670> getting<00:01:35.790> shoved<00:01:36.090> off<00:01:36.299> by

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
even though he's getting shoved off by

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.120 
even though he's getting shoved off by
defendants<00:01:36.900> why<00:01:37.049> he's<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.380> his<00:01:37.470> dribbling<00:01:37.920> run

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
defendants why he's on his dribbling run

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.490 
defendants why he's on his dribbling run
he<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.759> always<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.659> board<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.320> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
he is always on the board it's like the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
he is always on the board it's like the
boo<00:01:40.650> stuck<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.100> his<00:01:41.220> feel<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> magnet<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
boo stuck to his feel like a magnet and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.179 
boo stuck to his feel like a magnet and
it<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.229> hard<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:43.740> off<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> ball

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
it is so hard to get off the ball

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.160 
it is so hard to get off the ball
because<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.490> how<00:01:44.700> small<00:01:45.000> he<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.240> he<00:01:45.780> gets<00:01:45.960> out

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
because of how small he is he gets out

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.539 
because of how small he is he gets out

it<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:36.990> depends<00:02:37.320> on<00:02:37.410> your<00:02:37.530> playstyle

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100

if you want to just run with a player I
don't<00:02:40.620> exactly<00:02:41.100> recommend<00:02:41.790> agüero<00:02:42.150> because

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
don't exactly recommend agüero because

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390 
don't exactly recommend agüero because
he<00:02:42.600> isn't<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.990> fastest<00:02:43.530> or<00:02:43.710> plays<00:02:43.920> -<00:02:44.160> just

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
he isn't the fastest or plays - just

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.880 
he isn't the fastest or plays - just
stop<00:02:44.790> pace<00:02:45.120> abusing<00:02:45.690> with<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.410> if<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.710> love
