00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.589 

welcome<00:00:07.919> back<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.189> cycling<00:00:08.550> secret<00:00:08.940> today

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
welcome back to cycling secret today

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.030 
welcome back to cycling secret today
we'll<00:00:09.840> be<00:00:09.960> looking<00:00:10.080> at<00:00:10.260> group<00:00:10.500> writings<00:00:10.920> and

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
we'll be looking at group writings and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.759 
we'll be looking at group writings and
specifically<00:00:11.639> Robert<00:00:12.179> terms<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:13.349> we've<00:00:13.620> seen

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
specifically Robert terms as we've seen

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.829 
specifically Robert terms as we've seen
in<00:00:13.920> previous<00:00:14.070> videos<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:15.150> get<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> huge<00:00:15.599> energy

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
in previous videos you get a huge energy

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.240 
in previous videos you get a huge energy
save<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.410> we've<00:00:16.500> dropped<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.980> behind

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
save and we've dropped and behind

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.550 
save and we've dropped and behind
another<00:00:17.460> cyclist<00:00:17.850> so<00:00:18.600> obviously<00:00:18.960> when<00:00:19.500> you

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
another cyclist so obviously when you

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.320 
another cyclist so obviously when you
have<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.740> group<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.130> cyclists<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.210> all

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
have a group of cyclists they can all

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.120 
have a group of cyclists they can all
work<00:00:21.359> together<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.350> take<00:00:22.529> advantage<00:00:23.010> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
work together and to take advantage of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.400 
work together and to take advantage of
this<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:24.119> will<00:00:24.330> usually<00:00:24.510> mean<00:00:24.810> taking<00:00:25.199> turns

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
this this will usually mean taking turns

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.839 
this this will usually mean taking turns
in<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.650> front<00:00:25.920> where<00:00:26.099> all<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> work<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.670> being

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
in the front where all the work is being

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.939 
in the front where all the work is being
done<00:00:26.970> one<00:00:27.840> common<00:00:28.170> way<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.320> doing<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
done one common way of doing this is

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.970 
done one common way of doing this is
rolling<00:00:29.310> turns<00:00:30.170> when<00:00:31.170> rolling<00:00:31.470> turns<00:00:31.710> there

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
rolling turns when rolling turns there

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.280 
rolling turns when rolling turns there
are<00:00:32.040> two<00:00:32.189> lines<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.669> cyclists<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.930> outside

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
are two lines of cyclists the outside

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.840 
are two lines of cyclists the outside
line<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.739> cyclists<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.340> adding<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> little

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
line of cyclists are adding a little

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.360 
line of cyclists are adding a little
faster<00:00:36.300> than<00:00:36.540> those<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.899> inside<00:00:37.320> as<00:00:37.559> the

faster than those on the inside as the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.130 
faster than those on the inside as the

outside lead cyclist reaches the front

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.869 
outside lead cyclist reaches the front
they'll<00:00:40.590> pull<00:00:40.829> off<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.250> lower<00:00:41.399> their<00:00:41.640> speed

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
they'll pull off and lower their speed

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.660 
they'll pull off and lower their speed
to<00:00:42.059> join<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> slower<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.469> line<00:00:43.680> we're

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to join the slower in a line we're

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.040 
to join the slower in a line we're
reaching<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.030> back<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.420> line<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.960> will

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
reaching the back of this line they will

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.750 
reaching the back of this line they will

pull into the outer faster line and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.540 
pull into the outer faster line and
increase<00:00:48.450> their<00:00:48.660> speed<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.050> match<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:50.039> this

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
have to speed up further to move ahead

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.280 
have to speed up further to move ahead
of<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> you'll<00:01:18.119> both<00:01:18.299> use<00:01:18.750> energy<00:01:18.960> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
of you and you'll both use energy you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
of you and you'll both use energy you
could<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.590> conserved<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.150> will<00:01:21.270> have

an adverse effect right down the line

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.120 
an adverse effect right down the line
you<00:01:24.330> need<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> judge<00:01:24.810> carefully<00:01:25.380> when<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.950> pull

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you need to judge carefully when to pull

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.039 
you need to judge carefully when to pull
off<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.520> front<00:01:26.729> ensuring<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.750> clear<00:01:28.020> of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
off the front ensuring you're clear of

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
off the front ensuring you're clear of
the<00:01:28.290> bike<00:01:28.470> you'll<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.799> moving<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.189> front<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.610> a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the bike you'll be moving in front on a

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.359 
the bike you'll be moving in front on a
quick<00:01:30.479> glance<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.380> under<00:01:31.890> your<00:01:32.100> armor

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
quick glance down and under your armor

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
quick glance down and under your armor
the<00:01:32.490> insight<00:01:32.820> will<00:01:33.119> help<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.689> place<00:01:33.930> their

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the insight will help you to place their

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.749 
the insight will help you to place their
front<00:01:34.439> wheel<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.369> make<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
front wheel so you can make the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.039 
front wheel so you can make the
transition<00:01:36.000> smoothly

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
transition smoothly

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.080 
transition smoothly
when<00:01:38.740> reaching<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.130> back<00:01:39.340> pay<00:01:39.609> attention<00:01:40.000> to

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
when reaching the back pay attention to
