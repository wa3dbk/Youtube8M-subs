of people's behaviors this time of year

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.920 
of people's behaviors this time of year
we<00:00:45.810> tend<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.080> see<00:00:46.260> 6<00:00:46.800> 12<00:00:47.190> sometimes<00:00:48.090> more<00:00:48.330> ducks

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
we tend to see 6 12 sometimes more ducks

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.300 
we tend to see 6 12 sometimes more ducks
coming<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:49.500> public<00:00:49.770> parks<00:00:50.010> from<00:00:50.130> around

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
coming in from public parks from around

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.640 
coming in from public parks from around
the<00:00:50.490> area<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.970> it's<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:51.810> a<00:00:51.840> direct<00:00:52.170> result<00:00:52.320> of

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
the area and it's all a direct result of

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.620 
the area and it's all a direct result of
what<00:00:52.890> people<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.310> feeding<00:00:53.490> the<00:00:53.670> Ducks<00:00:53.880> a<00:00:54.120> lot

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
what people are feeding the Ducks a lot

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.750 
what people are feeding the Ducks a lot
of<00:00:54.750> times<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.290> nutrition<00:00:56.010> associated<00:00:56.670> with

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
of times the nutrition associated with

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.720 
of times the nutrition associated with
pieces<00:00:56.970> of<00:00:57.090> bread<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.450> popcorn<00:00:57.900> or<00:00:58.320> Cheetos

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
pieces of bread or popcorn or Cheetos

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.190 
pieces of bread or popcorn or Cheetos
isn't<00:00:59.730> adequate<00:01:00.120> compared<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> natural

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
isn't adequate compared to the natural

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.440 
isn't adequate compared to the natural
diet<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.620> these<00:01:01.770> ducks<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.180> actually

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
diet of these ducks and so it's actually

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.149 
diet of these ducks and so it's actually
a<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:03.630> deficient<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.259> protein<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.949> lot<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
a very deficient in protein and a lot of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.880 
a very deficient in protein and a lot of
calcium<00:01:05.700> other<00:01:05.850> minerals<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.890> unfortunately

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
calcium other minerals and unfortunately

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.200 
calcium other minerals and unfortunately
what<00:01:08.009> happens<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.430> their<00:01:08.549> bones<00:01:08.759> get<00:01:09.000> very

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
what happens as their bones get very

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.810 
what happens as their bones get very
very<00:01:09.390> soft<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.100> when<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.220> happens<00:01:11.250> their

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
very soft and when that happens their

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.670 
very soft and when that happens their
bones<00:01:11.970> twist<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.780> are<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:13.170> able<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.470> fly

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
bones twist and they are not able to fly

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.100 
bones twist and they are not able to fly
and<00:01:13.979> unfortunately<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.510> tend<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.750> see<00:01:15.900> them<00:01:16.020> at

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and unfortunately we tend to see them at

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
and unfortunately we tend to see them at
the<00:01:16.229> center<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.830> very<00:01:17.100> injured<00:01:17.580> condition

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

towns<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.710> area<00:01:34.799> do<00:01:35.400> put<00:01:35.580> out<00:01:35.670> feeders<00:01:36.060> I'm

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
towns in the area do put out feeders I'm

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.090 
towns in the area do put out feeders I'm
with<00:01:36.450> commercial<00:01:36.840> water<00:01:37.320> fell<00:01:37.530> pellets<00:01:37.920> in

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
with commercial water fell pellets in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.710 
with commercial water fell pellets in
them<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.729> people<00:01:38.940> want<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> feed<00:01:39.270> anything

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
them and if people want to feed anything

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
them and if people want to feed anything
at<00:01:39.840> all<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.320> usually<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:40.920> recommend

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
at all that's usually what we recommend

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.070 
at all that's usually what we recommend
at<00:01:41.909> least<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.360> some<00:01:42.570> nutritionally

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
at least it's some nutritionally

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.810 
at least it's some nutritionally
balanced<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.280> waterfowl<00:01:44.640> are

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
balanced and so the waterfowl are

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.789 
balanced and so the waterfowl are
actually<00:01:45.090> getting<00:01:45.270> an<00:01:45.420> appropriate<00:01:45.869> diet<00:01:46.080> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
actually getting an appropriate diet the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
actually getting an appropriate diet the
other<00:01:46.920> problem<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.210> feed

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
other problem is that when you do feed

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
other problem is that when you do feed
anything<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.080> ducks<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.439> parks<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:50.070> tend<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
anything to ducks in parks they tend to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.950 
anything to ducks in parks they tend to
get<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:50.490> overcrowded<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.479> when<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
get really overcrowded and when that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.179 
get really overcrowded and when that
happens<00:01:52.320> there's<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.740> lot<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:52.979> other

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
happens there's a lot of other

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.609 
happens there's a lot of other
repercussions<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.180> occur<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.260> when

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
repercussions that can occur and so when

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.719 
repercussions that can occur and so when
you<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.860> whole<00:01:56.040> bunch<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.250> ducks<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.580> one

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
you have a whole bunch of ducks in one

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.240 
you have a whole bunch of ducks in one
area<00:01:57.000> there's<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> lot<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> feces<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> might

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
area there's a lot of feces as you might

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.090 
area there's a lot of feces as you might
imagine<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.479> encourages<00:02:01.110> algae<00:02:01.860> blooms

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
imagine and that encourages algae blooms

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.710 
imagine and that encourages algae blooms
especially<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:03.000> hot<00:02:03.180> summer<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
especially in this really hot summer and

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.530 
especially in this really hot summer and
algae<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.530> actually<00:02:04.799> toxic<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.400> people<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.420> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
algae is actually toxic to people and to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.330 
algae is actually toxic to people and to
a<00:02:06.570> lot<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.780> pets<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.320> may<00:02:07.619> go<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.069> near<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
a lot of pets that may go in near the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.979 
a lot of pets that may go in near the
water<00:02:08.549> and<00:02:08.729> unfortunately<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.869> also

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
water and unfortunately it can also

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.660 
water and unfortunately it can also
cause<00:02:10.229> die-offs<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.830> fish<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.189> the<00:02:11.220> region<00:02:11.549> as

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
cause die-offs of fish in the region as

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.030 
cause die-offs of fish in the region as
well<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:13.110> don't<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.409> to<00:02:13.560> we<00:02:13.799> don't<00:02:13.860> like

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
well so we don't like to we don't like

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.800 
well so we don't like to we don't like
to<00:02:14.129> recommend<00:02:14.489> feeding<00:02:14.760> whatsoever<00:02:15.239> but<00:02:15.659> if

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
to recommend feeding whatsoever but if

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.929 
to recommend feeding whatsoever but if
you<00:02:15.959> do<00:02:16.139> some<00:02:16.859> of<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.040> area's<00:02:17.459> some<00:02:17.669> that<00:02:17.849> do

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
you do some of the area's some that do

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.039 
you do some of the area's some that do
provide<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.299> commercial<00:02:18.659> pellets<00:02:18.930> are

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
provide the commercial pellets are

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:19.610 
provide the commercial pellets are
better

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
better

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.170 
better
certainly<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.190> popcorn<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.790> bread<00:02:20.970> I

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
certainly the popcorn and the bread I

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.360 
certainly the popcorn and the bread I
had<00:02:21.450> no<00:02:21.690> clue<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.230> keep<00:02:22.500> saying<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.010> this

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
had no clue like I keep saying so this

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.710 
had no clue like I keep saying so this
could<00:02:23.519> actually<00:02:23.670> end<00:02:23.909> up<00:02:23.970> hurting<00:02:24.239> not<00:02:24.599> only

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
could actually end up hurting not only

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.970 
could actually end up hurting not only
the<00:02:24.900> Ducks<00:02:25.170> but<00:02:25.409> also<00:02:25.530> i<00:02:25.680> mean<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the Ducks but also i mean the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.190 
the Ducks but also i mean the
environment<00:02:26.549> around<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.879> area<00:02:27.209> absolutely

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
environment around this area absolutely

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.479 
environment around this area absolutely
yeah<00:02:28.409> a<00:02:28.470> lot<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.739> times<00:02:28.920> when<00:02:29.129> you<00:02:29.220> have<00:02:29.250> these

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
yeah a lot of times when you have these

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.180 
yeah a lot of times when you have these
algal<00:02:29.940> blooms<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.870> people<00:02:31.379> will<00:02:31.860> definitely

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
algal blooms the people will definitely

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.170 
algal blooms the people will definitely
get<00:02:32.250> affected<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.730> there's<00:02:32.909> a<00:02:32.970> smell

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
get affected to you there's a smell

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.750 
get affected to you there's a smell
associated<00:02:33.510> with<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.080> as<00:02:34.200> well<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.760> other

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
associated with it as well and other

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.580 
associated with it as well and other
kinds<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.239> waterfowl<00:02:36.629> like<00:02:36.870> candidate<00:02:37.530> e

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
kinds of waterfowl like candidate e

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.259 
kinds of waterfowl like candidate e
geese<00:02:37.769> for<00:02:37.980> example<00:02:38.340> we'll<00:02:38.549> use<00:02:38.579> these<00:02:38.849> parks

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
geese for example we'll use these parks

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.089 
geese for example we'll use these parks
as<00:02:39.450> for<00:02:39.659> their<00:02:39.870> home<00:02:40.049> base<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:40.950> they'll

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
as for their home base and then they'll

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.800 
as for their home base and then they'll
fly<00:02:41.250> off<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.549> other<00:02:41.670> areas<00:02:41.879> like<00:02:42.209> golf<00:02:42.450> courses

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
fly off to other areas like golf courses

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.809 
fly off to other areas like golf courses
or<00:02:43.049> other<00:02:43.170> neighborhoods<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.950> cause<00:02:44.610> further

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
or other neighborhoods and cause further

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.460 
or other neighborhoods and cause further
destruction<00:02:45.209> with<00:02:45.510> their<00:02:45.629> foraging<00:02:45.900> there<00:02:46.230> so

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
destruction with their foraging there so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.710 
destruction with their foraging there so
it's<00:02:46.920> sort<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.159> a<00:02:47.220> little<00:02:47.569> hotbed<00:02:48.569> of<00:02:48.599> activity

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
it's sort of a little hotbed of activity

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.259 
it's sort of a little hotbed of activity
that<00:02:49.140> we<00:02:49.379> really<00:02:49.650> want<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.920> try<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.269> just

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
that we really want to try to just

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.750 
that we really want to try to just
prevent<00:02:52.019> people<00:02:52.230> from<00:02:52.260> from<00:02:53.129> from<00:02:53.370> doing<00:02:53.640> this

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
prevent people from from from doing this

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.789 
prevent people from from from doing this
gotcha<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.450> got<00:02:54.569> about<00:02:54.660> 10<00:02:54.959> seconds<00:02:55.349> like<00:02:55.620> you

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
gotcha we got about 10 seconds like you

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.250 
gotcha we got about 10 seconds like you
said<00:02:56.129> I<00:02:56.430> mean<00:02:56.819> just<00:02:57.150> kind<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.750> stay<00:02:57.959> away<00:02:58.200> from

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
said I mean just kind of stay away from

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.630 
said I mean just kind of stay away from
feeding<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.829> mean<00:02:58.980> when<00:02:59.190> we're<00:02:59.340> talking<00:02:59.489> about

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
feeding I mean when we're talking about

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.430
