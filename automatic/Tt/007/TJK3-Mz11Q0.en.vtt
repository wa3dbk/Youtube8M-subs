square and then this Bishop wants to try

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
square and then this Bishop wants to try
to<00:00:52.739> get<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.969> porn<00:00:54.239> moves<00:00:54.480> this

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
to get out so if the porn moves this

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.010 
to get out so if the porn moves this
bishop<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.829> come<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.160> somehow<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> that's

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
bishop can come out somehow so that's

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.959 
bishop can come out somehow so that's
the<00:00:58.170> idea<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> Carrick<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.609> rather<00:00:59.879> than

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the idea of the Carrick on rather than

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.080 
the idea of the Carrick on rather than
the<00:01:00.239> French<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.250> avoiding<00:01:02.250> any<00:01:02.460> possible

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the French and avoiding any possible

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.020 
the French and avoiding any possible
tricks<00:01:03.570> over<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.470> f7<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:05.309> anything<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:05.850> that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
tricks over the f7 or anything like that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.670 
tricks over the f7 or anything like that
so<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:07.530> line<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.130> would<00:01:08.640> recommend<00:01:08.900> here<00:01:09.900> there

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
so the line I would recommend here there

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
so the line I would recommend here there
are<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.830> lot<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> lines<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.820> course<00:01:11.850> but

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
are a lot of lines here of course but

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.820 
are a lot of lines here of course but
the<00:01:12.450> line<00:01:12.630> i<00:01:12.659> would<00:01:12.900> recommend<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> most

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the line i would recommend here the most

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.399 
the line i would recommend here the most
is<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.780> e5<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.409> advanced<00:01:16.950> porn<00:01:17.400> variation<00:01:18.060> oh

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's called several ideas probably not

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.330 
it's called several ideas probably not
the<00:01:25.020> best<00:01:25.049> idea<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.590> take<00:01:25.890> because<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the best idea to take because it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
the best idea to take because it
simplifies<00:01:26.700> Blacks<00:01:27.330> game<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.900> helps<00:01:28.140> plug

five is the simplest most logical move
in<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.680> opinion<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.340> having<00:01:42.030> an<00:01:42.180> unbalanced

challenges letting the spawn be in the
way<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.890> night<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:49.770> if<00:01:50.340> black<00:01:50.759> plays

e6<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.229> bad<00:01:52.439> bishop<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.040> bad<00:01:53.220> French

blue losing a temple so what usually

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.399 
blue losing a temple so what usually
black<00:01:58.979> place<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.670> they<00:02:00.509> developed<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.049> bishop

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
black place is they developed a bishop

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.469 
black place is they developed a bishop
to<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.649> an<00:02:01.799> active<00:02:02.399> square<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:02.969> f5<00:02:05.270> just<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> try

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
to it an active square on f5 just to try

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.449 
to it an active square on f5 just to try
to<00:02:06.509> get<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> bishop<00:02:07.229> out<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:07.740> play<00:02:07.950> e6

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
to get the bishop out and then play e6

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.219 
to get the bishop out and then play e6
and<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.690> bishop

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and have this bishop

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.350 
and have this bishop
well<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:11.159> there<00:02:11.430> are<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.519> lot<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.700> moves<00:02:12.060> here

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
well now there are a lot of moves here

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800 
well now there are a lot of moves here
that<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.659> can<00:02:12.780> do<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.790> move<00:02:14.970> our<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.450> command

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
that you can do the move our to command

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.309 
that you can do the move our to command
is<00:02:16.019> actually<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.970> simple<00:02:17.970> solid<00:02:18.330> logical<00:02:19.140> move

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
is actually a simple solid logical move

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.410 
is actually a simple solid logical move
which<00:02:19.709> zach<00:02:20.040> which<00:02:20.340> has<00:02:20.580> actually<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.150> been

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
which zach which has actually not been

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.080 
which zach which has actually not been
played<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.379> lot<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.709> games<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.819> think

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
played in a lot of games but I think

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.979 
played in a lot of games but I think
it's<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.360> pretty<00:02:24.569> effective<00:02:24.780> move<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:26.989> the

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
it's a pretty effective move and the

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.180 
it's a pretty effective move and the
move<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.440> Bishop<00:02:28.920> d3<00:02:30.260> now<00:02:31.260> why<00:02:31.530> Bishop<00:02:31.980> d3

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
move is Bishop d3 now why Bishop d3

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.780

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
played most of the time well several

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.360 
played most of the time well several
ideas<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:42.000> bishop<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.660> five<00:02:43.160> looks<00:02:44.160> like<00:02:44.340> a

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
ideas this bishop on a five looks like a

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.180 
ideas this bishop on a five looks like a
good<00:02:44.610> piece<00:02:44.879> right<00:02:45.209> developed<00:02:45.769> attacks<00:02:46.769> here

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
good piece right developed attacks here

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.460 
good piece right developed attacks here
a<00:02:47.720> little<00:02:48.720> bit<00:02:49.280> controls<00:02:50.280> out<00:02:50.489> of<00:02:50.640> squares<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
a little bit controls out of squares and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.490 
a little bit controls out of squares and
this<00:02:52.470> bush<00:02:52.709> but<00:02:52.920> if<00:02:53.099> one<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:54.720> out<00:02:54.959> just

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
this bush but if one is just out just

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.069 
this bush but if one is just out just
developing<00:02:56.040> so<00:02:56.849> would<00:02:57.120> be<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.299> good<00:02:57.450> idea<00:02:57.569> to

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
developing so would be a good idea to

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.949 
developing so would be a good idea to
trade<00:02:58.680> them<00:02:58.890> off<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.910> helps<00:03:00.239> white<00:03:00.569> also

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
trade them off and that helps white also

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.130 
trade them off and that helps white also
get<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.260> Queen<00:03:01.470> out<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.730> game<00:03:02.940> so<00:03:03.660> help<00:03:03.930> so

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
get the Queen out to the game so help so

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.369 
get the Queen out to the game so help so
I<00:03:04.230> gained<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> temple<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.900> let's<00:03:06.900> say<00:03:07.079> black

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
I gained a temple and let's say black

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.039 
I gained a temple and let's say black
takes<00:03:08.660> takes<00:03:09.660> 90<00:03:10.019> d<00:03:10.230> 7<00:03:11.150> now<00:03:12.150> why<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.540> has<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.780> lot

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
takes takes 90 d 7 now why it has a lot

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.259 
takes takes 90 d 7 now why it has a lot
of<00:03:13.079> different<00:03:13.620> ideas<00:03:14.069> which<00:03:14.669> could<00:03:14.910> be<00:03:15.060> very

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
of different ideas which could be very

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.069 
of different ideas which could be very
effective<00:03:15.660> for<00:03:15.870> white<00:03:16.700> including<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.299> pawn

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
effective for white including the pawn

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.909 
effective for white including the pawn
sacrifice<00:03:19.349> e6<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.459> gain<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.819> lot<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.209> space<00:03:21.510> and

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
sacrifice e6 to gain a lot of space and

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.470 
sacrifice e6 to gain a lot of space and
now<00:03:22.919> if<00:03:23.160> F<00:03:23.370> takes<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.120> play<00:03:24.299> a<00:03:24.329> 4<00:03:24.919> 92<00:03:25.919> 93

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
now if F takes you can play a 4 92 93

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.069 
now if F takes you can play a 4 92 93
with<00:03:27.480> ideas<00:03:27.900> like<00:03:27.930> 95<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:28.980> 95<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.870> black<00:03:30.870> has

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
with ideas like 95 and 95 and black has

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.589 
with ideas like 95 and 95 and black has
a<00:03:31.109> very<00:03:31.380> tight<00:03:31.549> type<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.760> position<00:03:33.299> tough

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
a very tight type of position tough

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.559 
a very tight type of position tough
tough<00:03:33.870> position<00:03:36.799> so<00:03:37.799> already<00:03:38.130> black<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.239> find

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
tough position so already black can find

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.930 
tough position so already black can find
himself<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:40.109> a<00:03:40.230> tough<00:03:40.470> position<00:03:40.940> starting

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
himself in a tough position starting

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.780 
himself in a tough position starting
this<00:03:42.090> moment<00:03:42.599> I<00:03:42.950> mean<00:03:43.950> what<00:03:44.160> else<00:03:44.190> can<00:03:44.549> black

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
this moment I mean what else can black

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.210 
this moment I mean what else can black
dude<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.299> lot<00:03:45.569> of<00:03:45.599> them<00:03:45.810> play<00:03:46.049> e6<00:03:46.560> now<00:03:46.889> that<00:03:47.099> this

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
dude a lot of them play e6 now that this

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.030 
dude a lot of them play e6 now that this
Bishop<00:03:47.609> is<00:03:47.730> traded<00:03:48.269> but<00:03:49.200> then<00:03:49.349> also<00:03:49.590> why<00:03:49.980> it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
Bishop is traded but then also why it

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.069 
Bishop is traded but then also why it
has<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.220> strong<00:03:50.609> idea<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.180> try<00:03:51.419> to<00:03:51.480> put<00:03:51.780> pressure

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
has a strong idea to try to put pressure

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.970 
has a strong idea to try to put pressure
and<00:03:52.470> attack<00:03:54.139> probably<00:03:55.139> a<00:03:55.169> good<00:03:55.230> idea<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.680> start

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
and attack probably a good idea to start

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.229 
and attack probably a good idea to start
with<00:03:56.160> Bishop<00:03:56.459> e3<00:03:56.609> just<00:03:57.419> to<00:03:58.400> prolong<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.639> c5

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
with Bishop e3 just to prolong the c5

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.659 
with Bishop e3 just to prolong the c5
idea<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:02.180> then<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.389> say<00:04:03.599> 97<00:04:04.349> can<00:04:05.010> play<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.220> for

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
idea and then if say 97 can play a for

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:10.339 
idea and then if say 97 can play a for
the<00:04:06.660> idea<00:04:06.959> night<00:04:07.139> of<00:04:07.260> 392<00:04:07.949> and<00:04:08.780> then<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:10.169> have

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
the idea night of 392 and then you have

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.710 
the idea night of 392 and then you have
a<00:04:10.379> very<00:04:10.650> solid<00:04:11.010> bone<00:04:11.430> structure<00:04:12.060> very<00:04:12.269> solid

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
a very solid bone structure very solid

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.069 
a very solid bone structure very solid
Center<00:04:13.370> followed<00:04:14.370> by<00:04:14.519> castles<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.419> then

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
Center followed by castles and then

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.330 
Center followed by castles and then
possibly<00:04:16.590> even<00:04:16.820> g45<00:04:17.820> at<00:04:18.180> some<00:04:19.049> point<00:04:19.349> and<00:04:19.680> then

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
possibly even g45 at some point and then

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.020 
possibly even g45 at some point and then
definitely<00:04:21.329> white<00:04:21.599> might<00:04:21.840> have<00:04:22.079> a<00:04:22.109> true

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
definitely white might have a true

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.360 
definitely white might have a true
a strong<00:04:23.420> attack<00:04:23.780> going<00:04:24.139> on<00:04:24.290> whereas<00:04:25.130> on<00:04:25.340> the

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
a strong attack going on whereas on the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.150 
a strong attack going on whereas on the
queenside<00:04:25.730> black<00:04:26.360> whites<00:04:26.690> pretty<00:04:27.080> safe<00:04:27.470> with

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
queenside black whites pretty safe with

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.879 
queenside black whites pretty safe with
the<00:04:28.250> solid<00:04:28.520> center<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.410> everything<00:04:30.410> is<00:04:30.560> solid

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.560 

so<00:04:33.889> this<00:04:34.190> seems<00:04:34.610> like<00:04:34.730> a<00:04:34.880> pretty<00:04:35.180> interesting

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
so this seems like a pretty interesting

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.680 
so this seems like a pretty interesting
line<00:04:36.050> for<00:04:37.840> for<00:04:38.840> white<00:04:39.250> now<00:04:40.250> i'm<00:04:40.970> going<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.389> show

Bonin um in an action event it was

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.510 
Bonin um in an action event it was
actually<00:04:54.080> played<00:04:54.290> a<00:04:54.320> long<00:04:54.590> time<00:04:54.950> ago<00:04:55.190> but<00:04:55.460> I

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
actually played a long time ago but I

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.060 
actually played a long time ago but I
think<00:04:55.760> it's<00:04:55.910> a<00:04:56.000> pretty<00:04:56.210> instructive<00:04:56.810> game<00:04:57.080> now

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
think it's a pretty instructive game now

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.090 
think it's a pretty instructive game now
