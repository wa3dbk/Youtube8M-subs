fingers that were playing down here up
right<00:02:35.910> there<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.720> goes<00:02:36.900> as<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:39.090> know<00:02:39.269> right

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
think of like as an X here here down to

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.660 
think of like as an X here here down to
the<00:03:20.250> fifth<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:20.730> seventh<00:03:21.000> fret<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.440> up<00:03:22.670> same

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
on the 5th and 7th fret except this time

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.140 
on the 5th and 7th fret except this time
it's<00:03:26.280> going<00:03:26.430> from<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.239> 5th<00:03:27.840> 4<00:03:28.230> 3rd<00:03:28.680> string<00:03:29.150> 26

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
it's going from the 5th 4 3rd string 26

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.380 
it's going from the 5th 4 3rd string 26
5th<00:03:30.480> 4th<00:03:30.780> string<00:03:31.140> then<00:03:32.100> coming<00:03:32.430> back<00:03:32.459> over<00:03:33.000> to

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
5th 4th string then coming back over to

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.610 
5th 4th string then coming back over to
where<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.630> were<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.870> start<00:03:34.110> with<00:03:34.290> but

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
where you were to start with but

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.850 
where you were to start with but
dropping<00:03:34.890> down<00:03:35.239> here<00:03:36.239> here<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.970> here<00:03:39.860> sewing

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
dropping down here here here here sewing

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.660 
dropping down here here here here sewing
pattern<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.520> go<00:03:41.670> like<00:03:43.160> down<00:03:44.160> down<00:03:44.430> down

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
pattern I just go like down down down

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.370 
pattern I just go like down down down
then<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.940> start<00:03:48.420> I<00:03:48.480> think<00:03:48.660> with<00:03:48.750> an<00:03:48.840> upstroke<00:03:49.170> on

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
then I start I think with an upstroke on

00:03:49.380 --> 00:04:08.270 
then I start I think with an upstroke on
the<00:03:49.470> net<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.800> the<00:03:50.070> next<00:03:50.430> one<00:03:54.560> or<00:03:55.560> down

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.890 

so<00:04:09.280> next<00:04:09.519> because<00:04:10.209> these<00:04:10.360> chords<00:04:10.780> are

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
so next because these chords are

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.610 
so next because these chords are
equivalent<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.349> g<00:04:13.709> g<00:04:14.709> regular<00:04:15.220> g

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
equivalent to g g regular g

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.810 
equivalent to g g regular g
a<00:04:18.350> minor

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:29.320 

so<00:04:22.820> once<00:04:23.390> you<00:04:23.510> get<00:04:23.630> past<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:28.090> that's<00:04:29.090> just

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
so once you get past that that's just

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:40.830 
so once you get past that that's just
the<00:04:29.480> intro<00:04:29.990> then<00:04:30.230> you<00:04:30.320> can<00:04:30.440> get<00:04:30.590> to

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.780 

I

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.680 

so<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.420> gonna<00:04:46.480> go<00:04:47.820> like<00:04:48.820> three<00:04:49.180> down<00:04:49.390> shows

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
so you gonna go like three down shows

00:04:49.690 --> 00:05:06.390 
so you gonna go like three down shows
like<00:04:52.140> it<00:04:53.140> oh<00:04:53.430> so<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.520> said<00:04:54.730> no<00:04:54.880> all<00:04:55.420> right<00:04:55.510> d

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.930 

stop

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:29.460
