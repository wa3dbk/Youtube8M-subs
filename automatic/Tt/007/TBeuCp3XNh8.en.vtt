the actual weight of the material or the
metal<00:00:57.590> some<00:00:58.780> companies<00:00:59.780> like<00:00:59.870> this<00:01:00.050> GT<00:01:00.380> matte

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.130 
metal some companies like this GT matte
it's<00:01:00.770> very<00:01:01.010> light<00:01:01.570> that's<00:01:02.570> because<00:01:02.899> they

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
it's very light that's because they

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.310 
it's very light that's because they
don't<00:01:03.320> want<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.620> use<00:01:03.770> as<00:01:03.920> much<00:01:04.750> butyl<00:01:05.750> because

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
don't want to use as much butyl because

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.080 
don't want to use as much butyl because
butyl<00:01:06.770> is<00:01:06.860> expensive<00:01:07.310> its<00:01:07.520> petroleum-based

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
butyl is expensive its petroleum-based

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.149 
butyl is expensive its petroleum-based
so<00:01:08.990> they<00:01:09.200> whip<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.530> with<00:01:09.619> air<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:09.950> they<00:01:10.009> make

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
so they whip it with air and they make

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.550 
so they whip it with air and they make
it<00:01:10.280> lighter<00:01:11.149> so<00:01:11.600> it<00:01:11.719> looks<00:01:11.899> like<00:01:11.959> it's<00:01:12.289> thick

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
it lighter so it looks like it's thick

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.230 
it lighter so it looks like it's thick
and<00:01:12.770> there's<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.399> lot<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.579> material<00:01:13.969> but<00:01:14.030> there

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
and there's a lot of material but there

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.389 
and there's a lot of material but there
isn't<00:01:14.359> so<00:01:14.600> that's<00:01:14.780> how<00:01:14.899> they<00:01:15.020> get<00:01:15.139> the<00:01:15.319> cost<00:01:15.590> to

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
isn't so that's how they get the cost to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.849 
isn't so that's how they get the cost to
make<00:01:16.549> it<00:01:16.700> cheap<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.630> really<00:01:17.899> boils<00:01:18.229> down<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.409> is

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
make it cheap it really boils down to is

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.919 
make it cheap it really boils down to is
how<00:01:19.490> thick<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.819> aluminum<00:01:20.240> is<00:01:20.359> and<00:01:20.600> how<00:01:20.689> heavy

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
how thick the aluminum is and how heavy

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:22.870 
how thick the aluminum is and how heavy
the<00:01:21.109> butyl<00:01:21.439> is<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.859> then<00:01:21.979> how<00:01:22.159> low<00:01:22.340> it<00:01:22.520> bonds

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
the butyl is and then how low it bonds

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.340 
the butyl is and then how low it bonds
those<00:01:23.060> are<00:01:23.209> the<00:01:23.359> three<00:01:23.569> things<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.049> want<00:01:24.200> it

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
those are the three things you want it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.190 
those are the three things you want it
heavier<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.429> want<00:01:25.579> it<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.759> bond<00:01:25.959> so<00:01:26.959> we're

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
heavier and you want it to bond so we're

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.289 
heavier and you want it to bond so we're
going<00:01:27.289> to<00:01:27.350> go<00:01:27.469> and<00:01:27.649> do<00:01:27.889> this<00:01:28.009> wd-40<00:01:28.819> test<00:01:29.060> real

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
going to go and do this wd-40 test real

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.080 
going to go and do this wd-40 test real
quick<00:01:29.329> just<00:01:30.079> to<00:01:30.170> show<00:01:30.439> that<00:01:30.469> their<00:01:31.090> material

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
quick just to show that their material

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.839 
quick just to show that their material
will<00:01:32.659> act<00:01:32.779> the<00:01:32.990> same<00:01:33.170> way<00:01:33.439> if<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:33.829> put<00:01:34.219> it<00:01:34.549> on

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 
will act the same way if you put it on

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:42.399 
will act the same way if you put it on
wd-40<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:37.779> 40<00:01:38.779> on<00:01:38.899> there<00:01:41.079> here's<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.229> hush
