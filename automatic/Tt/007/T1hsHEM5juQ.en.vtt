00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.840

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.070

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.440
 they like the zombie characters that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.790
 we have what I saw is with a cliché is 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.980
 as a hidden character that 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.260
 unlock by doing some things times 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.989
 played the zombies the black ozone 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.420
 and has done the interests of the towers 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.399
 well there is a cliché that there are a couple of 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.989
 towers on a map that goes up a 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.989
 trophy and when you leave the game you 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.519
 the zombie comes out we invite you to a couple of 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.039
 more friends for more kids who wanted 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.750
 do it which is to say that I wanted to have what 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.379
 that your character is also handsome in 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.379
 build a nerve 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.640
 work and danny want you want to have the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.640
 zombie character jon and clear 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.810
 How to give cane or egg that you have 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:23.159
 put true neither uncle my mother that two 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:25.590
 arms with the arm that I explain to you a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.080
 thing is worth this cliché can not be done 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.750
 yes no if you do not have a patched computer 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.070
 the steps are saying chris mckay 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.630
 that it's me and I 'm saying if it's coming out 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.630
 bad if everything goes well 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.570
 during this time 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.640
 this other so that they sell in the mouth of 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.650
 is 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.650
 I had to take in this mouth 23 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.500
 what comes 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.330
 up here and on it ascended the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.330
 right tower 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.599
 the next step of this figure 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.330
 and this also has to do with zombies 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.489
 you do not make a zombie face because everything goes 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.110
 fitting to not have to shoot at 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.700
 this crazy 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.700
 now to the next eye 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.409
 and read this word that puts 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.330
 I get it if I get the alert went on 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.650
 the perfect tower at the moment is going well 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.940
 we all have to come here 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.420
 Running running running 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.130

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.200

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.430
 that to turn here is turning 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.430
 here fast fast fast here 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.890
 then activate 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.160
 being perfect uncle 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.320
 now a horde of zombies are coming 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.320
 just activate all the towers 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.190
 now they will come 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.150
 and the truth come out there 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.650

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.840

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.420
 We have not seen any real dude that 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:23.320
 we do not hear a thing a thing a thing 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.320
