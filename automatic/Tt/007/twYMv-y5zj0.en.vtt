00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
 think that together they have sold almost 170 million on the market 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.559
 of units in the space of about 10 years I would say scary numbers selling of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.799
 made the last generation then that of xbox 3 60 and pleistescion 3 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.090
 The bigger the success, the clearer we are 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.250
 you will ask for video players quite hardened did not own one 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.090
 playstation 3 an xbox 3 60 I believe almost none and it is precisely for this reason 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.180
 that the developers do not yet feel completely ready to 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.180
 abandon the old platforms the old consoles 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.030
 sideco centered the point of this video as you can see from the title here below how 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.820
 you heard from the small introduction today we will talk about a subject so much 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.780
 simple and fairly clear: playstation 3 and xbox 3 60 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.930
 they died as far as I'm concerned, and they won't be for quite a while yet 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.300
 time I think at least a couple of anne 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.980
 I think a clue to the next inevitable I would say retirement of the two consoles 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.780
 above I would say that ubisoft gave it one of the development houses 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.210
 most famous of the most successful industry that has recently done 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.280
 to know that you no longer want to develop on older generation consoles 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.950
 so his next triple won't come out for play 3 and xbox 3 60 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.000
 except, however, for a single game or just the news a title 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.690
 literally the casual that you can not say that in short, I would not say in short 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.090
 can invite to go out on the old consoles and on every possible platform 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.250
 and imaginable and therefore it is good from this point of view I would say that it can 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.990
 but also staying for the rest is enough with a certain solvent with the arrival of the new one 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.130
 so it was 2015 year 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.369
 a physiological drop in the cross and jenna outputs or those titles of those 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.089
 products that are developed 

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:48.479
 both for the current generation and for the first generation, just take a few steps 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.540
 back more or less at the end of 2014 to see 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.800
 cuanti triple 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.860
 how many titles came out on both play 3 and xbox 3 60 and on xbox on go 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.110
 pleistescion 4 from the shadow of the dead now to make cray 4 the big party car 5 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.270
 in short, there were really so many if not all of the car rent video games 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.320
 jenna but let's face it despite headlines like the witcher 3 batman 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.930
 arkham night project unravels that will be developed only for xbox 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.490
 --wanna playstation 4 epc the users and even the developers do not feel 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.940
 completely ready to abandon the old consoles of course the sales data 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.000
 jenner deficiencies speak clearly and decree it as a real one 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.409
 success at least from that point of view comply 4 to 22 million and xbox on anna 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.749
 to 12 million without forgetting wiew that the 10 million is about to arrive however me 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:43.510
 it would come to say that this is a runaway success right on the heels 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.980
 of their predecessors, in short, it is as if the consoles were thinking of it 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:52.099
 of lacking jenna on trust and that's exactly what I did for you is 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.279
 basically of exclusive titles for the new generation that are worth 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:03:00.919
 really the expense of three 400 europe say that there are none or they really are 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:05.650
 very few licenses then count that there is a huge amount of ports the divas 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.349
 master you were e-mails that are literally conquering the shelves 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.469
 regarding play4free xbox on anna 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.909
 photo 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:20.229
 in short, playstation 3 xbox 360 to be considered dead for you cagliari. 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:24.400
 even more alive than ever with a fan of the three we talked about before 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.190
 unbelievable 106 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.230
 70 million units and thousands of thousands of games still present 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.390
 on the shelves of the major retailers that certainly unloads the kanun 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.120
 apart from a very important slice of the sale there is also to consider a 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.680
 a factor that many have not taken into consideration often and willingly 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.760
 or the generational leap regarding the potential of consoles 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.660
 in short, what we saw between pley 2 etti the first x box replay 3 and xbox 3 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.660
 60 does not really cancel what to do with xbox 3 60 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.130
 tschantret outlets and the jenna shortcomings certainly their inevitable destiny as it is 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.270
 it is right and normal that it is to disappear but slowly but slowly 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.570
 what it will really take for direct rai 3 xbox 3 60 are consoles 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.480
 old obsolete and now outdated I leave the word want I can tone comments and 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.480
