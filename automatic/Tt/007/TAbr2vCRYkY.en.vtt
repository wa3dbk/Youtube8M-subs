00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.640
 when khl team players think about a match with 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 Vityaz many begin to tremble 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.650
 knees in the composition of the knight much more 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.210
 tough guys than any other khl club in 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.190
 this is the off season 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.520
 Moscow Region team updated immediately 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.420
 four newcomers from canada nectar 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.090
 socks the main difference from nhl I found 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.429
 physical fight in america in any league 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.439
 much more rudeness but we were paid 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.420
 money so we come here to play and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.480
 we will represent our team as 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.480
 can you better jeremy yablonski 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.620
 for us it doesn't matter who is on the ice 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.300
 I hope you play against someone 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.579
 will fight for the prize cup and 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.950
 the tremors will go into shock and then we and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.440
 We see who will stand at the end of the US combat 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.160
 in all lips 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.230
 kip brennan when am I going to anybody 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.270
 check i don't look at his last name on 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.039
 back I'm just driving up to him and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.260
 trying to strike so strong 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.560
 as much as I can, trying to hurt 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.210
 maybe this is a bit brutal desire 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.619
 especially rivals Knights worth fear 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.299
 john not grow his whole career he spent in 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.670
 lower north american leagues and 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.860
 scored more than 300 penalties four times 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.080
 minutes per season debut match 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.330
 Knight appeared for John not too 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 successful his team lost to salavat 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.540
 Yulaev 411 seems to be a rout but john is not 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.619
 upset in that fight he managed 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.689
 test for strength 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.880
 player Salavat Alexander Svitov 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.820
 the fight is over for the Russians and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.009
 broken teeth and hand injuries and games 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.170
 the first match we terribly liked someone 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.939
 there complained after playing our style but 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.070
 this is our job and we are obliged 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.640
 benefit your team by anyone 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.920
 as much as we can do John 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.020
 boxing for more than ten years now after 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.969
 training knights to him lined up 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.610
 lineup of players from the Moscow Region team 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.820
 who want to learn fighting experience 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.180
 Canadian 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.180
 Now 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:11.110
 the coming season last knight 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.959
 installed several fight 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.450
 Khl records so January match against 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.970
 Omsk avant-garde did not last and one 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.580
 period of pure time but hockey players 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.299
 staged a massive fight fight intermittently 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.040
 lasted a record hour and a half 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.260
 another match against the same avant-garde in 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.810
 December last year because of the massacre 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.220
 arranged by the players of the knight was interrupted 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.930
 already at 6 seconds 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.590
 hardly anyone will be able to start a fight 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.810
 faster i am happy to be here 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.120
 part of the knight I followed this command 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.989
 few years I knew a little about her 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.420
 just happy to play here peacocks train

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.430
 Nazarov 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.319
 Andrei is the first Russian tough guy in nhl he 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.709
 Olga's passion and remembers the old days 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.139
 feeling most pleasant especially when 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.629
 control really if 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:07.150
 seriously nothing fun no job 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:10.109
 seriously really work is 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.689
 this as much as possible to bring 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.060
 opponent players from the game in the same 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.260
 include the role then vg 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.359
 Canadian newcomers immediately 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.269
 loved their Russian coach they 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.400
 affectionately call him on zi de zi 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.889
 handsome he knows english helps 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.459
 we understand what it seems to us 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:32.500
 generally cool fortunate with the coach why, 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.139
 most trainers do not understand tough guys 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.359
 onesie himself was so he does not ask 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.760
 us why did you do this or that 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.400
 he knows why we are pleased with him 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.780
 work 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.879
 signing contracts all with new and 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.469
 new tamga pit Nazarov explains 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.290
 just need to win 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:53.469
 starting with annoyance and then maybe 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.840
 if your colleagues do not tune in to us 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.759
 in them beat the knight club with one of 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.620
 smallest budgets in chl 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.419
 however, the Moscow Region team often 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.790
 earn points due to the fact that 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.919
 simply intimidates costly 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.199
 stars of the opponent knight for it 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.989
 dislike but interest in games chl 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:14.310
 the club noticeably warms up adding pepper 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.310
 to our hockey league
