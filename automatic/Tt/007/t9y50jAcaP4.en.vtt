00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
think Rodriguez is better than as simple

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.530 
think Rodriguez is better than as simple
as<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.290> Neymar<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.860> form<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:03.850> in

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
as that Neymar is in form I think in

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.770 
as that Neymar is in form I think in
terms<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.990> a<00:03:05.080> come<00:03:05.380> near<00:03:06.220> mar<00:03:06.490> is<00:03:06.730> worse<00:03:07.270> than

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
terms of a come near mar is worse than

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.710 
terms of a come near mar is worse than
James<00:03:08.110> Rodriguez<00:03:08.740> striker<00:03:09.250> Neymar<00:03:10.209> is<00:03:10.390> better

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
James Rodriguez striker Neymar is better

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.410 
James Rodriguez striker Neymar is better
that's<00:03:11.110> as<00:03:11.380> simple<00:03:11.590> as<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:11.920> goes<00:03:12.280> but

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
that's as simple as that goes but

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.690
