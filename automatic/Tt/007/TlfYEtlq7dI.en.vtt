assuming this will be the adapter power

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.490 
assuming this will be the adapter power
that<00:03:16.540> there<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.690> is<00:03:17.780> we'll<00:03:18.080> also<00:03:18.170> get<00:03:18.440> into

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
that there it is we'll also get into

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.620 
that there it is we'll also get into
that

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.880 

really<00:03:23.630> nice<00:03:23.840> design<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.350> thought<00:03:24.740> it<00:03:24.800> was

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
really nice design I thought it was

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.220 
really nice design I thought it was
gonna<00:03:25.010> be<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.220> little<00:03:25.430> bit<00:03:25.670> bigger<00:03:25.910> but<00:03:26.870> oh<00:03:26.930> well

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
gonna be a little bit bigger but oh well

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.080 
gonna be a little bit bigger but oh well
I<00:03:28.720> hum<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.990> back<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.650> found<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:31.490> really

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
I hum on the back I found this really

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.410 
I hum on the back I found this really
cool<00:03:32.740> you<00:03:33.740> can<00:03:33.920> see<00:03:34.100> right<00:03:34.250> there<00:03:34.420> daylight

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
cool you can see right there daylight

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.540 
cool you can see right there daylight
savings<00:03:35.900> time<00:03:35.990> all<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:36.560> have<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.770> do<00:03:36.950> switch

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
savings time all you have to do switch

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.900 
savings time all you have to do switch
it

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
it

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.230 
it
I<00:03:37.940> think<00:03:38.750> that's<00:03:38.930> easy<00:03:39.680> I've<00:03:40.310> have<00:03:40.670> I've<00:03:40.910> had

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
I think that's easy I've have I've had

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.670 
I think that's easy I've have I've had
other<00:03:41.480> radios<00:03:41.960> where<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.290> have<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.560> actually

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
manually program it and that takes too

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.630 
manually program it and that takes too
long<00:03:46.130> in<00:03:46.580> is<00:03:46.760> kind<00:03:47.000> of<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.180> pain<00:03:48.070> let's<00:03:49.070> get<00:03:49.220> into

here's<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.730> connector<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.449> radio<00:04:23.400> it's<00:04:24.400> a

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
here's the connector to the radio it's a

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.879 
here's the connector to the radio it's a
little<00:04:24.730> flimsy<00:04:25.000> but<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:25.960> think<00:04:26.470> most<00:04:26.650> of<00:04:26.800> these

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
little flimsy but I think most of these

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:34.439 
little flimsy but I think most of these
are<00:04:27.160> so<00:04:27.780> not<00:04:28.780> too<00:04:29.080> worried<00:04:30.010> about<00:04:30.070> this<00:04:33.449> here's

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
are so not too worried about this here's

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.060 
are so not too worried about this here's
the<00:04:35.729> adapter<00:04:36.729> for<00:04:37.540> to<00:04:38.229> it<00:04:38.350> for<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.770> actually

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
the adapter for to it for it to actually

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.530 
the adapter for to it for it to actually
work<00:04:39.690> here<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.840> is<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.889> little<00:04:42.040> bolts<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.210> the

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
work here it is the little bolts and the

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.900 
work here it is the little bolts and the
other<00:04:43.660> vault<00:04:44.190> pretty<00:04:45.190> big<00:04:45.460> not<00:04:46.000> that<00:04:46.180> heavy

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
other vault pretty big not that heavy

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.610 
other vault pretty big not that heavy
has<00:04:48.910> I<00:04:48.940> think<00:04:49.180> it<00:04:49.419> has<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.540> decent-sized<00:04:50.199> cord
