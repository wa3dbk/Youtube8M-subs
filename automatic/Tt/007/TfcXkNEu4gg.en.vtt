00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.119
 Outer wall division squared 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.309
 Is insulation work? 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.599
 I got it 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.599
 I understood 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.199
 Glass wool of the outer wall 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.599
 this time 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.710
 Because of the lack of pluslu 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.710
 The maker has changed 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.380
 Basically the thermal resistance value 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.950
 21.4 or more 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 waiting 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.090
 This is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.610
 Yeah redefined 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.610
 About 5 mm of glass wool 14 kg 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.280
 If the resistance value is that of eight houses 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.920
 This is 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.920
 90mm of high-performance glare number 16 kg 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.060
 St Kochi 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.600
 2. Japan 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 I use a big game 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.410
 This time 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.950
 Esashi 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.140
 Depends on and is in the glass more 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.700
 Because we use tradeoffs in 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.160
 Eh or Ming 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.220
 Miss resistance value 1.4 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.220
 It is supposed to use the above 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.240
 in this way 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 Ant also of outlet box 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.760
 On the big billboard 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.200
 I'll handle the secret from moisture proof 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.750
 Let's stack rice 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.750
 Firmly street 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.810
 Go to the floor and Yuuka 21 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.530
 Zico 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.469
 Ear 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.829
 I will extend 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.399
 From shivering 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.589
 Oh and strong participation 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.839
 9th 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.409
 This innocent 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.329
 Good riot 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.629
 A politician 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.069
 Do you suppress 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.319
 It will be said
