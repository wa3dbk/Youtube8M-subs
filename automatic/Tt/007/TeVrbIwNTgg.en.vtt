 hi all photoshop lovers 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.520
 sorry for so much delay 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.860
 lessons there was no free time in this 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.600
 lesson we will do harm effectively 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.640
 family photos open photo 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.580
 Create a new layer. Press it. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.399
 contraction wait ok 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.460
 Now select the rectangular tool 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.149
 region 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:44.850
 select half of the photos choose 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.600
 color red and press alt backspace to 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:53.300
 fill selected area 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:58.550
 Now we select another part 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.710
 green and also press alt backspace 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:07.560
 now it means hiding this layer 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.490
 choose the first means we will need 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.930
 pick colors for this go to 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.460
 image 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.160
 correction pick color means source 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 we have a photo 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:34.490
 the layer will be red-green that is layer 1 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:36.990
 and now the luminosity we turn on touch 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.970
 these two sliders are just using 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.880
 weaken here but it is understandably weakened 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:48.630
 the effect can be somewhere like this and leave 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:52.800
 water slider time more then we 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:57.390
 get such an old photo effect 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.300
 old photos i.e. 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.250
 Probably I do not know there 70s 80s 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.810
 somewhere so it is possible to make such 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.500
 do not be honest so do not really like 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.000
 so i want no shades 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.000
 not very bright 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.390
 So 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:27.620
 about somewhere here is such a photo 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.620
 I think she looks much prettier 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:38.230
 Actually leave it ok click 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.950
 you can also wash the edges there 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:47.760
 burned you showed how to do it in 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:52.000
 previous lessons mean here or 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.450
 apply some texture or brushes 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.540
 but this is all for your taste basis I tell you 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.510
 showed if you liked put 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.170
