00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
this so both players know what is

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.570 
this so both players know what is
happening<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.380> their<00:02:50.560> opponents<00:02:50.980> base<00:02:51.160> but

happening in their opponents base but

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.730 
happening in their opponents base but
both<00:02:52.030> players<00:02:52.270> still<00:02:52.510> only<00:02:52.750> have<00:02:52.990> one<00:02:53.320> gateway

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
both players still only have one gateway

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.710 
both players still only have one gateway
each<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.730> is<00:02:54.880> quite<00:02:55.090> interesting<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.540> me

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
each and that is quite interesting to me

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.140 
each and that is quite interesting to me
we<00:02:56.170> see<00:02:56.380> probes<00:02:56.980> from<00:02:57.220> both<00:02:57.430> players<00:02:57.670> meeting

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
we see probes from both players meeting

away<00:03:02.170> actually<00:03:02.410> i<00:03:02.590> was<00:03:02.650> actually<00:03:02.770> trying<00:03:03.550> to

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
away actually i was actually trying to

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.520 
away actually i was actually trying to
maneuver<00:03:04.000> away<00:03:04.330> actually<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.780> AI<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:05.170> doing

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530

this<00:03:06.910> probe<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:07.330> now<00:03:07.510> q<00:03:08.380> bukkake<00:03:08.680> decides<00:03:08.980> you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
this probe so now q bukkake decides you

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.200 
this probe so now q bukkake decides you
know<00:03:09.250> what<00:03:09.460> I<00:03:09.490> don't<00:03:09.640> want<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.850> kill<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.000> probe

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
know what I don't want to kill a probe

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.480 
know what I don't want to kill a probe
for<00:03:10.390> free<00:03:10.570> get<00:03:10.840> out<00:03:10.960> of<00:03:11.080> here<00:03:11.170> x<00:03:11.350> labs<00:03:11.620> probe<00:03:11.920> so

for free get out of here x labs probe so

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.130 
for free get out of here x labs probe so
neither<00:03:12.880> player<00:03:13.090> has<00:03:13.240> dropped<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.600> proxy<00:03:13.990> pylon

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.510 
neither player has dropped a proxy pylon
anywhere<00:03:14.680> just<00:03:14.830> yet<00:03:14.950> which<00:03:15.220> i<00:03:15.310> think<00:03:15.370> is

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
anywhere just yet which i think is

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.980 
anywhere just yet which i think is
interesting<00:03:15.760> because<00:03:16.030> QE<00:03:16.420> khaki<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.720> adding

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
interesting because QE khaki is adding

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.480 
interesting because QE khaki is adding
on<00:03:17.110> 3<00:03:17.320> gateways<00:03:17.680> right<00:03:17.950> now<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.310> it'd<00:03:18.400> be

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
on 3 gateways right now and it'd be

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.920 
on 3 gateways right now and it'd be
really<00:03:18.670> cool<00:03:18.910> if<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.120> had<00:03:19.210> a<00:03:19.240> pylon<00:03:19.450> nearby

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
really cool if you had a pylon nearby

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.800 
really cool if you had a pylon nearby
