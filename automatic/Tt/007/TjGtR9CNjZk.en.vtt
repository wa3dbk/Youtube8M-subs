just<00:01:58.229> go<00:01:58.380> because<00:01:58.679> I<00:01:58.799> mean<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.039> peloton<00:01:59.369> was

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
coming from behind then he had three

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.169 
coming from behind then he had three
minutes<00:02:00.810> left<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.710> front<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.119> I

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
minutes left in front and then just so I

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.529 
minutes left in front and then just so I
had<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.600> risk<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.470> win<00:02:04.679> and<00:02:05.360> that's<00:02:06.360> how

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
had to risk it in a win and that's how

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.979 
had to risk it in a win and that's how
old<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.929> cool<00:02:07.799> guess
