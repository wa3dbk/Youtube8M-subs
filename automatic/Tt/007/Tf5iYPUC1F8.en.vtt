 interactive story of the characters here in order 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.210
 rice manager hyperion was with superiors 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.909
 on a short leg and was already inventing myself 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.729
 correct facial expression to react to 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.920
 news of the rise but the scene is in the spirit 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.170
 comedies intolerable bosses 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.840

 sent to pandora crank at 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.400
 all behind some kind of deal 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.250
 the second heroine Fiona charming 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.040
 resourceful and much better prepared for 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.140
 troubles than rice so happened that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.689
 conceived by rice scam 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.060
 and she was not the last participant 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.729
 and problems put them on one side 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.149
 barricades wallpaper heroes have additional 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.009
 game mechanics rice can scan 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.820
 surrounding objects getting them accurate 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.890
 description 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.710
 most often unnecessary but 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.380
 funny also in action scenes he 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:17.040
 controls the robot choosing weapons and 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:19.260
 pointing targets for attack and fiona keeps 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.000
 banks some money 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.490
 fate which turns out to be 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.850
 player's disposal when and what her 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.280
 you decide to spend even fiona in

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.110
 gun but when to spend this 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.340
 single bullet and whether to spend at all 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.170
 also you decide for 3 heroes we do not play 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.209
 but it is worth highlighting 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.090
 because the story we are seeing in 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.060
 mostly from his position some gangster 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.660
 keeps ion or with bound in itself 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.570
 to the lair 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.239
 and interrogates the whole plot of the first episode 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.239
 that's what they tell him sometimes 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.480
 together sometimes taking turns most 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.459
 the scenes you see from two perspectives 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.280
 which differ in details and quarrel 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.110
 heroes sometimes peony toffee will have 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.530
 answer the question so what was 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.750
 Further you choose the answer and it 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.420
 it seems like heroes 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.120
 really compose on the go trying 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.579
 don't get it gives birth strange but 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.299
 really unique experience you 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.360
 feel like a lying storyteller and 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.280
 incredulous listeners at the same time 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.590
 tales from the borderlands shows 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.320
 pandoru exactly the kind you want 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.110
 see off races with friends and guns 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.640
 with black humor intense dialogue and 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.459
 dangerous adventures 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.010
 the first episode of the series is perfect 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.470
 the beginning of a potentially perfect story in 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.200
 borderless universe without shooting and 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.310
 cooperative but funny and dynamic 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.220
 reckless 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.380
 and true to the original source is great 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.989
 the return of the story from the body tale to 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.060
 easy and not serious tone for which 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.500
 we are already a bit bored 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.500
 developers released serious drum &amp; 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.500
 bass
