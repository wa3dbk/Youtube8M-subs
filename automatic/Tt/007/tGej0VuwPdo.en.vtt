00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.920
 for the girls and guys how are they 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.690
 well today I come with another recipe from the 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.730
 simple for beginners and others 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.139
 that do not want to spend a lot of time or 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.400
 a lot of difficulty 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.370
 good today I'm going to make some noodles 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.260
 with chicken and well I bought these 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.449
 noodles that are from the landowner brand 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.490
 that least recommended my girl glory 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.930
 a little kiss glory 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.240
 and good I have chosen this that this 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.789
 oriental chicken as they see nothing but 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.000
 a ration is for a single person and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.030
 chosen this prawn good I invented it 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.070
 what we need are the noodles 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.870
 whole chicken breasts filleted but 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.059
 rather filleted to be pieces 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.260
 fine and if not the steak in you 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.930
 also red pepper and two onions 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.250
 red plants as they want and nothing these 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.899
 are the ingredients so we're going to 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.940
 get down to work with frying 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.239
 to start in the pan let's put 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.239
 oil 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.770
 and we're going to add the onion that 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.990
 previously he has cut it in julienne and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.990
 well we add what is the onion 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.790
 it is very tasty and onion 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.790
 and now I'm going to add the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.670
 pepper that we cut in julienne also 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.060
 and I cut it into smaller pieces 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:41.540
 so well 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.930
 add the pepper and we will add 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.930
 Salt 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.430
 we mix everything 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.450
 to 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.600
 to 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:03.340
 and we're going to leave it until this kid 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.340
 to 22 500 as the onion half height 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.810
 and what I'm going to do now is add the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.750
 chicken 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.230
 that I previously cut into strips 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.760
 thin boyacÃ¡ filleted for 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.760
 take advantage of the output by inks 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.340
 we come back with 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.360
 here let it end now do 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.740
 what can not be cured with chicken 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.740
 and you see them the neighborhood 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.770
 we reserve when I am already to come 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.410
 for a case a cauldron what this already 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.410
 with water carries 300 milliliters 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.810
 and I'm going to add a spoonful of oil 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.630
 the soup spoon 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.269
 that out there we add the content of the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.269
 about what comes here 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.890
 together with the oil we put the fire to 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.890
 to warm 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.599
 Over there 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.840
 we stir it 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.670
 we return to mix everything 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.010
 once the water is hot 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.100
 we will add the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.660
 noodles 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.660
 and you have to bring it to a boil 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.630
 the light is cooked in three more minutes or 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.310
 less 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.780
 Anyway, everything is fine 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.780
 we explain from behind the package 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.080
 once it is hot we will add the 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.080
 noodles 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.639
 so they come as acs of a block and then 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.650
 do 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.350
 they separate and others 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.980
 and we throw what is inside 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.380
 and we like to be next to me 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.260
 water once you get the heat 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.600
 of the fire then it will go away doing and 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.040
 others so I 'm not going to let it go 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.500
 finish once done as well what 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.590
 book and passarella to bleach and 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.630
 you choose the flavor so much 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.820
 the chicken as the prawn the truth 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.160
 that a good exquisite knows enough 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.350
 I support what of the noodle and I do not expect 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.870
 what you liked is a recipe 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.060
 quite simple to do even though it's 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.520
 its elaboration and nothing we see in the 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.520
 next video a little kiss state
