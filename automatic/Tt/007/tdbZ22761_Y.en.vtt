short board connects via via ethernet

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.609 
short board connects via via ethernet
cable<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.630> used<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> use<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> internet

pedal<00:02:23.959> over<00:02:24.110> here<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:25.250> just<00:02:25.430> use<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.790> as<00:02:25.940> a

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
pedal over here you just use this as a

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.570 
pedal over here you just use this as a
volume<00:02:26.420> or<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.930> push<00:02:27.560> down<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.980> switch<00:02:28.400> to

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
volume or you push down and switch to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.080 
volume or you push down and switch to
wall

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
wall

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.690 
wall
so<00:02:29.510> basically<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.230> amp<00:02:30.410> has<00:02:30.680> off<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.310> wall

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
so basically the amp has off a wall

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.540 
so basically the amp has off a wall
built<00:02:31.970> into<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:35.080> going<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.200> here<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:37.370> amp

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
built into it so going to here the amp

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.680 
built into it so going to here the amp
settings<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.840> go<00:02:40.090> it's<00:02:41.090> not<00:02:41.209> going<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.420> clear

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
settings you go it's not going to clear

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.210 
settings you go it's not going to clear
it<00:02:41.720> also<00:02:42.280> but<00:02:43.280> uh<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:44.180> do<00:02:44.420> six<00:02:45.040> different<00:02:46.040> amp

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
it also but uh you do six different amp

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.490 
it also but uh you do six different amp
channels<00:02:47.769> including<00:02:49.209> two<00:02:50.209> per<00:02:50.600> channel<00:02:50.989> so

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
channels including two per channel so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.110 
channels including two per channel so
you<00:02:52.010> can<00:02:52.040> go<00:02:52.959> blue<00:02:53.959> or<00:02:54.410> amber<00:02:55.010> free<00:02:55.459> for<00:02:56.000> each

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
you can go blue or amber free for each

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.860 
you can go blue or amber free for each
one

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.630 

so<00:02:59.739> you're<00:03:00.010> clean<00:03:00.430> twang<00:03:01.030> blues<00:03:02.069> crunch<00:03:03.069> metal

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
so you're clean twang blues crunch metal

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.030 
so you're clean twang blues crunch metal
or<00:03:03.879> insane<00:03:04.480> mode<00:03:04.870> which<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.620> same<00:03:05.830> thing

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
or insane mode which is the same thing

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.900 
or insane mode which is the same thing
as<00:03:06.129> metal<00:03:06.459> but<00:03:06.580> just<00:03:06.760> more<00:03:07.420> oomph<00:03:07.660> oh<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.500> guess

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
as metal but just more oomph oh I guess

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.839 
as metal but just more oomph oh I guess
that's<00:03:09.910> what<00:03:10.090> line<00:03:10.390> six<00:03:10.690> does<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.769> from<00:03:12.670> here

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
that's what line six does but from here

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.729 
that's what line six does but from here
you<00:03:12.910> can<00:03:13.180> do<00:03:13.269> four<00:03:13.540> channels<00:03:13.989> here<00:03:14.260> memory

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
you can do four channels here memory

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.130 
you can do four channels here memory
sets<00:03:15.010> but<00:03:15.670> then<00:03:15.790> there's<00:03:16.030> also<00:03:16.120> nine<00:03:16.450> banks

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
sets but then there's also nine banks

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.280 
sets but then there's also nine banks
so<00:03:17.860> basically<00:03:18.610> 36<00:03:19.390> channels<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.260> can

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
so basically 36 channels that you can

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.320 
so basically 36 channels that you can
make<00:03:20.709> you're<00:03:20.890> on<00:03:21.040> your<00:03:21.250> own<00:03:21.400> and<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:22.090> can<00:03:22.120> also

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
make you're on your own and you can also

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.400 
make you're on your own and you can also
name<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:23.590> can<00:03:24.090> scroll<00:03:25.090> through<00:03:25.170> this<00:03:26.170> with

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
name it you can scroll through this with

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.740 
name it you can scroll through this with
this<00:03:26.560> dial<00:03:26.860> here<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:28.000> can<00:03:28.150> go<00:03:28.360> up<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.660> down

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
this dial here you can go up and down

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.780 
this dial here you can go up and down
for<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.110> banks<00:03:29.440> or<00:03:29.560> left<00:03:29.830> or<00:03:29.950> right<00:03:30.129> into<00:03:30.670> the

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
for the banks or left or right into the

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.069 
for the banks or left or right into the
presets<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.480> it'd<00:03:32.230> be<00:03:32.430> up<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.700> down<00:03:33.880> for<00:03:34.420> one

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
presets so it'd be up and down for one

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.259 
presets so it'd be up and down for one
two<00:03:35.319> nine<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.430> left<00:03:36.670> your<00:03:36.849> right<00:03:37.060> would<00:03:37.239> be

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
two nine and I left your right would be

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.100 
two nine and I left your right would be
a<00:03:37.660> through<00:03:37.930> D<00:03:38.760> okay<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.030> then<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.690> also<00:03:40.840> have

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
a through D okay so then you also have

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.410 
a through D okay so then you also have
your<00:03:41.140> normal<00:03:41.530> controls<00:03:42.069> of<00:03:42.250> Drive<00:03:42.459> bass<00:03:42.880> mid

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
your normal controls of Drive bass mid

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.890 
your normal controls of Drive bass mid

you don't like the speakers in here you
can<00:05:39.270> go<00:05:40.270> into<00:05:40.419> like<00:05:40.599> some<00:05:40.750> Mesa<00:05:41.020> and<00:05:41.470> dual

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
can go into like some Mesa and dual

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.580 
can go into like some Mesa and dual
cabinets<00:05:42.970> or<00:05:43.090> whatnot<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:46.050> this<00:05:47.050> is<00:05:47.200> a<00:05:47.229> great

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
cabinets or whatnot and this is a great

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.480 
cabinets or whatnot and this is a great
amplifier<00:05:48.599> with<00:05:49.599> the<00:05:49.630> PRS<00:05:50.139> it<00:05:50.680> just<00:05:50.889> it's

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
amplifier with the PRS it just it's

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.420 
amplifier with the PRS it just it's
amazing<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:53.080> marshall<00:05:53.530> did<00:05:53.680> not<00:05:53.889> cut<00:05:54.160> it<00:05:54.310> the

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
amazing the marshall did not cut it the

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.830 
amazing the marshall did not cut it the
reason<00:05:54.550> why<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:54.820> went<00:05:55.030> to<00:05:55.120> this<00:05:55.240> the<00:05:55.479> marshall

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
reason why I went to this the marshall

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.680 
reason why I went to this the marshall
just<00:05:56.020> kept<00:05:56.169> cutting<00:05:56.349> off<00:05:56.650> on<00:05:57.610> me

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
just kept cutting off on me

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.420 
just kept cutting off on me
you<00:06:00.170> don't<00:06:00.350> want<00:06:00.500> that<00:06:00.680> happening<00:06:00.740> and<00:06:01.190> shows

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
you don't want that happening and shows

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.680 
you don't want that happening and shows
and<00:06:02.260> I<00:06:03.260> had<00:06:04.220> so<00:06:04.640> many<00:06:04.760> pedals<00:06:05.180> just<00:06:05.270> to<00:06:05.540> get<00:06:05.660> a

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
and I had so many pedals just to get a

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.930 
and I had so many pedals just to get a
decent<00:06:05.900> sound<00:06:06.350> through<00:06:06.830> the<00:06:06.920> marshal<00:06:07.310> so<00:06:07.520> this

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
decent sound through the marshal so this

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.250 
decent sound through the marshal so this
is<00:06:08.090> why<00:06:08.210> I<00:06:08.240> went<00:06:08.420> to<00:06:08.510> the<00:06:08.600> Lane<00:06:08.810> six

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
is why I went to the Lane six

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.280 
is why I went to the Lane six
and<00:06:09.790> this<00:06:10.790> is<00:06:10.910> not<00:06:11.030> a<00:06:11.090> full<00:06:11.390> tube<00:06:11.630> amp<00:06:11.900> it's<00:06:12.170> not

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
and this is not a full tube amp it's not

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.840 
and this is not a full tube amp it's not
a<00:06:12.320> full<00:06:12.560> digital<00:06:12.800> amp<00:06:13.190> that's<00:06:13.460> why<00:06:13.580> they<00:06:13.700> call

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
a full digital amp that's why they call

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.830 
a full digital amp that's why they call
it<00:06:13.880> a<00:06:14.030> hybrid<00:06:14.270> half<00:06:14.680> so<00:06:16.180> this<00:06:17.180> is<00:06:17.300> the<00:06:17.420> line<00:06:17.570> six

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
it a hybrid half so this is the line six

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.700 
it a hybrid half so this is the line six
