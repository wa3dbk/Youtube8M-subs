00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 with this it's quick tutorial I propose you 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:11.160
 an easy make-up ideal for the wearer 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:13.530
 glasses with an angled brush 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.150
 and brown eyeshadow we outline and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.190
 we fill our eyebrows well 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.800
 in this way they will stand out behind 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
 more defined glasses are more 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.580
 they will strengthen the look 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.260
 we take an opaque white eye shadow and it 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.349
 we extend over the whole eyelid like 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.570
 base we will not use pearl eyeshadows e 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.949
 satin finish because behind the lenses not 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.290
 they are good 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.390
 we will therefore use matt and above all 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.930
 we will choose light colors on the tone of the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.600
 pink and beige with a flat brush 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.489
 eyeshadow take a peach color it 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.190
 let's spread on the eyelid 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.730
 starting from the outside and blending it towards 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.500
 the inside of the eye with a brush 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.690
 angled we use a brown eye shadow 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.520
 to outline the area at the hairline 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.520
 upper and lower lashes 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.729
 then we apply a bare pencil 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.729
 inside the eye to enlarge it 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.100
 we abound with the best mascara 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.850
 incurvante rather than lengthening so 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.170
 that they flinch on her glasses 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.400
 we hold finger on the eyelid while 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.200
 we apply mascara 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.940
 so if we miss the pipe cleaner of the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.110
 mascara will touch the finger and not 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.310
 we risk dirtying up make-up 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.869
 we finish with a high lipstick 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.350
 held on the lips of one color 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.030
 orange now you are ready to wear 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.070
 your glasses without hiding it 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.900
