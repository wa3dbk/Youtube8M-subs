dinosaur we're actually going to meet
with<00:00:36.030> scientists<00:00:36.540> who<00:00:36.660> discovered<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.260> dr.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
with scientists who discovered it dr.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.910 
with scientists who discovered it dr.
Lindsay's<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.690> it's<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:39.930> just<00:00:40.110> any<00:00:40.350> dinosaur

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
Lindsay's and it's not just any dinosaur

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.639 
Lindsay's and it's not just any dinosaur
it's<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.430> mega<00:00:41.820> predator<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.200> giant

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it's a mega predator so it's a giant

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.040 
it's a mega predator so it's a giant
carnivorous<00:00:44.250> dinosaur<00:00:44.969> about<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> same<00:00:45.840> size

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
as a t-rex it's probably the second or

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
as a t-rex it's probably the second or
third<00:00:48.750> biggest<00:00:49.520> meat-eating<00:00:50.520> dinosaur

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
named that ended and soros they've all

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
named that ended and soros they've all
been<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.750> unique<00:01:22.560> names<00:01:22.830> okay<00:01:23.340> let's<00:01:23.549> step

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
been just unique names okay let's step

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520 
been just unique names okay let's step
back<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.240> second<00:01:24.600> we've<00:01:25.110> probably

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
back for just a second we've probably

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.499 
back for just a second we've probably
all<00:01:25.979> imagined<00:01:26.520> ourselves<00:01:26.610> looking<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.330> at<00:01:27.479> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
all imagined ourselves looking up at a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.140 
all imagined ourselves looking up at a
giant<00:01:27.750> t-rex<00:01:28.290> right<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> mean<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.729> really

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
giant t-rex right so I mean it's really

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.390 
giant t-rex right so I mean it's really
big<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.570> giant<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.650> fact<00:01:31.890> big<00:01:32.100> enough<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
big it's giant in fact big enough to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.359 
big it's giant in fact big enough to
squish<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.119> stump<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.159> see

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
squish you in one stump and this is see

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.940 
squish you in one stump and this is see
us<00:01:38.490> which<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.720> as<00:01:39.869> big<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.560> unlike

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
us which is just about as big but unlike

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
us which is just about as big but unlike
the<00:01:41.100> giant<00:01:41.460> t-rex<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:42.060> lived<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.509> completely

are<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.350> dinosaurs<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.890> grew<00:01:50.130> up<00:01:50.189> with

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
are all the dinosaurs you grew up with

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.609 
are all the dinosaurs you grew up with
as<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> kid<00:01:50.880> Stegosaurus<00:01:51.619> Allosaurus

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
as a kid Stegosaurus Allosaurus

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.160 
as a kid Stegosaurus Allosaurus
Camarasaurus<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> ton

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
Camarasaurus and then we know a ton

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.600 
Camarasaurus and then we know a ton
about<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.530> dinosaurs<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.130> lived<00:01:56.189> at<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
about the dinosaurs that lived at the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.250 
about the dinosaurs that lived at the
very<00:01:56.850> end

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
very end

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.170 
very end
the<00:01:57.650> reign<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:57.890> dinosaurs<00:01:58.460> like<00:01:58.760> Triceratops

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
the reign of dinosaurs like Triceratops

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.770 
the reign of dinosaurs like Triceratops
and<00:02:00.130> Tyrannosaurus<00:02:01.130> but<00:02:01.790> there<00:02:01.970> are<00:02:02.180> tens<00:02:02.570> of

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
and Tyrannosaurus but there are tens of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.140 
and Tyrannosaurus but there are tens of
millions<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.320> years<00:02:03.560> in<00:02:03.980> between<00:02:04.370> those

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
millions of years in between those

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.970 
millions of years in between those
different<00:02:05.540> dinosaur<00:02:05.930> faunas<00:02:06.260> and<00:02:06.470> we<00:02:06.590> have

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
different dinosaur faunas and we have

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.040 
different dinosaur faunas and we have
basically<00:02:07.160> no<00:02:07.610> idea<00:02:07.970> what<00:02:08.240> lived<00:02:08.450> here<00:02:08.750> in

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
basically no idea what lived here in

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.920 
basically no idea what lived here in
between<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.670> what<00:02:10.880> we<00:02:11.030> did<00:02:11.240> is<00:02:11.390> we<00:02:11.420> launched<00:02:11.780> an

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
between so what we did is we launched an

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.660 
between so what we did is we launched an
expedition<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.560> go<00:02:12.710> out<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:13.040> rocks<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.490> those

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
expedition to go out to rocks of those

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.580 
expedition to go out to rocks of those
ages<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.330> look<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:14.750> see<00:02:14.870> what<00:02:15.170> kinds<00:02:15.530> of

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
ages and look and see what kinds of

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.220 
ages and look and see what kinds of
dinosaurs<00:02:16.070> were<00:02:16.370> here<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:17.030> what<00:02:17.660> we<00:02:17.810> found<00:02:17.990> is

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
dinosaurs were here and what we found is

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.980 
dinosaurs were here and what we found is
that<00:02:18.260> it's<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:19.040> whole<00:02:19.250> nother<00:02:19.840> ecosystem<00:02:20.840> of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
that it's a whole nother ecosystem of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.440 
that it's a whole nother ecosystem of
dinosaurs<00:02:21.440> that's<00:02:21.950> composed<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.820> unique

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
groups of dinosaurs that we didn't even

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.890

Carcharodontosaurus went extinct in
North<00:02:52.100> America<00:02:52.790> that's<00:02:53.270> when<00:02:53.720> Tyrannosaurus

were able to phil was basically a void

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.830 
were able to phil was basically a void
in<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.740> ecosystem<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.610> evolved<00:02:59.360> into<00:02:59.510> the

in the ecosystem and evolved into the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.140 
in the ecosystem and evolved into the
