00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:29.090
 it's better now the equipment is there 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.220
 give the ones for the congratulations to see 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.150
 of important congratulations to 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.420
 players because they played a very 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.930
 good with the attitude as delivery all 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.750
 working together when you work as a 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.070
 team you are closer to winning and that's what 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.870
 happened here today and there's also that 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.510
 congratulate him public the hobby because he is 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.940
 impressive the way it has supported 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.170
 the team was with the others and the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.170
 played the sense there is inside 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:15.340
 little four workouts is little more 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.260
 that's why there's also work where 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.310
 about the coach who went through here 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.000
 as well 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.460
 and now there are things we can improve 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.380
 everyone has their way of thinking what 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.740
 world football the way how you want 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.130
 play something players do not 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.070
 they understood well that more I want more and 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.770
 I want that we can do more and better of 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.400
 what have you done today because we have 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.790
 quality capacity for this more 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.720
 as I say a short time and you also have to 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.070
 give you give a hug to another for 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.450
 because the work that is back 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.450
 it is also important for this 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.310
 a team that manages to take it apart 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.280
 how do you want that is the important thing during 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.860
 the matches last the whole game because 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.230
 sometimes you have to have order by times 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.170
 you have to return a little bit to 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.790
 to be able to get higher now when the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.920
 team is balanced with equipment is 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.470
 well and defense is safe in defense 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.530
 that gives confidence to the players and 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.530
 we can go out better and more conscious 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.150
 record player you have to work well there are 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.940
 try to be good in all 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.980
 moments of the game and I think the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.930
 players have gotten many times 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.660
 during the match, be well as 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.870
 team that was the one who won was the team 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.910
 everything for what he has done and as I say 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.180
 also very important fiction in 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.180
 this game 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.790
 if we knew it was going to be a 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.340
 difficult match because a team that 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.740
 plays well with good players as is 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.810
 how is Málaga and a team that is there 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.460
 up is not right we did not know that 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.190
 we had a lot of difficulty 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.310
 obvious that winning this match yes that 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.600
 the trust more this one already already what 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.900
 we conquered three points there 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.850
 start it next the next and contrary 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.450
 associated there are more three points for 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.910
 conquer work match game win 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.360
 which is to get as soon as possible 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.360
 more up 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.930
 if he has also played there are many times 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.730
 like 8 as andreu player who has 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.730
 quality and can also play there 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:16.100
 you have to have an option and did it thinking 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:19.280
 with today's game strategy 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.280
 and they stayed next matches all 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.590
 It can be different as another player 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.450
 plane I brought you a strategy for this 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.450
 party and what andrew fulfilled them very well 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.560
 to win it or space where Málaga 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.680
 it's strong that it's the middle players very 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.770
 rapid 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.700
 isco joaquín portillo players who 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.980
 they know very well 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.620
 if we win the medium and only pass many 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.210
 sometimes we got it auditory we had 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.210
 several situations that we were fine 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.420
 the game was not an easy match 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.880
 because the party that the requirement was 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.430
 very large by the player and is normal 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.820
 because there are many already there was much 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.010
 anxiety because a party at home have 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.750
 than to win it after what happened 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.360
 It is normal for trainer 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:33.170
 players are a little nervous with 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.360
 sequenced and in the end this is paid and 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:38.060
 so there came a height that there is 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.770
 be to the party and you're already winning and that 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.770
 it was important that he did it in the end 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.320
 not all players have to be 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.150
 ready for any time if 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.580
 past one thing be prepared for 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.320
 enter match where there were some 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.920
 players who were with some 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.960
 problems abel case that will be cold 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.910
 álex also brigantines also referred 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.890
 boe a little problem and you have to 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.470
 caution you have to be prepared for the 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:22.240
 eventuality of not being able to return the 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.240
 second part be prepared 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.940
 yes because you have to respect also that 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.790
 is back, life is our life 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.770
 of this coach profession what 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.620
 we know that when the results do not 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.600
 appear that not that the parents of 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.280

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.410

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.610
 I got here I do it now because what 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.980
 work did not start now since it started from 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.320
 preseason and you have to give continuity and 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.440
 improve was used is necessary to improve and 

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.990
 what I 'm going to try to do 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.390
 because it's from this that we 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.960
 we want to develop in front 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.960
 Thank you
