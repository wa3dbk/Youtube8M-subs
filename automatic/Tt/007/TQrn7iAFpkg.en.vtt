one<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.590> thermal<00:00:23.010> not<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:24.240> red<00:00:24.449> dot

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
one it's the thermal not the red dot

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.089 
one it's the thermal not the red dot
sight<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.320> looks<00:00:25.380> pretty<00:00:25.619> cool<00:00:25.769> when<00:00:26.010> you

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
sight it looks pretty cool when you

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.599 
sight it looks pretty cool when you
incorporate<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.670> into<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.939> trick<00:00:27.210> shot<00:00:27.449> um<00:00:28.609> I'll

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
incorporate it into a trick shot um I'll

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.640 
incorporate it into a trick shot um I'll
give<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.910> some<00:00:30.060> examples<00:00:30.150> later<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.140> using

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
give you some examples later on using

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.740 
give you some examples later on using
ladders<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.160> stuff<00:00:32.250> because<00:00:32.540> this<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
ladders and stuff because this is a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.490 
ladders and stuff because this is a
really<00:00:34.110> hard<00:00:34.320> shot<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:35.120> while<00:00:36.120> maintaining

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.770 

height<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.770> air<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.790> being<00:00:42.420> able<00:00:42.570> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
height in the air and like being able to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.709 
height in the air and like being able to
do<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.079> entire<00:00:43.350> trick<00:00:43.620> shot<00:00:44.300> because<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
do your entire trick shot because it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.860 
do your entire trick shot because it
takes<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.170> while<00:00:46.440> for<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.750> do<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
takes a little while for it to do the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.540 
takes a little while for it to do the
full<00:00:49.079> animation<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.800> swap<00:00:50.039> because

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
full animation and swap because

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.779 
full animation and swap because
sometimes<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> too<00:00:51.750> early<00:00:52.789> it'll

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
sometimes if you do it too early it'll

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.369 
sometimes if you do it too early it'll
knife<00:00:54.000> instead<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.600> doing<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.230> little

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
knife instead of doing a little

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.250 
knife instead of doing a little
animation<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.510> yeah<00:00:57.660> oh<00:00:58.190> that's<00:00:59.190> about<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.430> um

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
animation so yeah oh that's about it um
