00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.399
 each of these phones says have 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.779
 the most advanced camera in the market at 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:10.270
 less according to their respective manufacturers 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.710
 but as much as they tell us there is only 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.140
 a way to declare a winner 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.119
 Definitive as they are I am vanessa hand 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.329
 orellana of cinema in Spanish and today I'll put 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.720
 to test the g3 camera of him and the 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.730
 one m 8 of this and the galaxy s 5 of 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.380
 samsung before showing you the photos 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.810
 let's compare the specifications 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.029
 which each presumes the camera of the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.150
 galaxy s 5 has the most amount of 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.880
 16 megapixel pixels then the next one 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.980
 g3 with 13 megapixel camera and also 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.710
 has a faster laser focus than 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.720
 others and the one m 8 has 4 ultra 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.880
 pixels in the main camera but 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.730
 has two cameras to capture more 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.560
 detail and now let's see how useful 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.780
 are these decorations when it comes to taking a 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.910
 photo I took the same photo in the three 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.890
 phones but they are showing them 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.630
 directly in the video since the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.720
 quality of the phones screen 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.370
 It influences how the image looks like this photo 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.230
 of the golden gate bridge was taken with the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.250
 automatic option with resolution at 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.110
 maximum 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.360
 3 look good but my favorite was the 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.160
 of s 5 that I think I achieve better 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.440
 balance between the background sky and the 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.390
 bushes in front but when I get them 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.430
 I took inside to a place with little light the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.080
 story was another as you can see the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.320
 image of the cathedral came out on 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.150
 exposed with g3 and still with s5 and the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.070
 of l &amp; m 8 looks balanced and sharp 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.260
 also that the one in m 8 has almost 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.360
 wide-angle effect all shots 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.850
 of the same distance but the g3 was the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.260
 what else did you like and I did not like it later 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.690
 I tried them with the movie girls in 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.790
 Spanish with background office light and 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.530
 no doubt the winner was the m 8 with good 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.509
 contrast and skin colors more 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.790
 natural but already for the shots of 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.920
 near m 8 was the one that more problems me 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.410
 I could not focus on the petal 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.600
 closest to the lens the 5 s in focus without 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.789
 problem and the g3 takes a little longer but 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.649
 also he managed my favorite is the photo 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.229
 of g3 by the level of detail in the 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.789
 texture and depth of the shot but 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.520
 a photo that I only managed to take with 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.140
 galaxy s 5 camera was this photo 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.570
 under water because it is the only 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.580
 submersible of the three and finally 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.709
 I wanted to find out which one captured the best 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.910
 movement and as expected with 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.250
 that approach the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.220
 the g3 capture or the image with 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.500
 movement and with sharp details the m 8 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.450
 he did quite well and the 5 s was the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.730
 worse you will notice that the shoes look 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.010
 blurred now let's go with the camera 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.040
 frontal the deme 8 wins as for the 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.620
 number of pixels has 5 megapixels 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.110
 then it is followed by g3 with 2.1 and by 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.890
 last the 5 s with 2 megapixels in the 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.900
 front camera 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.090
 let's see how this affects the quality of 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.030
 the fis and effectively my favorite 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.830
 It was the m 8 with more natural colors 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.230
 while that of s 5 came out very opaque 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.970
 my only criticism is that with the m 8 it is 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.280
 more complicated switching between cameras 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.980
 whereas with the g3 it is enough 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.630
 slide your finger to the left to 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.030
 finish compare the recording of 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.640
 video of each and in this category yes 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.280
 there is an obvious loser the m 8 is the only 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.080
 that does not record video in 4k as you see 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.460
 note on the color and sharpness of the 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.930
 buildings the g3 and the s5 look better 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.240
 conclusion each camera has its 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.400
 strengths but the three passed the 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.830
 tests if your priority is the clarity of 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.150
 the image and the speed of focus you 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.010
 I recommend the shaft 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.170
 if instead you're going to take pictures of 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.299
 adventures especially aquatic and 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.390
 you want more vivid colors I recommend you 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.760
 the s5 and for better contrast and better 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.459
 selfish I recommend you try the three 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.590
 m8 cameras can see all these 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.170
 photos and the complete reviews of these 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.280
 telephones in cinema point with diagonal s 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.120
 for cinema in Spanish 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.120
