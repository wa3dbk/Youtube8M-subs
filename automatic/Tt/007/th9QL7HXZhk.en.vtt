00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.549
 girls today I have the solution for 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.500
 those girls who have wanted to elaborate 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.440
 this little flower and they could not do it 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.110
 because they can not get wide tape or 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.900
 because they have not got fabrics to you is 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 very easy very simple I hope you can 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.460
 make the flowers that have always 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 dear materials to elaborate this 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.910
 combined flower we have red ribbon the one 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.460
 we have here you can realize 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.210
 the difference between the tapes of what 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.110
 width the red one has four centimeters 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.050
 wide the white ribbon has 3.8 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.190
 centimeters wide and the flower and the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.100
 Peel tape has 2.5 centimeters of 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.130
 width the length that you are going to cut 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.500
 It depends on each tape I'm going to teach 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.010
 how can they elaborate it as they can 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.620
 do for all the tapes the process 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.620
 it's going to be the same 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
 so 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.280
 Here I will show you quickly the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.690
 tape has to go like this you are going to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.690
 make a diagonal cut 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.240
 and from there they begin to fold the tape 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.590
 so that the long and so power 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.230
 cut all the strips that size 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.920
 tape then they will bend the tape 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.920
 flush 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.510
 from the end of here and they are going to bend 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.410
 again 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.580
 forming what is a triangle to it 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.150
 is double you cut 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.430
 this is going to be with all the wide ribbons 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.200
 or thin depending on the size that 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.350
 you choose to elaborate the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.410
 Petals here will give you what it is 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.210
 the mold and you can cut it one 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.740
 by one as we just did or 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.290
 taking into account the measures that 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.010
 just we have done with this tape 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.160
 here we have cut 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.640
 the triangles of each of the tapes 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.700
 that we are going to work 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.860
 for the silver petal we have here 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.080
 we made the triangle we have already 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.690
 explained in previous video but here what 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.450
 Let's go again to explain the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.450
 ends of the tape 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.530
 cut diagonally for what reason it cuts in 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.750
 diagonal so they do not stay too high 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.770
 the little flowers are shorter 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.590
 they can work better they look better and 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.569
 that you have finished the petals for 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.280
 other combination of the flowers you 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.060
 hold them with a pin if you 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.390
 they want 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.510
 carmen all the little games and that's it 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.569
 easy to work when they are ready 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.209
 you are going to remove the pins for 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.630
 place the triangles one on top of 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.630
 others 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.610
 thus 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.520
 here they are going to fold 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.450
 towards the center and they will be left 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:14.310
 what is the petal 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:17.400
 here they will stay hard for what they are 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.010
 enough ribbons then you cut 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.610
 diagonally so that they have a 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:28.980
 I plan the petals and once they pass 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:32.010
 with your lighter or with your candle pass the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.770
 part of below and on the sides of once 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.450
 seal 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.450
 and stick the tapes 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.590
 to cases that a little bit loose again 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.930
 we passed it so that we fit 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.860
 Pegaditos ready are already totally 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.860
 stuck 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.570
 and armed the petals here we have six 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.600
 petals on this flower let's place one 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:07.480
 additional seven and seven petals 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.940
 silver plated with tape or with forgiveness 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.340
 with silicone or with a needle like you 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.879
 wish 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.879
 hit 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.230
 and the last one they're going to place if they 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.760
 they stick on the silicon on both sides to 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.670
 unite the whole flower 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.670
 then here they stick once and joins 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.560
 the little flower is finished 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.750
 let's place the circle of always 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.639
 I will always tell you so that you 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:49.669
 they have very nice wait expect that 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:53.319
 the little flower dries them and here they come together 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.319
 you and stick 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.860
 the circle of firmness and once 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.990
 the flowers are already well formed 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.509
 we hope those girls that always 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.849
 have wanted to make this little flower and not 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.460
 had been able to do here they already have the 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.469
 solution for that the center the one 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.900
 you want to place you can do 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:26.009
 several layers of the same flower 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.650
 colors combine colors here we go to 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.100
 place one of the porcelain sconces 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.560
 and chrome 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.990
 can place pearls can place 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.390
 button flowers what you want 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:42.220
 We really hope you liked it
