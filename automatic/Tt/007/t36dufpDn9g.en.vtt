you just buy from the supermarket but if
you<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.110> think<00:01:58.290> about<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.829> meat<00:01:58.979> has

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
you really think about it that meat has

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.289 
you really think about it that meat has
come<00:01:59.340> from<00:01:59.460> somewhere<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.969> come<00:02:00.090> from<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
come from somewhere it's come from a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.510 
come from somewhere it's come from a
meat<00:02:00.509> farm<00:02:00.750> where<00:02:01.469> an<00:02:01.890> animal<00:02:02.189> has<00:02:02.310> been

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
meat farm where an animal has been

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.700 
meat farm where an animal has been
raised<00:02:02.790> possibly<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.780> unsuitable<00:02:04.290> conditions

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
raised possibly in unsuitable conditions

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.139 
raised possibly in unsuitable conditions
where<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.250> been<00:02:05.369> suffering<00:02:05.700> its<00:02:05.820> whole<00:02:05.939> life

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
where it's been suffering its whole life

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.609 
where it's been suffering its whole life
and<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:06.750> they'll<00:02:06.869> almost<00:02:07.020> been<00:02:07.229> slaughtered

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
and then they'll almost been slaughtered

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.559 
and then they'll almost been slaughtered
just<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:07.979> they<00:02:08.069> can<00:02:08.129> we<00:02:08.280> cut<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.879> made<00:02:09.420> into

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
just so they can we cut up and made into

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.390 
just so they can we cut up and made into
meat<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> really<00:02:10.979> do<00:02:11.160> think<00:02:11.190> that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
meat for you so I really do think that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.800 
meat for you so I really do think that
if<00:02:11.550> people<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.849> go<00:02:12.000> outside<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.360> kill

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
if people have to go outside and kill

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.130 
if people have to go outside and kill
their<00:02:12.930> own

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
to eat the meat there will be a hell of

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.140 
to eat the meat there will be a hell of
a<00:02:17.040> lot<00:02:17.160> more<00:02:17.190> vegetarians<00:02:17.819> in<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:17.970> world
