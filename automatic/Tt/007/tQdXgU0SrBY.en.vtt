how to overcome that so I don't use any

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.540 
how to overcome that so I don't use any
gloves<00:00:51.710> some<00:00:52.710> people<00:00:53.010> use<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> gloves

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
gloves some people use the gloves

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
gloves some people use the gloves
because<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.329> bully<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.050> bowling<00:00:55.320> ball

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
because the bully the bowling ball

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.920 
because the bully the bowling ball
actually<00:00:55.649> will<00:00:56.190> cause<00:00:56.910> calluses<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.780> your

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
actually will cause calluses to your

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.010 
actually will cause calluses to your
hands<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:59.399> your<00:00:59.579> skin<00:01:00.180> nice<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.570> rough

hands and make your skin nice and rough

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.860 
hands and make your skin nice and rough
so<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.710> wear<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> glove<00:01:02.250> -<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> glove<00:01:03.719> is

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
so they wear the glove - so the glove is

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.899 
so they wear the glove - so the glove is
all<00:01:04.049> rough<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.920> ball<00:01:05.100> instead<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.820> their
