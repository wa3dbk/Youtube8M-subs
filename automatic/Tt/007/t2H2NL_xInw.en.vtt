really<00:01:46.829> i<00:01:47.189> mean<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.939> process<00:01:48.420> around<00:01:48.600> this

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
really i mean the process around this

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.789 
really i mean the process around this
phone<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.409> slow<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.170> hard<00:01:52.320> to

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
phone is slow and it's really hard to

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.069 
phone is slow and it's really hard to
play<00:01:53.040> any<00:01:53.280> actual<00:01:53.759> game<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.540> even<00:01:54.840> Mario

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
play any actual game like even Mario

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.830 
play any actual game like even Mario
here<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:55.710> pretty<00:01:56.189> hard<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.640> play<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.810> best

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
here it's pretty hard to play the best

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.899 
here it's pretty hard to play the best
thing<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.350> play<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:59.189> if<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.579> are<00:01:59.700> actually

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
thing to play like if you are actually

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.609 
thing to play like if you are actually
going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> use<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.729> most<00:02:02.729> likely<00:02:03.060> just

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
going to use this is most likely just

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.130 
going to use this is most likely just
tetris<00:02:04.619> or<00:02:04.829> something<00:02:05.280> out

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
tetris or something out

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.559 
tetris or something out
you<00:02:06.979> can't<00:02:07.250> really<00:02:07.400> play<00:02:07.700> any<00:02:07.729> action<00:02:08.330> games

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
you can't really play any action games

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.670 
you can't really play any action games
at<00:02:08.810> all<00:02:10.330> but<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.420> does<00:02:11.630> work<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:12.260> works<00:02:12.470> all

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
at all but it does work it works all

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.530 
at all but it does work it works all
right<00:02:12.920> I<00:02:12.950> have<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.400> overclocked<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:14.090> little<00:02:14.390> bit

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
right I have it overclocked a little bit

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.900 
right I have it overclocked a little bit
so<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.810> helps<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.200> out<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.410> little<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:16.850> not<00:02:17.060> much

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
so it helps it out a little but not much

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.910 
so it helps it out a little but not much
and<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.420> lot<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.660> times<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.350> sound<00:02:21.650> doesn't

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
and a lot of times the sound doesn't

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:31.330 
and a lot of times the sound doesn't
even<00:02:22.220> work<00:02:26.650> it's<00:02:27.650> cool<00:02:27.950> right<00:02:27.980> here<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
even work it's cool right here the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.430 
even work it's cool right here the
controls<00:02:31.970> are<00:02:32.209> kind<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.540> tough<00:02:32.750> as<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.110> screen

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
controls are kind of tough as the screen

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:43.479 
controls are kind of tough as the screen
is<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:33.800> small<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:40.910> does<00:02:41.120> one<00:02:42.190> that's<00:02:43.190> about

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
is so small and it does one that's about

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.080 
is so small and it does one that's about
all<00:02:43.520> for<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.060> game<00:02:44.269> tough<00:02:44.900> enough<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.260> sustain

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
all for the game tough enough to sustain

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.519
