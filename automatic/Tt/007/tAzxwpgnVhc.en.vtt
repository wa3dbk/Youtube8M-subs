00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
just about anywhere now in the homemade

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.240 
just about anywhere now in the homemade
systems<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.790> I've<00:00:55.910> built<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:56.450> far<00:00:57.250> usually

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
systems that I've built so far usually

the flood table sits directly on top of
the<00:01:01.250> reservoir<00:01:01.899> in<00:01:03.820> this<00:01:04.820> example<00:01:05.239> I'm<00:01:05.659> going

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
the reservoir in this example I'm going

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.980 
the reservoir in this example I'm going
to<00:01:06.320> be<00:01:06.409> using<00:01:06.649> two<00:01:07.159> containers<00:01:07.579> that<00:01:08.479> have<00:01:08.750> the

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
to be using two containers that have the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.830 
to be using two containers that have the
same<00:01:09.290> width<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.280> length<00:01:10.329> so<00:01:11.329> one<00:01:11.630> can

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
same width and length so one can

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.139 
same width and length so one can
actually<00:01:12.079> sit<00:01:12.619> down<00:01:12.649> inside<00:01:13.429> the<00:01:13.670> other<00:01:13.819> and

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
actually sit down inside the other and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.770 
actually sit down inside the other and
still<00:01:14.929> maintain<00:01:15.649> room<00:01:16.009> for<00:01:16.579> the<00:01:17.240> nutrient

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
still maintain room for the nutrient

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.279 
still maintain room for the nutrient
reservoir<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.469> bottom<00:01:19.869> now<00:01:20.869> this<00:01:21.109> is

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
reservoir in the bottom now this is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.139 
reservoir in the bottom now this is
simply<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.829> design<00:01:22.189> I've<00:01:22.429> chosen<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:22.999> go<00:01:23.030> with

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
simply the design I've chosen to go with

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.929 
simply the design I've chosen to go with
there<00:01:24.049> are<00:01:24.170> many<00:01:24.409> variations<00:01:24.889> on<00:01:25.459> this<00:01:25.700> type

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
there are many variations on this type

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.920 
there are many variations on this type
of<00:01:25.969> system

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
of system

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.440 
of system
now<00:01:28.440> at<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.710> point<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
now at this point it's up to you to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.840 
now at this point it's up to you to
decide<00:01:30.780> what<00:01:31.080> form<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.710> ebb<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.130> flow<00:01:32.310> system

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
decide what form of ebb and flow system

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.020 
decide what form of ebb and flow system
you<00:01:33.000> want<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.330> build<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.340> there

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
you want to build as you can see there

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.970 
you want to build as you can see there
are<00:01:36.150> many<00:01:36.390> variations<00:01:36.870> of<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.650> ebb<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.860> flow

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
are many variations of the ebb and flow

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.120 
are many variations of the ebb and flow
system<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.720> make<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.230> custom<00:01:40.560> design

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130

and<00:01:44.070> what<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.850> wish<00:01:45.120> to<00:01:45.300> accomplish<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.990> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and what you wish to accomplish with it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.050 
and what you wish to accomplish with it
you<00:01:46.860> don't<00:01:46.980> have<00:01:47.190> to<00:01:47.310> settle<00:01:47.550> for<00:01:47.640> someone

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you don't have to settle for someone

some nutrient solution in into our
reservoir

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
reservoir

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.440 
reservoir
and<00:03:43.749> also<00:03:44.379> we<00:03:44.499> can<00:03:44.560> go<00:03:44.739> ahead<00:03:44.859> now<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.310> plug<00:03:46.209> in

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
and also we can go ahead now and plug in

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.800 
and also we can go ahead now and plug in
our<00:03:46.799> aquarium<00:03:47.799> pump<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.430> get<00:03:48.849> some<00:03:49.090> air<00:03:49.450> into

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
our aquarium pump and get some air into

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.949 
our aquarium pump and get some air into
the<00:03:50.079> nutrient<00:03:50.829> solution<00:03:51.180> now<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.239> air<00:03:52.659> flow

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
the nutrient solution now the air flow

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.780 
the nutrient solution now the air flow
in<00:03:53.109> the<00:03:53.200> nutrient<00:03:53.680> solution<00:03:53.799> is<00:03:54.189> important

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
in the nutrient solution is important

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.899 
in the nutrient solution is important
because<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.389> does<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.599> couple<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:55.989> things<00:03:56.909> one

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
because it does a couple of things one

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.030 
because it does a couple of things one
thing<00:03:58.150> it<00:03:58.269> does<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.840> keep<00:03:59.290> algae<00:03:59.769> from<00:03:59.950> growing

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
thing it does is keep algae from growing

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.099 
thing it does is keep algae from growing
down<00:04:00.579> in<00:04:00.790> your<00:04:00.909> tank<00:04:01.150> from<00:04:01.359> stagnant<00:04:01.900> water

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
down in your tank from stagnant water

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.250 
down in your tank from stagnant water
and<00:04:02.319> secondly<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:04.060> oxygen<00:04:04.629> is<00:04:04.780> good<00:04:04.959> for<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
and secondly the oxygen is good for the

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.629 
and secondly the oxygen is good for the
roots<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.650> your<00:04:05.709> plants<00:04:06.219> that<00:04:06.340> are<00:04:06.489> being

roots of your plants that are being

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.709 
roots of your plants that are being
grown<00:04:06.939> hydroponically<00:04:09.239> now<00:04:10.239> let's<00:04:10.480> take<00:04:10.689> a

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:10.719 
grown hydroponically now let's take a

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:12.839 
grown hydroponically now let's take a
look<00:04:10.930> inside<00:04:11.109> our<00:04:11.409> flood<00:04:11.620> table<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:12.519> also

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
look inside our flood table and also

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.940 
look inside our flood table and also
we'll<00:04:13.180> plug<00:04:13.389> in<00:04:13.629> our<00:04:13.749> fountain<00:04:14.169> pump<00:04:14.409> now<00:04:14.889> the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
we'll plug in our fountain pump now the

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.830 
we'll plug in our fountain pump now the
pump<00:04:15.249> is<00:04:15.400> going<00:04:15.609> to<00:04:15.730> start<00:04:15.969> pumping<00:04:16.599> a

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
pump is going to start pumping a

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.409 
pump is going to start pumping a
solution<00:04:17.440> from<00:04:17.889> your<00:04:18.070> reservoir<00:04:18.400> up<00:04:18.729> at<00:04:19.269> your

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
solution from your reservoir up at your

solution from your reservoir up at your
flood<00:04:19.660> table<00:04:20.079> till<00:04:20.829> it<00:04:20.949> reaches<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.519> top<00:04:21.729> of

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
flood table till it reaches the top of

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.939 
flood table till it reaches the top of
the<00:04:22.030> overflow<00:04:22.270> pipe<00:04:22.720> which<00:04:23.470> will<00:04:23.680> maintain

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
the overflow pipe which will maintain

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.740 
the overflow pipe which will maintain
your<00:04:24.699> nutrient<00:04:25.360> solution<00:04:25.389> at<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.560> level<00:04:27.750> now

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
your nutrient solution at that level now

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.240 
your nutrient solution at that level now
let's<00:04:28.960> take<00:04:29.169> a<00:04:29.199> closer<00:04:29.560> look<00:04:29.860> at<00:04:30.070> your

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
let's take a closer look at your

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.969 
let's take a closer look at your
overflow<00:04:30.639> pipe<00:04:31.169> because<00:04:32.169> this<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.620> going<00:04:32.860> to

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
overflow pipe because this is going to

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.210 
overflow pipe because this is going to
largely<00:04:33.789> determine<00:04:34.720> how<00:04:35.440> your<00:04:35.710> system<00:04:36.099> will

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
largely determine how your system will

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.300 
largely determine how your system will
operate<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:37.720> can<00:04:37.870> adjust<00:04:38.259> the<00:04:38.530> overflow<00:04:39.070> pipe

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
operate you can adjust the overflow pipe

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.939 
operate you can adjust the overflow pipe
shorter<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.440> you'll<00:04:41.440> be<00:04:41.590> able<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.800> use

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
shorter and you'll be able to use

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.580 
shorter and you'll be able to use
smaller<00:04:42.370> net<00:04:42.759> pots<00:04:43.320> adjusting<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.380> more
