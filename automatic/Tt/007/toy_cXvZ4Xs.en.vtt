it and then just pull it and this is a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.210 
it and then just pull it and this is a
real<00:00:38.090> good<00:00:38.360> way<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.570> get<00:00:38.900> a<00:00:38.960> loop<00:00:39.230> built<00:00:39.559> so

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
real good way to get a loop built so

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.959 
real good way to get a loop built so
that<00:00:40.250> you<00:00:40.550> don't<00:00:40.820> get<00:00:41.230> a<00:00:42.370> kink<00:00:43.370> in<00:00:43.550> it<00:00:43.730> and

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
that you don't get a kink in it and

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.330 
that you don't get a kink in it and
where<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:44.930> would<00:00:45.140> have<00:00:45.320> to<00:00:45.530> put<00:00:45.770> it<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.129> Rope

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
where you would have to put it the Rope

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.660 
where you would have to put it the Rope
would<00:00:46.550> kind<00:00:46.850> of<00:00:46.940> get<00:00:47.030> a<00:00:47.059> kink<00:00:47.390> like<00:00:47.600> that<00:00:47.840> in<00:00:48.050> it

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
would kind of get a kink like that in it

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.889 
would kind of get a kink like that in it
because<00:00:49.670> then<00:00:49.850> you'd<00:00:50.000> have<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.420> put<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.629> back

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
because then you'd have to put a back

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.470 
because then you'd have to put a back
coil<00:00:51.289> in<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:51.559> swing<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:52.700> it's<00:00:52.879> kind<00:00:53.120> of<00:00:53.180> a<00:00:53.300> good

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
coil in it swing so it's kind of a good

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.680 
coil in it swing so it's kind of a good
way<00:00:53.980> to<00:00:54.980> build<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.550> make<00:00:56.180> sure<00:00:56.390> when<00:00:56.570> you

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
way to build that make sure when you

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.170 
way to build that make sure when you
hold<00:00:56.930> your<00:00:57.079> rope<00:00:57.469> that<00:00:58.250> you<00:00:58.850> have<00:01:00.940> this<00:01:01.940> is

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
hold your rope that you have this is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.450 
hold your rope that you have this is
called<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.600> spoke<00:01:02.989> make<00:01:03.800> sure<00:01:04.039> the<00:01:04.190> part

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
called the spoke make sure the part

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.980 
called the spoke make sure the part
that's<00:01:04.699> attached<00:01:05.059> so<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:05.539> you<00:01:05.660> don't<00:01:05.869> get

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
that's attached so that you don't get

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.139 
that's attached so that you don't get
confused<00:01:06.140> attached<00:01:06.770> to<00:01:07.039> the<00:01:07.130> Honda<00:01:07.340> is<00:01:07.880> in<00:01:08.030> the

being<00:01:59.270> afraid<00:01:59.720> but<00:02:00.440> it's<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.709> lot<00:02:00.890> easier<00:02:00.920> to

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
being afraid but it's a lot easier to

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.490 
being afraid but it's a lot easier to
keep<00:02:01.610> him<00:02:01.849> from<00:02:02.030> getting<00:02:02.270> afraid<00:02:02.690> so<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.229> have

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
keep him from getting afraid so you have

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.910 
keep him from getting afraid so you have
to<00:02:03.679> be

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
to be

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.399 
to be
very<00:02:04.009> careful<00:02:04.430> about<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.820> when<00:02:05.720> you<00:02:05.840> coil<00:02:06.170> up

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
very careful about that when you coil up

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.800 
very careful about that when you coil up
a<00:02:06.680> lot<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.130> people<00:02:07.490> once<00:02:08.270> they<00:02:08.450> get<00:02:08.569> kind<00:02:08.780> of

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
a lot of people once they get kind of

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.680 
a lot of people once they get kind of
comfortable<00:02:09.259> if<00:02:09.979> they're<00:02:10.340> just<00:02:10.729> practicing

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
comfortable if they're just practicing

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.390 
comfortable if they're just practicing
they'll<00:02:11.870> coil<00:02:12.290> like<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:12.560> with<00:02:12.950> their<00:02:13.130> thumb

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
they'll coil like this with their thumb

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.880 
they'll coil like this with their thumb
down<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.810> don't<00:02:15.020> want<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.410> do<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.680> you

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
down and you don't want to do that you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.370 
down and you don't want to do that you
want<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.190> practice<00:02:16.400> with<00:02:16.849> your<00:02:16.970> thumb<00:02:17.239> up<00:02:17.480> just

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
want to practice with your thumb up just

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.530 
want to practice with your thumb up just
like<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.830> were<00:02:18.950> going<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.400> coil<00:02:19.760> when<00:02:20.420> you

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
like you were going to coil when you

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.180 
like you were going to coil when you
were<00:02:20.660> riding<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.319> you're<00:02:21.410> ready<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.800> dally

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
were riding and you're ready to dally

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.250 
were riding and you're ready to dally
with<00:02:22.370> your<00:02:22.700> thumb<00:02:22.910> up<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.780> want<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.140> make

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
with your thumb up so you want to make

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.130 
with your thumb up so you want to make
sure<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.560> practice<00:02:24.830> that<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:26.000> other<00:02:26.209> way<00:02:26.600> to

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
sure you practice that the other way to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.059 
sure you practice that the other way to
make<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.350> loop<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.730> just<00:02:29.530> hang<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
make a loop is to just hang on to the

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.449 
make a loop is to just hang on to the
Honda<00:02:31.610> like<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.870> roll<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.310> hook<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.400> with

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
Honda like this and roll it hook it with

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.380 
Honda like this and roll it hook it with
your<00:02:34.700> thumb

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
your thumb

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.000 
your thumb
then<00:02:35.599> I<00:02:35.690> kind<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.930> put<00:02:36.110> between<00:02:36.410> my<00:02:36.650> fingers

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
then I kind of put between my fingers

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.670 
then I kind of put between my fingers
and<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.550> can<00:02:37.730> slide<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.239> up<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.660> then<00:02:39.500> you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
and you can slide it up and then you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.850 
and you can slide it up and then you
trade<00:02:40.280> hands<00:02:40.550> again<00:02:40.910> roll<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.780> bring<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.709> back

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
trade hands again roll it bring it back

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.180 
trade hands again roll it bring it back
up

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
up

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.199 
up
roll<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.860> bring<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:45.980> back<00:02:46.160> up<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.850> way<00:02:47.000> you've

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
roll it bring it back up that way you've

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.380 
roll it bring it back up that way you've
got<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.420> better<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:48.019> better<00:02:48.410> new<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.760> there's<00:02:50.330> a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
got a better a better new so there's a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.600 
got a better a better new so there's a
minute<00:02:50.690> there's<00:02:50.840> more<00:02:51.140> ways<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.739> do<00:02:51.890> it<00:02:51.920> just

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
minute there's more ways to do it just

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.100 
minute there's more ways to do it just
show<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:52.970> couple<00:02:53.209> there<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.840> have

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
show you a couple there so you have

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.590 
show you a couple there so you have
something<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.530> kind<00:02:54.739> of<00:02:54.769> build<00:02:55.010> on<00:02:55.510> when<00:02:56.510> you

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
something to kind of build on when you

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.870 
something to kind of build on when you
when<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.019> start<00:02:57.290> practicing<00:02:57.560> on<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.310> ground

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
when you start practicing on the ground

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.170 
when you start practicing on the ground
it's<00:02:59.000> just<00:02:59.239> swinging<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.780> roll<00:03:00.670> try<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.730> not

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
it's just swinging you roll try to not

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.650 
it's just swinging you roll try to not
start<00:03:02.569> with<00:03:02.720> too<00:03:03.459> big<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.700> loop<00:03:04.910> but<00:03:05.269> try<00:03:05.600> to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
start with too big of a loop but try to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.860 
start with too big of a loop but try to
just<00:03:06.019> get<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.769> you<00:03:07.670> can<00:03:07.880> swing<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.660> and

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
just get it so that you can swing it and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.229 
just get it so that you can swing it and
lay<00:03:09.019> it<00:03:09.049> down<00:03:09.200> on<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.620> ground<00:03:09.650> try<00:03:10.579> to<00:03:10.640> start

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
lay it down on the ground try to start

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.750 
lay it down on the ground try to start
with<00:03:11.570> it<00:03:12.459> like<00:03:13.459> this<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.209> just<00:03:14.359> go<00:03:14.630> up<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:16.549> lay

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
with it like this and just go up and lay

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.170 
with it like this and just go up and lay
it<00:03:16.820> flat

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
it flat

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.479 
it flat
stop<00:03:17.630> it<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:18.190> lot<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.220> times<00:03:19.549> people<00:03:20.030> will<00:03:20.180> start

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
stop it a lot of times people will start

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.420 
stop it a lot of times people will start
the<00:03:22.489> Honda<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.269> kind<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.510> leads<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.890> loop<00:03:25.130> so

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
the Honda it kind of leads the loop so

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.729 
the Honda it kind of leads the loop so
it<00:03:25.549> stays<00:03:25.820> open<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.870> lot<00:03:27.109> of<00:03:27.260> trouble<00:03:27.620> what

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
it stays open and a lot of trouble what

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.069 
it stays open and a lot of trouble what
people<00:03:28.070> have<00:03:28.280> when<00:03:28.519> they<00:03:28.640> start<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.239> grow<00:03:29.510> is

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
people have when they start to grow is

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.160 
people have when they start to grow is
they'll<00:03:30.350> start<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.950> go<00:03:31.130> like<00:03:31.340> this<00:03:31.609> and<00:03:32.170> this

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
they'll start to go like this and this

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.319 
they'll start to go like this and this
part<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.859> rope<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:36.190> leading<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.340> loop<00:03:37.549> so

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
part of the rope is leading the loop so

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.060 
part of the rope is leading the loop so
what<00:03:38.480> ends<00:03:38.750> up<00:03:38.810> happening<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.650> ends<00:03:39.980> up

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
what ends up happening is it ends up

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.220 
what ends up happening is it ends up
kinking<00:03:40.640> up<00:03:40.790> in<00:03:40.970> your<00:03:41.120> in<00:03:41.390> your<00:03:41.630> hand<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.079> end

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
kinking up in your in your hand you end

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.710 
kinking up in your in your hand you end
up<00:03:42.350> getting<00:03:42.530> what<00:03:43.400> like<00:03:43.850> this<00:03:44.090> where<00:03:44.420> it<00:03:44.540> gets

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
up getting what like this where it gets

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.449 
up getting what like this where it gets
a<00:03:44.840> figure<00:03:45.170> eight<00:03:45.350> in<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:48.230> got<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.250> try

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
a figure eight in it so you got to try

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.069 
a figure eight in it so you got to try
to<00:03:49.489> get<00:03:49.819> it<00:03:49.970> so<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.269> you<00:03:50.329> can<00:03:50.480> keep<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.900> loop

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
to get it so that you can keep the loop

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.390 
to get it so that you can keep the loop
open<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.780> can<00:03:53.989> keep<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:54.590> swing<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.250> a

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
open and you can keep it and swing it a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.000 
open and you can keep it and swing it a
couple<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:55.700> three<00:03:55.850> or<00:03:55.970> four<00:03:56.000> times<00:03:56.359> but<00:03:57.319> it's

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
couple of three or four times but it's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.640 
couple of three or four times but it's
more<00:03:58.340> trying<00:03:58.819> to<00:03:58.910> get<00:03:59.090> control<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.230> know<00:04:00.380> rope

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
more trying to get control you know rope

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.890 
more trying to get control you know rope
is<00:04:00.889> easy<00:04:01.100> to<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.910> master<00:04:02.389> because

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
is easy to to master because

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.289 
is easy to to master because
meccanica<00:04:03.560> it<00:04:04.040> doesn't<00:04:04.430> have<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.700> brain<00:04:05.030> it's

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
meccanica it doesn't have a brain it's

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.660 
meccanica it doesn't have a brain it's
not<00:04:05.450> like<00:04:05.689> your<00:04:05.989> horse<00:04:06.290> it's<00:04:06.590> thinking<00:04:07.189> and

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
not like your horse it's thinking and

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.210 
not like your horse it's thinking and
feeling<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.329> you<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.989> thing<00:04:09.319> only<00:04:09.590> does<00:04:09.950> what

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
feeling of you this thing only does what

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.610 
feeling of you this thing only does what
you<00:04:10.370> tell<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.640> to<00:04:10.760> do<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.900> more<00:04:12.140> you<00:04:12.290> have

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
you tell it to do so the more you have

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.740 
you tell it to do so the more you have
it<00:04:12.769> in<00:04:12.890> your<00:04:13.010> hand<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:13.579> you<00:04:14.299> can<00:04:14.329> practice

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
it in your hand and you can practice

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.210 
it in your hand and you can practice
these<00:04:15.260> kinds<00:04:15.650> of<00:04:15.680> things

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
these kinds of things

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.849 
these kinds of things
we're<00:04:16.669> just<00:04:17.509> try<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.780> swing<00:04:18.169> it<00:04:18.350> around<00:04:18.440> you

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
we're just try to swing it around you

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.090 
we're just try to swing it around you
like<00:04:19.070> this<00:04:19.400> over<00:04:20.329> your<00:04:20.449> head<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.989> keep<00:04:21.859> the

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
like this over your head and keep the

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.270 
like this over your head and keep the
loop<00:04:22.280> open<00:04:22.789> but<00:04:23.539> see<00:04:23.750> if<00:04:23.870> you<00:04:24.050> go<00:04:25.039> like<00:04:25.250> this

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
loop open but see if you go like this

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.370 
loop open but see if you go like this
see<00:04:25.759> it'll<00:04:26.000> end<00:04:26.150> up<00:04:26.270> getting<00:04:26.630> see<00:04:27.169> how<00:04:27.320> the

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
see it'll end up getting see how the

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.610 
see it'll end up getting see how the
ropes<00:04:27.680> on<00:04:27.860> top<00:04:28.100> of<00:04:28.220> my<00:04:28.340> wrist<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.900> you<00:04:30.229> want<00:04:30.500> to

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
ropes on top of my wrist so you want to

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.460 
ropes on top of my wrist so you want to
kind<00:04:30.770> of<00:04:30.889> make<00:04:31.100> sure<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:31.550> understand<00:04:32.150> that

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
kind of make sure you understand that

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.960 
kind of make sure you understand that
and<00:04:33.470> just<00:04:33.740> try<00:04:33.949> to<00:04:33.979> get<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.370> so<00:04:34.520> that<00:04:34.550> you<00:04:34.759> can

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
and just try to get it so that you can

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.879 
and just try to get it so that you can
keep<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.330> loop<00:04:35.510> open<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.199> then<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:36.710> can

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
keep the loop open and then you can

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.189 
keep the loop open and then you can
speed<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:37.280> up<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.669> little<00:04:37.850> bit<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.900> then<00:04:39.080> you

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
speed it up a little bit and then you

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.770 
speed it up a little bit and then you
could<00:04:39.380> go<00:04:39.760> right<00:04:40.760> out<00:04:40.940> in<00:04:41.060> front<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.389> you

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
could go right out in front of you

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.659 
could go right out in front of you
or<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.050> could<00:04:42.260> swing<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.530> side<00:04:42.860> arm<00:04:43.070> swing<00:04:43.370> so

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
or you could swing a side arm swing so

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.219 
or you could swing a side arm swing so
there's<00:04:44.270> lots<00:04:44.479> of<00:04:44.630> different<00:04:44.690> things<00:04:44.990> that

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
there's lots of different things that

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.870 
there's lots of different things that
are<00:04:45.350> going<00:04:45.440> to<00:04:45.560> get<00:04:45.710> into<00:04:45.979> all<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.280> swings

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
are going to get into all the swings

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.670 
are going to get into all the swings
but<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.360> hope<00:04:47.720> that<00:04:47.750> kind<00:04:48.169> of<00:04:48.229> helps<00:04:48.530> you<00:04:48.590> out

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
but I hope that kind of helps you out

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.250 
but I hope that kind of helps you out
