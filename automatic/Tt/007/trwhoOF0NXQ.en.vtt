 hello everyone today we will have a very 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.830
 interesting video on the replay of the battle on the tank 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.089
 in to 2801 as we all know more precisely that we have 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 thick part to scroll level 5 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:21.060
 anyone can buy it 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.869
 leopard here after their ray and pumping up 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 on a limp of 55 or 60 co-op then I already 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.510
 I do not remember that and free to buy status 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.370
 the panda can everyone here in general our 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.010
 Tanchik this was battle where I received the most 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.219
 the biggest experience for your group 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.500
 It seems the most maximum + 2 tanks are 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.120
 his gun is his most such 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:54.590
 best gun and fireflies because on 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:59.460
 we have 350 damage to it 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:03.270
 armor-piercing and accumulative and 410 damage 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.659
 land mines and land mines 53 for 5 euros 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.659
 no more than 64 and we have 150 cumulatives 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.210
 there is absolutely no sense of armor-piercing 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.439
 more now silver for what 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.729
 you can buy silver now 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:20.439
 cumulatives can be freely bought by everyone 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.210
 cumulative shells and bend because 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.670
 that cumulative hid bend over 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:30.340
 all levels even tenths level 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.380
 what to do sawed opponent bis 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.750
 look impenetrable cumulative this 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.329
 of course very sad 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.350
 nevertheless she was a good corner of us 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:48.039
 hitting without damage again 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:50.439
 cumulative projectile here all thoughts 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.880
 he found 300 with something very much 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.549
 say because until then the words 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.770
 cdb 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.109
 we get almost kill him here if only I 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.709
 I killed him I will end up getting further 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:05.229
 Orlik but nevertheless, this video should 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:09.849
 to be very interesting to you because 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.700
 the end of the battle took wars and that's a lot 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.459
 on her with damage 4k damage is generally excellent 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.310
 turned out the battle is my best were 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:26.330
 just guys do a great tank 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:28.520
 this day we talk very well so 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.860
 He aimed at his forehead and he drove abruptly 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.260
 got that on the tower we mutiem the skill of what 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.129
 you 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.970
 we kill t29 so here we are fine 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.970
 is shaping up 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.950
 i see and so i class 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.110
 stroy its looking where it looks kvass 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.550
 kvass shot out pascal and flour 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.820
 lower armor sheet so that residual 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.430
 punch run off his charge with us 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.910
 regarding just 7 welded seconds 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:24.790
 it is very fast for such an important edge 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:24.790
 50 on very quickly we have t-34 85 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.180
 I have his code c 305 zvirona she is already very 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:35.359
 plenty of space i'm actually him in the tower 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.069
 we already have three frags and did not wait 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.140
 that i will take the years in fact here 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:44.000
 I 'm killing us out of it right under the tower 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:53.659
 putting him already 4 frags here I am going there 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:04:00.639
 where I see that I see everything now t29 m6 m6 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:04:00.639
 leaving me noticing leaving Tanya igniting him 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:08.599
 thinking worth not shoot in the end I 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.400
 still didn't shoot because he just 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:15.349
 burned out i mean we just killed 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.880
 the enemy of the sixth level m 6 you 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.880
 followed the land mines plus still missed 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.880
 here 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.670
 really needed wanted to take the warrior below 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.800
 Hellcat amnesty is also sufficient in 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.160
 tanks if here if you already kill even 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.630
 someone the same isa or coma 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.750
 take oh then we have from them t20 children t-43 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.660
 I apologize for saying so even myself 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.180
 killed t-43 i got an orlik though not 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:53.860
 if I remember him she can kill him 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:58.500
 not even it all the same apparently but nothing 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:08.740
 actually writes on admit warrior 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:11.830
 then 129 and kvass here punching class 373 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:18.750
 Damage I already have a warrior 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.750
 kill t29 food on him 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.930
 It seems to be reduced but I do not break through if I 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.660
 would kill now 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.580
 I think everyone understands what I would take 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.090
 Orlik medal I was happy it would be 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:38.490
 my first medal Orlyk's well, nothing 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:44.500
