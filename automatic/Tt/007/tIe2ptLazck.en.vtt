in<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.380> video<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:02.190> will<00:00:02.310> get<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.850> second

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
in this video I will get the second

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.680 
in this video I will get the second
green<00:00:03.629> star<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.470> Bowser's<00:00:05.190> galaxy<00:00:06.060> generator

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
green star in Bowser's galaxy generator

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.200 
green star in Bowser's galaxy generator
this<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.139> pretty<00:00:10.679> difficult<00:00:10.950> green<00:00:11.670> star<00:00:12.059> to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
this is a pretty difficult green star to

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.990 
this is a pretty difficult green star to
get<00:00:12.420> there<00:00:13.320> are<00:00:13.710> three<00:00:14.160> ways<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.429> get<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
get there are three ways to get the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.529 
get there are three ways to get the
green<00:00:15.240> star<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.859> basically<00:00:17.550> spent<00:00:18.090> about

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
green star and I basically spent about

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.820 
green star and I basically spent about
15<00:00:19.260> minutes<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.859> each<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> three<00:00:20.730> ways<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
15 minutes on each of the three ways and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.000 
15 minutes on each of the three ways and
Taylan<00:00:23.420> so<00:00:24.420> that's<00:00:24.600> about<00:00:24.750> 45<00:00:25.470> minutes<00:00:25.740> of

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
Taylan so that's about 45 minutes of

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.669 
Taylan so that's about 45 minutes of
failure<00:00:26.580> on<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.240> star<00:00:27.570> altogether<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:31.439> green

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
failure on the star altogether the green

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.690 
failure on the star altogether the green
star<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> planet<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.570> Yoshi<00:00:34.700> you

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
star is on the planet with Yoshi you

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.790 
star is on the planet with Yoshi you
basically<00:00:36.239> want<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.290> planet<00:00:37.680> with

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
basically want to get to the planet with

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.959 
basically want to get to the planet with
Yoshi<00:00:38.129> with<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:38.820> much<00:00:39.090> cloud<00:00:39.600> Mario<00:00:40.140> power<00:00:40.530> as

all right so this is basically the end

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.870 
all right so this is basically the end
of<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.340> area<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.860> end<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.160> this<00:03:18.250> galaxy<00:03:18.850> and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
of the area the end of this galaxy and

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.570 
of the area the end of this galaxy and
over<00:03:19.240> here<00:03:19.480> we<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.260> blue<00:03:21.130> mug<00:03:21.370> which

the<00:03:48.880> tricky<00:03:49.090> jumpin<00:03:49.540> myself<00:03:49.960> but<00:03:50.530> I'll<00:03:50.650> show

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
the tricky jumpin myself but I'll show

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.330 
the tricky jumpin myself but I'll show
you<00:03:50.890> how<00:03:51.250> you're<00:03:51.610> supposed<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.120> do<00:03:52.300> it<00:03:53.220> we<00:03:54.220> need

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
you how you're supposed to do it we need

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.820 
you how you're supposed to do it we need
to<00:03:54.400> form<00:03:54.700> a<00:03:54.790> cloud<00:03:55.000> stay<00:03:55.420> like<00:03:55.660> right<00:03:56.020> here<00:03:56.350> on

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
to form a cloud stay like right here on

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.010 
to form a cloud stay like right here on
this<00:03:57.130> level<00:03:57.550> where<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.270> can<00:03:58.420> get<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.750> cloud

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
this level where you can get the cloud

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.640 
this level where you can get the cloud
flower<00:03:59.380> when<00:03:59.800> it<00:03:59.890> reappears<00:04:01.260> pretty<00:04:02.260> simple

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
flower when it reappears pretty simple

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.089 
flower when it reappears pretty simple
right

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.920 

here's<00:04:05.700> where<00:04:05.969> it<00:04:05.999> gets<00:04:06.269> more<00:04:06.359> complicated

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
here's where it gets more complicated

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.610 
here's where it gets more complicated
make<00:04:07.799> cloud<00:04:08.069> one<00:04:08.370> then<00:04:08.909> cloud<00:04:09.239> number<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.749> jump

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
make cloud one then cloud number to jump

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.709 
make cloud one then cloud number to jump
back<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:10.950> cloud<00:04:11.340> one<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:11.849> then<00:04:12.150> jump<00:04:12.480> back<00:04:12.689> to

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:12.719 
back to cloud one and then jump back to

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.500 
back to cloud one and then jump back to
cloud<00:04:13.079> -<00:04:13.319> now<00:04:14.280> you're<00:04:14.459> on<00:04:14.579> cloud<00:04:14.909> two<00:04:15.209> with

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
cloud - now you're on cloud two with

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.219 
cloud - now you're on cloud two with
three<00:04:15.930> things<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.829> five<00:04:17.310> Mario<00:04:17.820> power<00:04:18.229> it's

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
three things of five Mario power it's

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.460 
three things of five Mario power it's
very<00:04:19.530> useful<00:04:20.070> however<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:21.419> made<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.229> cloud

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
very useful however I made the cloud

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.800 
very useful however I made the cloud
side-by-side<00:04:23.280> you're<00:04:24.120> going<00:04:24.419> to<00:04:24.509> have<00:04:24.660> to

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
side-by-side you're going to have to

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.719 
side-by-side you're going to have to
make<00:04:24.990> these<00:04:25.139> clouds<00:04:25.530> on<00:04:25.800> different<00:04:26.370> levels

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
make these clouds on different levels

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.390 
make these clouds on different levels
and<00:04:26.940> do<00:04:27.060> all<00:04:27.300> sorts<00:04:27.780> of<00:04:27.900> side<00:04:28.680> jumps<00:04:29.250> or

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
and do all sorts of side jumps or

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.999 
and do all sorts of side jumps or
backflips<00:04:30.090> in<00:04:30.660> order<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.199> get<00:04:31.380> from<00:04:31.680> cloud<00:04:31.979> to

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
backflips in order to get from cloud to

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.879 
backflips in order to get from cloud to
cloud<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:33.090> reach<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.479> very<00:04:33.660> top<00:04:34.020> with<00:04:34.440> as<00:04:34.620> much

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
cloud to reach the very top with as much

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.390 
cloud to reach the very top with as much
cloud<00:04:35.340> Mario<00:04:35.789> power<00:04:36.090> as<00:04:36.360> possible<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:38.190> that's

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
cloud Mario power as possible so that's

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.820 
cloud Mario power as possible so that's
the<00:04:38.639> first<00:04:38.940> way<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.300> get<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:39.690> green<00:04:39.900> star<00:04:40.259> by

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
the first way to get the green star by

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.159 
the first way to get the green star by
being<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.400> jumping<00:04:41.910> master<00:04:42.509> in<00:04:42.780> somehow

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
being a jumping master in somehow

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.890 
being a jumping master in somehow
managing<00:04:43.949> to<00:04:43.979> get<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.639> launch<00:04:44.849> jar<00:04:45.240> with

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
managing to get to the launch jar with

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:54.170 
managing to get to the launch jar with
two<00:04:46.229> pieces<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.800> cloud<00:04:47.250> Mario<00:04:47.729> power

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.900 

now<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.780> second<00:04:55.410> way<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.620> get<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.250> green<00:04:56.490> star

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
now the second way to get the green star

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.160 
now the second way to get the green star
is<00:04:57.780> if<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.140> only<00:04:58.350> have<00:04:58.650> one<00:04:58.980> cloud<00:04:59.400> and

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
is if you only have one cloud and

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:09.980 
is if you only have one cloud and
perfect<00:05:01.170> timing<00:05:08.210> here's<00:05:09.210> a<00:05:09.270> great<00:05:09.540> star<00:05:09.810> right

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
perfect timing here's a great star right

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.010 
perfect timing here's a great star right
there<00:05:10.200> in<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.380> distance<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:12.180> green<00:05:12.510> star<00:05:12.840> is

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
there in the distance the green star is

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.590 
there in the distance the green star is
very<00:05:13.350> far<00:05:13.680> away<00:05:13.860> but<00:05:14.490> if<00:05:14.820> you<00:05:14.970> have<00:05:15.180> perfect

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
very far away but if you have perfect

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.290 
very far away but if you have perfect
timing<00:05:15.950> you<00:05:16.950> can<00:05:16.980> actually<00:05:17.430> make<00:05:17.940> it<00:05:17.970> with

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
timing you can actually make it with

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.350 
timing you can actually make it with
only<00:05:18.540> one<00:05:18.960> cloud<00:05:19.370> you<00:05:20.370> need<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.700> do<00:05:20.790> two<00:05:21.090> long

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
only one cloud you need to do two long

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.590 
only one cloud you need to do two long
jumps<00:05:21.840> with<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.020> spin<00:05:22.380> at<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.680> end<00:05:22.830> and

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
jumps with a spin at the end and

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.970 
jumps with a spin at the end and
unfortunately<00:05:24.600> I<00:05:24.870> missed<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.380> green<00:05:25.620> star

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
unfortunately I missed the green star

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.610 
unfortunately I missed the green star
but<00:05:26.910> as<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.210> can<00:05:27.360> see<00:05:27.510> it's<00:05:27.780> really<00:05:28.230> possible

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
but as you can see it's really possible

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.520 
but as you can see it's really possible
if<00:05:29.160> you<00:05:29.310> have<00:05:29.510> perfect<00:05:30.510> timing<00:05:30.570> some<00:05:31.230> people

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
if you have perfect timing some people

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.920 
if you have perfect timing some people
swear<00:05:31.800> by<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.310> fact<00:05:32.670> that<00:05:32.850> Luigi<00:05:33.480> can<00:05:33.660> jump

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
swear by the fact that Luigi can jump

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.800 
swear by the fact that Luigi can jump
farther<00:05:34.320> than<00:05:34.650> Mario<00:05:35.070> so<00:05:35.940> they<00:05:36.060> try<00:05:36.390> to<00:05:36.450> do<00:05:36.660> the

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
farther than Mario so they try to do the

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.730 
farther than Mario so they try to do the
star<00:05:37.140> as<00:05:37.410> in<00:05:37.620> Legion<00:05:39.080> okay<00:05:40.080> so<00:05:40.140> that's<00:05:40.500> way

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
star as in Legion okay so that's way

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.100 
star as in Legion okay so that's way
number<00:05:40.980> one<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:41.580> way<00:05:41.730> number<00:05:41.970> two<00:05:42.060> let<00:05:42.990> me

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
number one and way number two let me

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.500 
number one and way number two let me
show<00:05:43.290> you<00:05:43.350> way<00:05:43.710> number<00:05:43.950> three<00:05:44.340> which<00:05:45.150> was<00:05:45.330> the

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
show you way number three which was the

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.360 
show you way number three which was the
way<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.660> was<00:05:45.810> stretching<00:05:46.290> you<00:05:46.650> earlier<00:05:47.070> with

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
way I was stretching you earlier with

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.780 
way I was stretching you earlier with
that<00:05:47.400> row<00:05:47.820> of<00:05:48.000> coins<00:05:49.160> basically<00:05:50.160> want<00:05:50.730> to

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
that row of coins basically want to

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.210 
that row of coins basically want to
reach<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.210> top<00:05:51.450> of<00:05:51.480> this<00:05:51.720> area<00:05:52.110> where<00:05:53.070> you

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
reach the top of this area where you

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.180 
reach the top of this area where you
have<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.610> row<00:05:53.730> of<00:05:53.760> points<00:05:54.710> so<00:05:55.710> just<00:05:55.920> bribe

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
have the row of points so just bribe

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.900 
have the row of points so just bribe
this<00:05:56.460> one<00:05:56.730> all<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.270> way<00:05:57.390> up<00:05:57.510> to<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:57.810> top

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
this one all the way up to the top

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.360 
this one all the way up to the top
simply<00:05:59.910> wait<00:06:00.420> for<00:06:00.450> it<00:06:00.840> to<00:06:00.990> go<00:06:01.110> up<00:06:01.140> up<00:06:01.650> up<00:06:01.920> row

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
simply wait for it to go up up up row

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.780 
simply wait for it to go up up up row
and<00:06:03.620> eventually<00:06:04.620> reach<00:06:05.010> the<00:06:05.040> top<00:06:05.490> of<00:06:05.670> this

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
and eventually reach the top of this

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.850 
and eventually reach the top of this
area<00:06:06.060> where<00:06:06.570> you<00:06:06.660> can<00:06:06.870> long<00:06:07.140> jump<00:06:07.500> to<00:06:07.740> the

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
area where you can long jump to the

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.610 
area where you can long jump to the
right<00:06:08.040> to<00:06:08.790> reach<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.180> hidden<00:06:09.390> Road<00:06:09.780> coins<00:06:10.320> oh

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
right to reach the hidden Road coins oh

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.860 
right to reach the hidden Road coins oh
okay<00:06:13.650> you'll<00:06:14.640> see<00:06:14.820> I<00:06:14.850> failed<00:06:15.300> to<00:06:15.450> spin<00:06:15.750> the

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
okay you'll see I failed to spin the

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.140 
okay you'll see I failed to spin the
Wiimote<00:06:16.260> and<00:06:16.530> create<00:06:16.800> a<00:06:16.830> cloud<00:06:17.100> but<00:06:17.910> if<00:06:18.000> you're

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
Wiimote and create a cloud but if you're

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.020 
Wiimote and create a cloud but if you're
good<00:06:18.420> enough<00:06:18.560> you<00:06:19.560> can<00:06:19.770> shake<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:20.550> Wiimote<00:06:20.880> at

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
good enough you can shake the Wiimote at

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.000 
good enough you can shake the Wiimote at
that<00:06:21.240> moment<00:06:21.450> create<00:06:22.020> a<00:06:22.080> cloud<00:06:22.260> and<00:06:22.620> then<00:06:22.740> jump

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
that moment create a cloud and then jump

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:41.600 
that moment create a cloud and then jump
to<00:06:23.070> the<00:06:23.190> platform<00:06:23.400> with<00:06:24.000> all<00:06:24.150> the<00:06:24.270> coins

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.070 

all<00:06:42.610> right<00:06:42.880> there<00:06:43.120> we<00:06:43.240> go<00:06:43.389> okay

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
all right there we go okay

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.710 
all right there we go okay
it's<00:06:44.320> an<00:06:44.470> ayah<00:06:44.590> to<00:06:44.919> clouds<00:06:45.310> and<00:06:46.150> then<00:06:46.360> across

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
it's an ayah to clouds and then across

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.040 
it's an ayah to clouds and then across
the<00:06:47.020> area<00:06:47.350> with<00:06:47.500> the<00:06:47.650> point

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
the area with the point

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.680 
the area with the point
I<00:06:49.110> dropped<00:06:49.830> down<00:06:49.979> there<00:06:50.340> and<00:06:50.879> basically<00:06:51.150> I

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
I dropped down there and basically I

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.100 
I dropped down there and basically I
avoid<00:06:52.440> the<00:06:52.740> whole<00:06:53.030> challenge<00:06:54.030> of<00:06:54.539> this<00:06:54.720> entire

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
avoid the whole challenge of this entire

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:01.450 
avoid the whole challenge of this entire
planet

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.010 

and<00:07:02.460> as<00:07:02.820> you<00:07:02.970> can<00:07:03.090> guess<00:07:03.150> getting<00:07:03.720> the<00:07:03.840> green

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
and as you can guess getting the green

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.720 
and as you can guess getting the green
star<00:07:04.380> to<00:07:04.920> hog<00:07:05.310> Mario<00:07:05.700> clouds<00:07:07.100> it's<00:07:08.100> basically

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
star to hog Mario clouds it's basically

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:17.060 
star to hog Mario clouds it's basically
the<00:07:09.540> way<00:07:09.570> to<00:07:09.780> do<00:07:10.140> this<00:07:10.320> challenge<00:07:15.590> long<00:07:16.590> jump

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.070 
the way to do this challenge long jump

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.650 
the way to do this challenge long jump
number<00:07:17.460> one<00:07:18.110> and<00:07:19.110> I<00:07:19.200> make<00:07:19.380> a<00:07:19.410> cloud<00:07:20.180> my<00:07:21.180> belongs

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 
number one and I make a cloud my belongs

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.760 
number one and I make a cloud my belongs
out<00:07:21.930> number<00:07:22.290> two

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:22.770 
out number two

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.810 
out number two
and<00:07:23.930> from<00:07:24.930> here<00:07:25.140> I<00:07:25.200> simply<00:07:25.560> jump<00:07:26.010> forward<00:07:26.550> to

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:26.820 
and from here I simply jump forward to

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.410 
and from here I simply jump forward to
get<00:07:26.970> green<00:07:27.300> star<00:07:27.690> number<00:07:28.170> two
