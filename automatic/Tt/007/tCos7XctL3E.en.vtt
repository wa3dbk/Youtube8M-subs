blue<00:01:01.549> as<00:01:01.729> i<00:01:01.879> thought<00:01:02.059> is<00:01:02.269> a<00:01:02.330> little<00:01:02.750> bit

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
blue as i thought is a little bit

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.969 
blue as i thought is a little bit
lighter<00:01:03.170> than<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:04.159> original<00:01:05.020> 2006<00:01:06.490> retro<00:01:08.979> not

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979

to<00:01:10.130> be<00:01:10.250> confused<00:01:10.430> with<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.090> original<00:01:11.500> shoe

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to be confused with the original shoe

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.450 
to be confused with the original shoe
either<00:01:13.250> one<00:01:13.610> of<00:01:13.640> them<00:01:16.060> overall<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:17.270> not<00:01:17.360> bad

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
either one of them overall it's not bad

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.669 
either one of them overall it's not bad
I'm<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.520> fan<00:01:20.329> of<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.540> military<00:01:20.960> blue<00:01:21.229> I'm<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.470> fan

I'm a fan of the military blue I'm a fan
of<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.920> darker<00:01:22.369> blue<00:01:23.090> in<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:25.310> 06<00:01:25.789> /<00:01:26.030> these<00:01:26.450> but

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
of the darker blue in the 06 / these but

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.770 
of the darker blue in the 06 / these but
I<00:01:26.869> still<00:01:27.170> like<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.560> lighter<00:01:27.770> blue<00:01:31.659> quality<00:01:32.659> on

I still like the lighter blue quality on
these<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.170> ok<00:01:37.119> we<00:01:38.119> can<00:01:38.149> all<00:01:38.450> argue<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.109> was

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
these is ok we can all argue that it was

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.809 
these is ok we can all argue that it was
made<00:01:39.530> better<00:01:39.829> in<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.100> past<00:01:40.389> and<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:42.530> is<00:01:42.679> true
