um<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:14.210> don't<00:01:15.210> want<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.480> use<00:01:15.570> fraps<00:01:15.900> because

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.560 

that<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.800> really<00:01:20.130> kill<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:21.000> frame<00:01:21.240> rate<00:01:21.270> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
that can really kill your frame rate so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.380 
that can really kill your frame rate so
I<00:01:21.630> wanted<00:01:21.870> to<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.170> true<00:01:22.410> that<00:01:23.150> guess<00:01:24.150> with

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I wanted to get it true that guess with

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.610 
I wanted to get it true that guess with

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
now what I'm going to do is go ahead and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:40.440 
now what I'm going to do is go ahead and
click

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.279 

turn<00:01:40.719> volume<00:01:40.869> down<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.320> little<00:01:41.500> bit<00:01:43.170> there<00:01:44.170> it

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
turn volume down a little bit there it

00:01:44.289 --> 00:02:14.940 
turn volume down a little bit there it
is

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950
