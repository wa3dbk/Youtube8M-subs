good story in a good part to play in it
do<00:01:05.239> you<00:01:05.359> think<00:01:05.630> sometimes<00:01:06.079> with<00:01:06.350> these<00:01:06.499> big

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:06.709 
do you think sometimes with these big

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:08.679 
do you think sometimes with these big
films<00:01:07.100> they<00:01:07.279> sacrifice<00:01:07.880> spectacle<00:01:08.600> ever

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
films they sacrifice spectacle ever

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.469 
films they sacrifice spectacle ever
story<00:01:09.079> because<00:01:09.319> this<00:01:09.469> seems<00:01:09.649> to<00:01:09.829> have<00:01:09.950> both

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
story because this seems to have both

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.769 
story because this seems to have both
well<00:01:11.479> I<00:01:11.509> think<00:01:11.719> they<00:01:11.869> indulged<00:01:12.469> spectacle

00:01:13.769 --> 00:01:13.779 
well I think they indulged spectacle

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:18.190 
well I think they indulged spectacle
sometimes<00:01:15.340> over<00:01:16.340> story<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:17.029> that's<00:01:17.209> I<00:01:17.779> think

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
sometimes over story and that's I think

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.080 
sometimes over story and that's I think
what<00:01:18.499> you<00:01:19.159> know<00:01:19.249> the<00:01:19.369> biggest<00:01:19.549> danger<00:01:19.969> is

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
what you know the biggest danger is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.959 
what you know the biggest danger is
losing<00:01:20.659> human<00:01:21.200> scale<00:01:23.049> so<00:01:24.049> over

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.760 

overcomplicating<00:01:29.109> either<00:01:30.109> with<00:01:30.349> special

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
overcomplicating either with special

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.730 
overcomplicating either with special
effects<00:01:31.039> overcomplicating<00:01:32.029> or<00:01:32.740> just
