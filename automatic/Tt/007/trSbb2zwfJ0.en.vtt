let's start making our standard bones
for<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> leg<00:01:22.880> we're<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> make<00:01:24.150> this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
for the leg we're going to make this

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.819 
for the leg we're going to make this
phone<00:01:24.540> call<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.020> route<00:01:25.229> let's<00:01:25.860> call<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.130> leg

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
phone call it route let's call it leg

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:39.469 
phone call it route let's call it leg
route<00:01:30.290> just<00:01:31.290> move<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.799> here

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
out like thigh and zero out the position

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.980 
out like thigh and zero out the position
on<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:01.940> rotate<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:03.030> down<00:02:03.210> actually

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
on that and then rotate it down actually

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.560 
on that and then rotate it down actually
I<00:02:04.020> want<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.380> my<00:02:04.680> left<00:02:05.040> view<00:02:07.069> turn<00:02:08.069> on
