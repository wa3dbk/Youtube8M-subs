00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.140
 with you heading popular science and I anar 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.030
 mansa 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.340
 welcome and escorted by viewers 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.259
 robotics exploring the structure of the living 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.120
 creatures that move optimally 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.699
 using the energy of your own body 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.010
 created a robot kangaroo he is not only 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.260
 jumps but responds to commands like 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.180
 jumping live kangaroo they effectively 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.220
 spending energy one jump for 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.109
 committing another the same principle was 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.240
 rooted in king 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.489
 significantly inferior to speed hereby 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.200
 kangaroo kangaroo robot weighs only seven 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.100
 a kilogram and its height is about 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.020
 one meter 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 nonetheless he can bounce on 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 40 centimeters high moving 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.260
 Forward in one leap 80 centimeters 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.090
 what is the undoubted record for 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.070
 robot push off device 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.989
 use compressed air kangaroos here 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.270
 just like a lively kangaroo helps me 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.559
 jump time is 100, but for gestures 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.239
 reacts thanks to a special 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.640
 brotherhood is worn by the master 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.640
 whom he always keeps before his eyes 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.180
 have you ever seen a phone 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.880
 fully charged in 30 seconds 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.810
 look at this fascinating picture 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.370
 new battery introduced 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.110
 Israeli developers afterwards 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.580
 exist as a prototype however 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.810
 the company plans to release it on 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.820
 market for three years 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.320
 currently different battery 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.630
 pretty big with about a pack 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.270
 cigarette in bio - organic batteries 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.080
 use the so-called 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.570
 self-assembled on the crystals 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.550
 created from peptide molecules and here you are 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.440
 already see how gradually gradually 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.750
 full smartphone battery 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.750
 charging your phone is ready to go 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.710
 how to find a planet like this in the universe 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.810
 because our land is like others 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.070
 exoplanets are very dim and practically 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.350
 quietly in space 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.300
 let's launch the utility room into space 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.580
 offered in us this apparatus will be able 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.650
 take photos of distant exoplanets so 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.170
 how best to sunflower and block the light 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.270
 emanating from the star of the petal shaped 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.980
 the shape of the instruments reduces the bending of the light 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.440
 waves and it increases the chances that 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.540
 telescope get a clear image 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.770
 exoplanets another advantage 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.420
 the sunflower should become the presence of it 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.430
 engines thanks to which the flower 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.190
 will be able to move independently from 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.960
 one subject in another heading 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.230
 popular science says goodbye to you before 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.230
 new meetings 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.480
 brainstorm discussion club where 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.049
 discusses the most pressing issues 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.749
 science 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.700
 what are the new cancer treatments like 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:35.189
 separate this thesis from 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.980
 fake why we don't get a signal from 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.840
 extraterrestrial civilizations these other topics in 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.450
 brainstorming studios discuss 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.150
 leading russian scientists every monday 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.310
 in the morning on the channel tv center 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.310
 she conducts the program Urmantsev
