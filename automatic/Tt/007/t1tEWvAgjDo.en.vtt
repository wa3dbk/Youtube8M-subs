00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
like the boss door so I think every

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970 
like the boss door so I think every
level<00:00:41.700> has<00:00:41.910> about<00:00:42.120> five<00:00:42.480> or<00:00:42.690> six<00:00:42.960> stars<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.860> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
level has about five or six stars in it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.650 
level has about five or six stars in it
