00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
so it's really cool it's a little in my

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.380 
so it's really cool it's a little in my
opinion<00:03:39.380> square<00:03:40.010> but<00:03:40.550> that's<00:03:40.880> my<00:03:41.000> personal

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
opinion square but that's my personal

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.180 
opinion square but that's my personal
opinion<00:03:41.450> because<00:03:41.930> I'm<00:03:42.170> used<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:42.890> have<00:03:42.980> more

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
opinion because I'm used to have more

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.400 
opinion because I'm used to have more
rounded<00:03:43.670> cases<00:03:44.090> but<00:03:44.360> I<00:03:44.540> mean<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.810> iphone<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.200> a

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
rounded cases but I mean the iphone is a

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.180 
rounded cases but I mean the iphone is a
square<00:03:45.860> thing<00:03:46.570> it's<00:03:47.570> actually<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.290> pretty<00:03:48.410> good

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
square thing it's actually a pretty good

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.250 
square thing it's actually a pretty good
case<00:03:49.430> I'm<00:03:49.790> actually<00:03:50.240> thinking<00:03:50.750> about<00:03:51.080> using

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
case I'm actually thinking about using

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.870 
case I'm actually thinking about using
this<00:03:51.500> once<00:03:51.710> in<00:03:51.830> a<00:03:51.890> while<00:03:52.070> it's<00:03:52.370> really<00:03:52.640> cool

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
this once in a while it's really cool

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.850 
this once in a while it's really cool
especially<00:03:53.210> with<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.690> stand<00:03:54.050> without<00:03:54.560> the

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
especially with the stand without the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.620 
especially with the stand without the
stand<00:03:55.130> I'd<00:03:55.400> say<00:03:55.640> it'd<00:03:55.820> be<00:03:55.970> kind<00:03:56.330> of<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.480> useless

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
stand I'd say it'd be kind of a useless

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.770 
stand I'd say it'd be kind of a useless
case<00:03:56.990> but<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.380> stand<00:03:57.680> just<00:03:57.950> kind<00:03:58.130> of<00:03:58.160> makes<00:03:58.460> it

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
case but the stand just kind of makes it

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.720 
case but the stand just kind of makes it
because<00:03:59.780> everyone<00:04:00.440> loves<00:04:00.590> having<00:04:00.860> stands<00:04:01.370> for

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
because everyone loves having stands for

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.660 
because everyone loves having stands for
their<00:04:01.850> phones<00:04:02.230> it's<00:04:03.230> just<00:04:03.560> unknown<00:04:03.920> fact<00:04:04.280> and

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
their phones it's just unknown fact and

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.000 
their phones it's just unknown fact and
then<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.030> wrist<00:04:05.240> strap<00:04:05.510> Sasha<00:04:06.410> neck<00:04:06.710> strap

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
then the wrist strap Sasha neck strap

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.830 
then the wrist strap Sasha neck strap
it's<00:04:07.520> just<00:04:07.760> useful<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.420> then<00:04:08.570> you<00:04:08.630> can<00:04:08.720> just

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
it's just useful and then you can just

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.310 
it's just useful and then you can just
unclip<00:04:09.320> it<00:04:09.350> when<00:04:09.860> you<00:04:09.950> don't<00:04:10.040> need<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:11.320> so

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
unclip it when you don't need it so

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.040 
unclip it when you don't need it so
that's<00:04:12.800> awesome<00:04:13.280> it's<00:04:14.150> going<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.570> be<00:04:14.630> held<00:04:14.840> in

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
that's awesome it's going to be held in

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.350 
that's awesome it's going to be held in
place<00:04:15.230> very<00:04:15.920> well<00:04:16.190> with<00:04:16.430> this<00:04:16.610> that's<00:04:17.060> not

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
place very well with this that's not

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.020 
place very well with this that's not
coming<00:04:17.600> off<00:04:17.860> and<00:04:18.860> you<00:04:18.950> can<00:04:18.980> still<00:04:19.280> access<00:04:19.580> the

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
coming off and you can still access the

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.600 
coming off and you can still access the
microphone<00:04:20.690> speaker<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:22.450> charging<00:04:23.450> slot

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
microphone speaker and the charging slot

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.820 
microphone speaker and the charging slot
one<00:04:25.610> note<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:26.420> is<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:27.200> little<00:04:27.470> low<00:04:27.620> for

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
one note that this is a little low for

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.930 
one note that this is a little low for
my<00:04:28.040> preference<00:04:28.490> also<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:30.680> button<00:04:31.190> because<00:04:31.700> it

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
my preference also the button because it

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.570 
my preference also the button because it
is<00:04:32.300> covered<00:04:32.780> up<00:04:32.870> by<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.220> decent<00:04:34.220> amount<00:04:34.520> of

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
is covered up by a decent amount of

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.070 
is covered up by a decent amount of
plastic<00:04:34.790> but<00:04:35.270> that's<00:04:35.480> not<00:04:35.600> going<00:04:35.720> to<00:04:35.810> cause

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
plastic but that's not going to cause

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.230 
plastic but that's not going to cause
any<00:04:36.320> trouble<00:04:36.710> it<00:04:37.040> actually<00:04:37.250> causes<00:04:37.610> better

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
any trouble it actually causes better

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.090 
any trouble it actually causes better
protection<00:04:38.870> that<00:04:39.020> it's<00:04:39.140> not<00:04:39.260> going<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.590> be<00:04:39.710> hit

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
protection that it's not going to be hit

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.070 
protection that it's not going to be hit
in<00:04:40.220> your<00:04:40.340> pocket<00:04:40.790> but<00:04:41.420> it<00:04:41.510> can<00:04:41.690> be<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.870> little

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
in your pocket but it can be a little

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.240 
in your pocket but it can be a little
nuisance<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.950> grab<00:04:43.640> out<00:04:44.120> of<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:45.710> button<00:04:46.040> to

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
nuisance to grab out of the button to

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.270 
nuisance to grab out of the button to
grab<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:46.670> so<00:04:47.480> overall<00:04:48.410> I<00:04:48.620> think<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:49.040> is<00:04:49.100> a

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
grab that so overall I think this is a

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.420 
grab that so overall I think this is a
very<00:04:49.580> decent<00:04:49.910> case<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.980> I'm<00:04:51.980> going<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.340> be

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
very decent case and I'm going to be

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.030 
very decent case and I'm going to be
