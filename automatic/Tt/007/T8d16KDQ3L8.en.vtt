so<00:00:05.069> this<00:00:05.490> is<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.759> pack<00:00:05.940> size<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.660> nano<00:00:07.020> as<00:00:07.200> you

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
so this is the pack size of nano as you

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.580 
so this is the pack size of nano as you
can<00:00:07.440> see<00:00:07.620> if<00:00:07.740> X<00:00:07.919> out<00:00:08.130> really<00:00:08.309> small<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.590> let's

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
can see if X out really small and let's

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.789 
can see if X out really small and let's
get<00:00:11.010> started<00:00:11.550> with<00:00:11.730> setup<00:00:12.150> first<00:00:13.049> what<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.650> like

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
get started with setup first what I like

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.010 
get started with setup first what I like
to<00:00:13.980> do<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.490> put<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.059> ground<00:00:15.299> cloth<00:00:15.540> down<00:00:15.809> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
to do is put the ground cloth down the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.560 
to do is put the ground cloth down the
footprint<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:17.699> protects<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.210> bottom

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
footprint and that protects the bottom

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.500 
footprint and that protects the bottom
of<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.960> tent<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.970> extends<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.180> launch<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
of the tent and extends the launch a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.509 
of the tent and extends the launch a
longevity<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.529> tent<00:00:22.740> as<00:00:22.830> well<00:00:23.010> checks<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
longevity of the tent as well checks the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.230 
longevity of the tent as well checks the
floor<00:00:23.760> from<00:00:25.279> rocks<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.490> roots<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> ground

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
floor from rocks and roots on the ground

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.429 
floor from rocks and roots on the ground
so<00:00:28.070> you<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.220> land<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.519> your<00:00:29.699> footprint<00:00:30.090> here

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
so you can land up your footprint here

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.510 
so you can land up your footprint here
you'll<00:00:31.439> notice<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.009> footprints

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you'll notice that the footprints

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.700 
you'll notice that the footprints
slightly<00:00:32.969> smaller<00:00:33.360> than<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.290> length<00:00:34.530> from

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
slightly smaller than the length from

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.220 
slightly smaller than the length from
the<00:00:34.800> width<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.190> tent<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.750> for

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
the width of your tent and that is for

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.340 
the width of your tent and that is for
rain<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.719> comes<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.140> probably

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
rain so that it's it comes in probably

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.280 
rain so that it's it comes in probably
about<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> half<00:00:40.890> inch<00:00:41.100> or<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.450> sides<00:00:42.809> and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
about a half inch or so on all sides and

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.369 
about a half inch or so on all sides and
it<00:00:43.440> protects<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.750> footprint<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:45.899> actually

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it protects the footprint from actually

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
it protects the footprint from actually
pulling<00:00:46.680> out<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> water<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.940> don't<00:00:48.120> have

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
pulling out the water so you don't have

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
pulling out the water so you don't have
water<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.899> between<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.710> footprint<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
water in between the footprint and the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.470 
water in between the footprint and the
floor<00:00:51.059> every<00:00:51.239> time

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.890 

and<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:01.110> we<00:01:01.560> will<00:01:01.800> attach<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.670> footprint<00:01:03.660> to

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
and now we will attach the footprint to

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.530 
and now we will attach the footprint to
the<00:01:04.559> four<00:01:04.769> corners<00:01:04.980> of<00:01:05.160> banana<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.540> attaching

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the four corners of banana so attaching

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.830 
the four corners of banana so attaching
the<00:01:10.260> footprint<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> bottom<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.600> tent

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the footprint to the bottom of the tent

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.310 
the footprint to the bottom of the tent
just<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
just like that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.960 
just like that
so<00:01:16.320> nanos<00:01:16.830> poles<00:01:17.130> are<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> inside<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
so nanos poles are on the inside of the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.270 
so nanos poles are on the inside of the
tent<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.420> you'll<00:01:19.350> notice<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:20.100> you're

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
tent and you'll notice when you're

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.370 
tent and you'll notice when you're
setting<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.060> nanos<00:01:21.720> design<00:01:22.080> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
setting it out that nanos design is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.950 
setting it out that nanos design is
really<00:01:22.979> tight<00:01:23.190> so<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.420> poles<00:01:24.630> are<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
really tight so the poles are going to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
really tight so the poles are going to
tend<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.500> want<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.860> bow<00:01:26.250> out<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.790> bit<00:01:27.030> so

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
tend to want to bow out a little bit so

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.520 
tend to want to bow out a little bit so
it's<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.510> be<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.930> important<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it's going to be really important that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.740 
it's going to be really important that
we<00:01:29.070> use<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> velcro<00:01:29.520> tabs<00:01:29.940> or<00:01:30.180> inside<00:01:30.510> of<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
we use the velcro tabs or inside of the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.600 
we use the velcro tabs or inside of the
tent<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.229> kind<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.619> harness<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:32.100> poles<00:01:32.340> back

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
tent to kind of harness the poles back

00:01:32.610 --> 00:02:42.470 
tent to kind of harness the poles back
to<00:01:32.850> where<00:01:32.940> they<00:01:33.060> need<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.270> be

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:03:17.720 

you

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.670 

so<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.000> key<00:03:19.150> things<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.480> remember<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:20.320> make

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
so the key things to remember to make

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.620 
so the key things to remember to make
the<00:03:20.800> tent<00:03:21.010> look<00:03:21.220> its<00:03:21.370> best<00:03:21.640> is<00:03:21.910> stick<00:03:22.300> out<00:03:22.450> all

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
the tent look its best is stick out all

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.590 
the tent look its best is stick out all
four<00:03:22.840> corners<00:03:23.110> in<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.530> vestibule<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.600> make

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
four corners in the vestibule and make

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.660 
four corners in the vestibule and make
sure<00:03:25.870> each<00:03:26.170> of<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.410> four<00:03:26.620> poles<00:03:26.950> goes<00:03:27.340> into

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
sure each of the four poles goes into

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.780 
sure each of the four poles goes into
the<00:03:27.760> grommets<00:03:28.180> in<00:03:28.360> each<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.810> corners<00:03:29.200> and

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
the grommets in each of the corners and

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.180 
the grommets in each of the corners and
that<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.300> poles<00:03:31.780> all<00:03:32.170> are<00:03:32.620> wrapped<00:03:32.890> with<00:03:33.040> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
that the poles all are wrapped with the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.190 
that the poles all are wrapped with the
velcro<00:03:33.460> pieces<00:03:33.880> that<00:03:34.180> are<00:03:34.330> in<00:03:34.450> here<00:03:34.630> it'll

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
velcro pieces that are in here it'll

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.190 
velcro pieces that are in here it'll
keep<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.500> tent<00:03:35.740> really<00:03:35.980> tension<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:36.850> it'll

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
keep the tent really tension and it'll

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.390 
keep the tent really tension and it'll
keep<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.320> from<00:03:38.410> looking<00:03:38.560> kind<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:38.950> bowed<00:03:39.190> out

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
keep it from looking kind of bowed out

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.190 
keep it from looking kind of bowed out
and<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:40.209> should<00:03:40.360> look<00:03:40.450> it's<00:03:40.630> best<00:03:40.810> if<00:03:40.990> you<00:03:41.050> do

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
and it should look it's best if you do

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.730 
and it should look it's best if you do
those<00:03:41.350> things

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
those things

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.730 
those things
Thanks
