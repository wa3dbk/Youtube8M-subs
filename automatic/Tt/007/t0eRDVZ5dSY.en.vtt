there's no audio input and you have to

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.230 
there's no audio input and you have to
use<00:02:13.020> AV<00:02:13.860> jacks<00:02:14.250> which<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.730> system<00:02:15.060> doesn't

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
use AV jacks which the system doesn't

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.290 
use AV jacks which the system doesn't
come<00:02:15.450> with<00:02:15.600> any<00:02:15.690> jacks<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.650> buy<00:02:16.860> I

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
come with any jacks but you can buy I

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.290 
come with any jacks but you can buy I
guess<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.450> could<00:02:18.570> buy<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.790> inverter<00:02:20.790> to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
guess you could buy like a inverter to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.350 
guess you could buy like a inverter to
put<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.600> on<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.810> HDMI<00:02:22.440> cord<00:02:22.800> thingy<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.460> that

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
put it on the HDMI cord thingy and that

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.530 
put it on the HDMI cord thingy and that
will<00:02:24.510> connect<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.930> HD<00:02:25.740> I<00:02:26.010> mean<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.670> hate<00:02:27.330> V

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
so maybe they will have a converter like

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.140 
so maybe they will have a converter like
that<00:02:32.940> sooner<00:02:33.270> or<00:02:33.390> later<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> future<00:02:35.150> so
