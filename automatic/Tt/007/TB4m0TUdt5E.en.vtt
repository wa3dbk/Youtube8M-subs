 your friend sam who was killed in 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.020
 Seattle in the previous part actually like 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:48.010
 the whole game is a continuation of the shadow series 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.790
 wounds are the people who did not play shadow 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.800
 early in general is not the point of graphite they need 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.509
 knew to play the first part that is 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.360
 understand the plot psycho why and where 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.470
 pistils and stamens 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:10.209
 let's return what kind of graphics 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:13.959
 the graphics we have are in 2d style with a view from 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.790
 I do not want any third person graphics 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.760
 strongly find fault with this game because 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.390
 what will start now dirty type you do not 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.019
 sharish 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:29.739
 and go home on a street like 2013 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.709
 games are the same shit coming out of course I 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.790
 a little shock okay we put 4 points 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.560
 you will not find fault with me because 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.400
 arbor I strongly carp at me 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.610
 the animation is not like that is in forever 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.600
 very looks and generally textures to me 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.840
 I don't like it either, but that's not the point 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.319
 that coat of arms so let's control that 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:01.799
 the gameplay itself as it were 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:05.280
 gp no claude and variety what to say 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.590
 I wow excited about this game plain 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.040
 as it were 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.680
 rpk strategy with elements that is there 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.889
 pumping your character that is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.159
 create characters we pump over there 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:23.030
 tired skills and we are bending down 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.980
 do the job climbed the map 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.230
 that's all about blood is also very simple 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:33.180
 here with a mouse 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.690
 we study for the skill and the name of the native game for 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.260
 idiot in general so that was with you 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.340
