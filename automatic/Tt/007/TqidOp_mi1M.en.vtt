00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
at $100 and flooded strand at 75 I think

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.639 
at $100 and flooded strand at 75 I think
these<00:00:51.270> will<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:51.809> drop<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.320> bit<00:00:52.530> in

price once a bunch of packs get open but
the<00:00:55.770> foils<00:00:56.280> long-term<00:00:56.969> will<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.570> back<00:00:57.780> up

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809

because the fetchlands are in there and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
because the fetchlands are in there and
it<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.280> brings<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> value<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> whole
