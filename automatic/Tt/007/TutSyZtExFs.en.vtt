00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
maybe if you want to try them in

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.270 
maybe if you want to try them in
separate<00:01:55.320> squads<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.770> might<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.100> little

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
separate squads there might be a little

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.459 
separate squads there might be a little
bit<00:01:56.460> better<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.240> me<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.689> far<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.110> really

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.990 
bit better but for me so far I really
wasn't<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.950> impressed<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> defense

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
me he's probably one of the cheaper

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.800 
me he's probably one of the cheaper
players<00:02:36.010> in<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.370> entire<00:02:36.670> squad<00:02:37.060> then<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.569> left

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
players in this entire squad then a left

players in this entire squad then a left
mid<00:02:38.049> we<00:02:38.170> have<00:02:38.290> el<00:02:38.440> shaarawy<00:02:38.769> ultra<00:02:39.489> way

mid we have el shaarawy ultra way
unfortunately<00:02:39.879> only<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.569> four<00:02:40.810> star<00:02:41.049> skiller

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
unfortunately only a four star skiller

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.750 
unfortunately only a four star skiller
in<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.620> game<00:02:41.859> which<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.430> little<00:02:42.670> bit

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
in this game which is a little bit

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.729 
in this game which is a little bit
disappointing<00:02:43.329> but<00:02:43.480> hey<00:02:43.599> ho<00:02:43.810> I<00:02:44.019> definitely

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
disappointing but hey ho I definitely

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.319 
disappointing but hey ho I definitely
think<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.159> he<00:02:45.370> doesn't<00:02:45.579> suit<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.120> left

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
think that he doesn't suit the left

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.089 
think that he doesn't suit the left
midfield<00:02:46.720> position<00:02:46.900> he'd<00:02:47.500> be<00:02:47.680> much<00:02:47.890> better

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
midfield position he'd be much better

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.949 
midfield position he'd be much better
off<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.370> left<00:02:48.849> wing<00:02:49.060> or<00:02:49.209> left<00:02:49.239> forward<00:02:49.720> because

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
off a left wing or left forward because

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.509 
off a left wing or left forward because
he<00:02:50.049> needs<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.409> get<00:02:50.500> involved<00:02:50.799> in<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.159> game<00:02:51.310> and

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
he needs to get involved in the game and

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.300 
he needs to get involved in the game and
he<00:02:51.819> has<00:02:52.060> such<00:02:52.389> a<00:02:52.420> great<00:02:52.840> ability<00:02:53.650> when<00:02:54.040> he's<00:02:54.159> in

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
he has such a great ability when he's in

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.559 
he has such a great ability when he's in
and<00:02:54.459> around<00:02:54.609> the<00:02:54.760> box<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.180> feel<00:02:55.420> as<00:02:55.540> though

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
and around the box that I feel as though

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.300 
and around the box that I feel as though
he's<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.959> little<00:02:56.200> bit<00:02:56.379> wasted<00:02:56.739> on<00:02:56.889> that<00:02:57.040> left

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
he's a little bit wasted on that left

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.640 
he's a little bit wasted on that left
midfield<00:02:57.760> position<00:02:58.090> then<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.810> right<00:02:59.109> mid<00:02:59.319> we

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
a weird play for me so dinatale team for

me<00:04:55.230> has<00:04:55.410> been<00:04:55.440> such<00:04:55.830> an<00:04:55.950> amazing<00:04:56.220> player

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
me has been such an amazing player

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.340 
me has been such an amazing player
throughout<00:04:57.000> quite<00:04:57.300> a<00:04:57.330> few<00:04:57.570> FIFA's<00:04:57.930> now<00:04:58.110> and

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
throughout quite a few FIFA's now and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.080 
throughout quite a few FIFA's now and
going<00:04:58.770> into<00:04:59.130> this<00:04:59.250> I<00:04:59.430> thought<00:04:59.700> his<00:04:59.820> team<00:05:00.000> in

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
going into this I thought his team in

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.850 
going into this I thought his team in
the<00:05:00.180> season<00:05:00.540> would<00:05:00.810> have<00:05:00.960> been<00:05:01.170> unreal<00:05:01.680> and

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
the season would have been unreal and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.800 
the season would have been unreal and
don't<00:05:02.070> get<00:05:02.160> me<00:05:02.220> wrong<00:05:02.490> guys<00:05:02.520> he<00:05:03.150> is<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.300> good

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
don't get me wrong guys he is a good

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.140 
don't get me wrong guys he is a good
player<00:05:04.020> but<00:05:04.380> he's<00:05:04.770> nothing<00:05:05.280> like<00:05:05.310> what<00:05:05.880> I<00:05:05.910> was

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
player but he's nothing like what I was

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.360 
player but he's nothing like what I was
hoping<00:05:06.360> so<00:05:06.810> for<00:05:07.290> me<00:05:07.410> I<00:05:07.440> think<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:08.070> he<00:05:08.220> needs

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
hoping so for me I think that he needs

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.800 
hoping so for me I think that he needs
to<00:05:08.580> play<00:05:08.730> in<00:05:09.120> maybe<00:05:09.420> a<00:05:10.910> 4321<00:05:11.910> formation<00:05:12.180> maybe

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
to play in maybe a 4321 formation maybe

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.240 
to play in maybe a 4321 formation maybe
play<00:05:13.050> him<00:05:13.170> as<00:05:13.290> a<00:05:13.320> striker<00:05:13.710> in<00:05:13.890> something<00:05:14.160> like

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
play him as a striker in something like

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.820 
play him as a striker in something like
that<00:05:14.310> I'm<00:05:14.940> not<00:05:15.120> entirely<00:05:15.450> sure<00:05:15.630> or<00:05:16.020> even<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.560> 4

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
that I'm not entirely sure or even a 4

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.530 
that I'm not entirely sure or even a 4
12<00:05:17.190> 12<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:17.550> think<00:05:17.880> he<00:05:17.970> would<00:05:18.090> suit<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.480> a

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
12 12 I think he would suit that a

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.150 
12 12 I think he would suit that a
little<00:05:19.140> bit<00:05:19.230> better<00:05:19.350> i'm<00:05:19.560> not<00:05:19.680> entirely<00:05:19.950> sure

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
little bit better i'm not entirely sure

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.040 
little bit better i'm not entirely sure
though<00:05:20.550> but<00:05:21.030> i<00:05:21.060> have<00:05:21.360> to<00:05:21.390> admit<00:05:21.510> i<00:05:21.720> didn't

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
though but i have to admit i didn't

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.810 
though but i have to admit i didn't
really<00:05:22.169> get<00:05:22.440> his<00:05:22.620> full<00:05:22.860> potential<00:05:23.250> out<00:05:23.610> now<00:05:23.790> i

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
really get his full potential out now i

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.310 
really get his full potential out now i
know<00:05:24.060> a<00:05:24.150> lot<00:05:24.240> of<00:05:24.390> people<00:05:24.480> have<00:05:24.840> been<00:05:24.870> enjoying

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
know a lot of people have been enjoying

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.290 
know a lot of people have been enjoying
using<00:05:25.590> him<00:05:25.830> so<00:05:26.280> maybe<00:05:26.430> it's<00:05:26.669> my<00:05:26.730> certain<00:05:27.090> place

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
using him so maybe it's my certain place

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.820 
using him so maybe it's my certain place
now<00:05:27.510> they<00:05:27.690> didn't<00:05:27.930> suit<00:05:28.110> him<00:05:28.260> but<00:05:28.650> what's

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
now they didn't suit him but what's

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.470 
now they didn't suit him but what's
weird<00:05:29.070> is<00:05:29.190> that<00:05:29.250> his<00:05:29.460> normal<00:05:29.790> card<00:05:30.000> i<00:05:30.150> really

just to see what the deal is but as you

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.610 
just to see what the deal is but as you
can<00:05:41.730> see<00:05:41.880> he<00:05:42.270> poaches<00:05:42.540> this<00:05:42.930> goal<00:05:43.169> out<00:05:43.320> kind<00:05:43.560> of

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
can see he poaches this goal out kind of

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.020 
can see he poaches this goal out kind of
steals<00:05:43.890> it<00:05:44.160> but<00:05:44.310> he<00:05:44.370> just<00:05:44.490> making<00:05:44.820> sure<00:05:44.940> it

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
steals it but he just making sure it

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.270 
steals it but he just making sure it
goes<00:05:45.150> into<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.479> back<00:05:45.600> of<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:45.840> net<00:05:46.050> and<00:05:46.229> yes<00:05:46.860> OD

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
goes into the back of the net and yes OD

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.640

natale<00:05:47.760> he<00:05:48.180> is<00:05:48.300> really<00:05:48.600> good<00:05:48.780> I<00:05:49.140> think<00:05:49.470> that

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
natale he is really good I think that

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.320 
natale he is really good I think that
you<00:05:49.710> know<00:05:49.800> he's<00:05:49.919> a<00:05:49.950> solid<00:05:50.250> player<00:05:50.400> but<00:05:51.000> I<00:05:51.030> think

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
you know he's a solid player but I think

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.940 
you know he's a solid player but I think
if<00:05:51.419> you<00:05:51.510> want<00:05:51.660> the<00:05:51.720> maximum<00:05:52.260> potential<00:05:52.590> out<00:05:52.830> of

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
if you want the maximum potential out of

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.620 
if you want the maximum potential out of
him<00:05:53.070> you<00:05:53.400> have<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.669> play<00:05:53.790> him<00:05:53.880> in<00:05:54.090> a<00:05:54.180> sort<00:05:54.390> of<00:05:54.450> a

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
him you have to play him in a sort of a

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.300 
him you have to play him in a sort of a
cheaper<00:05:55.080> serie<00:05:55.350> a<00:05:55.470> squad<00:05:55.800> I<00:05:55.830> don't<00:05:56.070> think<00:05:56.250> I

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
cheaper serie a squad I don't think I

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.740 
cheaper serie a squad I don't think I
had<00:05:56.460> him<00:05:56.580> in<00:05:56.669> the<00:05:56.760> right<00:05:57.000> conditions<00:05:57.540> when<00:05:57.720> I

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
had him in the right conditions when I

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.080 
had him in the right conditions when I
