00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.580
 Hello, in this video we will see how to start Windows 10 in safe mode, 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.120
 which will allow to be able to settle a possible problem of update 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.020
 Or possibly an installation reset or a rollback to windows 10 or windows 7 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.720
 To start in safe mode 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.400
 Just press the ignition button 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:47.060
 We will wait until the circle is drawn, we press on the ignition button, we stay supported 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.940
 Until he plants a first time 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.580
 We restart it a second time 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:08.060
 Same, as soon as we will have the small circle, we stay pressed on the ignition button until the extinction a second time 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.900
 And we will restart it 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.560
 And do it a third time 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.400
 fourth restart 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.740
 Windows will launch in safe mode 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.440
 We see from the ignition, "preparation of the automatic repair", so, we let it do 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:58.320
 This method is to use in case of emergency or no possibility of doing otherwise because the hard drive does not like forced extinctions like that 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 So there he will run a diagnostic of your computer that is fast enough. 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:22.160
 Here you have automatic repair, so we will not restart, we will make advanced option right 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.720
 Here we go in the middle on troubleshooting 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.840
 So here we can reset the PC here. So we will reset it on windows 10 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.920
 Here, we will go on the advanced options 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:53.080
 Here, we will have a system restore, so if you had a problem following an update of windows update we will restore to the previous date 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.320
 Here you have the order guest 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.840
 System restart tool, we're going to see more recovery options so, all the way down 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.240
 And here we have the possibility to downgrade to the previous version 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.080
 For those whose version, the installation of windows 10 is very badly spent 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:34.080
 Here is for example a laptop that went from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, so by clicking here on the previous version, we could reinstall windows 8 as originally 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:44.400
 For, safe mode, here we take troubleshooting, advanced option 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.080
 And here, parameter and there, restarting, it is listed, it activates safe mode 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.160
 So our PC will restart in safe mode 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.720
 So we will choose, according to your choice, you can choose 4 or 5, enable safe mode or enable safe mode with network support 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.680
 So we will take over with network support 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.720
 so, the 5 key 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.400
 It may be that we have a freeze, so that's since windows 8, we often have black screens frozen, just look if the hard drive is flashing or not 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:13.000
 but generally, just wait for the full load mode 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:30.600
 And here, so, here, as seen at the bottom, in the 4 corners, we are in safe mode which allows to uninstall any programs that crash the PC in normal mode 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.400
 This video is now over, I wish you a good troubleshooting and see you soon!
