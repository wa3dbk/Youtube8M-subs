00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
clean off that surface where the fitting

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.070 
clean off that surface where the fitting
is<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.269> slip<00:00:27.480> over<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.490> also<00:00:29.810> clean<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
is going to slip over it also clean the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.940 
is going to slip over it also clean the
inside<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.189> fitting<00:00:32.870> with<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> wire<00:00:34.200> brush

I<00:00:36.559> had<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> price<00:00:37.950> tag<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.640> fitting<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.180> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
I had a price tag on my fitting and I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.670 
I had a price tag on my fitting and I
just<00:00:39.390> went<00:00:39.570> ahead<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.840> clean<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.110> off<00:00:40.469> as

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
just went ahead and clean that off as

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.260 
just went ahead and clean that off as
well<00:00:42.860> once<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.040> parts<00:00:44.610> are<00:00:44.730> all<00:00:44.850> nice<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
well once your parts are all nice and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.830 
well once your parts are all nice and
clean<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.350> do<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> dry<00:00:47.010> fit<00:00:47.539> if<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.600> have

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
clean you do the dry fit if you have

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.049 
clean you do the dry fit if you have
multiple<00:00:49.440> pieces<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.280> your<00:00:50.430> run<00:00:50.610> fit

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
multiple pieces in your run fit

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.389 
multiple pieces in your run fit
everything<00:00:51.420> together<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.079> make<00:00:52.260> sure<00:00:52.399> it's

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
everything together and make sure it's

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.000 
everything together and make sure it's
going<00:00:53.699> where<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.969> want<00:00:54.559> once<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.770> looks

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
going where you want once that looks

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.010 
going where you want once that looks
good<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.610> time<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.300> apply<00:00:57.840> some<00:00:58.770> flux<00:00:59.090> to<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
good it's time to apply some flux to the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.950 
good it's time to apply some flux to the
inside<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.920> fitting<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:03.120> outside

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
inside of the fitting and that outside

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.190 
inside of the fitting and that outside
of<00:01:04.260> each<00:01:04.739> connection<00:01:05.430> what<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> flux<00:01:06.540> does<00:01:06.869> is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
of each connection what the flux does is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.560 
of each connection what the flux does is
actually<00:01:07.650> pulls<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.340> solder<00:01:08.610> into<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.270> joint

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
actually pulls the solder into the joint

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.830 
actually pulls the solder into the joint
so<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.229> want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> nice<00:01:10.860> even<00:01:11.100> coat

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
so you want to get a nice even coat

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
so you want to get a nice even coat
everywhere<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.200> want<00:01:13.439> solder<00:01:14.090> make

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
everywhere that you want solder make

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
everywhere that you want solder make
sure<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.509> don't<00:01:15.659> leave<00:01:15.840> any<00:01:16.049> spots<00:01:16.740> uncovered

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
sure you don't leave any spots uncovered

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.679 
sure you don't leave any spots uncovered
and<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.509> nice<00:01:18.750> thin<00:01:19.200> even<00:01:19.530> coat<00:01:21.560> also<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:23.689> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
and a nice thin even coat also on the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.310 
and a nice thin even coat also on the
outside<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> pipe<00:01:25.619> where<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> flux<00:01:27.320> where

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
outside of the pipe where the flux where

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.569 
outside of the pipe where the flux where
the<00:01:28.500> where<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> fitting<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.310> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> be

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the where the fitting is going to be

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.929 
the where the fitting is going to be
applied<00:01:29.880> gets<00:01:30.420> flux<00:01:31.159> anywhere<00:01:32.159> flux<00:01:32.700> is

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
applied gets flux anywhere flux is

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.870 
applied gets flux anywhere flux is
solder<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> be<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:36.259> don't<00:01:37.259> add<00:01:37.880> flux

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
solder is going to be so don't add flux

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.990 
solder is going to be so don't add flux
too<00:01:39.299> far<00:01:39.570> down<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.960> pipe<00:01:40.610> because<00:01:41.610> it'll<00:01:41.850> look

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
too far down the pipe because it'll look

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.179 
too far down the pipe because it'll look
it'll<00:01:42.509> look<00:01:42.720> bad<00:01:42.960> once<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.619> solder<00:01:43.950> on

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
it'll look bad once you have solder on

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.050 
it'll look bad once you have solder on
there<00:01:45.200> now<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.259> have<00:01:46.470> flux<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.100> both<00:01:47.369> parts<00:01:47.880> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
there now I have flux on both parts of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.080 
there now I have flux on both parts of
my<00:01:48.479> fittings<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.409> connections<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:50.189> put<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
my fittings and connections I put it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.030 
my fittings and connections I put it
together<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.950> make<00:01:52.950> sure<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.850> all<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.720> way

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
together and make sure it's all the way

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.709 
together and make sure it's all the way
inserted<00:01:56.040> into<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> fitting<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.880> couple

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
inserted into the fitting a couple

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.160 
inserted into the fitting a couple
little<00:01:57.840> twists<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.530> turns<00:01:59.780> now<00:02:00.780> we're<00:02:00.990> ready

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
little twists and turns now we're ready

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.580 
little twists and turns now we're ready
to<00:02:01.229> fire<00:02:01.500> up<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.829> torch<00:02:03.110> set<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.200> your<00:02:04.350> torch

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
to fire up the torch set up your torch

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.540 
to fire up the torch set up your torch
so<00:02:04.829> there's<00:02:05.840> just<00:02:06.840> an<00:02:06.990> inch<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.439> 3/4<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.429> an

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
so there's just an inch or 3/4 of an

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.339 
so there's just an inch or 3/4 of an
inch<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.819> blue<00:02:09.090> flame<00:02:09.420> coming<00:02:09.840> off<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> tip

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
inch of blue flame coming off the tip

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.270 
inch of blue flame coming off the tip
and<00:02:10.670> touch<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.940> tip<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.450> blue<00:02:12.840> flame

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
and touch the tip of that blue flame

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.790 
and touch the tip of that blue flame
to<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.760> work<00:02:13.940> now<00:02:14.870> you're<00:02:15.200> not<00:02:15.290> trying<00:02:15.530> to

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
to the work now you're not trying to

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.860 
to the work now you're not trying to
melt<00:02:16.100> your<00:02:16.280> solder<00:02:16.640> you're<00:02:17.000> trying<00:02:17.300> to<00:02:17.569> heat

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
melt your solder you're trying to heat

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.210
