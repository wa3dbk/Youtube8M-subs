00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.709 
the Central Valley we're out here in our
experimental<00:00:14.370> orchard<00:00:14.820> today<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.389> we're

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
experimental orchard today and we're

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.720 
experimental orchard today and we're
going<00:00:15.840> to<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:16.110> a<00:00:16.139> review<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.860> the<00:00:17.040> project<00:00:17.400> that

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
going to do a review of the project that

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.670 
going to do a review of the project that
we<00:00:17.880> did<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.480> almost<00:00:18.900> exactly<00:00:19.290> two<00:00:19.500> months

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
we did just almost exactly two months

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.159 
we did just almost exactly two months
ago<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.640> was<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> old<00:00:21.090> goldmine<00:00:21.630> nectarine

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:22.169 
ago this was the old goldmine nectarine

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.769 
ago this was the old goldmine nectarine
that<00:00:22.349> we<00:00:22.470> top<00:00:22.710> worked<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.189> four<00:00:23.759> other<00:00:23.970> white

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
that we top worked with four other white

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.359 
that we top worked with four other white
nectarine<00:00:25.320> varieties<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.910> looks<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.480> on

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
nectarine varieties and it looks like on

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.479 
nectarine varieties and it looks like on
Snow<00:00:29.369> Queen<00:00:29.550> all<00:00:29.910> three<00:00:30.240> grafts<00:00:30.689> took<00:00:30.900> on

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
Snow Queen all three grafts took on

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.490 
Snow Queen all three grafts took on
Arctic<00:00:32.489> Jay<00:00:33.210> all<00:00:33.420> three<00:00:33.690> graphs<00:00:33.989> took<00:00:34.290> on

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
Arctic Jay all three graphs took on

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.040 
Arctic Jay all three graphs took on
Arctic<00:00:34.980> Rose<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.610> two<00:00:35.790> took<00:00:36.030> had<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> little

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
Arctic Rose the two took had a little

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.780 
Arctic Rose the two took had a little
issue<00:00:37.199> with<00:00:37.379> Arctic<00:00:37.860> star<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.550> graphs

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
issue with Arctic star one of the graphs

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.229 
issue with Arctic star one of the graphs
is<00:00:39.059> missing<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.829> another<00:00:40.829> has<00:00:41.040> been<00:00:41.239> moved

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
is missing and another has been moved

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
is missing and another has been moved
over<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.930> looks<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.260> two<00:00:43.590> out<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
over so it looks like two out of the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.440 
over so it looks like two out of the
three<00:00:44.070> didn't<00:00:44.489> make<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> third<00:00:45.239> one

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
three didn't make it but the third one

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.750 
three didn't make it but the third one
came<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.780> okay<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> point

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
came out okay and at this point

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.630 
came out okay and at this point
two<00:00:48.059> months<00:00:48.360> after<00:00:48.510> grafting<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.399> don't<00:00:50.399> really

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
two months after grafting I don't really

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.220 
two months after grafting I don't really
think<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.030> there's<00:00:51.329> anything<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.989> want

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
think that there's anything that I want

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.010 
think that there's anything that I want
to<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.649> tree<00:00:52.949> I'm<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.340> maybe

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
to do to this tree I'm going to maybe

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.389 
to do to this tree I'm going to maybe
take<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> bags<00:00:55.379> off<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.710> rest<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.250> way

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
take the bags off the rest of the way

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.889 
take the bags off the rest of the way
they<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:56.789> really<00:00:56.910> need<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.329> anymore

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
they don't really need to be on anymore

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.579 
they don't really need to be on anymore
they<00:00:58.710> did<00:00:58.949> their<00:00:59.100> job<00:00:59.129> fine<00:01:02.870> let's<00:01:03.870> take<00:01:04.320> both

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
they did their job fine let's take both

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.050 
they did their job fine let's take both
of<00:01:04.649> those<00:01:04.920> off<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.160> might<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.850> take<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
of those off and I might just take a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.810 
of those off and I might just take a
look<00:01:09.300> at<00:01:09.509> the<00:01:09.690> graph<00:01:10.410> at<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.220> point<00:01:11.550> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
look at the graph at this point and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.969 
look at the graph at this point and
maybe<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.780> take<00:01:12.929> out<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> little<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
maybe just take out a little bit of the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.460 
maybe just take out a little bit of the
growth<00:01:14.420> that's<00:01:15.420> growing<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:16.050> toward<00:01:16.410> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
growth that's growing in toward the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.270 
growth that's growing in toward the
center<00:01:17.179> by<00:01:18.179> removing<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.840> growth<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.440> toward

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
center by removing this growth in toward

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.490 
center by removing this growth in toward
the<00:01:20.340> center<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:21.240> eliminate<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.289> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the center will eliminate a lot of the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.680 
the center will eliminate a lot of the
overcrowding<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.459> will<00:01:23.940> allow<00:01:24.179> the<00:01:24.240> tsiyon

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
overcrowding and will allow the tsiyon

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.139 
overcrowding and will allow the tsiyon
growth<00:01:25.050> to<00:01:25.289> come<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:25.890> make<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.399> nice<00:01:26.670> open

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
growth to come out and make a nice open

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.139 
growth to come out and make a nice open
form<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.599> this<00:01:27.750> variety<00:01:28.700> here<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.819> actually

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
form on this variety here we actually

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.880 
form on this variety here we actually
even<00:01:30.300> have<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.479> couple<00:01:30.720> little<00:01:30.929> fruit<00:01:31.319> set<00:01:31.770> in

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
even have a couple little fruit set in

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.760 
even have a couple little fruit set in
here<00:01:32.160> but<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.490> don't<00:01:32.700> necessarily<00:01:32.849> want<00:01:33.509> that

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
here but we don't necessarily want that

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.020 
here but we don't necessarily want that
so<00:01:34.770> we'll<00:01:34.920> pop<00:01:35.190> that<00:01:35.220> little<00:01:35.550> fruit<00:01:35.849> out<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
so we'll pop that little fruit out of

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.199 
so we'll pop that little fruit out of
there<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:37.130> open<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> center<00:01:38.580> on<00:01:38.819> this<00:01:38.970> one

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
there and open up the center on this one

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.290 
there and open up the center on this one
and<00:01:39.500> really<00:01:40.500> that's<00:01:41.220> about<00:01:41.459> all<00:01:41.819> I'm<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.239> to

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
and really that's about all I'm going to

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.389 
and really that's about all I'm going to
do<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.599> this<00:01:43.020> tree<00:01:43.229> right<00:01:43.380> now<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.160> have<00:01:44.190> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
do to this tree right now we do have a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.770 
do to this tree right now we do have a
little<00:01:44.910> bit<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.090> sucker<00:01:45.330> growth<00:01:45.599> that's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
little bit of sucker growth that's

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.150 
little bit of sucker growth that's
coming<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.200> right<00:01:46.470> from<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> base<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.099> the

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
coming down right from the base of the

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.550 
coming down right from the base of the
tree<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.640> actually<00:01:47.910> rootstock<00:01:48.630> below

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
tree and that's actually rootstock below

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.800 
tree and that's actually rootstock below
the<00:01:49.709> original<00:01:49.830> graft<00:01:50.459> so<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.239> this<00:01:51.390> time<00:01:51.599> it's

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the original graft so at this time it's

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.680 
the original graft so at this time it's
probably<00:01:51.929> not<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> bad<00:01:52.440> idea<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:53.069> to<00:01:53.690> remove

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
probably not a bad idea just to remove

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.730 
probably not a bad idea just to remove
that<00:01:55.700> right<00:01:56.700> at<00:01:56.789> ground<00:01:57.030> level

the tree now we'll come back again and

months and at that time we'll probably

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.080 
months and at that time we'll probably
remove<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.740> considerable<00:02:16.460> amount<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.820> growth

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
on the nurse branch we may even

on the nurse branch we may even
completely<00:02:19.459> remove<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.970> nurse<00:02:20.120> branch<00:02:20.450> if

that time we may make the decision to
remove<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.490> graft<00:02:31.730> or<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.120> make<00:02:32.480> sure<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.750> we

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
remove a graft or to make sure that we

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.680 
remove a graft or to make sure that we

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
depending on how much top we have we may

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.400 
depending on how much top we have we may
even<00:02:37.850> pinch<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.690> tips<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.050> some<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.350> the

even pinch the tips on some of the

grafts and get them to start branching

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.060 
grafts and get them to start branching
