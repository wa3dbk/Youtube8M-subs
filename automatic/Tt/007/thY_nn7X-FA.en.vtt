I'm<00:01:55.700> not<00:01:56.030> sure<00:01:56.240> why<00:01:56.539> these<00:01:57.470> are<00:01:57.710> really<00:01:57.950> easy

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
I'm not sure why these are really easy

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.249 
I'm not sure why these are really easy
to<00:01:58.280> read<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.729> see<00:01:59.000> all<00:01:59.929> the<00:02:00.050> same

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
informations and the UK books than they

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.300

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
are in the US version so the artwork I

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.810 
are in the US version so the artwork I
think<00:02:07.579> is<00:02:08.860> why<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:09.890> like<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.190> artwork<00:02:10.519> on<00:02:10.640> these

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
but alright is better because the actual

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.430 
but alright is better because the actual

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.330 
four books so what's a cool cold case
and<00:02:54.610> it's<00:02:55.330> almost<00:02:55.810> it's<00:02:56.410> just<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.680> little<00:02:57.220> bit

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
and it's almost it's just a little bit

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.300 
and it's almost it's just a little bit
bigger<00:02:57.550> than<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.910> soft<00:02:58.860> covers<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.010> US

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
bigger than the soft covers the US

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.210 
bigger than the soft covers the US
version<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:02.320> I<00:03:02.380> thought<00:03:02.560> these<00:03:02.710> were<00:03:02.920> kind<00:03:03.160> of

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
version so I thought these were kind of

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:10.590 
version so I thought these were kind of
neat<00:03:05.610> kick-out<00:03:06.610> seeing<00:03:07.590> those
