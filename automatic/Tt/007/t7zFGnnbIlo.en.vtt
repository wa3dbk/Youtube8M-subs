and watching films
from<00:00:39.660> Ravencroft<00:00:40.660> I<00:00:41.020> think<00:00:41.230> that's<00:00:41.350> what<00:00:41.500> it

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
from Ravencroft I think that's what it

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.439 
from Ravencroft I think that's what it
is<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:42.370> then<00:00:42.489> do<00:00:42.699> you<00:00:42.820> hookers<00:00:43.149> get<00:00:43.840> up

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
is and then do you hookers get up

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.970 
is and then do you hookers get up

by the invisible man he's going on a
bombing<00:00:48.339> spree<00:00:48.940> I<00:00:49.210> thought<00:00:50.050> Ravencroft<00:00:50.649> will
