we've<00:01:57.600> actually<00:01:57.750> got<00:01:58.020> leg<00:01:58.259> extenders<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
we've actually got leg extenders on the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.859 
we've actually got leg extenders on the
front<00:01:59.369> here<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.090> other<00:02:00.210> words<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.570> calf

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
front here so in other words that calf

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.219 
front here so in other words that calf
support<00:02:01.350> comes<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.719> what<00:02:03.719> will<00:02:03.869> happen

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
support comes right up what will happen

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.050 
support comes right up what will happen
is<00:02:04.350> probably<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.860> until<00:02:05.130> about<00:02:05.219> 12<00:02:05.640> months

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
is probably up until about 12 months

want to be nice and comfy and not little
dangly<00:02:10.590> legs<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.459> then<00:02:11.610> when<00:02:11.760> we<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:12.000> old

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
dangly legs but then when we are old

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.190 
dangly legs but then when we are old
enough<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.780> can

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
enough that we can

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.559 
enough that we can
some<00:02:13.440> more<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.340> drops<00:02:14.640> down<00:02:14.760> feet<00:02:15.270> can<00:02:15.450> go

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
some more that drops down feet can go

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.000 
some more that drops down feet can go
onto<00:02:15.690> here<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.349> got<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.650> padded

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
onto here you have got that padded

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.860 
onto here you have got that padded
support<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.670> car<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.239> much<00:02:18.450> comfier

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
support on the car so it's much comfier

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.630 
support on the car so it's much comfier
adjustable<00:02:21.870> wheels<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.739> we<00:02:22.769> can<00:02:23.069> put<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.459> on

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
adjustable wheels so we can put that on

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.729 
adjustable wheels so we can put that on
to<00:02:23.819> swivel<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:24.959> releasing<00:02:25.620> that

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
to swivel so it's just releasing that

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.250 
to swivel so it's just releasing that
part<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.489> will<00:02:26.730> want<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.090> facility<00:02:27.900> if

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
part of you will want that facility if

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.229 
part of you will want that facility if
when<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.890> go<00:02:29.040> around<00:02:29.220> store<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:30.000> want<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
when you go around store so you want the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.990 
when you go around store so you want the
maneuverability<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:30.959> get<00:02:31.200> in<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.500> out<00:02:31.590> easily

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
maneuverability to get in and out easily

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.339 
maneuverability to get in and out easily
but<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:33.090> we<00:02:33.180> are<00:02:33.330> going<00:02:33.599> on<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.840> off-roading

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
but if we are going on that off-roading

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.930 
but if we are going on that off-roading
we've<00:02:34.680> always<00:02:34.830> said<00:02:35.160> about<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.489> wheels<00:02:35.670> being

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
we've always said about the wheels being

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.940 
we've always said about the wheels being
a<00:02:35.970> little<00:02:36.180> bit<00:02:36.269> chunkier<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.380> if<00:02:37.620> we're<00:02:37.830> going

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
a little bit chunkier so if we're going

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.580 
a little bit chunkier so if we're going
anywhere<00:02:38.160> like<00:02:38.550> grass<00:02:38.910> gravel<00:02:39.599> cobbles<00:02:40.380> or

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
anywhere like grass gravel cobbles or

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.680 
anywhere like grass gravel cobbles or
sand<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.819> locked<00:02:42.000> off<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.420> gives<00:02:42.569> you

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
sand have it locked off it gives you

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.130 
sand have it locked off it gives you
much<00:02:42.959> much<00:02:43.200> better<00:02:43.379> suspension<00:02:45.019> you've<00:02:46.019> got<00:02:46.110> a

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
much much better suspension you've got a

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.080 
much much better suspension you've got a
storage<00:02:46.500> basket<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.099> bottom<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.640> you'll
