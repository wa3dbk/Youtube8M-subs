00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.320
 I have been a bit difficult for a year 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.620
 probably the most difficult year 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.680
 career 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.090
 2014 hadn't started badly either 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.650
 however it did not start misbehaving not 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.370
 I still want to complain about why 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.340
 alive in the first month gone 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.960
 quite well especially online 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.239
 I also did a great live lightening 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.720
 now in February I had a month off 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.420
 even 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.489
 so there can also be and now March 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.440
 started recently so maybe we hope 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.860
 to do something 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:58.250
 well here it goes venice pt blob lola e 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.739
 roller that are already day 2 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.699
 I had done about a year and a half 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.040
 make a change in my cards ie 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.130
 I had increased the number of people a little 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.800
 tournaments I played every day 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.750
 honestly I've never been a 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.730
 great nerd even with video games not 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.740
 I've never been a lover so I don't have 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.500
 this predisposition to multi tabling 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.900
 extreme that is what I know when I talk with 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.240
 rocco sometimes tells me no because of it 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.250
 good 30x I could really go 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.020
 bad if the headache is to have 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.660
 I don't know how amazing it is 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.540
 so anyway I try to always open 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.030
 twenty tournaments a night is mine 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.780
 aiea a game is always maintained even with 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.270
 the 13 bring us 15x at the same time 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.550
 then when it happens especially the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.960
 Sunday that maybe you have some tables 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.450
 in addition 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.270
 let's say by a little indie game but it succeeds 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.409
 I still manage to follow them on social networks 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.340
 network 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.770
 I have always been passionate about myself 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.890
 immediately created a character at the beginning 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.740
 the hunting leon hound dominator 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.750
 who was genuinely complaining was a bit 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.910
 dictated by wanting to create the character 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.950
 a little because in the beginning however like 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.870
 everyone didn't know the game well 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.810
 however the variance that really does 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.569
 then everything else exists at the beginning 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.410
 really believed maybe he was 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.079
 abnormal take that I know 20 30 purposes 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.989
 and session now we have calluses 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.450
 after 45 years it is now you know that 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.579
 normality has always been very annoying and 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.920
 we are there always let's say curse though 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.370
 basically we know it is part 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.859
 of the game especially live 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.900
 we could play a whole life and 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.920
 never arrive despite maybe the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.190
 our game is profitable or otherwise 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.420
 decent so let's say that as said 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.359
 a little while ago but we hope for 2014 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.670
 I'd like to do a nice live result 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.510
 storage took me well there 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.430
 I also try to be very good friends 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.959
 for me jokes often joke about 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.150
 because anyway I know he is a lot 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.889
 convinced of himself, however, he is 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.930
 taking advantage of this as well 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.340
 I did at the beginning with the part of the human 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.450
 of being wine 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.920
 well I for myself have always been a 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.530
 quite humble person however not 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.290
 I was never afraid I am sure of it 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.000
 my approach to the game and I don't feel 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.349
 better than none but I don't feel 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.170
 lower than none 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.610
 that is to say in the sense I will tell you when I am 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.590
 gone the first year and gas 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.280
 I attended a table that I believe 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:49.050
 perhaps it was the most difficult table there 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.550
 my career where i had there is a libori 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.019
 mcdonald and two other friends their reg 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.519
 of the strongest online that in this 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.340
 moment I don't remember in the names or nick 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.380
 but they were just the two super hard ones well you 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.750
 I must say that for me it was also one 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.600
 big confidence boost to be those 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.790
 levels at that table and not hear 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.380
 then so much pressure or 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.290
 however that difference already exists 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.450
 they are human like us this was one 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.069
 great satisfaction for me though 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.169
 clearly I'm not the type who wants 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.720
 to say the ride to me is stronger than 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.300
 all absolutely not even because I say 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.940
 more than anything I always try to do 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.100
 talk results then in the moment in 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.919
 which should also begin to win 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:34.000
 maybe I could say I'm happy but 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.400
 a sentence of the will never come out 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.600
 kind nor jokingly in earnest 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.449
 then you never know 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.419
 regarding titan 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.059
 most likely we will renew it because 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.860
 in my contract it will expire in April 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.180
 been said so we'll talk about it later 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.830
 quietly because a great one 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.659
 relationship with them we are great 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.999
 family so I don't think there are any 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:58.479
 problems and then then waited for me 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:05:00.639
 definitely another year with titan e 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.879
 I hope it's better than last year 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.589
 also because they also want to repay 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.909
 this trust they gave me 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:08.909
 so we hope good
