00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.970 

and<00:03:45.769> before<00:03:46.769> previously<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.700> did<00:03:48.030> have<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.379> I<00:03:49.379> was

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
and before previously I did have a I was

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.899 
and before previously I did have a I was
running<00:03:50.280> an<00:03:50.370> EA<00:03:50.519> t<00:03:50.640> 4<00:03:51.709> processor<00:03:52.709> with<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:52.980> 5770

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
running an EA t 4 processor with a 5770

00:03:53.909 --> 00:04:02.600 
running an EA t 4 processor with a 5770
and<00:03:56.299> okay<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.810> was<00:03:57.989> pretty<00:03:58.170> jittery<00:04:01.610> this

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
and okay it was pretty jittery this

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.670 
and okay it was pretty jittery this
coverage<00:04:02.940> really<00:04:03.239> this<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:04.019> a<00:04:04.140> step<00:04:04.470> up

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
coverage really this is really a step up

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.620 
coverage really this is really a step up
for<00:04:04.950> me

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.740 

and<00:04:09.200> I<00:04:09.290> did<00:04:09.770> buy<00:04:10.280> this<00:04:10.340> off<00:04:10.820> of<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.270> EVGA

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
and I did buy this off of the EVGA

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:19.420 
and I did buy this off of the EVGA
website<00:04:12.820> four<00:04:13.820> hundred<00:04:14.090> twenty<00:04:14.180> nine<00:04:14.480> dollars

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.650 

and<00:04:19.699> the<00:04:20.479> case<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:21.250> at<00:04:22.250> right<00:04:22.400> now<00:04:22.430> 17<00:04:23.090> frames<00:04:23.419> a

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
and the case is at right now 17 frames a

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.850 
and the case is at right now 17 frames a
second<00:04:24.020> 17.2

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.459 

now<00:04:30.400> okay<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:30.879> case<00:04:31.330> that<00:04:31.629> this<00:04:32.560> is<00:04:32.830> an<00:04:33.129> is<00:04:33.580> a

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:34.469 
now okay the case that this is an is a

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:41.519 
now okay the case that this is an is a
silverstone<00:04:35.469> raven

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:41.529 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:46.519 

r<00:04:41.649> vo<00:04:42.399> tu<00:04:42.549> e<00:04:42.969> I<00:04:43.889> guess<00:04:44.889> this<00:04:45.069> is<00:04:45.219> the<00:04:45.249> second

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:46.529 
r vo tu e I guess this is the second

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:50.179 
r vo tu e I guess this is the second
generation<00:04:47.529> of<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.159> that<00:04:48.759> particular<00:04:49.179> line

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:50.189 
generation of the that particular line

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
generation of the that particular line
that<00:04:51.189> seemed<00:04:51.399> to<00:04:51.429> be<00:04:51.579> a<00:04:51.609> pretty<00:04:51.669> nice<00:04:51.969> case

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:52.209 
that seemed to be a pretty nice case

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:54.719 
that seemed to be a pretty nice case
this<00:04:52.719> video<00:04:53.319> card<00:04:53.619> is<00:04:53.979> eleven<00:04:54.549> and<00:04:54.639> a<00:04:54.699> half

this video card is eleven and a half

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.439 
this video card is eleven and a half
inches<00:04:55.269> long<00:04:55.509> and<00:04:56.699> yeah<00:04:57.699> it<00:04:57.849> was<00:04:57.969> pretty<00:04:58.149> long

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
inches long and yeah it was pretty long

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.899 
inches long and yeah it was pretty long
