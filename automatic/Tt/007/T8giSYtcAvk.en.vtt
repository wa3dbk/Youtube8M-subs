00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hi girls, I hope you are 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.500
 I like my videos and I have to 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.019
 record one more for you a tutorial of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.630
 How to prepare my skin is not that I use 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.580
 in my day to day but sure is that I 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 I usually go out to the mall for 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.910
 example of a much lighter thing as well 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.939
 light that I think can give you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.830
 adapt at any time ok then no 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.260
 call half sleep because today 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.310
 Sunday I made the enem 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.769
 in these two days then we are really 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.329
 Exalts but I could not stop coming here. 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.190
 give it to you 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.309
 So let's talk let's start with 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.309
 An opposite is that I'm going to spread 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.370
 always starts at the forehead because it is 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.690
 a voice and then zhu plunged the part 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.770
 What else is shining is this zone t 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.760
 Let's go there as always, everything for her. 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.460
 the bush complaint 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.740
 I think that's what matters least to me. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:12.090
 besides pop the translucent pas always the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.430
 12 too or a darker to tune 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.619
 my daughter cry then makes 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.380
 But it's always good, right for her. 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.020
 What do we give more then? 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.830
 after that, the first one ok I hope he 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.990
 dry a bit and I do good that is unb 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.729
 to give the lips that I am 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.799
 seeing today is iof is very good 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.680
 the use of gasoline also more gasoline 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.619
 I always take the lipstick off and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.170
 hence you do not have to take 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.600
 so after me after these two 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.790
 first steps I come with the basis on 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.240
 if I am using a liquid from 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.790
 story I stay on the mac and she leaves 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.940
 you pick up the vine so if you have too much 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.340
 spine or not spotting 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.530
 the use of it or if you can change it is 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.330
 Always good to pass a corrective said 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.570
 but how do not want to talk about something very 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:13.390
 heavy I just do it with a brush 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.100
 the two- tape fire case that leaves the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.870
 much lighter moment 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.940
 I 'm going to start, too. He has mine. 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.760
 forehead that's where I have the most stain 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.760
 I've been looking at the entire face 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.180
 liked 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.590
 may be a bit whiter because 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.590
 I'm using two lamps 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.650
 there always do a little as such if 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.890
 You felt a little difference. 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.190
 noticed in the tonality depending on the neckline 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:59.140
 of your clothes but that's basically it 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.600
 it can be applied to the base I do not 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.550
 I like to spend a colorful powder kind of 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.140
 according to tone of my skin always do 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.950
 a translucent one that most committed 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:13.000
 even oiliness I'll use a qe3 cable 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:17.560
 here's a cute little tire I think 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.370
 it gives more firmness and leaves more but not 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.209
 I know how to say even compact cross is difficult 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.800
 explain 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.160
 I have to wait for the first base of 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:34.450
 Cocoa is the old woman's quick noticing me. 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:37.230
 I come with him in the zone where he is more 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.230
 my face 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.160
 Can you see I realize that I leave. 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:52.780
 not much happens here because I 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:57.300
 I come with a darker liner than the 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.300
 my land a brush but XATA dinha 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:12.570
 she just for the rosinha to be with this 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.570
 very pale face 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:28.130
 also passed in the drawing 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.590
 and in my optics a tip for you 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.139
 other 16 curves here but when 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.620
 separate apply the old begins at the root 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.750
 Eyelashes come in half and then only 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.440
 it was not only at the tip of the eyes of the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.270
 eyelashes 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.000
 it will leave more crooked will not let 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.490
 that broken thing half a tire I 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.919
 I always spend a mascara to the test. 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.780
 In case I have used this mega lot 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:55.639
 flash of the mother on the same line as he is 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.729
 very good 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:02.150
 is it does not leave the children hard and to the test 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.380
 water plus the given curvature 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.150
 by corvette 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:11.180
 Ok let's go I always leave the mascara for 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.300
 last to enter do not get a 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.620
 poof of blush or cabbage and illuminator 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.099
 this things 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:23.419
 understood and one of walks is you weigh 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:26.630
 pencil 6b of the same arts class in 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.820
 Serious eyebrow is really good, I'll go 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.460
 teaching for you I always see the 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.990
 first where my shadow ends otherwise 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.630
 would have to end up with beer 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.430
 If you go to see I have a little 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.430
 I come from the corner 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.120
 It leaves you with a very natural effect if you 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.379
 have the shadow that is very clear I 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.379
 I do not know if it will have this same effect 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.930
 repeat the same thing from the other side 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.800
 so I do not think it's basically this 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.330
 What I do in my day to day life I hope 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.130

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.350

 Sunscreen to go out in daylight 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.430
 in a couple of things law is important to do 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.650
 if they protect the skin 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.170
 so that's it girls the tutorial of today 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.740
