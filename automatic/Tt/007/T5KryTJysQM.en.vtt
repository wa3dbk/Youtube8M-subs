 year to diesel engines compared to the petrol version 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.650
 but for the younger multitude to gain power from 60 to 70 horses 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.560
 slightly performance 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.570
 its top speed increase to 150 kilometers an hour against 145 in version 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.270
 gasoline 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.320
 as for acceleration and gains 2 seconds on the 0 to 100

 kilometers per hour 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.010
 but its main attraction and its much higher torque and especially 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.580
 available much earlier but they will come back to test this part the 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.940
 range 4 on his favorite playground we left in snow class 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.200
 after climbing the week after the scene

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.659
 difficult to recognize the source the source of vbc wellne she 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.150
 on the road despite suspensions a little closes the door to 4 4 and comfortable 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.420
 thanks to its permanent all-wheel drive the car is very 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.300
 comfortable whatever the conditions of adherence in normal conditions the 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.610
 power is transmitted to 98% on the front wheels 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.020
 the differential went up to the central couplers allows to transfer 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.760
 automatically the torque on the rear wheels in case of loss of grip 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.150
 equipped with disc brakes at the front as well as at the back plus more than one abs

 the panda 4 4 multi-room reveals a southern efficiency behavior 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.030
 in terms of safety the car gets a blow from the airbag the

 device 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.090

 that accentuates the maximum and nervous assistance and grc panda is revealed 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.050
 very nice to drive in the mountains especially on my cheeks these reactions 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.190
 are very healthy 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.460
 attention however 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.489
 the car just waiting to play we quickly tend to want to have fun too 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:18.149
 to have fun better put them on track dirt road then 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.959
 niger stand 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.859
 the attempt that made his class to all conditions 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.459
 and the more it gets complicated 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.529
 the more they redouble their efforts to prove its effectiveness 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:27.769
 she is simply 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.769
 bluffing 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.509
 equipped with mixed tires m plus c is 185 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:40.419
 enough in most cases the panda 4 4 a line can receive in 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.439
 free option 265 off-road tires 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.339
 the main attraction of the diesel engine and its torque of 145 thousand tons

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.839
 available from 1500 rpm swami all rather than version 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:09.009
 gasoline that falls well in any terrain it is precisely at low speed that we 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:12.009
 needs this couple to face the obstacles 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.129
 all bluffing what she learns at 4 4 still has some limitations 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:22.409
 its attacked angles of exits and crossing respectively 24 42 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.409
 and 24 degrees 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:29.649
 its degree of steepness of 50% 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.599
 but it is especially its ground clearance which is a problem although raised by 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.749
 compared to the panda with 165 millimeters it remains limited for a 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:39.229
 All Terrain 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:43.549
 the evidence on these paths the panda tends to play the snow plow 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.769
 but what is good about the panda is that it is often enough to 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.450
 take a little more momentum so that she eventually gets through 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.450
 demonstration 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.309
 Chaz invincible the panda qatar but not so m 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:17.340
 its small diesel block of 130 kilos although we endow with particulate filters 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.500
 but does not exceed the 141 grams per kilometer resignation of its guests 2 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.630
 we are far from the emissions of big 4 4 or even some sedans in terms 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.880
 consumption diesel engine is still reasonable here with 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.880
 five titles three per 100 km in mixed cycle 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:45.840
 side look the cheekbone 4 play it discreet our version to the devil 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 stands out from her little sister held by her elevated ground clearance 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.090
 its wide black plastic side protectors that connect the front to 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.309
 the back of the car 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:56.029
 passing through the wheel arch 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.740
 and these specific front and rear shields 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.960
 these even make the panda look 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.190
 3 meters 50 cm length in version than another model 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.499
 against 3 meters 50 3 in two-wheel drive version 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:12.709
 inside no revolution we find the interior of the panda with 16 

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:13.949
 7 million colors 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.949
 and its plastic dashboard 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.400
 visit this opposition among others 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.770
 manual and standard air conditioning 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.770
 and the steering wheel receives the controls of the car radio cd 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.120
 a few small ones with 206 cubic decimetres the chest of this for the 4 4 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.789
 welcome without problem all our material 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.639
 once the rear seat folded 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.699
 the volume cleared reaches 775 6 meters lower 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.229
 small handy agile cute seven years the class 4 is so simply 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.900
 impressive 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.020
 proposed to 14 50 euros in basic version 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.280
 and about 1550 euros in pingping version it only has a real fault the 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.910
 size of his tank only 30 liters for the rest the kaka panda all 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:07.909
 little throw is that of happiness
