and the lemon rind is that it helps
we've<00:01:33.270> low<00:01:33.720> pectin<00:01:34.110> fruits<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.679> gem<00:01:34.920> to

00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:35.099 
we've low pectin fruits for the gem to

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:40.040 
we've low pectin fruits for the gem to
see<00:01:37.009> right<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.160> this<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:38.700> boiling<00:01:38.910> now<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.990> I'll

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
see right up this is boiling now so I'll

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.149 
see right up this is boiling now so I'll
just<00:01:40.200> reduce<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.649> heat<00:01:40.800> a<00:01:41.390> bit

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:02:12.000 

take<00:01:48.159> these<00:01:48.340> lemon<00:01:48.610> rinds<00:01:48.820> out

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.530 

now<00:02:12.520> you're<00:02:12.700> going<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.849> keep<00:02:13.030> staring<00:02:13.270> this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
now you're going to keep staring this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.830 
now you're going to keep staring this
for<00:02:13.660> about<00:02:13.750> another<00:02:13.930> 20<00:02:14.230> minutes<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:16.599> sugar

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
for about another 20 minutes the sugar

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.890 
for about another 20 minutes the sugar
will<00:02:17.019> help<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.319> fruit<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.650> break<00:02:17.860> down<00:02:21.900> those

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
will help the fruit to break down those

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.390 
will help the fruit to break down those
constants<00:02:23.440> during<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.860> winter<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.129> make<00:02:24.280> sure

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
constants during the winter to make sure

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.320 
constants during the winter to make sure
it<00:02:24.519> doesn't<00:02:24.760> boil<00:02:24.879> over

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.880 

so<00:02:31.840> I'll<00:02:31.930> come<00:02:32.080> back<00:02:32.230> when<00:02:32.380> this<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.680> almost

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
so I'll come back when this is almost

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:42.030 
so I'll come back when this is almost
ready<00:02:34.740> I'll<00:02:35.740> show<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.100> how<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.340> test<00:02:36.580> for<00:02:36.760> chill

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.730 

all<00:02:43.040> right<00:02:43.220> we're<00:02:43.340> almost<00:02:43.430> done<00:02:43.790> now<00:02:44.740> another

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
all right we're almost done now another

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.610 
all right we're almost done now another
good<00:02:45.950> indicator<00:02:46.960> when<00:02:47.960> your<00:02:48.080> games<00:02:48.290> about

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
good indicator when your games about

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.020 
good indicator when your games about
done<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:50.420> visually<00:02:51.520> you<00:02:52.520> can<00:02:52.550> see<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.790> lot<00:02:53.000> of

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
done is visually you can see a lot of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.660 
done is visually you can see a lot of
foam<00:02:53.390> has<00:02:53.600> settled<00:02:53.840> down<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:57.280> lot<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.430> fruit

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
foam has settled down a lot of the fruit

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:07.140 
foam has settled down a lot of the fruit
is<00:02:58.880> broken<00:02:59.120> down

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.660 

when<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.810> juice<00:03:07.989> isn't<00:03:08.200> all<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.440> running

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.920 

now<00:03:16.670> what<00:03:16.820> I'm<00:03:16.910> going<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.180> do<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.450> test<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.810> this

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
now what I'm going to do to test it this

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.770 
now what I'm going to do to test it this
is<00:03:18.140> set<00:03:19.030> I've<00:03:20.030> got<00:03:20.210> a<00:03:20.240> cold<00:03:20.540> plate<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.660> I'll

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
is set I've got a cold plate and I'll

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.190 
is set I've got a cold plate and I'll
just<00:03:23.960> drop<00:03:24.110> some<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.530> jam<00:03:24.980> on<00:03:25.010> there<00:03:26.200> and

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
just drop some of the jam on there and

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.150 
just drop some of the jam on there and
let<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.470> sit<00:03:27.740> for<00:03:27.770> a<00:03:27.920> minute<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:29.830> lot<00:03:30.830> of<00:03:30.920> people

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
let it sit for a minute a lot of people

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.920 
let it sit for a minute a lot of people
say<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.340> take<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:31.940> jam<00:03:32.150> off<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.450> heat<00:03:32.690> while

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
say to take the jam off the heat while

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.790 
say to take the jam off the heat while
you're<00:03:33.490> testing<00:03:34.490> I<00:03:35.380> figure<00:03:36.380> it's<00:03:36.500> only<00:03:36.590> for<00:03:36.770> a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
you're testing I figure it's only for a

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.610 
you're testing I figure it's only for a
minute<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.280> it's<00:03:38.150> not<00:03:38.210> going<00:03:38.360> to<00:03:38.450> make<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.530> that

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
minute so it's not going to make it that

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.560 
minute so it's not going to make it that
much<00:03:39.680> worse

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
much worse
