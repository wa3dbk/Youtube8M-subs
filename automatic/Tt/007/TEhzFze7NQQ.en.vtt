00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.270
 this stream of calm waters that 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.140
 brawn descends media 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:29.490
 jacarezinho carandás here on top of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:32.809
 mountaineer saw in conceição do mato 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.700
 inside what is born the rio santo santo 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.960
 one of the most important of the river basin 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.090
 goals 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.160
 google flock to the large number of 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.980
 fish in the mix that exist only 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.309
 here and we can see the Atlantic forest 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.399
 still well preserved does training 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.260
 but the pressure is already on 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.730
 present her recent vote of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.350
 eucalyptus 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:13.010
 I've killed myself and you're already well 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.810
 near the source a risk that is seen 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.979
 in the entire area of ​​the source of the holy river 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.170
 antônio 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:32.759
 this region is a region of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:34.829
 National integration is sweet a bowl 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.220
 federal 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.829
 the holy antônio is the water of greater 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.899
 today in the Solimões basin and is 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.200
 a water recharge region of three 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.790
 large federal basins 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.820
 it would be very important to create a 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.430
 fan of conservation unit that is 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.620
 including the limits of 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.380
 marine containment 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.370
 from an initial proposal for a park 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.040
 state 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.990
 in this unit with relationships when what 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.679
 still needs to be remodeled 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.170
 You already see some occupations in 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.020
 small properties 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.900
 a subsistence agriculture but the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.120
 people already notice the presence of 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.170
 monoculture of eucalyptus and 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.540
 mainly block and beyond 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.160
 natural pastures that are used to 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.640
 extensive cattle raising 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.380
 the purpose of a conservation unit 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.239
 Mantena natural processes 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:44.730
 biodiversity is a fragile ecosystem and 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.730
 that his vocation is to keep it that way. 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.930
 I have solved this part of the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.780
 The river is still clean 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.689
 city ​​to receive sewage or anything 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.909
 Mining still can fish a lot here 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:12.579
 then it is the river show is considers that it is 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:14.200
 important for people here to us 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.629
 sees that many people still pass on the island 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.609
 boat still transport has to be 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.510
 just life still very quiet around here 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.629
 it is not 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:28.450
 the waters are crystal clear, do not you think 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:31.180
 that this is not even where the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.450
 fish only exists here on the river including right 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.280
 and I was saying here of the great that 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.370
 do not you think so 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.730
 I was just a little puppy and I think 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.329
 likes to be with him has many 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.400
 rapids to it river level 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.639
 The embassy is not much 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:59.470
 just think that this could hurt the psd - 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:04:02.290
 rapids, I have to say that 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.760
 He won the cup with myself 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.760
 I just think you can take me forever. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.430
 is one of several sewage 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.759
 mexico and the streets here of irons and descents 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.759
 directly 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.289
 to the rio santo santo 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.910
 in this other one ready here of the city of 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.850
 irons 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:42.820
 the sewage is released becoming a 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:48.680
 small stream runs between waste trash 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:53.330
 directly to one of the kidneys have the 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.030
 biodiversity and at the same time 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:01.780
 unique time 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.780
 here in minas gerais is the river soturno 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.389
 ah
