 guilds still have a battle between guilds 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:07.710
 for some territories also in this game 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.200
 there is a good wiki 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.140
 but she is still in the development process of course 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.860
 there are not all the articles you need 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:24.970

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:29.380
 learn for example the level of sharpening what 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:32.890

 also there are a lot of things 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.060
 more precisely even things quest 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.169
 which can get some easy 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.169
 some difficult 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:06.530
 plus there is sulfur for beginners 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:10.900
 for example exchanging shards on each role 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:17.110

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:21.620

 hikes i like this arena better 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:12.099
 there is no need for a shower engine 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.099
 in a strange place, wait until the bosses come out 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:22.030

 which you can ride can be an example 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:09.990

 the game is very colorful 

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:57.140
