00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
do is hit him with force imbalance which

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.129 
do is hit him with force imbalance which
is<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.209> only<00:03:07.269> ability<00:03:07.599> I've<00:03:07.720> got<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.019> can

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
is the only ability I've got that can

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.660 
is the only ability I've got that can
sort<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.380> hidden<00:03:08.560> even<00:03:08.920> at<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.130> long<00:03:09.370> range

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
sort of hidden even at that long range

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.009 
sort of hidden even at that long range
and<00:03:10.000> that's<00:03:10.180> going<00:03:10.359> to<00:03:10.420> suck<00:03:10.599> some<00:03:10.630> of<00:03:10.870> his

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
and that's going to suck some of his

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.330 
and that's going to suck some of his
life<00:03:11.170> away<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.590> give<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:11.950> me<00:03:12.069> and

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
life away and give it to me and

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.800 
life away and give it to me and
hopefully<00:03:13.030> that'll<00:03:13.329> help<00:03:13.450> me<00:03:13.630> get<00:03:13.780> through

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
hopefully that'll help me get through

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.839 
hopefully that'll help me get through
that<00:03:14.019> first<00:03:14.230> server<00:03:14.470> spike<00:03:14.739> of<00:03:14.889> damage<00:03:15.250> then

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
that first server spike of damage then

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.259 
that first server spike of damage then
I'll<00:03:16.000> hit<00:03:16.209> for<00:03:16.510> speed<00:03:16.810> I'll<00:03:17.169> run<00:03:17.470> up<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:18.010> and

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
I'll hit for speed I'll run up to it and

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.240 
I'll hit for speed I'll run up to it and
then<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:19.599> advantage<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:20.380> gone<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
then that advantage is it's gone the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.949 
then that advantage is it's gone the
agent<00:03:21.549> has<00:03:21.669> a<00:03:21.700> has<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.180> tools<00:03:22.480> at<00:03:22.870> his

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
agent has a has the tools at his

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.539 
agent has a has the tools at his
disposal<00:03:23.019> he<00:03:23.620> has<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.950> know<00:03:24.040> is<00:03:24.400> a

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
disposal he has you know is a

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.720 
disposal he has you know is a
short-range<00:03:25.060> done<00:03:25.480> he<00:03:25.930> has<00:03:26.109> a<00:03:26.139> flashbang<00:03:26.799> so<00:03:27.430> I

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
short-range done he has a flashbang so I

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.259 
short-range done he has a flashbang so I
what<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.120> want<00:03:28.359> to<00:03:28.510> do<00:03:28.660> is<00:03:28.840> cause<00:03:29.769> him<00:03:30.069> to<00:03:30.519> think

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
what I want to do is cause him to think

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.259 
what I want to do is cause him to think
that<00:03:32.019> he's<00:03:32.200> winning<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:33.310> encountered<00:03:33.819> him<00:03:33.970> an

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
that he's winning and encountered him an

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.870 
that he's winning and encountered him an
agent<00:03:34.660> always<00:03:35.079> wins<00:03:35.380> with<00:03:35.650> preparation<00:03:36.340> close

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
agent always wins with preparation close

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.440 
agent always wins with preparation close
but<00:03:37.299> I<00:03:37.329> think

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
but I think

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.869 
but I think
obviously<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.560> agent<00:03:39.920> console<00:03:40.790> is

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
obviously the agent console is

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:55.070 
obviously the agent console is
definitely<00:03:41.209> going<00:03:41.330> to<00:03:41.390> live

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.140
