00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
thing about this glitch is if I move out

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.080 
thing about this glitch is if I move out

you how to get in this glitch because i

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.990 
you how to get in this glitch because i
do<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.770> want<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> get<00:01:08.220> patched<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.850> don't

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
do not want it to get patched I don't

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.580 
do not want it to get patched I don't
know<00:01:09.060> if<00:01:09.119> that's<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.479> me<00:01:09.630> being<00:01:09.659> paranoid<00:01:09.990> I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
know if that's just me being paranoid I

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.350 
know if that's just me being paranoid I
don't<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.340> would<00:01:11.460> actually<00:01:11.610> go<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
don't know if they would actually go and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
don't know if they would actually go and
do<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.590> don't<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> risk<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
do that but I don't want to risk it

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.219 
do that but I don't want to risk it
because<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.820> way<00:01:15.509> too<00:01:15.570> much<00:01:15.689> fun<00:01:16.340> as<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> saw

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
because it's way too much fun as you saw

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.020 
because it's way too much fun as you saw
it<00:01:19.229> was<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.100> zombie<00:01:20.460> was<00:01:20.580> close<00:01:20.759> enough

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it was the one zombie was close enough

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.190 
it was the one zombie was close enough
that<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> killed<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> i<00:01:21.900> could<00:01:22.049> actually

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that when I killed it i could actually

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.870 
that when I killed it i could actually
get<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.650> max<00:01:23.070> ammo<00:01:23.549> without<00:01:24.360> leaving<00:01:25.880> here

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
get the max ammo without leaving here

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880 
get the max ammo without leaving here
you<00:01:27.030> can't<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.390> walk<00:01:27.869> out<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.650> by<00:01:28.829> the
