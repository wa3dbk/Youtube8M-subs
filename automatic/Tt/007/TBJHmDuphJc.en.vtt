of Z bend pliers well they're starting
to<00:00:42.520> get<00:00:42.610> a<00:00:42.670> little<00:00:42.850> rusty<00:00:43.270> it's<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.050> neglected

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
of like three times in the 20 years that

of like three times in the 20 years that
I've<00:00:49.750> had<00:00:50.050> it<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:51.040> concept<00:00:51.670> is<00:00:51.940> pretty

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
I've had it the concept is pretty

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.270 
I've had it the concept is pretty
interesting<00:00:53.110> I<00:00:53.200> mean<00:00:53.350> it's<00:00:53.469> pretty<00:00:53.800> neat<00:00:54.070> you

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
interesting I mean it's pretty neat you

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.959 
interesting I mean it's pretty neat you
slide<00:00:54.610> your<00:00:54.879> wire<00:00:55.030> in<00:00:55.390> and<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:57.100> crimp<00:00:57.670> the

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
slide your wire in and just crimp the

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.880 
slide your wire in and just crimp the
snot<00:00:58.420> out<00:00:58.660> of<00:00:58.690> that<00:00:58.930> piece<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.320> wire<00:00:59.500> and<00:00:59.800> it

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
snot out of that piece of wire and it

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.240 
snot out of that piece of wire and it
should<00:01:00.160> yield<00:01:00.520> a<00:01:00.760> Z<00:01:01.120> Bend<00:01:01.620> well<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.739> theory<00:01:03.070> is

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
should yield a Z Bend well the theory is

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.369 
should yield a Z Bend well the theory is
good<00:01:03.489> but<00:01:04.149> with<00:01:04.239> this<00:01:04.360> pair<00:01:04.659> of<00:01:04.750> pliers<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.320> I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
good but with this pair of pliers and I

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.870 
good but with this pair of pliers and I
paid<00:01:05.590> like<00:01:05.770> $19<00:01:06.760> for<00:01:07.000> them<00:01:07.380> ages<00:01:08.380> ago<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.700> late

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
paid like $19 for them ages ago the late

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.170 
paid like $19 for them ages ago the late
80s<00:01:10.299> I<00:01:10.420> guess<00:01:10.630> well<00:01:11.590> this<00:01:11.950> is<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.369> Z<00:01:12.640> Bend<00:01:12.940> that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
80s I guess well this is the Z Bend that

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.670 
80s I guess well this is the Z Bend that
it<00:01:13.330> yields<00:01:13.659> and<00:01:13.930> I'm<00:01:13.990> going<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.170> try<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.409> bring

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
it yields and I'm going to try to bring

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.410 
it yields and I'm going to try to bring
it<00:01:14.830> up<00:01:14.979> here<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.869> show<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:18.189> you<00:01:18.640> can<00:01:19.000> see

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
it up here and show you but you can see

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.340 
it up here and show you but you can see
the<00:01:20.200> space<00:01:20.530> in<00:01:20.830> here<00:01:20.860> is<00:01:21.310> very<00:01:21.970> narrow<00:01:22.360> so<00:01:23.290> if

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
the space in here is very narrow so if

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.600 
the space in here is very narrow so if
you're<00:01:23.470> going<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.650> try<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.830> feed<00:01:24.100> that<00:01:24.250> into<00:01:24.460> a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
you're going to try to feed that into a

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.120 
you're going to try to feed that into a
servo<00:01:25.270> control<00:01:25.750> horn<00:01:26.080> or<00:01:26.320> even<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.650> big<00:01:26.860> nine

120<00:02:11.499> size<00:02:11.709> pattern<00:02:12.219> planes<00:02:12.519> I<00:02:12.700> used<00:02:12.909> to<00:02:13.029> fly

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
120 size pattern planes I used to fly

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.660 
120 size pattern planes I used to fly
and<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:15.080> found<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.680> technique<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.220> work<00:02:16.250> best

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
and I found this technique to work best

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.430 
and I found this technique to work best
this<00:02:16.970> technique<00:02:17.360> came<00:02:17.570> from<00:02:17.840> an<00:02:17.990> old<00:02:18.110> veteran

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
this technique came from an old veteran

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.590 
this technique came from an old veteran
model<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.100> friend<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.520> mine<00:02:19.760> who's<00:02:20.060> well<00:02:20.420> he

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
since passed but he showed me this years

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.740 
since passed but he showed me this years
ago<00:02:23.660> after<00:02:24.020> I<00:02:24.230> expressed<00:02:24.830> my<00:02:25.210> grief<00:02:26.210> with<00:02:26.540> this

ago after I expressed my grief with this

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.430 
ago after I expressed my grief with this
piece<00:02:26.960> of<00:02:26.990> junk<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:28.810> ever<00:02:29.810> since<00:02:30.080> then<00:02:30.290> this

piece of junk and ever since then this

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.960 
piece of junk and ever since then this
is<00:02:30.650> all<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:31.010> I've<00:02:31.130> used<00:02:31.400> this<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.760> only

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
is all that I've used this is the only

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.910 
is all that I've used this is the only
technique<00:02:32.420> I've<00:02:32.660> used<00:02:32.990> I'm<00:02:33.530> going<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.740> get<00:02:33.830> up

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
technique I've used I'm going to get up

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.260 
technique I've used I'm going to get up
here<00:02:34.070> close<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.490> Cameron<00:02:34.970> I'm<00:02:35.060> going<00:02:35.210> to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
here close to the Cameron I'm going to

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.840 
here close to the Cameron I'm going to
try<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.510> show<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.870> how<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.260> works<00:02:36.850> basically

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
try to show you how this works basically

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.510 
try to show you how this works basically
you<00:02:38.270> take<00:02:38.450> your<00:02:38.660> wire<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.140> your<00:02:40.010> pliers<00:02:40.310> and

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
you take your wire and your pliers and

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.850 
you take your wire and your pliers and
you<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:40.970> come<00:02:41.240> in<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.570> edge<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.830> little

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
you just come in the edge just a little

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.800 
you just come in the edge just a little
bit<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.650> crimp<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.460> in<00:02:46.610> there<00:02:46.820> hold<00:02:47.630> it

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
bit and crimp it in there hold it

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.470 
bit and crimp it in there hold it
tightly<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.470> then<00:02:49.130> give<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.520> 90<00:02:49.970> degree

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
tightly and then give it a 90 degree

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.160 
tightly and then give it a 90 degree
Bend<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:52.250> what<00:02:52.370> we<00:02:52.490> got<00:02:52.670> there<00:02:52.970> let's<00:02:53.840> show<00:02:54.110> you

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
Bend so what we got there let's show you

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.680 
Bend so what we got there let's show you
against<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.680> white<00:02:54.890> background<00:02:55.690> ninety

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
against the white background ninety

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.570 
against the white background ninety
degree<00:02:56.990> Bend<00:02:57.020> now<00:02:58.010> we're<00:02:58.160> going<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.310> come<00:02:58.550> up

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
degree Bend now we're going to come up

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.350 
degree Bend now we're going to come up
we're<00:02:59.570> going<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.750> grab<00:03:00.020> it<00:03:00.050> again<00:03:00.970> try<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.030> set

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
we're going to grab it again try to set

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.960 
we're going to grab it again try to set
the<00:03:02.510> depth<00:03:02.840> about<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.040> width<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.520> we<00:03:04.730> want

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
the depth about the width of we want

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.880 
the depth about the width of we want
that<00:03:05.120> Z<00:03:05.330> Bend<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.690> be<00:03:05.840> for<00:03:06.110> our<00:03:06.140> control<00:03:06.530> horn

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
that Z Bend to be for our control horn

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.530 
that Z Bend to be for our control horn
and<00:03:07.550> clamp<00:03:08.270> it<00:03:08.450> tight<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:09.050> do<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:09.980> again<00:03:10.540> 90

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
and clamp it tight and do it again 90

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.500 
and clamp it tight and do it again 90
degrees<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.980> what<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.280> end<00:03:13.400> up<00:03:13.580> with<00:03:13.640> is<00:03:14.240> you

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
degrees and what you end up with is you

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.450 
degrees and what you end up with is you
know<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:14.990> funny-looking<00:03:15.380> shape<00:03:15.890> that's<00:03:16.190> you

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
know this funny-looking shape that's you

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.160 
know this funny-looking shape that's you
know<00:03:16.550> not<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.760> Z<00:03:17.060> Bend<00:03:17.300> at<00:03:17.450> all<00:03:17.570> I<00:03:17.600> give<00:03:17.990> it<00:03:18.110> a

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
know not a Z Bend at all I give it a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.770 
know not a Z Bend at all I give it a
little<00:03:18.470> bit<00:03:18.800> more<00:03:19.040> sometimes<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:19.700> go<00:03:19.940> past<00:03:20.210> 90

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
little bit more sometimes I go past 90

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.340 
little bit more sometimes I go past 90
degrees<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:23.270> yield<00:03:23.510> what<00:03:23.720> I<00:03:23.750> want<00:03:24.080> now<00:03:24.290> I'm

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
degrees to yield what I want now I'm

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.550 
degrees to yield what I want now I'm
going<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.560> grab<00:03:24.770> this<00:03:25.040> first<00:03:25.370> Bend<00:03:25.850> as<00:03:26.750> such

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
going to grab this first Bend as such

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.130 
going to grab this first Bend as such
and<00:03:27.890> I'm<00:03:28.430> just<00:03:28.790> going<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.150> give<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.600> twist

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
and I'm just going to give it a twist

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.380 
and I'm just going to give it a twist
just<00:03:30.980> twist<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.580> whole<00:03:31.820> thing<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:34.340> now<00:03:34.580> do<00:03:35.360> a

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
just twist the whole thing and now do a

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.940 
just twist the whole thing and now do a
little<00:03:35.570> cleanup<00:03:35.840> here<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.440> sometimes<00:03:36.770> I<00:03:36.920> use

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
little cleanup here and sometimes I use

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.410 
little cleanup here and sometimes I use
a<00:03:37.540> needle<00:03:38.540> nose<00:03:38.570> for<00:03:39.080> it<00:03:39.230> but<00:03:40.010> now<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.700> can<00:03:41.390> see

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
a needle nose for it but now you can see

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.830 
a needle nose for it but now you can see
here<00:03:41.960> I've<00:03:42.500> got<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:42.830> wide<00:03:43.270> 90<00:03:44.270> degree<00:03:44.570> Bend

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
here I've got a wide 90 degree Bend

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.680 
here I've got a wide 90 degree Bend
that's<00:03:45.080> probably<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.590> little<00:03:45.920> too<00:03:46.070> wide<00:03:46.690> but

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
that's probably a little too wide but

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.510 
that's probably a little too wide but
you<00:03:47.990> can<00:03:48.140> see<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.500> technique<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.190> use

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
you can see the technique that I use

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.300 
you can see the technique that I use
anyway<00:03:50.480> I've<00:03:50.630> started<00:03:50.900> using<00:03:51.020> this<00:03:51.500> again

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
anyway I've started using this again

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.970 
anyway I've started using this again
about<00:03:52.520> two<00:03:52.790> decades<00:03:53.000> ago<00:03:53.480> and<00:03:53.930> this<00:03:54.620> is<00:03:54.890> the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
about two decades ago and this is the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.790 
about two decades ago and this is the
best<00:03:55.580> technique<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.390> have<00:03:56.660> found<00:03:56.960> so<00:03:57.740> I

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
best technique that I have found so I
