00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
enough that it can breathe and then you

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.780 
enough that it can breathe and then you
cover<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.920> whole<00:02:45.950> thing<00:02:46.130> with<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.459> towel<00:02:46.760> and

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.210 
cover the whole thing with a towel and
that's<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.450> way<00:02:47.569> it's<00:02:47.720> been<00:02:47.840> kept<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:48.470> can

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
that's the way it's been kept I can

that's the way it's been kept I can
still<00:02:49.489> see<00:02:49.760> bubbles<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.390> here<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:51.200> it's<00:02:51.890> still

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
still see bubbles in here so it's still

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.430 
still see bubbles in here so it's still
fermenting<00:02:52.819> it's<00:02:53.390> still<00:02:53.750> doing<00:02:54.080> its<00:02:54.230> thing

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440

the siphon hose that I bought at the
brewery<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:02.269> you<00:03:02.900> could<00:03:03.080> get<00:03:03.349> that<00:03:03.380> anywhere

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.529 
or anything like that to get in there so
anyway<00:04:33.410> hopefully<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.370> get<00:04:34.729> a<00:04:34.940> full<00:04:35.270> three

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
anyway hopefully I get a full three

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.560 
anyway hopefully I get a full three
gallons<00:04:35.960> of<00:04:36.110> wine<00:04:36.350> out<00:04:36.380> of<00:04:36.740> this<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.419> you<00:04:38.419> know

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
gallons of wine out of this and you know

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.130 
gallons of wine out of this and you know
this<00:04:38.750> when<00:04:39.650> this<00:04:39.889> actually<00:04:40.580> clears<00:04:41.030> if<00:04:41.630> it

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
this when this actually clears if it

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.640 
this when this actually clears if it
does<00:04:42.349> um<00:04:43.310> hopefully<00:04:43.940> when<00:04:44.930> we<00:04:44.960> go<00:04:45.200> to<00:04:45.260> bottle

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
does um hopefully when we go to bottle

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.080 
does um hopefully when we go to bottle
it<00:04:45.770> we're<00:04:45.950> going<00:04:46.039> to<00:04:46.099> strain<00:04:46.400> this

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
it we're going to strain this

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.740 
it we're going to strain this
a<00:04:47.150> few<00:04:48.370> straining<00:04:49.370> things<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.389> we<00:04:50.510> won't<00:04:50.690> have

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
a few straining things so we won't have

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.950 
a few straining things so we won't have
peach<00:04:51.080> chunks<00:04:51.500> in<00:04:51.620> our<00:04:51.740> wine<00:04:51.919> so<00:04:52.639> anyways<00:04:53.480> I'll

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
and I can tell you the easiest way to

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.210 
and I can tell you the easiest way to
get<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:07.270> strain<00:05:08.270> off<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.479> peaches<00:05:08.840> is<00:05:09.380> I<00:05:09.560> put

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
get the strain off the peaches is I put

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.300 
get the strain off the peaches is I put
I<00:05:10.550> washed<00:05:11.330> up<00:05:11.660> a<00:05:11.840> stray<00:05:12.350> a<00:05:12.380> real<00:05:12.740> fine<00:05:13.040> mesh

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
I washed up a stray a real fine mesh

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.830 
I washed up a stray a real fine mesh
strainer<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.820> you<00:05:13.910> just<00:05:14.090> stick<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.479> down<00:05:14.540> in

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
strainer and you just stick that down in

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.080 
strainer and you just stick that down in
there<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.110> then<00:05:15.290> siphon<00:05:15.830> out<00:05:16.010> of<00:05:16.160> that<00:05:16.340> pool

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
there and then siphon out of that pool

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.870 
there and then siphon out of that pool
that<00:05:17.600> collects<00:05:18.199> in<00:05:18.440> there<00:05:18.590> and<00:05:18.800> that<00:05:19.520> was<00:05:19.729> the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
that collects in there and that was the

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.690 
that collects in there and that was the
easiest<00:05:20.300> way<00:05:20.630> so<00:05:21.250> that<00:05:22.250> being<00:05:22.430> said<00:05:22.580> I'll

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
easiest way so that being said I'll

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.219 
easiest way so that being said I'll
still<00:05:22.970> have<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.180> filter<00:05:23.750> out<00:05:23.870> a<00:05:23.900> bunch<00:05:24.139> of

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
still have to filter out a bunch of

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.190 
still have to filter out a bunch of
stuff<00:05:24.290> if<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:25.070> if<00:05:25.460> it<00:05:25.610> actually<00:05:25.790> comes<00:05:26.270> out<00:05:27.190> and

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
stuff if it if it actually comes out and

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.870 
stuff if it if it actually comes out and
I've<00:05:30.200> got<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.500> go<00:05:30.620> get<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:30.860> new<00:05:30.919> bubbler<00:05:31.430> because
