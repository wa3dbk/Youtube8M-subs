 Hello good afternoon, today I want to show you, as I use, the shrinkable film of 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:15.019
 pvc, to decorate bottles and some gifts. And then the only thing I need for the bottles 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.949
 are. a wooden tablet, the shrinkable film 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.949
 pvc, scotch tape, dryer, scissors and silicon gun. It is all the material. 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:35.539
 Well, here I am showing you that the shrinkable film, I have more or less to check how much 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:50.020
 I'll need, and I'll cut it short. Already cut, that movie, you start to detach, it's done 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.040
 double, and already there I'm going to cut, in half. 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:24.540
 I'm not so expert in this, because I only do it once a year, and it's always in December. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 But as you know, I always show you what I'm doing. 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.740
 And now we will only accommodate, our plastic or our pvc, and we will go sticking 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:35.500
 with scotch tape, on the bottom. I always try to stick it what it is in the 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:45.080
 edge of my kitchen, of my table, not to battle so much and there sometimes at trial 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.760
 I do, or if I do not look out. I look to see if I'm hitting well, but it's very simple, 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.709
 It's not as complicated as we sometimes think, because you can usually take it somewhere 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.560
 part where they are covered or they are well arranged father, but well I do this 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.560
 I say in December and right now I'm working on it. 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:43.400
 You have to cut the excess to be able to paste it very well, because if it does not fit, I throw a ball in the bottom part. 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.460
 In this part of here there are people, who know how to cut very well and unite it, I 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.460
 I'm not an expert, but I try to keep everything in one of the two bottles and not 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.020
 see our work ugly. 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.870
 And here also in the bottom part, we will cut all our surplus and we will only apply 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.620
 scotch tape and then we are almost ready for our work. 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.500
 and here 'for I show it to you by the part below, where I am applying the tape. 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:20.220
 and these are the ones that I need to decorate, I only put some poinsettias, some ornaments. 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:27.220
 And here we are only applying the heat of the dryer so that our 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:35.110
 pvc film. 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:14.660
 To this I felt that I did not put enough scotch tape on it and so that it will not be released or anything I am applying to it And to this one that is different, well I am also 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:21.810
 applying the heat of the dryer and then I hope you will use my tutorial so that you can 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:29.630
 do it and that you can make your gifts, or your bottles decorate them with this kind of 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:38.000
 material. And then you know, I invite you to subscribe to my channel on YouTube, and
