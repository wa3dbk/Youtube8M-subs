 Y 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.240
 the one who passes boy I have a new video 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.520
 guys and we're a little video 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.380
 special because to a top 5 of life's 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.330
 minecraft premium was in subscribers 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.560
 recommending that they make a top 5 and 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.689
 good live kids three or five 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.250
 followers that did not upload to channel 5 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.350
 accept the premium that has not been uploaded 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.660
 because I was not going to repeat what I already had 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.340
 uploaded previously we are in known 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.260
 from arkham this is a neutral rush and 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.850
 it was just because it 's pretty beautiful in 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.800
 lobby then I wanted to come here 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.660
 to present the video so good 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.430
 It's a sad transition and we're going to create the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.230
 number one of this good guys and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.729
 we are here back with the number one 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.890
 of this top and we are on servers 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:45.659
 mindflex this would be pretty well known 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.850
 but it also has to be in this 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.830
 top 5 because the truth got very 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.330
 very very good that has many 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.860
 game modes but not only that 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.049
 but also going to try each 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.360
 two for three thousand many mini-games that 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.909
 they are only exclusive to this server as well 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.610
 that we are going to do we give right click of 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.110
 compass and here we have bridget 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.320
 we're still here with your beard game 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.220
 Ministerof super up 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.900
 lohan but my team almost he follows 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.750
 dominate without stain and for whom 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.290
 mayor we have all this 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.350
 we have super split anr dragons one in 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.960
 of khyber brown escape is great that 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.450
 assassin's micro battle super paint ball 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.190
 tour wars the stars and bacon brown and here 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.960
 would finish our first server of 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.610
 our top 5 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.770
 so we go with the second one and in the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.330
 put number 2 we have to mimic a 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.430
 sound very very good and I think the 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.800
 ministers of olimpo staff that do not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.300
 he has nothing with him but he is very very very 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.310
 well and it has practically the same 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.020
 modalities although a lot more 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.060
 we started here a compass we give 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.590
 right click and here we have the continuous 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.170
 from the server because we have super 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.360
 created brothers the world superbike 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.670
 game widgets vp dan johnson hands 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.520
 ghostbusters escape or eminent beast 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.019
 aesthetics is mod 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.129
 zombie image against human end of the 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.870
 villa 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:20.250
 blog hand draw the block which has 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.660
 of the run bates lab and ping mei slap and 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.430
 good guys that would have finished our 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.959
 management of this server I say it because 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.239
 with parkour and see you in the number 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.430
 3 in position number we deal with min 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.190
 play a server that is related 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.769
 with that the xp 55 I do not know if to exactly 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.910
 yours or one of the administrators the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.739
 true that leaving this server are 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.590
 pretty well has a lot of modality in 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.900
 game and you see that there are things are a bit 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.400
 different we give right click and because 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.980
 we have the different minigames of 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.310
 server we are here you know of events 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.470
 min yu etc 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.930
 seeks to instruct pvp effect parkour do 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.370
 and taxi and sky wars the truth that you see no 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.430
 It is very large but you see that there is 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.800
 they stand out because they have different objects 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.349
 that make it special for example a 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.209
 cane or improve a flamethrower and what 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.920
 it's just a stupid article you 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.450
 it can be a bomb or a launcher 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.400
 pig so the truth is that it's very 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.230
 well they are small details that in the end 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.269
 camps can make a difference in the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.280
 position number 4 we have minecraft 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.410
 central a server that does not have much 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.480
 modality of game that stand out but what 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.890
 that you have is very very very well done you 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.010
 we give the sorcerer right click and when 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.120
 close is because we have this blog 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:35.450
 creative pvp kit hurry your rival fight 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.790
 jones skyworks his drink the game jane 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.890
 ansell and capture the flag and this one followed 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.260
 eta machine with its sky was also 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.420
 like the previous mmm play but this one more 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.370
 of the style of v craft the truth that 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.940
 these skywest are very very good with 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.769
 very hung map in as you see has you 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.160
 lots of sand exactly if it ends 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.880
 here 246 is worth it if they have so many sands and 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.100
 the truth 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.350
 Pretty much if you ever get tired of 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.850
 kraft would recommend coming from this one 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.680
 and in position number 5 we are with 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.240
 crowd a server that does not have much 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.800
 game mode but that are not the 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.690
 same meaning that they are not all 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.790
 servers have already tired and it 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.130
 we will remove survival game zombie escape 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.070
 bucket that has with split hell 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.720
 textron and my advantage see with hunters 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.460
 main the revolution sÃ­ndicas the 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.560
 game that a few eyes of hunger but 1 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.160
 versus 1 because we continue with super jump 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.250
 one-on-one boat colony wars 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.900
 active and snow splif as you are watching 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.340
 does not have many blows modalities not 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.810
 they are nothing like all 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.060
 servers have and good but here 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.950
 would finish another top 5 of servers 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.600
 Minecraft premium before finishing 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.130
 I want to say that we are not ordered from 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.440
 better quality to lesser 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.180
 randomly not that because it's 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.090
 at No. 5 is better than 1 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.740
 the 3 or the number 4 as well as the guys 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.580
 you give comment line sharing is 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.590
 thanks 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.590
 well let's go to next chao
