because the fact that you look day and I
didn't<00:01:46.350> wander<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.860> makes<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.640> look<00:01:47.700> bad<00:01:47.939> so

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
didn't wander to it makes it look bad so

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
didn't wander to it makes it look bad so
that's<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.840> great<00:01:48.930> thing<00:01:49.110> about<00:01:49.229> these<00:01:49.439> shoes

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that's a great thing about these shoes

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.170 
that's a great thing about these shoes
that<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.100> wear<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.549> very<00:01:50.909> bad

environments and they look great now

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.170 
environments and they look great now
when<00:01:53.310> these<00:01:53.430> first<00:01:53.700> released<00:01:54.000> all<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
when these first released all the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.539 
when these first released all the
reading<00:01:54.509> interest<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.990> them<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.380> saw<00:01:56.130> them<00:01:56.369> on

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
reading interest in them I saw them on

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.969 
reading interest in them I saw them on
the<00:01:56.670> website<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.329> they<00:01:58.170> were<00:01:58.320> naked<00:01:58.500> special

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the website and they were naked special

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.039 
the website and they were naked special
to<00:01:59.070> me<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.369> then<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.240> actually<00:02:00.390> saw<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> friend

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
to me and then I actually saw a friend

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.450 
to me and then I actually saw a friend
and<00:02:01.259> he<00:02:01.290> actually<00:02:01.560> bought<00:02:01.710> them<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.219> went<00:02:02.399> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and he actually bought them and I went a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.580 
and he actually bought them and I went a
solid<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.850> person<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.750> when<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:03.990> saw<00:02:04.229> them<00:02:04.350> look

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
solid in person and when I saw them look

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
solid in person and when I saw them look
better<00:02:04.829> than<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.250> expected

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
better than I expected

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.690 
better than I expected
tonight<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:05.970> look<00:02:06.150> great<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.570> feet<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.700> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
tonight they look great on feet so the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.980 
tonight they look great on feet so the
problem<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.119> these<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:09.720> released

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
problem with these is that they released

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.260 
problem with these is that they released
in<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.170> USA<00:02:10.560> only<00:02:10.710> at<00:02:11.100> first<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> thought

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
in the USA only at first so I thought

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.850 
in the USA only at first so I thought
they<00:02:12.360> were<00:02:12.450> only<00:02:12.660> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.140> USC<00:02:13.590> release

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
they were only going to be a USC release

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.070 
they were only going to be a USC release
and<00:02:14.100> then<00:02:14.670> they<00:02:15.150> actually<00:02:15.450> got<00:02:15.540> stopped<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.900> new

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and then they actually got stopped a new

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.320 
and then they actually got stopped a new
EU<00:02:16.350> website<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.130> I'll<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.210> get

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.730 
EU website and I'll like I have to get

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740
