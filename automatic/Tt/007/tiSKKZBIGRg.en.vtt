00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.080
 the soto of chanterelles up to endangered thousands of trees of this green lung 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.480
 a few kilometers from the center of zaragoza have dried up in the last 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.320
 years due to lack of water and a good part of those that are left give symptoms of 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.100
 exhaustion municipal officials have announced that their intention is to 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.730
 grant the endorsement mind the public domain of this area to be able to act 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.109
 in her 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.039
 I am very proud of the vertex saying that you can see that floor 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.210
 if the law allows it without even having to expropriate because this one 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.610
 particular what they have done is that the whole is not a kid 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.870
 there are three areas of public domain 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.190
 and that according to the legislation have no right to do so and can be recovered 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.850
 ignorant by these hours three kilometers of fatah catalogs that 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.580
 declares proven that all the 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.980
 treetops totally that case 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.800
 once inside, damage to trees and undergrowth is better 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.860
 we are in the area through which the water enters can be overwhelmed this year not 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.650
 He has done it not once and there have been no contributions from the surpluses of the 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.030
 huerta have been cut sergio ortega boss of the force to the 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.800
 excorredores that by the way here to nagua in the spring and summer that is 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.479
 when more water needs 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.880
 in the trees 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.869
 then we find that all the trees the understory is dead 13 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:14.750
 necessary 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.130
 let the system work again, who dedicates trust before hundreds of years 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.880
 so that the catalog can continue living that is the contributions that came 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.220
 from veto to orchard the sources that are almost nugget 50 species 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.630
 the soto has received numerous recognitions among others the one of 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.540
 spaces of natural and scenic interest and is also the only 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.390
 natural enclave of the green ring of zaragoza 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.900
 the joaquin araujo naturalist defined it as a small jungle 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.450
 transplanted steel summoned the amazonas now affirms his friend and 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.500
 Mariano MÃ©rida collaborator can not say the same thing this forum 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.100
 spectacular unique trees that were in the soto of cantalobos 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.659
 and what hadid or dying in this drought is to continue from these previous years and 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.630
 we are already seeing that it does not encourage his retirement age of cantayo leaves but that 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.380
 we fix on the twigs 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.700
 among them the most that have to be prepared down below under par for the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.650
 spring they have not left then they point us apart from that we generate pd of 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.690
 death in the Grove is to wish for an announced death and that end is saved 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.540
 small part of the soto the final 150 meters here 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.410
 the findings we are in a strategic point between photo catalogs this 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.999
 is the only agency that currently gets between photo 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.759
 p then we have to make this drought work believe catalogs end 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.809
 to 150 meters we have all the green forest 102 that exposes green undergrowth 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:46.090
 all the opa the trees and yet from that point up almost three 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.869
 kilometers of the forest we have done it 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:52.359
 In its more than 300 years of life the soto has seen many threats go by 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.289
 now the drought and climate change have rekindled the alarm 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.120
 ten days before the start of the pillar celebrations, the city prepares to 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.819
 homes there will be talks the central - of course
