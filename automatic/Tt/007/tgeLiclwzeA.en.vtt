 simple we can activate the gps and that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.910
 way to locate ourselves more easily 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.189
 using suddenly the google maps or 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.039
 any application that uses our 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.160
 geo location not to disable this 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.020
 option here we are going to deactivate it for 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 show them how to activate it for another 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.390
 method that a little bit longer as 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.550
 here by configuration let's adjust to 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.770
 games completely the option is by 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.500
 here below is called services of 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.550
 location in service of locations that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.650
 you can activate the gps we give you here to use 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.840
 use gps satellites 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.400
 and as you will see we are going to verify it to see 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.010
 if it was activated as you will see here it was 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.770

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.990

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.150
 and we use the google maps of certain 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.700
 way we see that we get a location 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.040
 very accurate very close where we are and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.020

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.960
