well systems 12 volts DC only how don't

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
well systems 12 volts DC only how don't
run<00:00:47.370> any<00:00:47.550> AC<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.239> burgers<00:00:48.570> off<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.079> just

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
run any AC and burgers off of it just

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.500 
run any AC and burgers off of it just
because<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.309> does<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> pretty<00:00:51.090> small

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
because it does have a pretty small

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.959 
because it does have a pretty small
battery<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.860> uh<00:00:52.890> let<00:00:53.399> me<00:00:53.430> show<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.670> some<00:00:53.940> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
hours with this little LED I would say

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.440 
hours with this little LED I would say
you<00:01:19.320> know<00:01:19.470> they're<00:01:19.740> probably<00:01:20.009> last<00:01:20.369> an<00:01:20.700> entire

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you know they're probably last an entire

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.740 
you know they're probably last an entire
24<00:01:22.229> hours<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.950> not<00:01:23.100> tested<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
24 hours I just have not tested it that

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.140 
24 hours I just have not tested it that
far<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.920> pretty<00:01:26.100> powerful<00:01:26.460> 3am<00:01:26.939> power

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
far but it's pretty powerful 3am power

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.039 
far but it's pretty powerful 3am power
slow<00:01:27.540> LED<00:01:28.250> light<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.579> pretty<00:01:30.180> sure<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.720> run<00:01:30.930> an

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049

now<00:01:45.899> we<00:01:45.960> charge<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.590> USB<00:01:46.860> battery<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:48.270> also

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
now we charge that USB battery it also

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.389 
now we charge that USB battery it also
charges<00:01:48.750> double-a<00:01:49.470> batteries<00:01:49.979> thanks<00:01:50.220> to

this USB double a battery charger and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.420 
this USB double a battery charger and
also<00:01:53.970> charge<00:01:54.240> triple<00:01:54.570> ace<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.280> switch<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
also charge triple ace if you switch the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.050 
also charge triple ace if you switch the
little<00:01:56.670> thing

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
little thing

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.730 
little thing
and<00:01:58.240> then<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.630> course<00:01:58.659> my<00:01:59.079> batteries<00:01:59.560> all

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
and then of course my batteries all

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.510 
and then of course my batteries all
right<00:02:00.040> there<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.780> also<00:02:02.110> charges<00:02:02.520> this

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
right there so it also charges this

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.760 
right there so it also charges this

perfect<00:04:05.500> charge<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.069> all<00:04:06.129> I've<00:04:06.310> how<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.519> do<00:04:06.730> is

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
perfect charge and all I've how to do is

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.740 
perfect charge and all I've how to do is
I<00:04:06.939> had<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.209> steal<00:04:07.420> water<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.650> sales

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
I had to steal water to the sales

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.030 
I had to steal water to the sales
so<00:04:11.360> panels<00:04:12.360> come<00:04:12.570> in<00:04:12.780> right<00:04:13.020> here<00:04:13.320> via<00:04:13.920> these

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
so panels come in right here via these

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.400 
so panels come in right here via these
alligator<00:04:14.610> clips<00:04:14.940> you'll<00:04:15.840> notice<00:04:16.200> there<00:04:16.380> is

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
alligator clips you'll notice there is

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.229 
alligator clips you'll notice there is
no<00:04:16.709> charge<00:04:16.950> controller<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.820> that's<00:04:18.060> because

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
no charge controller and that's because

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.940 
no charge controller and that's because
the<00:04:18.570> way<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.750> have<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.109> panel<00:04:19.470> set<00:04:19.650> up<00:04:19.769> outside

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
the way I have the panel set up outside

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.069 
the way I have the panel set up outside
and<00:04:20.430> between<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.880> house<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.120> garage<00:04:21.540> and<00:04:22.019> the

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
and between the house and garage and the

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.290 
and between the house and garage and the
fence<00:04:22.380> they<00:04:23.010> don't<00:04:23.190> get<00:04:23.310> optimum<00:04:23.790> sunlight

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
fence they don't get optimum sunlight

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.660 
fence they don't get optimum sunlight
per<00:04:25.020> day<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.230> it<00:04:25.470> was<00:04:25.500> taking<00:04:25.830> sometimes

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
per day and it was taking sometimes

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.250 
per day and it was taking sometimes
three<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.180> four<00:04:27.420> days<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.840> charge<00:04:28.080> this

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
three to four days to charge this

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.680 
three to four days to charge this
battery<00:04:28.610> with<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.640> charge<00:04:29.940> controller<00:04:30.300> on<00:04:30.540> it

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
battery with a charge controller on it

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.470 
battery with a charge controller on it
so<00:04:31.520> what<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.550> found<00:04:32.820> is<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.090> if<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.420> directly

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
so what I found is that if I directly

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.050 
so what I found is that if I directly
hook<00:04:34.290> up<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.680> solar<00:04:35.010> panels<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:35.940> as

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
hook up the solar panels to this and as

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.850 
hook up the solar panels to this and as
long<00:04:36.210> as<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:36.510> drained<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.810> battery<00:04:37.170> enough

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
long as I drained the battery enough

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.340 
long as I drained the battery enough
down<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:39.120> maybe<00:04:39.300> about<00:04:39.570> eleven<00:04:39.930> point<00:04:40.170> nine

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
down to maybe about eleven point nine

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.220 
down to maybe about eleven point nine
volts<00:04:40.860> every<00:04:41.160> night<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.970> will<00:04:42.210> never<00:04:42.480> reach

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
volts every night it will never reach

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.820 
volts every night it will never reach
over<00:04:43.790> 14.3<00:04:44.790> boats<00:04:45.030> per<00:04:45.360> day<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:45.830> that's

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
over 14.3 boats per day and that's

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.050 
over 14.3 boats per day and that's
pretty<00:04:46.980> much<00:04:47.100> how<00:04:47.370> it's<00:04:47.490> been<00:04:47.610> working<00:04:47.850> for

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
pretty much how it's been working for

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.060 
pretty much how it's been working for
the<00:04:48.150> past<00:04:48.180> couple<00:04:48.600> of<00:04:48.810> weeks<00:04:48.870> just<00:04:49.710> because<00:04:49.950> I

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
the past couple of weeks just because I

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.250 
the past couple of weeks just because I
don't<00:04:50.580> track<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:51.030> Sun<00:04:51.270> those<00:04:51.690> particular

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
don't track the Sun those particular

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.900 
don't track the Sun those particular
panels<00:04:52.710> which<00:04:52.860> I'll<00:04:53.040> show<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.220> in<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.460> second

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
panels which I'll show you in a second

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.060 
panels which I'll show you in a second
and<00:04:54.540> I<00:04:54.840> make<00:04:55.050> sure<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.230> drain<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.740> every<00:04:56.040> day

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
and I make sure to drain this every day

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.330 
and I make sure to drain this every day
so<00:04:56.640> no<00:04:57.030> charge<00:04:57.330> controller<00:04:57.660> necessary<00:04:58.340> with

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
so no charge controller necessary with

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.200 
so no charge controller necessary with
this<00:04:59.460> little<00:04:59.700> system<00:05:00.260> but<00:05:01.880> sometimes<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:03.030> have

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
this little system but sometimes I have

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.730 
this little system but sometimes I have
the<00:05:03.360> multimeter<00:05:03.810> hooked<00:05:04.080> up<00:05:04.260> again<00:05:04.530> i<00:05:04.620> have

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
the multimeter hooked up again i have

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.370 
the multimeter hooked up again i have
three<00:05:05.040> solar<00:05:05.280> systems<00:05:05.790> now<00:05:05.970> so<00:05:06.630> i<00:05:06.660> can't<00:05:07.200> keep

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
three solar systems now so i can't keep

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.260 
three solar systems now so i can't keep
it<00:05:07.530> here<00:05:07.680> all<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.010> time<00:05:08.070> but<00:05:08.460> i<00:05:08.580> do<00:05:08.640> check<00:05:09.060> the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
it here all the time but i do check the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.930 
it here all the time but i do check the
voltage<00:05:09.960> every<00:05:10.440> now<00:05:10.560> and<00:05:10.770> then<00:05:10.919> of<00:05:11.550> course<00:05:11.580> has

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
voltage every now and then of course has

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.640 
voltage every now and then of course has
been<00:05:11.970> running<00:05:12.450> for<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.660> little<00:05:12.840> while<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.530> it's

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
been running for a little while so it's

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.520 
been running for a little while so it's
still<00:05:14.400> pretty<00:05:14.580> hot<00:05:14.790> 12.4<00:05:15.630> eight<00:05:15.780> going<00:05:16.470> to

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
still pretty hot 12.4 eight going to

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.610 
still pretty hot 12.4 eight going to
drain<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.010> about<00:05:17.390> 12<00:05:18.390> volts<00:05:18.870> we're<00:05:19.350> nights

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
drain it to about 12 volts we're nights

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.810 
drain it to about 12 volts we're nights
over<00:05:20.040> just<00:05:20.340> make<00:05:20.550> sure<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.790> doesn't

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
over just make sure it doesn't

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.090 
over just make sure it doesn't
overcharge<00:05:21.540> and<00:05:22.850> here's<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:24.030> panel's<00:05:25.100> panels

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
overcharge and here's the panel's panels

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.320 
overcharge and here's the panel's panels
are<00:05:26.250> outside<00:05:28.010> two<00:05:29.010> up<00:05:29.190> top<00:05:29.460> or<00:05:29.700> from<00:05:29.820> other<00:05:30.060> two

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.630 
are outside two up top or from other two
systems<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.470> 20<00:05:31.860> watt<00:05:32.040> one<00:05:32.430> is<00:05:32.610> a

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
systems the 20 watt one is a

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.630 
systems the 20 watt one is a
monocrystalline<00:05:33.360> ones<00:05:33.780> poly<00:05:34.220> but<00:05:35.220> here<00:05:35.490> the

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
monocrystalline ones poly but here the

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.340 
monocrystalline ones poly but here the
panels<00:05:36.000> for<00:05:36.120> this<00:05:36.240> system<00:05:36.479> it<00:05:36.780> works<00:05:36.930> off<00:05:37.200> with

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
panels for this system it works off with

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.110 
panels for this system it works off with
12<00:05:37.620> watts<00:05:37.919> and<00:05:38.340> that's<00:05:38.580> made<00:05:38.820> up<00:05:38.970> of<00:05:39.060> three

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
12 watts and that's made up of three

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.920 
12 watts and that's made up of three
pounds<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.960> 5<00:05:40.800> watt<00:05:41.130> in<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.520> middle<00:05:41.850> 3<00:05:42.479> watt<00:05:42.660> to

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
pounds a 5 watt in the middle 3 watt to

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.500 
pounds a 5 watt in the middle 3 watt to
the<00:05:43.020> right<00:05:43.229> and<00:05:43.500> a<00:05:43.740> four<00:05:44.430> wat<00:05:44.669> to<00:05:44.910> the<00:05:45.000> left<00:05:45.240> all

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
the right and a four wat to the left all

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.560 
the right and a four wat to the left all
wired<00:05:46.020> in<00:05:46.260> parallel<00:05:46.290> they're<00:05:47.190> all<00:05:47.340> 17.5<00:05:48.270> both

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
wired in parallel they're all 17.5 both

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.260 
wired in parallel they're all 17.5 both
so<00:05:48.780> I<00:05:48.840> can<00:05:49.020> do<00:05:49.169> that<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:50.310> they<00:05:50.669> they're

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
so I can do that and they they're

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.330 
so I can do that and they they're
supposed<00:05:51.630> to<00:05:51.720> put<00:05:51.930> out<00:05:52.020> about<00:05:52.260> 800<00:05:53.040> a<00:05:53.130> little

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
supposed to put out about 800 a little

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.150 
supposed to put out about 800 a little
bit<00:05:53.430> over<00:05:53.610> at<00:05:54.650> eight<00:05:55.650> hundred<00:05:55.710> milliamps

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
bit over at eight hundred milliamps

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.880 
bit over at eight hundred milliamps
worth<00:05:56.520> of<00:05:56.729> energy<00:05:57.450> but<00:05:57.690> thanks<00:05:58.650> to<00:05:58.770> my

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
worth of energy but thanks to my

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.250 
worth of energy but thanks to my
temporary<00:05:59.220> wiring<00:06:00.000> outside<00:06:00.510> i<00:06:00.840> needed<00:06:01.169> about

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
temporary wiring outside i needed about

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.230 
temporary wiring outside i needed about
25<00:06:01.919> feet<00:06:01.950> of<00:06:02.370> it<00:06:02.460> so<00:06:02.580> i<00:06:02.640> went<00:06:02.820> to<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.000> dollar

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
25 feet of it so i went to the dollar

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.530 
25 feet of it so i went to the dollar
store<00:06:03.450> yeah<00:06:04.320> I'm<00:06:04.440> that<00:06:04.710> cheap<00:06:05.360> they're<00:06:06.360> not

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
store yeah I'm that cheap they're not

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.900 
store yeah I'm that cheap they're not
getting<00:06:06.780> off<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.500> optimum<00:06:08.400> current<00:06:08.790> they're

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
getting off the optimum current they're

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.420 
getting off the optimum current they're
giving<00:06:09.180> off<00:06:09.330> a<00:06:09.360> maximum<00:06:10.140> of<00:06:10.320> about<00:06:10.979> six

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
giving off a maximum of about six
