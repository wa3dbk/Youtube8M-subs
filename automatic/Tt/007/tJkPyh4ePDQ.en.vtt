mayera<00:02:29.740> generation<00:02:30.370> 2<00:02:30.580> which<00:02:30.850> lost<00:02:31.090> even<00:02:31.720> less

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
mayera generation 2 which lost even less

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.820 
mayera generation 2 which lost even less
time<00:02:32.290> but<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.280> works<00:02:33.760> better<00:02:37.590> part<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.710> the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
time but it works better part of the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.130 
time but it works better part of the
generation<00:02:39.160> 1<00:02:39.640> /<00:02:40.150> later

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
walking speed as you remember it's about

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.210 
walking speed as you remember it's about
the<00:04:23.530> normal<00:04:23.740> sprinting<00:04:24.310> speed<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:26.220> the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
the normal sprinting speed and the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.440 
the normal sprinting speed and the
sprinting<00:04:27.580> speed<00:04:27.669> on<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:27.940> one<00:04:28.180> was<00:04:28.330> the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
sprinting speed on this one was the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.770 
sprinting speed on this one was the
walking<00:04:28.780> speed<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.110> other<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:30.270> we<00:04:31.270> run<00:04:31.450> really

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
walking speed the other so we run really

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.130 
walking speed the other so we run really
fast<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:33.730> as<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.090> can<00:04:34.150> see<00:04:34.210> it<00:04:34.660> lasts<00:04:34.900> very

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
fast and as you can see it lasts very

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.550
