00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 very good other endorsements how about six 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.000
 you come to the channel has not been given but I 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 He warned that he was going to do this series but 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.830
 It has encouraged me and in 2.0 I will try 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.410
 get me the one in live so this 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.900
 it will be the first episode guide episode 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.410
 to see how how is this going to be very 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.750
 difficult to remove the one that already live 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.039
 I'm taking it out of planned deferred 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.650
 live is going to be the cock and also 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.750
 commenting for you hundred 2.0 then 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.250
 an added difficulty so when 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.579
 I have here, I have the remington 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.500
 that I'm testing it now and the other 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.239
 team I think it's a clan is pretty 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.010
 complicated in strict but good I do not know 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.230
 how many episodes will this last as 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 I say the objective is to remove the one that in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.850
 life and I will put all my effort into 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.399
 it added that good to record episodes that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.530
 do not upload them others and those who see that they are 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.379
 more entertaining and such and in the first place 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.660
 let's play team duel 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.190
 the truth to get it out here because I 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.329
 I really like the gun 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.190
 excellence 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.390
 in this game the truth that lasted for 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.610
 equipment is crap but how is the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.490
 first episode for 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.810
 to see how this works , I say 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.660
 I understand by sure team that I get out 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.070
 a chair at the beginning in half and 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.170
 Then , if that is why I'm going to get 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.840
 in domain I will try to change 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.380
 game modes all the time so like 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.360
 I also wanted to do 2.0 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.690
 here it is 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.690
 ostia 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.000
 well let's see how we are given this 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.970
 it's very difficult as I say take out the one 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.590
 in life and also in this map that 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.690
 if he has caught the trick then 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.370
 ok but it's a small one and it's having 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.080
 very controlled of answer you already know that 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.570
 in this game it is very difficult 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.160
 he answers this game took the cow with 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.590
 muted and large week loaders 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.260
 then I have a similar class 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.280
 to which I explain in the guide for 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.560
 classes to get it out who 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.630
 and let's see how we are given stays 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.040
 Nearby burst my head as well 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.810
 that is the second game that I miss 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.950
 today but well let's see if we're going 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.950
 to some chair 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.840
 in this game it is said to be sure 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.140
 I was taking out 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.850
 the camouflage 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.569
 skin back here because they are 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.280
 appearing here we also give 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.499
 I'm very bad kid is the first 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.319
 I already tell you, I'm very clumsy but 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:28.980
 well , nothing happens 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.980
 We get warmed 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.890
 three point 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.100
 I'm here, they're showing up 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.110
 I take the moment I'm controlling it 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.230
 decently let's get in here 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.870
 because everyone is going to come here 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.300
 and it's worth there and it has to be 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.040
 appearing down here 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.190
 is reappearing here and right opposite 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.700
 that's a chat with to destroy it from 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.000
 I do not want to get close anymore HD7 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.810
 it's worth of 8 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.220
 I like I like to go up here and what 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.830
 pity kid the whole cable is in the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.050
 I knew that I do not know if it was because of 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.150
 sat I bought meaning maybe I knew that 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.590
 I was down there, well, I like I do not know 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.050
 why but sometimes I do not get out 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.880
 things without life and I start doing life 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.500
 in common I'm commenting I'm like oh 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.090
 I 'm not going to say that I'm more 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.030
 concentrate on the game but let's say that 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.730
 I think more what I do then some 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.080
 sometimes I get better streaks in life and 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.480
 then trying to play to get me out 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.970
 good gusts and obviously the other 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.980
 guy carries 40 points 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.630
 these new equipment is not going to give me 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.450
 no time or cunt so we're going to 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.680
 try to win the game at least 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.080
 that as I say the other team was a 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.580
 group which is a bit unfair but 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.190
 well let's see what can be done if 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.500
 we can win the game before I went together 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.660
 and I was lost by beating to see if 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.970
 now at least we can trace it 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.130
 in quotes if they suck that 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.110
 way to see let's play a little bit 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.000
 more cautious to see if we can 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.570
 trace this as you see we are going quite 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.570
 matched 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.870
 we are to that the cow does not materialize 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.300
 but it goes great done with silencer 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.720
 lately I was noticing that she is weak 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.720
 it goes a little bit 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.370
 or 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.130
 vale vale vale are appearing like 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.740
 my right is going to try to get out here 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.570
 I'm going to catch them, let's go 52 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.310
 points 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.500
 let's see if we can finalize this the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.760
 goal is also not to make episodes 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.470
 too long 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.880
 boring I can host this theme 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.070
 is bursting the whole game is of 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.670
 close I do not know what weapon carries worth they carry 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.990
 his rifle he sees it there in the fit that already 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.610
 I used to look at the row above 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.080
 because at the beginning I was always 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.280
 I used to see the fit and now 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.380
 I was looking at her here but good 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.170

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.270

 to win the game are a group and 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.650
 obviously they will be there talking 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.990
 the night 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.350

 reappearing 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.000
 68 69 is very complicated 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.200
 they're playing in a kid way that 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.200

 Well I will raise this episode as 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.740
 I liked it is the first game uns 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.419
 lost I did not get much rat a 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.949
 streak of 9 but there I got to take out 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.080
 but I really liked the 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.150
 two or two or three plays that I throw 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.289
 there they have been pretty decent 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.360
 ours there is a triple and such 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.219
 nothing more kids tell me if you like the 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.930
 idea of this series as I already tell you the 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.580
 companies that will be encouraging the 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.499
 objective is almost one who in life and 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.120
 of changing the weapon game modes what 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:43.319
 I will try to do the most fun and 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.339
 diverse possible 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.349
