00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.170 

I<00:00:32.210> guess<00:00:32.719> given<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.670> accepted<00:00:34.670> traditional

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
I guess given the accepted traditional

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.600 
I guess given the accepted traditional
epic<00:00:35.449> in<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.629> sport<00:00:35.960> Emanuel<00:00:36.379> if<00:00:37.160> this<00:00:37.460> were

epic in the sport Emanuel if this were

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.180 
epic in the sport Emanuel if this were
Pacquiao<00:00:38.030> title<00:00:38.480> belt<00:00:38.629> instead<00:00:39.079> of<00:00:39.140> Diaz's<00:00:39.500> it

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
Pacquiao title belt instead of Diaz's it

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.439 
Pacquiao title belt instead of Diaz's it
would<00:00:40.340> have<00:00:40.430> been<00:00:40.489> stopped<00:00:40.760> before<00:00:40.910> now<00:00:41.239> it

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
would have been stopped before now it

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.569 
would have been stopped before now it
probably<00:00:41.600> would<00:00:41.989> have<00:00:42.019> you<00:00:42.410> know<00:00:42.440> there's<00:00:43.339> one

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
probably would have you know there's one

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.040 
probably would have you know there's one
keep<00:00:43.820> coming<00:00:44.059> at<00:00:44.120> all<00:00:44.149> night<00:00:44.449> when<00:00:44.629> they<00:00:44.839> met

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
keep coming at all night when they met

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.450 
keep coming at all night when they met
him<00:00:45.170> but<00:00:45.290> if<00:00:45.410> even<00:00:45.769> when<00:00:45.829> he<00:00:45.890> punches<00:00:46.250> is

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
him but if even when he punches is

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.610 
him but if even when he punches is
ineffective<00:00:46.850> he's<00:00:47.540> not<00:00:47.750> a<00:00:47.809> knockout<00:00:48.229> puncher
