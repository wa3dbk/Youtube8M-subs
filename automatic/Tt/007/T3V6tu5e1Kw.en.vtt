unique<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.670> our<00:01:55.850> table<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.930> fact<00:01:56.960> that<00:01:57.260> our

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
unique to our table is the fact that our

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.140 
unique to our table is the fact that our
two<00:01:57.620> leads<00:01:57.830> are<00:01:58.070> stored<00:01:58.310> right<00:01:58.520> here<00:01:58.820> inside

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
two leads are stored right here inside

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.890 
two leads are stored right here inside

the base

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.860 
the base
so<00:02:00.380> these<00:02:00.590> leaves<00:02:01.060> stay<00:02:02.060> right<00:02:02.300> here<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:02.750> when

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
so these leaves stay right here so when

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.510 
so these leaves stay right here so when
