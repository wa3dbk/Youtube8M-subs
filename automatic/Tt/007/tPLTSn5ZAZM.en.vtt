the port shoe is basically the Jew that
we<00:02:47.100> get<00:02:47.280> when<00:02:47.310> we<00:02:47.490> raise<00:02:47.850> our<00:02:48.150> pork<00:02:48.510> shoulder

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
we get when we raise our pork shoulder

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.080 
we get when we raise our pork shoulder
so<00:02:50.610> actually<00:02:51.420> most<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.650> same

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.800 

at<00:02:56.090> this<00:02:56.270> point<00:02:57.100> I'm<00:02:58.100> going<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.790> also<00:02:59.390> put<00:02:59.660> in

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
at this point I'm going to also put in

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.000 
at this point I'm going to also put in
some<00:03:00.020> parmesan<00:03:00.410> rinds

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.410 

I<00:03:04.689> really<00:03:05.689> like<00:03:06.189> raising<00:03:07.189> them<00:03:07.370> at<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.150> low

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
I really like raising them at a low

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.240 
I really like raising them at a low
temperature<00:03:08.560> like<00:03:09.560> putting<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.159> the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
temperature like putting this in the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.030 
temperature like putting this in the
oven<00:03:10.280> at<00:03:11.290> 250<00:03:12.290> or<00:03:12.799> 275<00:03:13.670> at<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.150> very<00:03:14.329> most<00:03:14.540> and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
oven at 250 or 275 at the very most and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.319 
oven at 250 or 275 at the very most and
covering<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.129> really<00:03:16.489> tightly<00:03:16.760> that's<00:03:17.120> kind

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
covering it really tightly that's kind

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.690 
covering it really tightly that's kind
of<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.510> key<00:03:17.750> is<00:03:18.439> to<00:03:18.500> cover<00:03:18.829> it<00:03:19.129> really<00:03:19.430> tightly

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
of the key is to cover it really tightly

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.479 
of the key is to cover it really tightly
so<00:03:21.519> none<00:03:22.519> of<00:03:22.549> this<00:03:22.909> liquid<00:03:23.120> really<00:03:23.690> evaporates

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
so none of this liquid really evaporates

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.160 
so none of this liquid really evaporates
and<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.790> will<00:03:25.940> be<00:03:26.090> totally<00:03:26.480> amazing<00:03:26.750> because

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
and it will be totally amazing because

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.500 
and it will be totally amazing because
when<00:03:27.379> it<00:03:28.069> comes<00:03:28.310> out<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:28.579> oven<00:03:28.640> like<00:03:29.360> you

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
when it comes out of the oven like you

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.960 
when it comes out of the oven like you
touch<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.019> pork<00:03:30.230> cheek<00:03:30.500> with<00:03:30.769> a<00:03:31.099> spoon<00:03:31.700> and

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
touch the pork cheek with a spoon and

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.210 
touch the pork cheek with a spoon and
just<00:03:32.060> like<00:03:32.569> falls<00:03:33.230> apart

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:47.860
