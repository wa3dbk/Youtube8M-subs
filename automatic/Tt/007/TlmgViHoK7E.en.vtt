00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
all right Joey I couldn't hear a

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.850 
all right Joey I couldn't hear a
question<00:01:28.780> if<00:01:28.899> you<00:01:28.990> ask<00:01:29.079> me<00:01:29.290> a<00:01:29.320> question<00:01:29.710> let<00:01:29.799> me

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
question if you ask me a question let me

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.980 
question if you ask me a question let me
just<00:01:29.950> tell<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.430> situation<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:31.689> are<00:01:31.720> going

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
just tell you the situation we are going

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.569 
just tell you the situation we are going
to<00:01:32.140> start<00:01:32.350> thawing<00:01:32.619> out<00:01:32.920> I<00:01:32.950> think<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.369> little

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
to start thawing out I think a little

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.249 
to start thawing out I think a little
bit<00:01:33.759> tomorrow<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.600> temperature<00:01:34.960> should<00:01:35.140> get

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
bit tomorrow the temperature should get

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.020 
bit tomorrow the temperature should get
up<00:01:35.380> just<00:01:35.590> above<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:35.979> freezing<00:01:36.189> mark<00:01:36.399> 33

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
up just above the freezing mark 33

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.760 
up just above the freezing mark 33
degrees<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:37.570> we'll<00:01:37.720> be<00:01:37.840> freezing<00:01:38.259> by<00:01:38.380> 1<00:01:38.619> degree

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
degrees so we'll be freezing by 1 degree

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.800 
degrees so we'll be freezing by 1 degree
tomorrow<00:01:39.220> but<00:01:39.729> then<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.330> streets<00:01:40.630> will

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
tomorrow but then the streets will

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.359 
tomorrow but then the streets will
refreeze<00:01:41.380> tomorrow<00:01:41.770> night<00:01:41.979> they're<00:01:42.159> getting

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
refreeze tomorrow night they're getting

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.830 
refreeze tomorrow night they're getting
slick<00:01:42.610> out<00:01:42.820> here<00:01:43.060> again<00:01:43.149> tonight<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.720> I<00:01:43.780> think

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
slick out here again tonight and I think

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.090 
slick out here again tonight and I think
that's<00:01:44.170> going<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.380> happen<00:01:44.500> perhaps<00:01:44.920> even
