00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
voltage identification this week I need

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.530 
voltage identification this week I need
stands<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.460> has<00:02:05.670> reported<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.360> IV

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
stands for this has reported in IV

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.310 
stands for this has reported in IV
stands<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:07.080> identification<00:02:07.880> so<00:02:08.880> there<00:02:09.479> some

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
stands for identification so there some

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.150 
stands for identification so there some
of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> BLM<00:02:11.040> has<00:02:11.250> five<00:02:11.730> say<00:02:12.360> seven<00:02:12.390> each<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:13.920> as

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
of the BLM has five say seven each so as

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.700 
of the BLM has five say seven each so as
we<00:02:14.490> are<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.610> forward<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.960> VI<00:02:16.170> number<00:02:16.620> of

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
we are going forward the VI number of

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.400 
we are going forward the VI number of
behaves<00:02:17.160> are<00:02:17.430> increasing<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.480> what<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:19.110> this

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
behaves are increasing so what is this

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.100 
behaves are increasing so what is this
really<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.400> nothing<00:02:20.850> but<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> signal<00:02:21.540> which

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
really is a nothing but the signal which

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.260 
really is a nothing but the signal which
comes<00:02:22.380> out<00:02:22.620> from<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.160> c2<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.730> binary<00:02:24.030> format

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
comes out from the c2 in a binary format

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.630 
comes out from the c2 in a binary format
by<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.020> way<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.350> doing<00:02:25.590> four<00:02:25.800> zeros<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.460> one

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
by the way we doing four zeros and one

next function al-sabah is the drive blue
what<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.870> javac'<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.440> know<00:04:40.740> one<00:04:41.370> this<00:04:41.730> opens

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
what is the javac' I know one this opens

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.870 
what is the javac' I know one this opens
up<00:04:42.630> whatever<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.770> voltage<00:04:43.950> is<00:04:44.310> being<00:04:44.520> formed

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
up whatever the voltage is being formed

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.720 
up whatever the voltage is being formed
over<00:04:45.090> here<00:04:45.540> will<00:04:46.200> be<00:04:46.410> ground<00:04:47.220> will<00:04:47.700> be

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
over here will be ground will be

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.630 
over here will be ground will be
grounded<00:04:48.419> up<00:04:48.540> to<00:04:48.720> Z<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.770> this<00:04:49.950> is<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.130> function

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
grounded up to Z so this is the function

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.960 
grounded up to Z so this is the function
of<00:04:50.700> my<00:04:50.940> guide<00:04:51.240> hi<00:04:51.480> and<00:04:51.690> then<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.020> know<00:04:52.169> and

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
of my guide hi and then you know and

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.480 
of my guide hi and then you know and
once<00:04:53.970> we<00:04:54.210> move<00:04:54.450> forward<00:04:54.780> this<00:04:55.650> joining<00:04:56.220> point

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
once we move forward this joining point

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.060 
once we move forward this joining point
so<00:04:56.790> just<00:04:56.820> imagine<00:04:57.570> anything<00:04:57.990> what<00:04:58.410> happens<00:04:58.890> in

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
so just imagine anything what happens in

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.909 
so just imagine anything what happens in
this<00:04:59.220> turning<00:04:59.610> point<00:04:59.810> in<00:05:00.810> this<00:05:01.110> joining<00:05:01.650> point

this turning point in this joining point

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.210 
this turning point in this joining point
what<00:05:02.220> happens<00:05:02.669> out<00:05:02.850> there<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.240> some<00:05:04.110> kind<00:05:04.470> one

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
what happens out there is some kind one

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.180 
what happens out there is some kind one
of<00:05:05.250> this<00:05:05.430> voltage<00:05:05.730> is<00:05:06.030> over<00:05:06.240> here<00:05:06.710> this<00:05:07.710> wood

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
of this voltage is over here this wood

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.420 
of this voltage is over here this wood
is<00:05:08.220> formed<00:05:08.760> up<00:05:09.350> and<00:05:10.350> once<00:05:10.710> there<00:05:11.280> is<00:05:11.400> no

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
is formed up and once there is no

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.400 
is formed up and once there is no
voltage<00:05:11.910> is<00:05:12.240> been<00:05:12.540> trained<00:05:12.840> by<00:05:13.200> this

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
voltage is been trained by this

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.170 
voltage is been trained by this
fertility<00:05:13.620> one<00:05:14.160> of<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.370> wood<00:05:14.520> is<00:05:14.669> over<00:05:15.000> here

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
fertility one of the wood is over here

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.690 
fertility one of the wood is over here

the gate for maybe one microsecond so

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.940 
the gate for maybe one microsecond so
for<00:05:41.970> my<00:05:42.150> microsecond<00:05:42.930> maybe<00:05:43.169> this<00:05:43.470> third<00:05:43.740> will

for my microsecond maybe this third will
come

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
come

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:45.909

what they inform of maybe two or three

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.309 
what they inform of maybe two or three
more<00:05:46.279> and<00:05:46.939> similarly<00:05:47.389> this<00:05:47.659> is<00:05:47.719> an<00:05:47.990> ending

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 
more and similarly this is an ending

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.209 
more and similarly this is an ending
down<00:05:48.919> by<00:05:49.309> the<00:05:49.370> go<00:05:49.669> right<00:05:49.909> analyst<00:05:50.779> me<00:05:51.169> out<00:05:51.559> zero

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
down by the go right analyst me out zero

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:55.959 
down by the go right analyst me out zero
over<00:05:52.309> here<00:05:52.960> so<00:05:53.960> what<00:05:54.589> we<00:05:54.860> get<00:05:55.099> over<00:05:55.309> here<00:05:55.699> is

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:55.969 
over here so what we get over here is

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.929 
over here so what we get over here is
nothing<00:05:56.389> but<00:05:56.509> I<00:05:56.809> mean<00:05:56.990> a<00:05:57.020> pulse<00:05:57.379> of<00:05:57.620> would<00:05:57.939> this

00:05:58.929 --> 00:05:58.939 
nothing but I mean a pulse of would this

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.049 
nothing but I mean a pulse of would this
we<00:05:59.689> send<00:06:00.050> it<00:06:00.199> to<00:06:00.409> any<00:06:00.710> happen<00:06:01.129> so<00:06:01.370> every

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:02.059 
we send it to any happen so every

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:05.049 
we send it to any happen so every
motherhood<00:06:02.659> they<00:06:02.960> start<00:06:03.349> or<00:06:03.589> laptop<00:06:04.219> it's<00:06:04.789> a

motherhood they start or laptop it's a

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:08.769 
motherhood they start or laptop it's a
very<00:06:05.479> very<00:06:06.080> important<00:06:06.770> that<00:06:07.430> you<00:06:07.699> will<00:06:08.089> have<00:06:08.419> a

in happens over here in a desktop you

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.809 
in happens over here in a desktop you
generally<00:06:12.319> find<00:06:12.499> a<00:06:12.680> prototype<00:06:13.159> of<00:06:13.339> inductance

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:13.819 
generally find a prototype of inductance

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:15.999 
generally find a prototype of inductance
in<00:06:14.389> case<00:06:14.569> of<00:06:14.719> a<00:06:14.809> laptop<00:06:15.050> you<00:06:15.349> find<00:06:15.620> generally<00:06:15.979> a

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009 
in case of a laptop you find generally a

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.519 
in case of a laptop you find generally a
box<00:06:16.279> safe<00:06:16.550> of<00:06:16.729> inductors<00:06:17.240> the<00:06:17.779> analysis<00:06:18.409> will

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:18.529 
box safe of inductors the analysis will

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.909 
box safe of inductors the analysis will
be<00:06:18.560> there<00:06:18.919> and<00:06:19.909> from<00:06:20.389> thee<00:06:20.629> that<00:06:20.900> is<00:06:21.139> you<00:06:21.770> will

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
be there and from thee that is you will

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.329 
be there and from thee that is you will
find<00:06:22.189> in<00:06:22.520> very<00:06:22.879> low<00:06:23.300> ohms<00:06:23.629> resistance<00:06:24.409> and

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:25.339 
find in very low ohms resistance and

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.100 
find in very low ohms resistance and
then<00:06:25.699> you<00:06:25.819> throw<00:06:26.180> on<00:06:26.270> one<00:06:26.419> second<00:06:26.839> for<00:06:26.870> the

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
then you throw on one second for the

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.689 
then you throw on one second for the
circuit<00:06:27.439> diagram<00:06:27.560> what<00:06:27.919> is<00:06:28.009> the<00:06:28.129> use<00:06:28.279> of<00:06:28.310> that

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
circuit diagram what is the use of that

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.170 
circuit diagram what is the use of that
and<00:06:29.830> after<00:06:30.830> that<00:06:30.949> you<00:06:31.099> will<00:06:31.129> find<00:06:31.490> some<00:06:31.789> series

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
and after that you will find some series

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.889 
and after that you will find some series
of<00:06:32.389> capsules<00:06:33.759> see<00:06:34.759> these<00:06:34.909> are<00:06:35.089> capsules<00:06:35.569> maybe

a<00:07:47.830> straight<00:07:48.159> line<00:07:48.459> so<00:07:49.240> this<00:07:49.779> is<00:07:50.379> nothing<00:07:51.039> but

00:07:51.059 --> 00:07:51.069 
a straight line so this is nothing but

a straight line so this is nothing but
the<00:07:51.639> voltage<00:07:51.819> which<00:07:52.240> is<00:07:52.360> required<00:07:52.779> by<00:07:52.869> the<00:07:53.050> CPU

the voltage which is required by the CPU
now<00:07:54.069> I<00:07:54.430> just<00:07:55.119> show

now I just show

now I just show
so<00:07:56.469> this<00:07:56.649> line<00:07:56.860> so<00:07:57.189> here<00:08:00.119> this<00:08:01.119> is<00:08:01.389> nothing<00:08:01.689> but
