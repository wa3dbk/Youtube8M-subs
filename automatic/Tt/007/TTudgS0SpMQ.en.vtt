00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.150
 the staff 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:16.190
 some people were having doubts 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:24.080
 with regard to the activation of daylight and 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:28.400
 misty heat here see then how 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.770
 I do to activate the new panel 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.810
 I need to take apart anything 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.800
 He takes a little light down here. 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.590
 tec 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.270
 however it is necessary that the car already has 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.950
 predisposition is the wire in the connector and 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.410
 you need in addition has the key 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.329
 original that many mile headlights today 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:56.210
 you do not come for a very high value 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.550
 then and we will do we can 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.100
 be putting up that right lamp 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.200
 now he will be putting her without 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.890
 be in the contacts 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.479
 this contact and will pick up the external wire 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:18.340
 which in positive negative going to the 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:18.340
 key of the fog lamp or relay ok 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.409
 You get here give a lap like it 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.119
 without making contact with it for 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.720
 that does not cause any type of 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.720
 problem 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.659
 Okay, he's going to be independent. 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.820
 stay here only supported and what if this is 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:46.970
 The sound is bad with 12 thousand soldiers. 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.920
 in 10 or the second option is you are 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.100
 using led and voting using a led 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.100
 White 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.879
 So you have to go back and do it here. 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.450
 to put an electrical tape 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.730
 in the hole here tightly led 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.640
 came in tight tight back there to do 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.370
 a connection of the child because with 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.109
 original tea lamp I have to 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:46.239
 be careful not to let them do 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:49.959
 contact and why is that in one of these 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.689
 contacts here will have a negative that is 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.970
 connected all over the board if suddenly in the 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.639
 installation time I make contact here 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.909
 with the original pine lamp and with 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:04.689
 can damage the panel because there 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.730
 close short isolate if you are with 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:10.299
 the original mud but with led is much more 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.459
 simple dollar and it completely goes 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.459
 being only doing the same lighting 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.769
 thicken 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.120
 is another thing he already comes with a painted 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.340
 then it 's no use you put him 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.670
 fault 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.489
 it is green regardless of which side 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.819
 Do you miss it or come to reflect? 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.819
 very 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.290
 you already realize that he came in but he 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.280
 it's a little loose so do not put 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.280
 more precise the steering wheel 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:12.659
 good then and how was a beast seeing a 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.709
 led insulated well insulated so that no 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:21.570
 there is no contact with the circuit 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.280
 board had not seen the unifying thread and 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.870
 I can suddenly get up a little bit 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.090
 this screw 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.630
 I'm going to make it lift the 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.590
 screw and spent here below and or 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.479
 fixed will not risk leaving it then 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:42.599
 like most fog lights and 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.979
 come with a key that does not have 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.750
 lighting 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.340
 so this is a hand on the wheel back to 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.340
 call here but you already the panel 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.230
 in this case you also have a headlight 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.180
 rear fog is here on the other side 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:11.230
 there is also an illumination here 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:14.830
 on the other side has some other 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.830
 items here too 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:25.580
 the safety car to the belt of 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:30.230
 can only be activated if you 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:35.120
 Belt sensor in hand only 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:41.960
 that we have here the traction control and 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:44.740
 stability then this is now the ps 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.330
 positive is finding positive linking 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.790
 in the positive that only comes when the price 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.000
 on the key and the relay opens and a negative 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:06:03.230
 on the plate or negative of some other 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:06.620
 Well, then, it's okay, a way I did. 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:08.720
 the client's authorization in the best way 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.600
 I was out of silicone glue to with 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.210
 led then I talked to him about the 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.990
 possibility of being with sam is to put 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:20.090
 insulation tape making the pressure and gave 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.110
 right 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:32.150
 as it has a universal key drop 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:34.270
 very strong here a universal key is a 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:42.770
 hand on the wheel with which he will be able to know 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:46.640
 when connected or does not know universal 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:49.100
 that it uses the no indication then it is 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.390
 complicated he can already forget the 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:57.520
 fog lamp with shannon denied 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:07:01.580
 so the connection is very simple look only 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:09.470
 that the defendant is beauty 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:12.889
 the song will 85 positive and 8 September 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.900
 negative beauty 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:17.270
 if forlÃ¡n for the same thing 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.180
 the lamp you do not have to worry about 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:25.520
 polarity only told who 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:27.439
 on these two good connectors my car o 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.180
 relay to stay in front 

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:30.830
 in the engine vault that I can 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.430
 I do be coming directly here 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.430
 in the key 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:41.889
 When I do it 's positive 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:44.840
 as the team is true test 

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:48.050
 I'll get negative LED placed 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:51.199
 negative on back 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:54.349
 Here in this key then is this beauty 

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:55.310
 Tip for you is something simple to 

00:07:54.349 --> 00:08:00.949
 do 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:04.039
 but very useful because you will have 

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:07.400
 a preview of when your headlight 

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:09.770
 of fog is linked to beauty 

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.779
 If you liked the video of olic no 

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.849
 forget to like our page on 

00:08:11.779 --> 00:08:16.569
 facebook on leaving 

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:16.569
 a big hug
