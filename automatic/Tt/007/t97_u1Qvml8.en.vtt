belt ok first step is to trace out the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.090 
belt ok first step is to trace out the
CD<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.969> cardboard<00:01:00.480> which<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.079> already<00:01:01.260> did<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
CD on cardboard which I already did and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.230 
CD on cardboard which I already did and
then<00:01:02.969> next<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.960> cut<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.559> out<00:01:08.240> just

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
then next you have to cut it out just

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.100 
then next you have to cut it out just
might<00:01:09.510> take<00:01:09.780> them<00:01:09.930> in

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.770 

and<00:01:17.110> cardboard<00:01:17.530> kind<00:01:18.220> of<00:01:18.400> gets<00:01:18.820> hard<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.300> cut

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
and cardboard kind of gets hard to cut

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.380 
and cardboard kind of gets hard to cut
so<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:23.619> we<00:01:23.650> best<00:01:24.040> if<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.400> use<00:01:24.640> like<00:01:24.850> sharper

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
so if we best if you use like sharper

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.540 
so if we best if you use like sharper
scissors<00:01:26.400> big<00:01:27.400> ones<00:01:27.670> like<00:01:27.850> she<00:01:28.060> is<00:01:28.180> using<00:01:29.550> not
