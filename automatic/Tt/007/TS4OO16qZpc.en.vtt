really go outside
well<00:05:28.690> I<00:05:28.720> could<00:05:29.009> could<00:05:30.009> I<00:05:30.580> just<00:05:31.210> prefer<00:05:31.479> not<00:05:31.690> to

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
well I could could I just prefer not to

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.450 
well I could could I just prefer not to
because<00:05:32.169> I<00:05:32.380> don't<00:05:32.440> really<00:05:32.830> like<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.130> rain<00:05:33.280> or

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
because I don't really like the rain or

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.170 
because I don't really like the rain or
that<00:05:33.610> much<00:05:33.759> but
