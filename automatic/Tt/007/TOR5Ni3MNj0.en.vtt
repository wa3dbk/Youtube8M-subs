vlog<00:02:03.619> lot<00:02:04.130> more<00:02:04.310> than<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:04.490> wanted<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.970> be

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
vlog lot more than I wanted it to be

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.760 
vlog lot more than I wanted it to be
mostly<00:02:05.780> just<00:02:05.960> because<00:02:06.229> we<00:02:06.350> didn't<00:02:06.500> go<00:02:06.590> up<00:02:06.680> and

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
mostly just because we didn't go up and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.899 
mostly just because we didn't go up and
play<00:02:06.860> in<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.009> snow<00:02:07.070> as<00:02:07.310> much<00:02:07.460> as<00:02:07.579> I<00:02:07.670> thought<00:02:07.850> we

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
play in the snow as much as I thought we

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.999 
play in the snow as much as I thought we
would<00:02:08.209> because<00:02:09.140> we<00:02:09.320> did<00:02:09.440> not<00:02:09.470> dress<00:02:09.769> very

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
would because we did not dress very

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.620 
would because we did not dress very
appropriately<00:02:10.610> for<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:10.970> snow<00:02:11.269> we<00:02:11.510> weren't

appropriately for the snow we weren't

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.060 
appropriately for the snow we weren't
prepared<00:02:11.750> for<00:02:12.049> it<00:02:12.290> but<00:02:12.650> that's<00:02:12.769> okay<00:02:13.040> because

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
prepared for it but that's okay because

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.000 
prepared for it but that's okay because
