00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.199 
different guides and that time we had a
bear<00:02:25.340> we<00:02:25.700> renamed<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.390> mushroom<00:02:27.459> one<00:02:28.459> night<00:02:28.730> we

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
bear we renamed it mushroom one night we

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.949 
bear we renamed it mushroom one night we
spotted<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:30.019> big<00:02:30.560> big<00:02:31.040> track<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:32.000> grizzly<00:02:32.690> bears

so<00:02:33.230> we<00:02:33.379> were<00:02:33.500> really<00:02:33.769> worried<00:02:34.160> because<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.940> was

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
so we were really worried because it was

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.490 
so we were really worried because it was
for<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.420> last<00:02:35.629> three<00:02:35.870> days<00:02:36.019> that<00:02:36.080> we<00:02:36.470> were

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
for the last three days that we were

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.890 
for the last three days that we were
going<00:02:37.099> back<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.580> same<00:02:37.760> spot<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.720> we

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
going back to the same spot but we

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.080 
going back to the same spot but we
didn't<00:02:39.230> see<00:02:39.379> mushroom<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:40.040> we<00:02:40.730> were<00:02:40.849> thinking

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
didn't see mushroom so we were thinking

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.160 
didn't see mushroom so we were thinking
hmm<00:02:41.690> maybe<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:43.190> grizzly<00:02:43.610> caught<00:02:43.819> him<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.810> so

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
hmm maybe the grizzly caught him and so

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.900 
hmm maybe the grizzly caught him and so
was<00:02:45.410> at<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.709> end<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.069> day<00:02:46.220> five<00:02:46.549> o'clock

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
was at the end of the day five o'clock

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.880 
was at the end of the day five o'clock
if<00:02:47.120> Marvin<00:02:47.390> say<00:02:47.599> okay<00:02:47.900> I'm<00:02:48.019> gonna<00:02:48.200> go<00:02:48.440> take<00:02:48.769> the
