00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:34.400 
there's a 1 mil yep
nice<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:28.520> deep<00:02:29.520> cut<00:02:32.900> straight<00:02:33.900> against<00:02:34.230> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
nice and deep cut straight against the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:42.580 
nice and deep cut straight against the
line<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:40.710> that's<00:02:40.860> all<00:02:41.100> that's<00:02:41.310> left<00:02:41.490> behind

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
line and that's all that's left behind

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.140 
line and that's all that's left behind
pretty<00:02:43.590> straight<00:02:43.980> I'm<00:02:44.250> happy<00:02:44.730> with<00:02:44.850> that

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.590 

now<00:02:51.650> touching<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.280> tape<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.180> little<00:02:54.480> as

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
now touching the tape as little as

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.680 
now touching the tape as little as
possible<00:02:55.160> we're<00:02:56.160> going<00:02:56.460> to<00:02:56.670> apply<00:02:57.360> as

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
possible we're going to apply as

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:09.310 
possible we're going to apply as
straightest<00:02:58.380> we<00:02:58.650> humanly<00:02:59.220> can<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> piece

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.860 

so<00:03:10.320> we've<00:03:10.860> got<00:03:11.100> something<00:03:11.370> straight<00:03:11.970> like

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
so we've got something straight like

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:20.300 
so we've got something straight like
this<00:03:17.510> got<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> little<00:03:18.750> bit<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.960> a<00:03:19.050> dag<00:03:19.320> piece<00:03:19.650> you

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
this got a little bit of a dag piece you

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.890 
this got a little bit of a dag piece you
can<00:03:20.460> always<00:03:20.580> do<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.850> very<00:03:21.150> straight<00:03:21.600> cut

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
can always do a very straight cut

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:31.230 
can always do a very straight cut
without<00:03:22.470> damaging<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.550> paintwork

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.750 

there<00:03:32.170> we<00:03:32.260> go<00:03:34.110> as<00:03:35.110> we<00:03:35.410> could<00:03:35.560> see<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:36.190> masking

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
there we go as we could see the masking

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.310 
there we go as we could see the masking
is<00:03:37.770> nice<00:03:38.770> and<00:03:39.450> covering<00:03:40.450> all<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.750> pieces<00:03:40.990> that

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
is nice and covering all the pieces that

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.280 
is nice and covering all the pieces that
I<00:03:41.440> want<00:03:41.790> when<00:03:42.790> another<00:03:43.270> color<00:03:43.630> is<00:03:43.780> applied<00:03:44.110> on

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
I want when another color is applied on

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.430 
I want when another color is applied on
top<00:03:44.790> then<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.880> tape<00:03:46.090> is<00:03:46.270> removed<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:47.050> color

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
top then the tape is removed the color

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.870 
top then the tape is removed the color
underneath<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:48.100> tape<00:03:48.340> will<00:03:48.550> still<00:03:48.760> be

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
underneath the tape will still be

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.010 
underneath the tape will still be
retained<00:03:49.270> a<00:03:49.570> good<00:03:50.470> hint<00:03:50.770> when<00:03:51.660> painting<00:03:52.660> which

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
retained a good hint when painting which

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.440 
retained a good hint when painting which
I<00:03:53.200> did<00:03:53.470> recommend<00:03:53.800> lacquer<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.490> be<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.880> best

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
I did recommend lacquer to be the best

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.900 
I did recommend lacquer to be the best
for<00:03:55.720> masking<00:03:56.520> even<00:03:57.520> though<00:03:57.610> it's<00:03:57.760> not

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
for masking even though it's not
