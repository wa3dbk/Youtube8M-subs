00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
device and you can go into a store have

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.450 
device and you can go into a store have
that<00:01:49.320> associate<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:49.950> trying<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.189> sell<00:01:50.369> it

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that associate that's trying to sell it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
that associate that's trying to sell it
to<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.640> take<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> take<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.869> out<00:01:51.960> of

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
to you take it out of the take it out of

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.660 
to you take it out of the take it out of
the<00:01:52.170> packaging<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.130> you'll<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.579> an

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the packaging so you'll get an

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.980 
the packaging so you'll get an
opportunity<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.180> see<00:01:54.329> what<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.570> feels<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
opportunity to see what it feels like a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.780 
opportunity to see what it feels like a
sieve<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> time

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
sieve is right for you so in the time

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.719 
sieve is right for you so in the time
something<00:01:57.270> looks<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.780> lot<00:01:58.140> better<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> case

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
something looks a lot better in the case

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.880 
something looks a lot better in the case
then<00:01:59.909> actually<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.110> end<00:02:01.350> up<00:02:01.409> either

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
then actually is and you end up either

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.310 
then actually is and you end up either
having<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> make<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> return<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.659> living<00:02:04.170> with

want so let's pop this guy out and see
what<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:23.129> end<00:02:23.160> up<00:02:23.489> with<00:02:23.550> I'm<00:02:24.150> gonna<00:02:24.330> start

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
what we end up with I'm gonna start

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.479 
what we end up with I'm gonna start
together<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.930> little<00:02:25.200> piece<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.650> adhesive<00:02:25.830> glue

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
together a little piece of adhesive glue

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.420 
together a little piece of adhesive glue
there<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.060> almost<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.480> silicone<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
there like I almost like a silicone and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.520 
there like I almost like a silicone and
it's<00:02:29.430> real<00:02:29.670> simple<00:02:29.879> construction<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:31.049> snaps

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
it's real simple construction it snaps

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.070 
it's real simple construction it snaps
in<00:02:31.950> here<00:02:32.430> as<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.640> can<00:02:32.849> see<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.540> just<00:02:33.840> pull

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
in here as you can see and you just pull

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.710 
in here as you can see and you just pull
that<00:02:34.290> back<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:35.549> nuts<00:02:35.760> right<00:02:35.970> out<00:02:36.120> so

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that back and it's nuts right out so

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.500 
that back and it's nuts right out so
it's<00:02:37.440> just<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> whole<00:02:38.010> lot<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:39.330> has<00:02:39.480> a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
it's just not a whole lot to it it has a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.860 
it's just not a whole lot to it it has a
inner<00:02:39.900> plate<00:02:40.260> here<00:02:40.620> which<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.870> doesn't

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
inner plate here which really doesn't

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.839 
inner plate here which really doesn't
say<00:02:43.170> anything<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.310> says<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.640> same

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
say anything it just says the same

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.039 
say anything it just says the same
things<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.209> are<00:02:45.420> on<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> back<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.840> just

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
things that are on the back that just

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.350 
things that are on the back that just
read<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.829> couple<00:02:47.040> different

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
languages and this is it so it's got

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.319 
languages and this is it so it's got
some<00:02:52.049> rubber<00:02:52.530> strips<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.489> there<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.940> kind<00:02:54.120> of

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
some rubber strips in there to kind of

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.780 
some rubber strips in there to kind of
padded<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.799> slides<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.489> out<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.730> your

padded as it slides in and out of your
device<00:02:57.739> there's<00:02:58.739> another<00:02:59.040> one<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.280> those

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
device there's another one of those

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.030 
device there's another one of those
rubber<00:02:59.579> strips<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:01.019> got<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.349> soft<00:03:01.769> touch

anything<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:14.220> adds<00:05:14.400> very<00:05:14.729> minimal<00:05:15.240> weight<00:05:15.450> to

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
anything it adds very minimal weight to

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.570 
anything it adds very minimal weight to
the<00:05:15.750> phone<00:05:15.990> but<00:05:16.530> most<00:05:16.800> importantly<00:05:17.340> it

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
the phone but most importantly it

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.120 
the phone but most importantly it
doesn't<00:05:17.940> add<00:05:18.210> much<00:05:18.570> of<00:05:19.169> any<00:05:19.320> width<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:19.979> the
