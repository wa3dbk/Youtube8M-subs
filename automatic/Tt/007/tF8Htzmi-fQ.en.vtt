we're going to take the shape of an E

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.639 
we're going to take the shape of an E
minor<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.840> that's<00:00:33.989> going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.320> our<00:00:34.410> first

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
minor and that's going to be our first

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.200 
minor and that's going to be our first
chord<00:00:34.950> we're<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.610> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.760> call<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
chord we're just going to call that a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.119 
chord we're just going to call that a
minor<00:00:36.420> 7<00:00:36.870> that's<00:00:36.989> actually<00:00:37.350> all<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.770> so

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
minor 7 that's actually all that is so

minor 7 that's actually all that is so
you<00:00:38.610> can<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:38.790> try<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.360> chord<00:00:39.780> now

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
you can actually try this chord now

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.780 
you can actually try this chord now
instead<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.829> regular<00:00:40.980> Imai<00:00:41.579> 'nor

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
instead of a regular Imai 'nor

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.049 
instead of a regular Imai 'nor
and<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.540> see<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.670> ok<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.700> that's

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and just see if you like it ok so that's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.220 
and just see if you like it ok so that's
a<00:00:45.239> minor<00:00:45.450> 7<00:00:46.129> then<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.520> simply<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:48.960> middle

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
a minor 7 then I simply take my middle

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.010 
a minor 7 then I simply take my middle
finger<00:00:49.500> off<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:51.090> play<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.420> there<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
finger off and play it right there and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.840 
finger off and play it right there and
now<00:00:52.289> we<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.890> G<00:00:53.219> major<00:00:53.699> chord<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:55.850> next

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
now we have a G major chord the next

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.819 
now we have a G major chord the next
thing<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.420> called<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.690> D<00:00:57.989> suspended

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
thing we have is called a D suspended

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.660 
thing we have is called a D suspended
fourth<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.670> D<00:01:00.059> sus<00:01:00.359> four<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.340> if<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.520> Heat

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
fourth or D sus four and if it's Heat

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.420 
fourth or D sus four and if it's Heat
for<00:01:02.879> me<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.239> easier<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:04.220> keep<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.400> mind

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
for me it's easier to just keep in mind

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.490 
for me it's easier to just keep in mind
that<00:01:05.700> I'm<00:01:05.790> keeping<00:01:05.909> those<00:01:06.210> glued<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.290> just

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that I'm keeping those glued and I just

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.429 
that I'm keeping those glued and I just
go<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> what<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.950> think<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> D<00:01:08.909> chord<00:01:09.439> like

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
go to what I think of as a D chord like

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.710 
go to what I think of as a D chord like
that<00:01:10.970> even<00:01:11.970> though<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> middle<00:01:12.390> finger<00:01:12.659> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that even though the middle finger is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
that even though the middle finger is
not<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.229> notes<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:13.680> even<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.040> there<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
not that notes not even in there so you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.660 
not that notes not even in there so you
could<00:01:14.960> just<00:01:15.960> move<00:01:16.320> your<00:01:16.470> first<00:01:16.770> finger<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
could just move your first finger to the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.670 
could just move your first finger to the
second<00:01:18.000> fret<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> g<00:01:18.509> string<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.470> have

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
second fret of the g string and you have

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.120 
second fret of the g string and you have
the<00:01:19.979> d<00:01:20.189> sus<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.119> need<00:01:21.740> then<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> next

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the d sus for that we need then the next

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.080 
the d sus for that we need then the next
thing<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.400> need<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.850> an<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:25.130> well<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.430> 7sus4

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
thing we need is an a well it's a 7sus4

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.940 
thing we need is an a well it's a 7sus4
is<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.600> we'd<00:01:27.750> call<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.380> basically<00:01:28.770> we

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
is what we'd call it but basically we

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.499 
is what we'd call it but basically we
just<00:01:29.100> move<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.460> finger<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:30.329> play

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
just move that finger up and we play

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.469 
just move that finger up and we play
that<00:01:33.020> ok<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.079> once<00:01:34.380> again<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.710> chords<00:01:34.979> are

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
that ok so once again the chords are

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:47.679 
that ok so once again the chords are
Imai<00:01:36.479> nur<00:01:36.540> 7<00:01:38.570> G<00:01:39.570> major<00:01:39.840> D<00:01:41.780> sus<00:01:42.780> 4<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:45.119> 7<00:01:45.840> sus<00:01:46.290> 4

ok<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.049> getting<00:01:49.350> used<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.860> these

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
ok so if you're getting used to these

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.310 
ok so if you're getting used to these
chord<00:01:50.460> shapes<00:01:50.759> what<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.229> can

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
chord shapes what you can do is you can

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.620 
chord shapes what you can do is you can
actually<00:01:52.439> go<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.250> could<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.630> just

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
actually go like this you could on just

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.840 
actually go like this you could on just
strum<00:01:54.899> each<00:01:55.079> chord<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.590> once<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
strum each chord down once to get the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
strum each chord down once to get the
chord<00:01:57.060> shapes<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.840> then<00:01:58.320> start<00:01:58.590> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
chord shapes going and then start to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.929 
chord shapes going and then start to
focus<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> rhythm<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.610> you're<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> little

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
focus on the rhythm if you're a little

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.429 
focus on the rhythm if you're a little
farther<00:02:00.240> along<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.570> your<00:02:00.750> plane<00:02:00.990> then<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:01.320> can

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
farther along in your plane then we can

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.410 
farther along in your plane then we can
just<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:01.770> right<00:02:01.920> into<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> rhythm<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
just go right into the rhythm but so

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090 
just go right into the rhythm but so
anyway<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.990> think<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.500> good<00:02:04.619> idea<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.890> try

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
anyway I think it's a good idea to try

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:35.590 
anyway I think it's a good idea to try
this<00:02:05.159> if<00:02:05.579> you're<00:02:05.820> still<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> beginner

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.990 

just<00:02:36.260> like<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.650> okay<00:02:37.460> let's<00:02:37.670> break<00:02:37.940> down

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
just like that okay let's break down

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.580 
just like that okay let's break down
this<00:02:38.390> rhythm

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
this rhythm

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:47.470 
this rhythm
the<00:02:39.860> first<00:02:40.100> chord<00:02:43.540> do<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:45.400> down<00:02:46.400> down<00:02:46.910> down

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
and when we go to the G we go which is

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.090 
and when we go to the G we go which is
obviously<00:03:30.710> down<00:03:31.490> up<00:03:31.790> down<00:03:32.090> down<00:03:32.450> down<00:03:33.140> so
