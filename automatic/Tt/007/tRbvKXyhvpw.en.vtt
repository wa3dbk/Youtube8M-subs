00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello and welcome to techniques of 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.109
 sale here victor cabreira and in this 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.179
 short video you will discover what 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.030
 to do so despite all your efforts the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.040
 sale is not concluded and how to avoid 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.220
 to lose future customers 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.490
 indeed it happens regularly that the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.410
 client or that the prospect or ten names it 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 you'll have to get used to it because the sale 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.720
 confronts more than any other activity 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.279
 to failure and rejection and as said 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.140
 my former national sales director 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.899
 when i was at heineken's 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.210
 the sale starts when the customer 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.770
 Oudinot 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.809
 the problem if you give up at 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.450
 first refusal if you deprive yourself 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.910
 a vast majority of customers who do not 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.180
 are not yet totally convinced or 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.520
 who just want to test you 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.870
 so we 'll see how to react in 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.489
 comes out the first case it's a no 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.710
 conditional if it's your first 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.500
 attempt at conclusion this is not the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.280
 moment to give up hanging on and 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.350
 try to get something for 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 this resume the argumentation a 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.150
 change of angle of attack for example 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.520
 because a customer can have multiple 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.850
 needs and motivations saint general the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.590
 case or check that this objection 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.280
 of a cache no others that are more 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.350
 important 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.570
 you must take the time to 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.450
 well dug in order to meet 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.549
 specifically to the objection can 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.250
 also recalled the criteria of choice 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.500
 important using the so-called technique 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.960
 of selection I told you about it in 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.950
 a previous video I will put you the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.619
 link to side but do you put in mind that 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.020
 the conclusion is a perpetual loop 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.920
 until you are confronted with a 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.780
 not categorical 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.810
 incidentally second case you have to 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.590
 to make a categorical no 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.360
 what to do you must preserve the future 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.659
 losing a sale does not necessarily mean 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.070
 say to lose a future customer 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.740
 I recommend this technique and 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.410
 iman often successful be ball players 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.180
 leave and worthily and thank your 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.819
 interlocutor for interest if you 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.280
 been carried forward your regret 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.040
 do not work together wished that 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.049
 the choice made meet expectations 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.239
 from your prospect the goal 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.549
 you will have understood this had triggered 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.209
 a sense of doubt feeling of 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.609
 regret you can also put the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.340
 finger subtly on a sensitive point 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.439
 at random one of the weaknesses of your 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.230
 competitor to play the role of 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.150
 advise your interlocutor 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.829
 will probably be grateful for the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.019
 when I come I also recommend 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.980
 to propose a new meeting to 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.590
 middle term 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.389
 in case the needs evolve in order to 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.189
 take stock of the satisfaction of 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.510
 your prospect 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.359
 this allows you to leave the door 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.790
 open to your contact 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.919
 remember that keeping a customer is 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.989
 more important than a sale they 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:08.319
 be forced and unsuited to reality 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.750
 of the customer do you accept name 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.810
 provisional rather than getting a yes 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.319
 in less schott and toast near 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.049
 client 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.709
 we must always think about the value 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.720
 of the customer avi besides here are some 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.970
 techniques to stay in the landscape 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.829
 of the prospect you have to keep the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.260
 control and foresee follow-up 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:32.139

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.470
 features you also performed

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.799

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.489
 suspense that you did not have the
