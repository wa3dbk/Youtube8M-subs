resolution okay you can find them all

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.889

listed on my video index page which the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.799 
listed on my video index page which the
u.s.<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.530> which<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.920> find<00:00:44.100> here<00:00:44.629> okay<00:00:45.629> and

u.s. of which you can find here okay and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
u.s. of which you can find here okay and
as<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.440> say<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.489> basic<00:00:47.789> stuff

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
as I say if you know the basic stuff

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.850 
as I say if you know the basic stuff
then<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:49.079> what<00:00:49.289> follows<00:00:49.440> should<00:00:49.739> make

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
then all of what follows should make

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.790 
then all of what follows should make
perfect<00:00:50.039> sense<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
perfect sense to you

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.380 
perfect sense to you
okay<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:54.350> obviously<00:00:55.350> different<00:00:56.250> songs<00:00:56.550> have

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
okay so obviously different songs have

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.810 
okay so obviously different songs have
different<00:00:58.260> chord<00:00:58.890> structures<00:00:59.370> different

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
different chord structures different

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.540 
different chord structures different
chord<00:01:00.030> progressions<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:00.780> sequences<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.829> they

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
chord progressions or sequences and they

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.219 
chord progressions or sequences and they
all<00:01:02.609> work<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.090> slightly<00:01:03.300> different<00:01:03.480> ways<00:01:03.809> on

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
all work in slightly different ways on

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.649 
all work in slightly different ways on
the<00:01:04.890> other<00:01:05.010> hand<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:06.030> things<00:01:06.270> in

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the other hand they do have things in

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.460 
the other hand they do have things in
common<00:01:07.850> now<00:01:08.850> what<00:01:09.479> I'm<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> talk<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.409> you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
common now what I'm going to talk to you

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.929 
common now what I'm going to talk to you
about<00:01:10.560> now<00:01:11.010> isn't<00:01:13.100> it<00:01:14.100> isn't<00:01:14.220> directly

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
about now isn't it isn't directly

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.100 
about now isn't it isn't directly
relevant<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.540> doing<00:01:15.810> stuff<00:01:15.930> like

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
relevant to doing stuff like

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.350 
relevant to doing stuff like
improvisation<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.009> playing<00:01:17.220> pop<00:01:17.520> piano<00:01:17.759> but

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
improvisation and playing pop piano but

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.910 
improvisation and playing pop piano but
it's<00:01:18.479> good<00:01:18.689> background<00:01:19.229> knowledge<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.770> have

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
it's good background knowledge to have

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.070 
it's good background knowledge to have
you'll<00:01:20.490> find<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.939> comes<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.479> handy<00:01:21.630> if

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you'll find it comes in really handy if

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.690 
you'll find it comes in really handy if
you<00:01:22.290> ever<00:01:22.320> tried<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.950> start<00:01:23.189> writing<00:01:23.549> your<00:01:23.640> own

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you ever tried to start writing your own

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
you ever tried to start writing your own
songs<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:24.869> find<00:01:25.080> you're

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
songs or if you really find you're

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.670 
songs or if you really find you're
developing<00:01:25.740> improvisations<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
developing improvisations to a

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.030 
developing improvisations to a
particularly<00:01:28.680> intense<00:01:28.950> degree<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:31.040> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
particularly intense degree and the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.330 
particularly intense degree and the
simplest<00:01:32.460> way<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.759> thinking<00:01:33.750> about<00:01:34.710> any<00:01:34.950> chord

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
simplest way of thinking about any chord

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.510 
simplest way of thinking about any chord
progression<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.380> in<00:01:37.380> terms<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.100> being<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
progression is in terms of it being a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.710 
progression is in terms of it being a
journey<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.900> journey<00:01:41.420> starts<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
journey and that journey starts on the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480 
journey and that journey starts on the
tonic<00:01:43.079> chord<00:01:43.439> let's<00:01:43.710> say<00:01:43.920> we're<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> key

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
tonic chord let's say we're in the key

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.380 
tonic chord let's say we're in the key
of<00:01:44.520> C<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.450> would<00:01:45.570> start<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.860> C<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.460> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
of C so it would start in on C and it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.230 
of C so it would start in on C and it
journeys<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:49.110> away<00:01:49.740> from<00:01:49.770> C<00:01:50.310> towards<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
journeys out away from C towards a

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.740 
journeys out away from C towards a
dominant<00:01:51.810> chord<00:01:52.520> probably<00:01:53.520> G<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.600> might

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
dominant chord probably G but it might

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.389 
dominant chord probably G but it might
be<00:01:54.899> another<00:01:55.200> chord<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.040> might<00:01:56.280> be

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
be another chord that's like it might be

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.760 
be another chord that's like it might be
a<00:01:56.430> quasi<00:01:56.759> dominant<00:01:57.149> chord

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
a quasi dominant chord

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
a quasi dominant chord
like<00:01:58.369> D<00:01:58.610> minor<00:01:58.880> 7<00:01:59.750> over<00:02:00.200> G<00:02:00.439> but<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.520> journey

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
like D minor 7 over G but the journey

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.450 
like D minor 7 over G but the journey
out<00:02:02.060> very<00:02:02.780> basically<00:02:03.380> goes<00:02:03.560> from<00:02:03.590> tonic<00:02:04.100> to

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
out very basically goes from tonic to

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.870 
out very basically goes from tonic to
dominant<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:06.110> journey<00:02:06.380> back<00:02:06.799> goes<00:02:07.700> from

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
dominant and the journey back goes from

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.040 
dominant and the journey back goes from
dominant<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:09.380> tonic<00:02:09.819> now<00:02:10.819> within<00:02:11.360> any<00:02:11.660> one

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
dominant to tonic now within any one

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.520 
dominant to tonic now within any one
chord<00:02:12.620> progression<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:14.239> journey<00:02:14.989> might<00:02:15.319> be

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
chord progression that journey might be

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.290 
chord progression that journey might be
repeated<00:02:16.040> over<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.400> over<00:02:16.489> again<00:02:16.700> several

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
repeated over and over again several

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.110 
repeated over and over again several
times<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:18.319> if<00:02:18.590> we<00:02:18.739> think<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.160> really<00:02:19.880> really

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
times so if we think of a really really

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.720 
times so if we think of a really really
very<00:02:20.330> common<00:02:20.630> chord<00:02:21.440> sequence<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.190> E<00:02:22.780> flat<00:02:24.730> C

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
very common chord sequence and E flat C

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.490 
very common chord sequence and E flat C

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
minor 7 F - 7 B flat 7 ok um you you

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.080 
minor 7 F - 7 B flat 7 ok um you you
might<00:02:33.680> know<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:33.890> from<00:02:34.220> songs<00:02:34.459> like<00:02:34.700> um<00:02:34.970> I

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
might know that from songs like um I

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.400 
might know that from songs like um I
think<00:02:35.269> I've<00:02:35.360> given<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.720> as<00:02:35.810> an<00:02:35.900> example<00:02:36.319> before

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
think I've given it as an example before

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.600 
think I've given it as an example before
but<00:02:36.769> sounds<00:02:37.130> like<00:02:37.250> blue<00:02:37.430> moon<00:02:37.670> bloom<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:40.400> saw

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
but sounds like blue moon bloom you saw

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.350 
but sounds like blue moon bloom you saw
me<00:02:40.819> standing<00:02:40.880> alone<00:02:42.489> without<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.730> dream<00:02:43.910> in<00:02:44.150> my

me standing alone without a dream in my
heart<00:02:45.370> without<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.640> love<00:02:46.819> of<00:02:47.030> my<00:02:47.239> own<00:02:47.420> and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
heart without a love of my own and

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.100 
heart without a love of my own and
that's<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.160> really<00:02:49.340> superb<00:02:49.700> example<00:02:50.450> of<00:02:51.049> the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
that's a really superb example of the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.050 
that's a really superb example of the
principle<00:02:51.260> we're<00:02:51.950> travelling<00:02:52.370> starting<00:02:52.910> on

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
principle we're travelling starting on

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.140 
principle we're travelling starting on
the<00:02:53.209> tonic<00:02:53.450> which<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.840> E<00:02:53.959> flat<00:02:55.000> going<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.090> a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
the tonic which is E flat going to a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.580 
the tonic which is E flat going to a
chord<00:02:56.330> that's<00:02:56.450> slightly<00:02:56.720> different<00:02:56.930> um<00:02:58.450> C<00:02:59.450> -<00:02:59.720> C

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
chord that's slightly different um C - C

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.310 
chord that's slightly different um C - C
minor<00:03:00.769> 7<00:03:01.269> slightly<00:03:02.269> different<00:03:02.570> still<00:03:02.840> until

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
minor 7 slightly different still until

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.699 
minor 7 slightly different still until
we<00:03:03.500> reach<00:03:03.769> a<00:03:04.239> far<00:03:05.239> furthest<00:03:05.930> out<00:03:06.079> point<00:03:06.410> if<00:03:06.620> you

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
we reach a far furthest out point if you

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.110 
we reach a far furthest out point if you
like<00:03:06.829> which<00:03:07.070> is<00:03:07.100> a<00:03:07.220> dominant<00:03:07.700> dominant

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
like which is a dominant dominant

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.630 
like which is a dominant dominant
seventh<00:03:08.450> B<00:03:08.600> flat<00:03:08.810> 7<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.380> case<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.920> then

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
seventh B flat 7 in this case and then

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.979 
seventh B flat 7 in this case and then
we<00:03:10.970> return<00:03:11.390> back<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.950> tonic<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.549> the

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
we return back to the tonic and the

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.880 
we return back to the tonic and the
sequence<00:03:14.989> starts<00:03:15.079> again<00:03:15.440> so<00:03:15.560> we're<00:03:15.680> traveling

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
sequence starts again so we're traveling

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.060 
sequence starts again so we're traveling
out<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.209> dominant<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:17.959> then<00:03:18.680> back<00:03:18.859> to<00:03:18.980> the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
out to the dominant and then back to the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.840 
out to the dominant and then back to the
tonic<00:03:19.959> ok<00:03:21.130> let's<00:03:22.130> think<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.430> another<00:03:22.609> famous

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
tonic ok let's think of another famous

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.590 
tonic ok let's think of another famous
example<00:03:24.250> let's<00:03:25.250> look<00:03:25.549> at<00:03:25.760> when<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.299> saints<00:03:26.540> go

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
example let's look at when the saints go

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.190 
example let's look at when the saints go
marching<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:27.200> in<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.500> key<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.709> C

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200

tooji<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.469> dominant<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.159> we've<00:03:41.370> gone<00:03:41.549> from

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
tooji the dominant so we've gone from

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.819 
tooji the dominant so we've gone from
the<00:03:41.969> tonic<00:03:42.329> all<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.290> way<00:03:43.409> out<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.739> the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
the tonic all the way out to the

see<00:04:02.170> we're<00:04:02.709> stuck<00:04:02.980> where<00:04:03.249> everything's

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
see we're stuck where everything's

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.910 
see we're stuck where everything's
happening<00:04:04.510> around<00:04:04.659> the<00:04:05.319> tonic<00:04:05.590> chord<00:04:05.739> which

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
happening around the tonic chord which

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.220 
happening around the tonic chord which
is<00:04:05.950> called<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.340> C<00:04:06.519> major<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.120> we're<00:04:07.629> going<00:04:08.019> out

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
is called a C major and we're going out

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.410 
is called a C major and we're going out
and<00:04:08.650> back<00:04:08.889> out<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.519> back<00:04:09.700> sometimes<00:04:10.269> you're

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
and back out and back sometimes you're

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.039 
and back out and back sometimes you're
only<00:04:10.540> getting<00:04:10.750> as<00:04:10.959> far<00:04:11.200> as<00:04:11.500> an<00:04:12.150> F<00:04:13.150> minor<00:04:13.629> before

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
only getting as far as an F minor before

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.180 
only getting as far as an F minor before
coming<00:04:14.290> back<00:04:14.319> to<00:04:14.620> C<00:04:15.150> but<00:04:16.150> most<00:04:16.389> of<00:04:16.539> the<00:04:16.599> time

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
coming back to C but most of the time

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.170 
coming back to C but most of the time
it's<00:04:18.190> very<00:04:19.090> strongly<00:04:19.449> dominant<00:04:19.870> chord<00:04:20.049> like<00:04:20.259> G

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
it's very strongly dominant chord like G

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.950 
it's very strongly dominant chord like G
okay<00:04:22.229> as<00:04:23.229> I<00:04:23.410> say<00:04:23.590> if<00:04:23.800> you<00:04:23.919> look<00:04:24.160> at<00:04:24.720> most<00:04:25.720> songs

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
okay as I say if you look at most songs

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.390 
okay as I say if you look at most songs
that<00:04:26.349> you<00:04:26.410> play<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:26.650> know<00:04:26.800> if<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:26.979> have<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.190> few

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
that you play you know if you have a few

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.710 
that you play you know if you have a few
song<00:04:27.610> books<00:04:27.820> hanging<00:04:28.120> around<00:04:28.300> look<00:04:28.570> at<00:04:28.660> the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
song books hanging around look at the

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.920 
song books hanging around look at the
chord<00:04:28.990> sequences<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:30.009> can<00:04:30.370> be<00:04:30.520> useful<00:04:30.789> not<00:04:31.479> to

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
chord sequences it can be useful not to

moving away from it but always coming

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.879 
moving away from it but always coming
back<00:04:50.199> okay<00:04:50.860> it<00:04:51.639> usually<00:04:52.150> goes<00:04:52.360> via<00:04:53.110> dominant

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
back okay it usually goes via dominant

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.210

whole key of a song changes and let me

whole key of a song changes and let me
give<00:05:07.599> you<00:05:07.659> an<00:05:07.750> example<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:08.409> is<00:05:08.680> if<00:05:09.460> you're

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
give you an example this is if you're

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.140 
give you an example this is if you're
reading<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.150> book<00:05:10.300> this<00:05:11.490> score<00:05:12.490> box<00:05:12.759> plays<00:05:13.000> on

reading the book this score box plays on

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.689 
reading the book this score box plays on
the<00:05:13.210> bottom<00:05:13.419> of<00:05:13.449> page<00:05:13.509> 28<00:05:14.139> and<00:05:14.349> and<00:05:15.310> it's<00:05:15.490> very

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:15.699 
the bottom of page 28 and and it's very

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.159 
the bottom of page 28 and and it's very
simple<00:05:15.970> chord<00:05:16.180> sequence<00:05:16.599> that<00:05:16.720> goes<00:05:16.810> through

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
simple chord sequence that goes through

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.939 
simple chord sequence that goes through
see<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.710> minus<00:05:18.099> seven<00:05:18.580> F<00:05:18.759> G<00:05:19.479> but<00:05:20.110> then<00:05:20.289> modulates

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
see a minus seven F G but then modulates

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.730 
see a minus seven F G but then modulates
into<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.430> key<00:05:21.669> of<00:05:21.880> D<00:05:22.360> flat<00:05:22.389> so<00:05:22.990> that<00:05:23.199> the<00:05:23.380> tonic

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
into the key of D flat so that the tonic

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.740 
into the key of D flat so that the tonic
chord<00:05:23.919> stops<00:05:24.340> being<00:05:24.610> C<00:05:24.849> and<00:05:25.090> starts<00:05:25.389> being<00:05:25.599> D

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
chord stops being C and starts being D

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:38.480 
chord stops being C and starts being D
flat<00:05:26.050> okay<00:05:26.500> I'll<00:05:26.590> play<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:26.830> through

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.159 

there's<00:05:39.030> the<00:05:39.210> modulation

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
there's the modulation

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.080 
there's the modulation
and<00:05:41.800> then<00:05:42.009> we're<00:05:42.129> into<00:05:42.370> d-flat<00:05:44.819> you<00:05:45.819> get<00:05:45.999> the

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
and then we're into d-flat you get the

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.679 
and then we're into d-flat you get the
idea<00:05:46.419> the<00:05:46.599> way<00:05:47.080> that's<00:05:47.439> worked<00:05:47.800> is<00:05:48.009> that<00:05:48.689> we've

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:49.689 
idea the way that's worked is that we've

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.260 
idea the way that's worked is that we've
been<00:05:49.810> in<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.020> key<00:05:50.199> of<00:05:50.289> C<00:05:50.590> where<00:05:51.159> the<00:05:51.270> dominant

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
been in the key of C where the dominant

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.279 
been in the key of C where the dominant
is<00:05:52.689> G<00:05:53.020> but<00:05:53.979> as<00:05:54.039> soon<00:05:54.219> as<00:05:54.249> the<00:05:54.729> chord<00:05:55.330> of<00:05:55.569> a-flat

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
is G but as soon as the chord of a-flat

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.950 
is G but as soon as the chord of a-flat
appears<00:05:56.919> which<00:05:57.370> is<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.639> dominant<00:05:58.029> of<00:05:58.150> D<00:05:58.360> flat

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
appears which is the dominant of D flat

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.779 
appears which is the dominant of D flat
suddenly<00:05:59.590> the<00:05:59.740> sequence<00:06:00.159> starts<00:06:00.520> to<00:06:00.639> want

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
suddenly the sequence starts to want

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.689 
suddenly the sequence starts to want
wants<00:06:01.749> to<00:06:01.840> start<00:06:02.050> resolving<00:06:02.620> back<00:06:03.219> onto<00:06:03.430> D

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
wants to start resolving back onto D

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.239 
wants to start resolving back onto D
flat<00:06:04.029> rather<00:06:04.810> than<00:06:05.080> C<00:06:05.349> okay<00:06:06.009> so<00:06:06.069> that's

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:06.249 
flat rather than C okay so that's

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:09.629 
flat rather than C okay so that's
modulation<00:06:07.020> but<00:06:08.020> basically<00:06:08.529> whatever<00:06:09.400> the

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
modulation but basically whatever the

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.969 
modulation but basically whatever the
tonic<00:06:10.240> chord<00:06:10.689> is<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:11.020> sequence<00:06:11.409> will<00:06:11.560> always

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
tonic chord is the sequence will always

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.439 
tonic chord is the sequence will always
try<00:06:12.219> to<00:06:12.249> come<00:06:12.520> back<00:06:12.639> to<00:06:12.819> it<00:06:12.909> and<00:06:13.090> that's<00:06:13.360> how

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
try to come back to it and that's how

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.450 
try to come back to it and that's how
cause<00:06:13.689> he<00:06:13.870> Quincy's<00:06:14.199> work<00:06:14.409> no<00:06:15.159> matter<00:06:15.340> how

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
cause he Quincy's work no matter how

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.089 
cause he Quincy's work no matter how
complicated<00:06:15.819> a<00:06:16.150> piece<00:06:16.300> of<00:06:16.449> music<00:06:16.779> is

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
complicated a piece of music is

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.110 
complicated a piece of music is
essentially<00:06:18.099> all<00:06:18.279> that's<00:06:18.610> happening<00:06:18.909> is<00:06:19.090> a

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
essentially all that's happening is a

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.200 
essentially all that's happening is a
journey<00:06:19.539> from<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.349> tonic<00:06:20.729> away<00:06:21.729> from<00:06:22.060> the

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
journey from the tonic away from the

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.929 
journey from the tonic away from the
tonic<00:06:22.740> probably<00:06:23.740> out<00:06:24.099> to<00:06:24.310> a<00:06:24.370> dominant<00:06:24.699> chord

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939 
tonic probably out to a dominant chord

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:26.879 
tonic probably out to a dominant chord
and<00:06:25.240> back<00:06:25.479> again<00:06:25.659> and<00:06:26.080> that<00:06:26.469> might<00:06:26.680> happen

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
and back again and that might happen

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:29.189 
and back again and that might happen
several<00:06:27.340> times<00:06:27.759> over<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.539> course<00:06:28.599> of<00:06:28.870> a<00:06:28.960> chord
