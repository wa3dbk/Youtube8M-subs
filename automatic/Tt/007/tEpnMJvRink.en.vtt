00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 welcome to a new video on the day of 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.009
 today I bring you the jailbreak video 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.450
 for ios 6 this is going to be a lot grass 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.189
 simpler to the video that had 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.440
 uploaded where we had to enter via 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.849
 ssh to our device and good many 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.500
 things that we had to do in this 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.240
 occasion we simply need a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.770
 program that is network is not the only thing that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 we are going to have to download are downloaded 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.010
 very fast does not weigh so much and well I'm going 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.840
 to leave the link in the description 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.310
 for mac like for windows this 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.869
 jailbreak is still tester and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.340
 it will only work for them 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.980
 devices that the previous one is saying 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.990
 to go with 4 iphone 3gs and for the ipod 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.430
 fourth - generation touch others 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.899
 devices still have to wait 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.730
 an unter jailbreak that I do not think 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.380
 it should take about one out 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.820
 or two months so good when it comes out 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.530
 it's the airbag obviously I 'll be 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.879
 making the video but for while 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.440
 I tell you we need this program a 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.120
 Once they download it they extract it 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.469
 they take out of the folder where the only thing 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.420
 what they have to do is in case of 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.800
 windows right click and in these 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.329
 options have to look for the one that says 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.129
 open as administrator just what 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.690
 they select in case of mac simply 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.160
 they open it and well once they open the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.780
 program to see that it is very simple 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.460
 they are simply two buttons one that says 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.020
 boil and one where all the rest are 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.940
 things the only thing we have to do is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.439
 press here where it says jailbreak ok a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.610
 Once we are in this window what 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.870
 let's do is connect our 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.220
 device turned off here 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.560
 has paid a quarter ipod touch 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.880
 generation and we're going to press next 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.620
 when pressing next we're going to have to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.900
 press the button for three seconds 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.610
 power then the two buttons for 10 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.560
 seconds and then only the button 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.060
 home for 15 seconds the steps are without 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.320
 release the buttons if they reach 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.670
 wrong everything they can do again 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.960
 so there's no problem so 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.640
 is what is going to do next press and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.170
 make the game of the buttons I'm going to 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.260
 press next and now for three 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.550
 seconds the power button now both 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.550
 for ten seconds 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.640
 and now I release it and only the button 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.200
 of home for 15 seconds or until 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.710
 appear the window are usually like 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 about 10 seconds 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.020
 and ok once he does this we can already 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.610
 drop our device that's here 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.320
 is going to be a robot they are going to appear 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.320
 white letters that is totally normal 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.600
 Ok Kim asks us if we want to install 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.040
 if we are going to select cydia and the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.450
 of battery percentage is optional 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.430
 but I recommend you do so 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.870
 to press in next and now if already 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.130
 start all the jailbreak let's 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.130
 focus here the device 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.820
 Here we see this hard drive that is 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.050
 completely normal do not worry be 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.220
 these letters appear the same is 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.220
 totally normal this 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.210
 ok now we load this pineapple that 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.740
 it is totally normal this is what most 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.730
 it takes so do not worry if you 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.730
 it takes a couple of minutes 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.730
 because once the process is finished 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.110
 let's go to our device we're going to 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.269
 see what is not yet following what 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.319
 we have to do is close redsnow what 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.480
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.730
 reopen we can go here to extras 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.049
 we are going to go here to youth boot this 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.640
 what we are going to do next is what 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.079
 you will have to do every time you 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.790
 turn off your device that's why 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.260
 this is a tethered jailbreak there are times 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.400
 that is going to get stuck in the block 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.500
 There are times to learn and they will not be able to 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.819
 open any application and that's because 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.019
 it's a tethered jailbreak then where 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.420
 we must do this step that we are 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.769
 doing right now the george wood every 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.180
 once your device is turned off so 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.310
 we're just going to press george wood 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.750
 and here we have to connect our 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.159
 device again turned off so 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.599
 is connected what he is going to do is that 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.859
 I'm going to turn it off or once I 'm 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.599
 off and it will let us tighten the 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.040
 button that says next and again there 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.319
 to do it from the steps of the buttons 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.120
 of for three seconds then for ten the 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.319
 two and then only for the fifteen 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.680
 button of hamas and that is what I'm going to 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.680
 do right away 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.879
 they just leave it there normal 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.100
 here is already doing the web wood 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.450
 and good now it's going to turn on 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.250
 it automatically has to appear 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.500
 a pineapple of rex nou then 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.060
 our device is and once 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.320
 is this can already be the network is not and 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.760
 our herb will be ready and 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.459
 as I said everything we did 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.080
 after closing stir it open it from 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.880
 George Wood has to do it every time 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.380
 that device appears now yes we 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.330
 let's go to our device let's see 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.590
 that the icon is already installed ok 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.970
 once you have learned your device 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.980
 they will see that the icon is already 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.030
 installed just open it and good 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.190
 they're going to see what's going to open they're going to do 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.900
 a question that are hacker users 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.480
 or developer simply put you 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.100
 user and in ready and so it's simple go 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.690
 to install still on your device already 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.220
 the jailbreak is done as they saw this 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.930
 gerbert was much simpler than the 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.640
 Previous video I recommend it a lot 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.990
