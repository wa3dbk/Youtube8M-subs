00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
machine so another week that will be up

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.770 
machine so another week that will be up
and<00:02:43.250> running<00:02:43.340> so<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.730> decided<00:02:44.330> to<00:02:44.450> bring<00:02:44.600> it

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
and running so I decided to bring it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.070 
and running so I decided to bring it
home<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.680> drew<00:02:46.670> all<00:02:46.760> over<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.150> basically<00:02:47.630> and

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
home and drew all over it basically and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.320 
home and drew all over it basically and
the<00:02:48.680> reason<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.160> got<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.940> if<00:02:50.150> you've

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
the reason I got this is if you've

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.600 
the reason I got this is if you've
listened<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.780> my<00:02:50.870> other<00:02:51.080> videos<00:02:51.470> I<00:02:51.860> very<00:02:52.550> much
