can stay in front of this high and stay

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.270 
can stay in front of this high and stay
on<00:04:40.520> starboard<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.740> continue<00:04:42.740> in<00:04:42.949> a<00:04:43.099> nice

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.950 

sound<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.949> we're<00:04:52.330> throwing<00:04:53.330> our<00:04:53.449> eggs<00:04:53.689> into

the northerly route trying to go as fast
as<00:04:56.360> we<00:04:56.479> possibly<00:04:56.509> can<00:04:57.169> we're<00:04:58.069> pushing<00:04:58.310> pretty

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
as we possibly can we're pushing pretty

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.089 
as we possibly can we're pushing pretty
hard<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.870> see<00:05:00.199> how<00:05:00.349> fans<00:05:00.650> out<00:05:00.830> it's<00:05:00.949> pretty

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
hard and see how fans out it's pretty

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.920 
hard and see how fans out it's pretty
complicated<00:05:01.370> there's<00:05:01.939> lots<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.270> those<00:05:02.449> again

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
complicated there's lots of those again

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.529 
complicated there's lots of those again
but<00:05:03.289> the<00:05:03.439> first<00:05:03.650> challenge<00:05:03.919> is<00:05:04.219> try<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:05.360> stay

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
but the first challenge is try and stay

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.839 
but the first challenge is try and stay
on<00:05:05.569> the<00:05:05.689> back<00:05:05.900> of<00:05:05.930> ham<00:05:06.259> and<00:05:06.560> avoid<00:05:07.189> that<00:05:07.520> the

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
on the back of ham and avoid that the

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.200 
on the back of ham and avoid that the
high<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:09.620> breeze<00:05:09.860> has<00:05:09.889> started<00:05:10.669> to<00:05:10.789> die<00:05:10.969> abit

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
high the breeze has started to die abit

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.939 
high the breeze has started to die abit
for<00:05:11.389> the<00:05:11.449> teams<00:05:11.689> as<00:05:11.930> the<00:05:12.289> high<00:05:12.409> pressure<00:05:12.620> moves

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:12.949

in<00:05:13.129> and<00:05:13.310> as<00:05:13.789> will<00:05:14.000> said<00:05:14.030> it's<00:05:14.389> forcing<00:05:14.719> them

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
in and as will said it's forcing them

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.899
