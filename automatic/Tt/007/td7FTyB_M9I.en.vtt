00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.819
 VAZ 2112 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.069
 again characteristic malfunction 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.269
 motor inherent 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.219
 proper car complaint 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.410
 There is a lot of client to take 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.830
 oils one of the reasons is clear that the stages 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:26.269
 I am another reason for him from abundantly 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.269
 oil leak into every possible gap 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:34.590
 cooling all see in the oil to well and more 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.579
 one hot issue you look at 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.480
 candle wells 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.290
 it is like this the first second third cylinder 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.579
 right here from a prominent spray there and 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:52.199
 the fourth cylinder is completely flooded 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.710
 oil well, somehow a candle coil 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.820
 In oil 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.829
 she somehow worked complaints to 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.650
 the engine troit was not surprising 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.510
 of course, just apparently did not fill the young 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.540
 still kept me all the same yes 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:15.210
 isolation kept most likely to this 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.860
 will come at least see the head but 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.340
 Of course it is optimal to do repairs 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 engine 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:26.450
 so here we are on the second cylinder 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.960
 see that the candle is clean is hard to see 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.610
 here we already see a belt on the insulator 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.479
 that is, the breakdown has already begun to form 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.159
 Well, well covered all over with oil and 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.090
 flows right under the top cover right 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.340
 here here is a trace of him if we are here 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.020
 we watch it a little bit here 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.210
 almost dry but here here 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.970
 Naturally all thoughts are husband and butter 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.840
 ran away and why the oil is driven by different 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.830
 engine sides 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.130
 why him 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.330
 and the first reason is that the breather is clogged 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.729
 which comes from the valve cover 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.710
 the throttle pipe goes off but it is clogged 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.880
 still not so scary much worse 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.860
 when compression rings stop 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.920
 do their job gas breaks through 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.810
 sump that causes an increase in pressure 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.790
 crankcase gases and naturally times 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.730
 the pressure above becomes safon no longer 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.040
 copes and gas starts to go where 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.600
 weakly therefore all these seals have 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.340
 we appear in the oil all traces here 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.200
 oils with a circle of traces of oil that is necessary 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.200
 do engine overhaul
