00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.350
 every year 120 billion dollars 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.430
 The doctors said they were cancer patients 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.469
 they have to spare each other 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.800
 my doctor told me I'll be listening soon 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.800

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.900
 arthritis or multiple sclerosis 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.140
 this is an atlas of cancer deaths in 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.660
 China, unlike in the west MaÃŸmann place 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.580
 neither dairy nor meat we 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.900
 could accelerate cancer growth 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.530
 or stop me depending on the protein intake 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.540
 clearly what causes the most suffering 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.810
 The authorities ignore that they want 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.520
 maintain the status quo 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.500

 some people would call that extreme 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.750
 I do not know any therapy that only 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.220
 almost as effective as one 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.720
 pure vegetable nutrition 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.720

 From a helpless sacrifice is my 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.180
 diabetes is finally cured 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.320
 that changed my life therefore 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.990
 Nutrition is much more important than you 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.460
 Medias had thought the answer is at 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 a forbidden simple one 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.060
 People must be responsible for 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.560
 take over your health and start 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:17.970

 description and deals with 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.400
 the basic theme of the meat 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.410
 human evolution is how important 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.180
 meat as a protein source in ours 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.690
 nutrition can be found elsewhere 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.370
 Respectively 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.780
 and above all, how are the animals 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.490
 from which we ended up 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.840
 win this meat and all that 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.580
 packed together results in a 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.440
 Documentation around two doctors the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.820
 originally raised in the usa 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.010
 are and still live there today 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.000
 originally also lived on farms 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.530
 and therefore a very own one 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.180
 but have to use binding then 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.650
 gradually in her career path 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.480
 have found that the superstition 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.190
 that milk is one of the most important reason 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.930
 product and foreign milk from others 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.250
 types are harmful to health 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.750
 The human may be gradually 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.640
 have expanded and many many people 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.110
 treat and the whole animal 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.000
 placed in the united states of 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.040
 america where in obesity that 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.900
 dominant theme is at least if you 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.370
 Talk about it is the typical country around 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.480
 that it will be here 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.980
 different stories of 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.450
 people used it very much 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.980
 The many have suffered in

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.700
 illnesses respectively 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.019
 prosperous diseases like diabetes with 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.180
 It will also bring a lot 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.320
 the topic bypass operation heart and 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.150
 asked everything with just one 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.560
 provided with poor nutrition 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.850
 an extremely high meat pleasure 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.769
 or enjoyment of 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.209
 packed together and animal products 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.410
 the question is posed in the room 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.049
 not healthier on animal 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.230
 to give up products and he has one 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.700
 therefore really lacking 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.560
 the documentation says it completely 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.879
 no, you can eat vegetables 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.409
 and you just have to know how to get there 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.610
 fed a changeover 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.750
 Every case makes you feel better 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.549
 one feels fresh ammann is fourth 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.200
 man lives longer there goes the 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.519
 Documentation also systematically many 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.290
 various questions and makes 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.420
 actually pretty fun to look at 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.280
 is also provided with German engine 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.569
 that means the documentation is often 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.920
 also in this direction with the 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.170
 original language with subtitles provided 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.879
 So also for all fans in this 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.049
 direction in the information at this 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.549
 and above all in 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.290
 documentation the climbing I say 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.640
 art harmless and, on there is the 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.810
 others agree with the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.340
 meat consumption and animal husbandry 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.019
 are allowed to employ the left just like that 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.669
 many are just not that tough 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.380
 Looking at things can be imagined 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.889
 back just try humanely clear 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.660
 close 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.190
 Hey guys, you know what 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.330
 is healthy and that's how difficult it is 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.100
 not and brings a whole lot too 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.780
 of examples that livestock on 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.639
 the other side next to the big theme 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.949
 nutrition and health easy too 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.570
 ecologically totally brutal for the environment 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:36.580
 is and what everything associated with it 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.080
 a globalized world of stakes around 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.639
 Half the world exported there are 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.810
 many many topics you like in the 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.340
 teaching can appeal to one 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.840
 many times during summer holidays have so 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.440
 typical doku that makes itself yes 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.729
 actually good at 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.900
 biology lessons and that's why 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.039
 maybe a little here 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.780
 recommendation in this direction 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.820
 No one darling with me 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.530
 by the way, you can also get them here 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.000
 on youtube I think look a bit 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.990
 full length uploaded but as I said 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.919
 I prefer to dvd good friends 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.539
 do not want any recommendations for this 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.050
 Documentation about none of me 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.340
 rating 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.440
 so everyone like that 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.389
 Spring take aways as well as feed the world 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.770
 documentation may be on here 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.050
 find each case of a topic again 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.729
 to which he or she quite interesting 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.460
 should find so if I through my 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.539
 review about forklift can be a down 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.130
 if this video did 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.690
 let it stay if not otherwise 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.550
 you know, there are a few more 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.560
 left around me and tomorrow at 15 o'clock 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.060
 of course, at the latest, a new video 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.669
 if it is then I hope there are times 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.669
 of course again from 3
