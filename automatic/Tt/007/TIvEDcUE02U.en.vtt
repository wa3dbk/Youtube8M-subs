00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.580
 do it with mali 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.830
 Ventilation belts are mainly used 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.140
 roof ventilation areas used 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.119
 Temperature differences can cause it 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.790
 Moisture in this area 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.099
 that mahle ventilation band guaranteed 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.720
 the corresponding ventilation the ventilation 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.410
 Tape is easy to screw 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.410
 fixed 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.250
 the roof 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.530
 Installation begins with the iron gutters 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.989
 The installation is particularly easy 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.750
 when using the adjustable 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.879
 the adjustable gutters are iron 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.180
 Iron can be in height and inclination 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.910
 be adjusted 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.490
 the lowest and the highest travel 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.550
 be first mounted the slope 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.010
 should be 2 to 3 mm meter 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.230
 will travel between the two races 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.670
 a cord in the middle and on the nose 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.670
 strained by the race iron 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.729
 then it will fall 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.000
 controls the other races travel 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.210
 should be in the distance of 50 to 70 cm 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.250
 the individual journeys are mounted 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.540
 are then screwed on and at the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.540
 aligned 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.659
 the gutter is completely through the 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.359
 support 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.219
 to the race trim on the rear 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.829
 from knew hang in and over the 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.140
 front bead tilt the hole for the 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.490
 Expiration is drawn on and the 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.490
 clip away again 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.979
 the drainage of the gutter can through 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.880
 a cut with a saw blade 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.880
 be generated 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.000
 The circular cut will be with a 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.000
 cut metal shears 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.220
 the clip will 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.220
 glued to the gutter again 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.850
 the tail can be on both 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.740
 install gutter it will be in the front in the world 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.470
 the gutter stuck and behind 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.490
 pressed down now we hang the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.500
 gutter 1 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.959
 the opening of the bead is over 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.150
 the nose of the gutters iron pushed the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.610
 gutter will then iron in the gutters 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.709
 turned all the rear springs of the gutters 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.959
 Iron is pressed down with it 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.800
 this gutter in the gutters iron 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.350
 fix 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.690
 every piece has to go once 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.360
 possibility to be fixed in the middle 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.160
 to it at the back essay the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.400
 spring from the middle gutter iron 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.739
 then marks the settlement 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.810
 cut in or a sawn with it is 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.610
 ensures that a possible 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.709
 extension of the gutter of the 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.880
 respective connecting shell or corner 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.940
 is recorded 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.010
 the evaluate whether system helps 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.590
 the connection of the gutters is done by 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.230
 a connection shell the connection 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.030
 shell has a wide range for each side 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.130
 sealing rubber in the rear 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.410
 treatise of the connecting shell is 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.250
 For each gutter side a nocke 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.830
 available 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.320
 this engages in the nut during assembly 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.390
 the gutter on the back from canton 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.090
 is the plug-in aid for the gutter 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.160
 marked by arrows so easy 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.100
 Mount a gutter yourself 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.140
 of course he's on it with molly 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.330
 must be able to be mounted 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.550
 all rear springs of the gutters iron 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.470
 flush with the rear shutdown of the 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.600
 gutter to be cut off the 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.700
 demarcation from it will strip in 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.890
 the holding of the gutter hung 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.800
 the attachment from it strip 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.750
 done with cardboard nails are meant to several 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.549
 mounted on strips one after the other 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.040
 So these are with one 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.830
 overlap of about two centimeters 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.320
 mounted the eaves strip protects the 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.810
 Building structure in front of rainwater and snow 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.970
 the attachment of the ventilation eaves 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.110
 kamps is like the strip on it 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.110
 nails with cardboard 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.599
 v shaped cuts at the end and beginning 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.909
 every meeting ventilation camp 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.159
 facilitate the assembly if several 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.349
 elements are strung together 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:57.139
 The integrated came serves as protection 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:57.139
 against bird a flight foliage and so on 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.280
 All items are simply plugged 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.889
 a bow can be placed directly on the neck 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.319
 The distance from the bow is inserted 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:13.289
 to the wall is measured that is the 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:15.539
 total distance now a bow in a 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.879
 downpipe stuck and the zollstock so 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.680
 the bow stopped that one 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.500
 distance of about two to three 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.599
 centimeters to the wall gives the measure of 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.909
 the wall to the entry help of the case 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.979
 Pipe in the bow in our case 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:32.219
 twelve centimeters is detected from the 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:36.409
 Total measure deducted is the downpipe 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.409
 deflected to the measure with a saw 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.030
 downpipe for the roof overhang is with 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.930
 two bends together at the neck 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.770
 plugged 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.900
 An adhesion is not required 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.180
 the vertical downpipe is with 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.669
 downpipe places fastened by the 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.620
 juicy design of falco and bow must 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.389
 below a pipe sleeve or one 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.470
 downpipe sheet a fixed position 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.110
 be set 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.240
 while the ring screw is next to the 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.550
 Fastening brackets of a place set 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.340
 in the middle and at the end of the downpipe 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.870
 will be set equal to all here 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.909
 the ring screw between the 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.909

 the included fixing clips 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:56.779
 the assembly is done quickly 

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:59.239
 Mounting brackets are in the distance 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:01.999
 from 40 centimeters to the front 

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:04.279
 then the bead is glued
