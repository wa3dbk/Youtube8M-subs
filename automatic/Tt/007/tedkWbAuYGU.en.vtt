00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.410
 now I will become the chapter of the league 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.449
 was asked in the mistaken belief appears 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.580
 that does not mean so much of 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.440
 modeling ems or something that is hold 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.939
 not quite right so if I'm with the 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.680
 like playing hire or not so 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.530
 multi effect is if that makes me 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.130
 All well and as a result I got 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.180
 the question what I think of it plugins 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.579
 is also possible today you have 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.239
 an audio interface, a sound card 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.550
 for the calculator laptop calculator no matter or 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.649
 also tray free of charge what you are then 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.699
 with the guitar this interface was 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.710
 these cards 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.659
 until then we do not have any 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.030
 guitar sound and then we have in 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.729
 calculator a software the one 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.829
 amplifier simulated that works too 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.129
 that is that i would say that i am 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.920
 the device loses version if you will 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.229
 because a computer can be a laptop or something 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.330
 he is the computational power of a process 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.490
 take over as one in one 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.850
 Multi-effect finds is easy in it 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.229
 why should he never do that ? 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.770
 and then of course you can just in 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.770
 a computer 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.939
 by means of plug in different amplifiers 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.460
 adjustment or amplifier 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.079
 simulate there I am actually relative 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.439
 big fan of that is actually possible 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.119
 relatively well I use it little me 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.520
 I have everything I have for example 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.820
 amplitube software that's one of those 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.960
 software now there are also a thousand 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850
 Manufacturers can do them all 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.289
 the same thing 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.359
 the one above the one likes it better 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.189
 one can do so that they work 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.829
 All very well and I have just 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.289
 amplitube and there is then the career 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.869
 as follows the software is not stupid 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.270
 if I am now a player and then 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.630
 I take that on the lays the software 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.869
 Of course not the recorded signal 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.939
 do not talk about what's in the computer 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.439
 the distorted signals are simulated 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.119
 normal patient-made 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.710
 Of course, then the software does not take 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.280
 the distorted sound on it could be 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.730
 But you do not have to but the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.190
 software takes just what you want 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.959
 a player has an accident clinic days 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.350
 recorded and not the plugin 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.230
 so to speak behind this track so that 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.330
 am able to playback 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.220
 still to put the sound one so 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.560
 I lie down with the computer solution 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.120
 Not at all stuck with the sound of me 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.620
 that is if I know something now I know 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.630
 I think the song and I have one 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.580
 played guitar and I hear that 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.170
 the next day and think digitally 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.569
 actually played so is quite 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.370
 nice but the sound does not fit 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.720
 This can always be when you 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.820
 if the singing came to it or 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.440
 more instruments that one the way old 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.440
 now the guitar is the squeeze here 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.850
 everything broken and short and small 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.100
 and then you can do this the season 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.620
 completely changed that is natural 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.330
 a super cool thing was something 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.190
 is ping in the studio as william 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.959
 if a really big one 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.480
 studios will actually be the track 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.380
 again by amplifier hunted that 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.989
 would be the same 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.610
 You have this trace and you can do this 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.680
 Simply change the plug-in afterwards 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.989
 I actually think that's pretty good 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.970
 only factor with which you always take 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.970
 this system just has to be that way 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.799
 fast and as good as the software 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.110
 and give the computer together 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.690
 there comes the famous latency ins 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.190
 What is the latency when I play 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.709
 Now what a player with the guitar 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.480
 This happens in real time, the guitars 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.840
 signal is still in guilin the 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.959
 calculator but it needs a certain 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.220
 time it takes the computer to order 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.660
 to calculate the recorded signal and 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.870
 then throw it out again 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.549
 when the playback is one of a track 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.130
 so no problem because he hits it 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.630
 all the tracks will be at the time 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.700
 ex thrown out there I'm interested 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.560
 that is not reflected in your own is that 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.600
 important if i what a player possible 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.310
 that the sound I hear while listening too 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.440
 that's what's on the guitar right away 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.049
 happens and when I put the latency in 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.890
 a software not further down 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.269
 can turn 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.459
 because that is really so little 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.890
 Stop complete felt like this 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.120
 a little later that's because one 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.459
 generally always the moment where 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.350
 The guitarists always only 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.789
 Game and the meeting of the providers 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.120
 software first look very funny 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.169
 because that sounds so direct and indirect 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.120
 that does not really happen 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.710
 At the same time there are only people 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.449
 which is that I do not care so much there 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.729
 they do not have any empathy at all 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.960
 for something that noticed that not 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.940
 For example, I would do that immediately 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.699
 So remember I say ten 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:42.139
 milliseconds or something that puts that 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:43.759
 is weird and there for me 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.740
 It just decides how good that is 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.180
 must be system so that you something with 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.560
 can start 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.750
 to avoid that as I said 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.789
 reproduction side, it does not matter there 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.340
 Downsized serena then that is 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.130
 but it is conscious for the moment of 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.780
 playtime important and you can do this 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.340
 However, I can handle this factor 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.800
 by starting the signal at the beginning 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.210
 splits if you just play 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.830
 in such a box you could still 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.330
 to have a small office life 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.060
 then of course you also have to go his 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.460
 a signal two stages by means of split 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.960
 boxee box so that you can order the direct 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.460
 Feeling always playing when importing 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.729
 still playing a small guitar 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.190
 can 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.080
 But then record in the computer 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.120
 content can be understood that way 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.650
 so the plate stories I think 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.090
 actually great you can really 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.530
 really in retrospect one works 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.840
 then of course the guitar signal 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.669
 also change again with the equalizer 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.770
 so it really what through 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.990
 plugin is being hunted something completely different 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.750
 So there you have it, of course 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.099
 unbelievably good options and also 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.750
 dynamics of which you can actually even 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.820
 A compressor over it clap effects 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.740
 as well as being very clear when I enter 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.090
 quite a bit how exactly does delay want to have 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.180
 in the train or only at a certain 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.070
 stop holding what I know only when 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.080
 Otherwise, intro has a little delay over it 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.849
 I can do this over a soup tenant 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.770
 that of course cut everything there and there 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.210
 is all make the issue in responding 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.440
 really great for that 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.000
 are expected take that all 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.000
 restaurants are not so much on the topic
