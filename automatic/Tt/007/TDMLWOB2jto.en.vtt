00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
fixed on a bigger airship and it is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.319 
fixed on a bigger airship and it is
called<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.850> airlander<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.680> an<00:00:37.950> enormous

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
called the airlander it's an enormous

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.720 
called the airlander it's an enormous
enormous<00:00:39.329> blimp<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.230> largest<00:00:40.800> flying

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
enormous blimp it's the largest flying

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.350 
enormous blimp it's the largest flying
object<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.530> world<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.760> world<00:00:45.180> record

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
object in the world it's a world record

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.090 
object in the world it's a world record
it's<00:00:45.660> basically<00:00:46.079> two<00:00:46.379> blimps<00:00:46.739> put<00:00:46.950> together

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
it's basically two blimps put together

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.420 
it's basically two blimps put together
that<00:00:47.879> flies<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.840> an<00:00:48.989> air<00:00:49.289> wing<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:50.039> it's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that flies like an air wing like it's

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.400 
that flies like an air wing like it's
and<00:00:50.760> that's<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> big<00:00:52.110> butt

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
and that's not a that's like a big butt

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.180 
and that's not a that's like a big butt
right<00:00:52.680> there<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> big<00:00:53.129> bottom<00:00:54.829> but<00:00:55.829> that's<00:00:55.980> not

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
right there a big bottom but that's not

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.830 
right there a big bottom but that's not
what<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.460> that's<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.090> blimp<00:00:57.360> right<00:00:57.600> there

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
what it is that's the blimp right there

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.069 
what it is that's the blimp right there
yeah<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.710> he's<00:00:59.460> an<00:00:59.699> investor<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.660> company

it's it's one of his dreams this is him

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's it's one of his dreams this is him
actually<00:01:04.519> piloting<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.270> thing

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
actually piloting the thing

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
actually piloting the thing
it's<00:01:07.260> 302<00:01:07.830> feet<00:01:08.040> long<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> longest

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it's 302 feet long it's the longest

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
it's 302 feet long it's the longest
aircraft<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.479> world<00:01:09.510> he<00:01:09.900> says<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> can

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
aircraft in the world he says it can

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.469 
aircraft in the world he says it can
reach<00:01:10.770> about<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.040> hundred<00:01:11.430> miles<00:01:11.640> an<00:01:11.850> hour<00:01:11.970> so

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
reach about a hundred miles an hour so

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.300 
reach about a hundred miles an hour so
it's<00:01:12.840> an<00:01:12.960> airfoil<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.100> blimp

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it's an airfoil it's not just a blimp

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.880 
it's an airfoil it's not just a blimp
that<00:01:14.369> goes<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.150> acts<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> wing<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> can

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that goes up it's acts as a wing and can

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.830 
that goes up it's acts as a wing and can
go<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.400> fast<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.909> maneuver<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.509> fast

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
go really fast and maneuver really fast

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.200 
go really fast and maneuver really fast
it<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.530> stay<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.890> there<00:01:20.100> he<00:01:20.250> says<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:20.970> to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
it can stay up there he says for up to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
it can stay up there he says for up to
three<00:01:21.509> weeks<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.909> 70%<00:01:24.420> greener<00:01:25.170> than<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
three weeks so it's 70% greener than a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
three weeks so it's 70% greener than a
regular<00:01:26.540> airliner

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
regular airliner

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.170 
regular airliner
now<00:01:28.409> he's<00:01:28.619> giddy<00:01:28.979> over<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> possibilities

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
now he's giddy over the possibilities

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.510 
now he's giddy over the possibilities
and<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.290> what<00:01:31.439> Dickinson<00:01:31.860> has<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.250> say<00:01:32.430> he

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
and this is what Dickinson has to say he

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.280 
and this is what Dickinson has to say he
says<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.119> game<00:01:33.360> changer<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.869> terms<00:01:33.990> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
says it's a game changer in terms of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.380 
says it's a game changer in terms of
things<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> air<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.180> things

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
things we can have in the air and things

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.260 
things we can have in the air and things
we<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.560> seizes<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.280> imagination<00:01:39.060> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
we can do it seizes my imagination I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.600 
we can do it seizes my imagination I
want<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.259> thing<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.590> flight<00:01:40.890> pole

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
want to get in this thing in flight pole

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.480 
want to get in this thing in flight pole
to<00:01:41.939> pole<00:01:41.970> he<00:01:42.600> says<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.200> we'll<00:01:43.950> fly<00:01:44.130> over<00:01:44.159> the

to pole he says and we'll fly over the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.160 
to pole he says and we'll fly over the
