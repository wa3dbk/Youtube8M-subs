00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the bike as you get more confident try

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.810 
the bike as you get more confident try

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
front wheel to that point where it takes

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.390 
front wheel to that point where it takes
a<00:01:06.510> minimum<00:01:06.780> effort<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.680> stay<00:01:07.860> balanced<00:01:08.250> on

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
a minimum effort and stay balanced on

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
a minimum effort and stay balanced on
the<00:01:08.460> rear<00:01:08.729> wheel<00:01:08.939> once<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.869> find<00:01:10.140> this

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the rear wheel once you find this

balance point the back approaches your
friends<00:01:12.590> pull<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.799> full<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.640> stop

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
friends pull it on full and it will stop

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.580 
friends pull it on full and it will stop
your<00:01:15.000> back<00:01:15.180> wheels<00:01:15.390> dead<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.290> bring<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
your back wheels dead and bring the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.890 
your back wheels dead and bring the
front<00:01:16.799> end<00:01:17.040> back<00:01:17.280> down<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> ground

front end back down to the ground

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.420 
front end back down to the ground
eventually<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.560> aim<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
eventually the aim is to get to that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
eventually the aim is to get to that
balance<00:01:20.580> point<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.119> keep<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.630> by<00:01:22.320> using<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
balance point and keep it by using a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.499 
balance point and keep it by using a
combination<00:01:22.950> dabbing<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> rear<00:01:23.850> brake<00:01:24.180> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
combination dabbing the rear brake and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.230 
combination dabbing the rear brake and
pedaling<00:01:24.960> harder<00:01:25.729> once<00:01:26.729> you've<00:01:26.909> begun<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
pedaling harder once you've begun to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.940 
pedaling harder once you've begun to
master<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> forwards<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.530> rear<00:01:28.740> with

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
master the forwards and rear with

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.230 
master the forwards and rear with
balance<00:01:29.280> point<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.729> will<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.030> need<00:01:30.180> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
balance point you will then need to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.730 
balance point you will then need to
control<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> side<00:01:30.960> balance<00:01:31.320> which<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.590> can

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
control the side balance which you can

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.520 
control the side balance which you can
do<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.130> two<00:01:32.369> ways<00:01:32.750> firstly<00:01:33.750> by<00:01:34.079> using<00:01:34.290> your

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
do in two ways firstly by using your

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.760 
do in two ways firstly by using your
knees<00:01:34.799> speed<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.670> overall<00:01:35.729> body<00:01:36.210> weight

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.890 

secondly<00:01:39.520> by<00:01:39.850> turning<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.270> handle<00:01:40.600> bars<00:01:40.750> in

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
secondly by turning the handle bars in

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.930 
secondly by turning the handle bars in
opposite<00:01:41.470> direction<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:42.520> which<00:01:42.790> you're

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
opposite direction that which you're
