that it was a trifling challenge to get

that it was a trifling challenge to get
this<00:00:27.150> thing<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.689> play<00:00:27.869> ball<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.949> was<00:00:29.250> extremely

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
this thing to play ball it was extremely

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.389 
this thing to play ball it was extremely
painful<00:00:30.599> because<00:00:31.170> sometimes<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.070> would<00:00:32.219> run

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
painful because sometimes it would run

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.610 
painful because sometimes it would run
at<00:00:32.520> 500<00:00:33.090> megahertz<00:00:33.390> bus<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.960> sometimes<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
at 500 megahertz bus and sometimes it

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.680 
at 500 megahertz bus and sometimes it
wouldn't<00:00:34.829> boot<00:00:35.040> up<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.460> sometimes<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.570> would

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
wouldn't boot up all sometimes it would

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.420 
wouldn't boot up all sometimes it would
throw<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> memory<00:00:37.260> air<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.739> sometimes<00:00:38.219> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
throw a memory air and sometimes it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.569 
throw a memory air and sometimes it
wouldn't<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.170> 480<00:00:40.980> megahertz

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
wouldn't I do have it at 480 megahertz

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.229 
wouldn't I do have it at 480 megahertz
and<00:00:42.350> here's<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.620> memory<00:00:43.829> benchmark<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and here's the memory benchmark of the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.630 
and here's the memory benchmark of the
motherboard<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.930> question<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> ddr3

motherboard in question with the ddr3

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.209 
motherboard in question with the ddr3
memory<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.920> unfortunately<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.010> had<00:00:50.190> to

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
memory in it unfortunately I had to

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.340 
memory in it unfortunately I had to
underclock<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> memory<00:00:51.360> slightly<00:00:51.960> because

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
underclock the memory slightly because

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.319 
underclock the memory slightly because
for<00:00:52.590> some<00:00:52.770> reason<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.160> memory<00:00:53.489> controller<00:00:53.699> on

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
for some reason the memory controller on

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.740 
for some reason the memory controller on
this<00:00:55.020> motherboard<00:00:55.350> when<00:00:55.860> running<00:00:56.149> all<00:00:57.149> banks

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
this motherboard when running all banks

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.470 
this motherboard when running all banks
of<00:00:57.899> memory<00:00:58.289> filled<00:00:58.620> has<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> real<00:00:59.940> big<00:01:00.180> issue

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
of memory filled has a real big issue

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
of memory filled has a real big issue
with<00:01:00.780> running<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.199> memory<00:01:01.559> at<00:01:01.649> full<00:01:01.859> speed

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
with running the memory at full speed

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.719 
with running the memory at full speed
for<00:01:02.520> some<00:01:02.730> reason<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> unfortunately<00:01:05.489> that's

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
for some reason so unfortunately that's

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.060 
for some reason so unfortunately that's
about<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.840> out<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.860> there's

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
about all I can get out of it so there's

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.100 
about all I can get out of it so there's
a<00:01:08.100> shot<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.760> processor<00:01:09.689> right<00:01:09.869> here

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
a shot of the processor right here

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.070 
a shot of the processor right here
running<00:01:10.350> at<00:01:10.439> cpu-z<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
here's my processor right here in yellow

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.999 
here's my processor right here in yellow
we<00:01:26.310> compare<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:28.159> four<00:01:29.159> core<00:01:29.490> i7<00:01:31.009> we're

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
we compare this to a four core i7 we're

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.210 
we compare this to a four core i7 we're
not<00:01:32.189> too<00:01:32.670> far<00:01:33.030> below<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.890> go<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.100> here

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
not too far below that and we go up here

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.670 
not too far below that and we go up here
to<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.880> i7<00:01:36.540> 20<00:01:36.890> 601<00:01:38.750> quite<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.170> gap<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
to the i7 20 601 quite a bit of a gap to

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.090 
to the i7 20 601 quite a bit of a gap to
that<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.549> here's<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.329> float<00:01:42.630> point<00:01:43.100> test

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that one and here's a float point test

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.179 
that one and here's a float point test
here<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.810> see<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> Xeon<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:46.950> right

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
here you can see the Xeon is just right

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.830 
here you can see the Xeon is just right
under<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.610> Phenom<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.509> course<00:01:48.659> a
