getting this car I think the most

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.390 
getting this car I think the most
important<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.210> me<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:25.230> want<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.100> fit

something<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.110> good<00:01:31.440> for<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:32.070> use

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
something that that is good for my use

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.730 
something that that is good for my use
when<00:01:32.520> I'm<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.910> jungle<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:33.740> sometimes

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
when I'm in the jungle and sometimes

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.480 
when I'm in the jungle and sometimes
really<00:01:35.160> caught<00:01:35.400> there<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:37.070> would<00:01:38.070> prefer<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
really caught there I would prefer to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.720 
really caught there I would prefer to
fit<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.480> best<00:01:40.080> equipment<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:40.950> available

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.570 

yeah<00:01:44.730> ba<00:01:45.030> ba<00:01:45.270> ba<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.020> reason<00:01:46.380> why<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.070> chose

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
yeah ba ba ba and the reason why I chose

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.470 
yeah ba ba ba and the reason why I chose
this<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.870> think<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.620> only

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
this is because I think this is the only

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.910 
this is because I think this is the only
boo<00:01:51.480> ba<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.470> give<00:01:52.680> me<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.860> certificate

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
boo ba that can give me a certificate

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
boo ba that can give me a certificate
when<00:01:57.110> when<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.260> get<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.070> something<00:01:59.600> to<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
when when you get to do something to a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.020 
when when you get to do something to a
certain<00:02:01.080> poundage<00:02:01.620> then<00:02:02.400> only<00:02:02.730> the<00:02:02.790> air

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
certain poundage then only the air

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.090 
certain poundage then only the air
becomes<00:02:03.390> out<00:02:03.660> I<00:02:03.690> think<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.140> very<00:02:04.590> very

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
becomes out I think that's very very

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.680 
becomes out I think that's very very
important<00:02:05.760> so<00:02:06.300> properly<00:02:06.870> fitted<00:02:08.149> ba<00:02:09.149> ba

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
important so properly fitted ba ba

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.360 
important so properly fitted ba ba
and<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> safety<00:02:10.619> features<00:02:11.159> I<00:02:11.340> think

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
and with the safety features I think

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.059 
and with the safety features I think
it's<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:12.420> important<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.989> me<00:02:13.140> for<00:02:13.409> binge<00:02:13.860> I

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
it's it's important to me for binge I

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.850 
it's it's important to me for binge I
think<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.720> choose<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.840> which<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.349> believe<00:02:16.709> this

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
think I choose this which I believe this

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.460 
think I choose this which I believe this
is<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.069> more

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
is a more

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.220 
is a more
most<00:02:19.040> reliable<00:02:19.580> which<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.660> using<00:02:21.110> it

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
most reliable which you and using it

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.740 
most reliable which you and using it
audibly<00:02:21.650> for<00:02:21.950> two<00:02:22.730> inches<00:02:23.120> which<00:02:23.720> is

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
audibly for two inches which is

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.090

allowable<00:02:24.500> by<00:02:24.700> jpg<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:25.880> then<00:02:26.630> I've<00:02:27.320> put<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.980> a

four-wheel-drive<00:05:08.820> equipment<00:05:09.820> I<00:05:11.070> think<00:05:12.070> the

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
four-wheel-drive equipment I think the

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.970 
four-wheel-drive equipment I think the
important<00:05:12.850> thing<00:05:12.880> to<00:05:13.000> consider<00:05:13.330> is<00:05:13.980> safety

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
important thing to consider is safety

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.330 
important thing to consider is safety
safety<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:16.090> very<00:05:16.750> important<00:05:17.320> because<00:05:17.950> you

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
safety is very important because you

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.320 
safety is very important because you
surely<00:05:18.910> don't<00:05:19.090> one<00:05:23.280> bar<00:05:24.280> where<00:05:24.670> the<00:05:25.000> moment

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
surely don't one bar where the moment

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.790 
surely don't one bar where the moment
you<00:05:25.420> knock<00:05:25.630> it<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:25.870> something<00:05:26.290> that<00:05:26.320> ever

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
you knock it to something that ever

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.870 
you knock it to something that ever
comes<00:05:27.220> on<00:05:27.480> get<00:05:28.480> something<00:05:28.870> that<00:05:29.170> is<00:05:29.880> approved

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
comes on get something that is approved

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.990 
comes on get something that is approved
by<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.600> JPG<00:05:32.230> and<00:05:33.220> so<00:05:33.460> far<00:05:33.700> I<00:05:34.290> think<00:05:35.290> it's<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.790> one

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
by a JPG and so far I think it's the one

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.970 
by a JPG and so far I think it's the one
that<00:05:37.210> can<00:05:37.510> only<00:05:37.660> give<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.260> certification

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
that can only give you the certification

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.160 
that can only give you the certification
or<00:05:39.130> provoked<00:05:39.700> by<00:05:39.910> jpg<00:05:40.420> that's<00:05:40.660> right<00:05:40.780> yes<00:05:40.930> when

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
or provoked by jpg that's right yes when

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.730 
or provoked by jpg that's right yes when
we<00:05:41.320> go<00:05:42.210> especially<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:44.080> time<00:05:44.290> fishing<00:05:44.530> that

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
we go especially the time fishing that

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.430 
we go especially the time fishing that
people<00:05:45.040> is<00:05:45.280> we<00:05:45.520> go<00:05:45.850> actually<00:05:46.630> really<00:05:47.140> deep

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
people is we go actually really deep

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.460 
people is we go actually really deep
into<00:05:47.740> the<00:05:47.860> jungle<00:05:48.310> and<00:05:48.960> going<00:05:49.960> in<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.290> weather

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
into the jungle and going in the weather

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.470 
into the jungle and going in the weather
might<00:05:50.710> be<00:05:50.740> fine<00:05:51.070> but<00:05:51.310> sometimes<00:05:51.850> when<00:05:52.060> we<00:05:52.210> come

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
might be fine but sometimes when we come
