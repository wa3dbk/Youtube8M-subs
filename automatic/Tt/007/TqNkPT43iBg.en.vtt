guys<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.799> getting<00:01:44.009> better<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:45.149> only<00:01:45.360> better

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
guys are getting better not only better

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.969 
guys are getting better not only better
from<00:01:45.990> last<00:01:46.200> year<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.530> better<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.950> season

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
from last year but better as the season

from last year but better as the season
has<00:01:47.369> progressed<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.710> wouldn't<00:01:49.979> limit<00:01:50.280> this

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
has progressed so I wouldn't limit this

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.219 
has progressed so I wouldn't limit this
team<00:01:50.670> by<00:01:50.880> ever<00:01:51.299> think<00:01:51.539> in<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.750> window<00:01:52.079> was
