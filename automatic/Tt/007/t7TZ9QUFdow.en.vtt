00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
almost 10 inches from tail to nose but

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.499 
almost 10 inches from tail to nose but
it's<00:01:30.520> still<00:01:30.640> really<00:01:30.819> cool<00:01:31.060> he's<00:01:31.210> got<00:01:31.329> some

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
it's still really cool he's got some

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.029 
it's still really cool he's got some
range<00:01:31.719> of<00:01:31.840> motion<00:01:31.899> here<00:01:32.409> in<00:01:32.469> his<00:01:32.590> arm<00:01:32.799> so<00:01:32.979> you

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
range of motion here in his arm so you

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.440 
range of motion here in his arm so you
can<00:01:33.159> move<00:01:33.219> them<00:01:33.369> up<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:33.670> down<00:01:33.789> nothing<00:01:34.090> at<00:01:34.359> the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
can move them up and down nothing at the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.779 
can move them up and down nothing at the
head<00:01:34.659> and<00:01:34.929> his<00:01:35.409> legs<00:01:35.679> do<00:01:35.950> move<00:01:35.979> back<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.579> forth

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
head and his legs do move back and forth

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.010 
head and his legs do move back and forth
this<00:01:36.939> like<00:01:37.119> so<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.479> kind<00:01:37.659> of<00:01:37.719> have<00:01:37.869> to
