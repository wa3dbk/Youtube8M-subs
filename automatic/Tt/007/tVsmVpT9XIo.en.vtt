00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
and I'm just going to do a quick version

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.809 
and I'm just going to do a quick version
of<00:01:37.659> it<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:38.079> doesn't<00:01:38.409> stay<00:01:38.590> in<00:01:38.619> very<00:01:39.009> long<00:01:39.249> but

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.580 
what I think was just break the ends and
then<00:01:42.939> tuck<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:43.960> in<00:01:44.139> and<00:01:44.789> just<00:01:45.789> wore<00:01:46.149> it<00:01:46.359> as<00:01:46.590> you
