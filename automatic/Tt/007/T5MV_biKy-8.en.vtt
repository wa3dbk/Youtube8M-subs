of sweet olive oil into the mixture and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.500 
of sweet olive oil into the mixture and
then<00:02:01.100> usually<00:02:02.100> water<00:02:02.280> sits<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.729> top<00:02:02.910> I<00:02:03.360> mean

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.719 
then usually water sits on top I mean
oil<00:02:03.690> sits<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.110> top<00:02:04.260> of<00:02:04.470> water<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.070> with<00:02:05.580> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
soap it kind of dissolves in it fuses it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.410 
soap it kind of dissolves in it fuses it
into<00:02:08.730> the<00:02:08.850> shampoo<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.019> you're<00:02:10.200> making<00:02:10.350> so

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
the block it got a little smaller but it

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.150

this<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.300> how<00:02:15.450> big<00:02:15.750> my<00:02:16.110> block<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.709> black<00:02:16.890> soap

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
this is how big my block of black soap

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.370 
this is how big my block of black soap
was<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.610> dropped<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.600> 16<00:02:18.989> ounces<00:02:19.320> of

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
was that I dropped in the 16 ounces of

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.550 
was that I dropped in the 16 ounces of
water<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:20.570> you<00:02:21.570> just<00:02:21.750> let<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.080> sit<00:02:22.350> there

very it lathers up very very well in a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.420 
very it lathers up very very well in a
way<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.750> test<00:03:12.960> that<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:13.860> just<00:03:14.250> by

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
way you can test that it's just by

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.630 
way you can test that it's just by
taking<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:15.450> peb<00:03:16.020> of<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.650> slope<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:17.100> this<00:03:17.520> and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
taking a peb of a slope like this and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.520 
taking a peb of a slope like this and
lathering<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.820> up<00:03:21.000> right<00:03:21.330> in<00:03:21.390> your<00:03:21.630> hands<00:03:22.200> like

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
lathering it up right in your hands like

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.120 
lathering it up right in your hands like
this

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
this

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.910 
this
and<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.730> can<00:03:23.940> see<00:03:24.270> that<00:03:24.810> my<00:03:25.200> hands<00:03:25.440> are<00:03:25.650> white

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
and you can see that my hands are white

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.110 
and you can see that my hands are white
from<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.400> lather<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:27.720> that's<00:03:28.500> great<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.640> we

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
from the lather so that's great so we

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.060 
from the lather so that's great so we
know<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.450> it's<00:03:30.600> ready<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.740> didn't

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
know that it's ready if it didn't

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.370 
know that it's ready if it didn't
leather<00:03:32.250> up<00:03:32.550> as<00:03:32.760> much<00:03:33.090> as<00:03:33.450> you'd<00:03:33.630> like<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.110> what

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.080 
leather up as much as you'd like it what
I<00:03:34.410> suggest<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.130> adding<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.760> little<00:03:35.910> bit<00:03:36.000> more

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
I suggest is adding a little bit more

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.960 
I suggest is adding a little bit more
soap<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.840> waiting<00:03:37.200> for<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.500> dissolve<00:03:37.970> you

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
soap and waiting for it to dissolve you

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.030 
soap and waiting for it to dissolve you
can<00:03:39.180> either<00:03:39.420> leave<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.050> shampoo<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:40.770> this

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
can either leave the shampoo in this

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.900 
can either leave the shampoo in this
liquid<00:03:41.510> mousse<00:03:42.510> form<00:03:42.900> like<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.440> or<00:03:44.190> what<00:03:44.790> you

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
liquid mousse form like this or what you

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.120 
liquid mousse form like this or what you
can<00:03:45.060> do<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.330> thicken<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.840> up<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.290> there<00:03:46.590> isn't

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
can do is thicken it up and there isn't

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.710 
can do is thicken it up and there isn't
all<00:03:47.280> natural<00:03:47.730> later<00:03:47.910> thinking<00:03:48.240> of<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.510> by

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
all natural later thinking of that by

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.310 
all natural later thinking of that by
using<00:03:48.959> xantham<00:03:49.590> gum<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:51.120> is<00:03:51.480> what<00:03:52.230> it

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
using xantham gum and this is what it

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
up if you're like me and you spill

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.550 
up if you're like me and you spill
liquids<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.980> lot<00:04:31.190> easier<00:04:31.640> than<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.210> do

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
liquids a lot easier than you do

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.260 
liquids a lot easier than you do
something<00:04:33.560> that's<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.800> little<00:04:33.830> more<00:04:34.040> solid<00:04:34.460> or

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
something that's a little more solid or

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.170 
something that's a little more solid or
I<00:04:36.170> find<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:36.950> when<00:04:37.160> I<00:04:37.190> use<00:04:37.490> dance<00:04:37.790> I'm<00:04:37.970> going

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
I find that when I use dance I'm going

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.750 
I find that when I use dance I'm going
to<00:04:38.420> thicken<00:04:39.080> this<00:04:39.350> up<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.860> it<00:04:39.980> lasts<00:04:40.490> longer

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
to thicken this up and it lasts longer

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.490 
to thicken this up and it lasts longer
and<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.120> don't<00:04:41.300> waste<00:04:41.540> as<00:04:41.750> much<00:04:41.960> of<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.230> product

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
and I don't waste as much of the product

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.770 
and I don't waste as much of the product
a<00:04:43.060> teaspoon<00:04:44.060> that<00:04:44.450> in<00:04:45.790> about<00:04:46.790> half<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.420> it<00:04:47.570> and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780

a teaspoon that in about half of it and
roughly<00:04:48.050> measuring<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:50.320> so<00:04:51.320> I'm<00:04:51.410> going<00:04:51.590> to<00:04:51.650> add

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
roughly measuring it so I'm going to add

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.340 
roughly measuring it so I'm going to add
about<00:04:52.010> half<00:04:52.400> of<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:52.850> teaspoon<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.570> it<00:04:53.750> like<00:04:54.020> so

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
you're gonna stir and wait for it to get

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.010

you the finished product I actually it

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.250 
you the finished product I actually it
was<00:05:06.050> taking<00:05:06.350> really<00:05:06.530> long<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:07.100> stir<00:05:07.370> so<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.570> put

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
was taking really long to stir so I put

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.820 
was taking really long to stir so I put
it<00:05:09.380> into<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:10.220> blender<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:11.560> whipped<00:05:12.560> it<00:05:12.710> up

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
it into the blender and whipped it up

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.470 
it into the blender and whipped it up
really<00:05:13.310> quickly<00:05:13.550> because<00:05:13.910> if<00:05:14.000> you<00:05:14.120> stir<00:05:14.450> it

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
really quickly because if you stir it

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.780 
really quickly because if you stir it
I'm<00:05:14.810> awesome<00:05:15.440> as<00:05:15.740> mentioned<00:05:16.130> if<00:05:16.220> you<00:05:16.310> stir<00:05:16.610> it

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
I'm awesome as mentioned if you stir it

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.300 
I'm awesome as mentioned if you stir it
it<00:05:16.940> does<00:05:17.120> take<00:05:17.390> a<00:05:17.419> very<00:05:17.720> long<00:05:18.020> time<00:05:18.290> so<00:05:18.980> this<00:05:19.250> is

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
it does take a very long time so this is

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.120 
it does take a very long time so this is
the<00:05:19.610> end<00:05:19.960> consistency<00:05:20.960> that<00:05:21.110> you<00:05:21.290> get<00:05:21.560> it's

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
the end consistency that you get it's

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.370 
the end consistency that you get it's
nice<00:05:22.520> and<00:05:22.820> thick<00:05:23.180> like<00:05:23.600> I<00:05:23.720> said<00:05:23.960> if<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:24.200> want

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
nice and thick like I said if you want

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.380 
nice and thick like I said if you want
it<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.530> be<00:05:24.680> thinner<00:05:24.980> add<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.490> little<00:05:25.910> bit<00:05:26.120> less

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
it to be thinner add a little bit less

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.260 
it to be thinner add a little bit less
but<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:26.990> love<00:05:27.290> it<00:05:27.440> this<00:05:27.560> way<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.490> find<00:05:28.760> a<00:05:28.850> funnel

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
but I love it this way and find a funnel

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.980 
but I love it this way and find a funnel
so<00:05:29.930> what<00:05:30.080> I'm<00:05:30.169> going<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.350> do<00:05:30.500> is<00:05:30.650> use<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.160> zip

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
so what I'm going to do is use the zip

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.370 
so what I'm going to do is use the zip
cut<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.830> corner<00:05:33.130> of<00:05:33.370> it<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:34.180> dispose<00:05:34.720> to<00:05:35.260> the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
cut the corner of it to dispose to the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.100 
cut the corner of it to dispose to the
Spencer<00:05:35.800> the<00:05:35.950> shampoo<00:05:36.640> into<00:05:37.120> that<00:05:37.810> model

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
Spencer the shampoo into that model

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.800 
Spencer the shampoo into that model
which<00:05:38.800> is<00:05:38.950> way<00:05:39.220> cheaper<00:05:39.250> than<00:05:39.760> buying<00:05:40.150> shampoo

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
which is way cheaper than buying shampoo

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.410 
which is way cheaper than buying shampoo
if<00:05:41.140> you<00:05:41.170> had<00:05:41.440> at<00:05:41.560> the<00:05:41.650> ingredients<00:05:42.090> and<00:05:43.090> you

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
if you had at the ingredients and you

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.720 
if you had at the ingredients and you
will<00:05:43.510> really<00:05:44.050> never<00:05:44.260> run<00:05:44.560> out<00:05:44.590> so<00:05:45.400> what<00:05:45.640> I'm
