00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.309
 repubblica has the task of trying 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.000
 to form the new government 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:22.010
 here's how you know out the 6 with 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.150
 responsibility also the sense of 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.939
 importance and relevance of this challenge 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.760
 I thanked the president of 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.520
 I assured the republic but in 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.940
 this whole difficult situation 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.870
 the commitment and the energy of which I will be e 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.440
 we will be capable of the next ones 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.840
 hours 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.600
 we will first meet the president 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.890
 of the room 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:52.579
 then I will be in Florence for the Senate 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.949
 necessary for the insurrectionary movement 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:00.549
 energy city and from tonight to Rome 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.860
 tomorrow the consultations will begin 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:10.159
 formal and official 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:14.090
 the commitment that we are firm while very 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.569
 you are very significant president of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.550
 republic represented me so 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.060
 completed and articulated 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.310
 the outcome of his consultations 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.850
 the commitment that we imagine those of a 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.759
 lengthening in the political perspective 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.310
 of this legislature and then yes 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.240
 sets me the expected natural horizon 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.170
 from the constitution 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.929
 therefore before any discussion 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.799
 it is essential that political forces 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.619
 of the majority for what 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.330
 concerns the government and the whole arch 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.850
 constitutional with regard to the 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.750
 profile of the reforms are well 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.219
 aware of the next steps 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.750
 that is, it means having in the next few hours 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.200
 an extraordinary attention to 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.320
 content and choices to make 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.409
 the platform with which we will discuss 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.990
 together with the political forces it is that 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.890
 which provides 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.780
 within the month of February a job of 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.170
 people on constitutional reforms and 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.950
 literals to bring to the attention of 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.220
 parliament and immediately afterwards in the months 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.459
 following immediately one month of 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.930
 March to the question of labor in the month 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.269
 of April the reform of the public 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.349
 administration where May is that 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.140
 of the tax authorities 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.209
 in other words we intend to 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.769
 work very seriously on 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.630
 content before any discussion 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.180
 I am in solidarity with you in these hours 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.299
 you are writing 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.370
 very complicated things about 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.459
 men and someone also concerns the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.760
 personal stories and so I came to 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.129
 boredom alone the son-in-law and therefore I imagine 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.650
 what can you find 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.950
 having said that our attention is on 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.889
 content that you don't play we take the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.629
 time needed knowing that out of 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:11.939
 here the sense of urgency is 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:15.780
 extraordinarily delicate and important 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:18.510
 but it is also equally true that a 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.120
 legislature horizon like the one that 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.959
 we need each other for what we are 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.310
 concerns a few days time 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.530
 to get to dissolve the reserve 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.159
 what concerns me sure Mr. 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.400
 president political forces and her 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:42.450
 especially the Italian people who 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.700
 are witnessing this crisis of 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.739
 government that I will put all my courage 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.030
 the enthusiasm of which is not taken away 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.250
 I'm able 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.690
 starting from the most important emergency 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.729
 which is what it concerns not only 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.979
 my generation but mine too 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:58.379
 generation that is the emergence of work 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.699
 of employment and somehow too 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.079
 of resignation 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.079
 we have which one works for
