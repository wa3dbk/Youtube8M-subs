let the water get in let microbes get

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:29.529 
let the water get in let microbes get
into<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.140> soil<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.679> turn<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.579> soil<00:01:28.789> on<00:01:29.030> that

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
into the soil and turn the soil on that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.039 
into the soil and turn the soil on that
that<00:01:30.140> will<00:01:30.259> actually<00:01:30.319> work<00:01:30.590> for<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.069> and

medium green sort of sand and what this

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.879 
medium green sort of sand and what this
does<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.149> it<00:01:56.329> creates<00:01:56.749> little<00:01:57.079> pockets<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.679> air

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:57.889 
does is it creates little pockets of air

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:03.819 
does is it creates little pockets of air
in<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.310> clay<00:01:58.549> soil<00:01:59.170> and<00:02:00.170> um<00:02:02.319> it<00:02:03.319> doesn't<00:02:03.740> let

in the clay soil and um it doesn't let

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.770 
in the clay soil and um it doesn't let
the<00:02:03.950> soil<00:02:04.069> it<00:02:04.789> doesn't<00:02:04.819> let<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.240> clay<00:02:05.420> soil

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
the soil it doesn't let the clay soil

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.559 
the soil it doesn't let the clay soil
clump<00:02:06.289> together<00:02:06.439> so<00:02:06.859> much<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.340> another<00:02:08.300> type

composted<00:02:23.989> wood<00:02:24.019> forest<00:02:24.890> products

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
composted wood forest products

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.210 
composted wood forest products
and<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> piece<00:02:27.989> like<00:02:28.200> well<00:02:29.069> it's

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
and you have a piece like well it's

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.250 
and you have a piece like well it's
called<00:02:29.400> or<00:02:29.550> make<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.790> late<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.209> know<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.110> can

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
called or make you late I know you can

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.589 
called or make you late I know you can
see<00:02:31.440> there<00:02:31.909> it's<00:02:32.909> kinda<00:02:33.150> hard<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.360> see<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:35.599> we

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
see there it's kinda hard to see and we

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.350 
see there it's kinda hard to see and we
also<00:02:36.750> make<00:02:36.989> compost<00:02:37.440> here<00:02:37.860> my<00:02:38.099> where<00:02:38.819> I<00:02:38.849> live

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
also make compost here my where I live

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.740 
also make compost here my where I live
and<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:41.370> is<00:02:41.519> basically<00:02:41.700> what<00:02:42.000> compost<00:02:42.450> looks

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and this is basically what compost looks

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.270 
and this is basically what compost looks
like<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.680> isn't<00:02:43.950> from<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.250> store<00:02:44.989> this<00:02:46.280> you

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
like this isn't from a store this you

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.070 
like this isn't from a store this you
can<00:02:47.400> just<00:02:47.549> make<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.849> from<00:02:48.090> leaf<00:02:48.330> products<00:02:48.870> or

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
can just make this from leaf products or

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.470 
can just make this from leaf products or
um<00:02:49.950> grass<00:02:50.670> clippings<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:52.340> food<00:02:53.340> waste<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
um grass clippings of food waste the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.640 
um grass clippings of food waste the
stuff<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.989> would<00:02:55.140> basically<00:02:55.230> throw

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
stuff that you would basically throw

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.699 
stuff that you would basically throw
away<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.690> if<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.959> were<00:02:58.079> just<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.349> let<00:02:58.560> this

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
away and if you were just to let this

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.309 
away and if you were just to let this
decay<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.489> your<00:02:59.819> yard<00:03:00.180> every<00:03:00.390> year<00:03:00.599> rather

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
decay in your yard every year rather

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.789 
decay in your yard every year rather
than<00:03:01.640> breaking<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.879> up<00:03:03.290> you'd<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.440> able<00:03:04.560> to

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
than breaking it up you'd be able to

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.309 
than breaking it up you'd be able to
have<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> really<00:03:05.670> nice<00:03:05.819> topsoil<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.750> lets

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
have a really nice topsoil that lets

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.990 
have a really nice topsoil that lets
that<00:03:07.680> retains<00:03:07.980> water<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:10.340> you<00:03:11.340> know<00:03:11.459> lets<00:03:11.879> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
that retains water and you know lets the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.390 
that retains water and you know lets the
water<00:03:12.180> get<00:03:12.450> down<00:03:12.629> into<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:14.190> where<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
water get down into the to where the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.759 
water get down into the to where the
trees<00:03:14.579> are<00:03:14.640> trying<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.239> drink<00:03:15.660> water<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
trees are trying to drink water to the

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.619 
trees are trying to drink water to the
root<00:03:16.980> systems<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:19.220> now<00:03:20.220> I'm<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.459> mess<00:03:20.670> here<00:03:20.910> but

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
root systems so now I'm a mess here but

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.309 
root systems so now I'm a mess here but
uh<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:23.010> said<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.629> make<00:03:24.629> sure<00:03:24.780> your<00:03:24.900> sands

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
uh like I said so make sure your sands

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.979 
uh like I said so make sure your sands
and<00:03:25.530> if<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.129> mix<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.970> if<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.209> mix<00:03:27.420> all<00:03:27.629> these

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
and if you mix it if you mix all these

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:28.729 
and if you mix it if you mix all these
things<00:03:28.260> together

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
things together

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.580 
things together
and<00:03:29.579> you<00:03:30.060> do<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.239> really<00:03:30.419> good<00:03:30.660> job<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:31.290> breaking

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
and you do a really good job of breaking

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.580 
and you do a really good job of breaking
it<00:03:31.859> down<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.389> make<00:03:33.569> some<00:03:34.049> pretty<00:03:34.200> good

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
it down you can make some pretty good

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.009 
it down you can make some pretty good
soil<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:36.329> I<00:03:36.389> have<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.569> little<00:03:36.870> demonstration

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
soil and I have a little demonstration

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:43.580 
soil and I have a little demonstration
over<00:03:37.560> here<00:03:38.030> this<00:03:39.030> is<00:03:40.190> just<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.989> mixture<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.349> all

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
over here this is just a mixture of all

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.289 
over here this is just a mixture of all
three<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:44.130> these<00:03:44.329> soils<00:03:45.329> right<00:03:45.510> here<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:46.680> it's

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
three of these soils right here and it's

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.490 
three of these soils right here and it's
allowed<00:03:48.299> water<00:03:48.569> to<00:03:48.690> get<00:03:48.870> through<00:03:49.319> there

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
allowed water to get through there

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.509 
allowed water to get through there
really<00:03:49.889> well<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:51.200> this<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.260> just<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.829> clay

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
really well and this is just the clay

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.670 
really well and this is just the clay
soil<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:54.959> I'm<00:03:55.049> just<00:03:55.139> going<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.319> do<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> little

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
soil so I'm just going to do a little

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.000 
soil so I'm just going to do a little
demonstration<00:03:55.889> for<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.579> here<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.970> how<00:03:58.010> the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
demonstration for you here of how the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.330 
demonstration for you here of how the
two<00:03:59.250> differ<00:03:59.730> in<00:04:00.690> regards<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:03.019> water

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
two differ in regards to water

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.500 
two differ in regards to water
so<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:07.440> is<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.620> clay<00:04:07.950> soil<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:11.610> you<00:04:11.790> see<00:04:11.970> how<00:04:12.150> it

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
so it is a clay soil and you see how it

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.710 
so it is a clay soil and you see how it
didn't<00:04:12.840> really<00:04:12.989> let<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.319> water<00:04:13.500> go<00:04:14.489> in<00:04:14.720> it's

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
didn't really let the water go in it's

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.780 
didn't really let the water go in it's
slowly<00:04:16.139> letting<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.739> water<00:04:16.859> go<00:04:17.040> through<00:04:19.790> it's

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
slowly letting the water go through it's

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.120 
slowly letting the water go through it's
letting<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.299> go<00:04:21.450> through<00:04:21.630> but<00:04:22.320> most<00:04:22.919> of<00:04:23.070> the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
letting it go through but most of the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.800 
letting it go through but most of the
water<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.490> staying<00:04:23.730> up<00:04:23.910> here<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.740> over<00:04:26.010> time

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
water is staying up here and over time

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.830 
water is staying up here and over time
this<00:04:27.810> this<00:04:28.590> so<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.919> will<00:04:29.040> get<00:04:29.160> compacted<00:04:29.840> it'll

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
this this so it will get compacted it'll

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.060 
this this so it will get compacted it'll
get<00:04:30.990> harder<00:04:31.320> for<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.560> tree<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:32.070> breathe<00:04:32.970> in<00:04:33.570> to

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
get harder for the tree to breathe in to

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.040 
get harder for the tree to breathe in to
move<00:04:35.070> around<00:04:35.450> unless<00:04:36.450> you're<00:04:36.600> keeping<00:04:36.720> this

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
move around unless you're keeping this

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.830 
move around unless you're keeping this
water<00:04:37.520> saturated<00:04:38.520> which<00:04:39.330> that<00:04:39.540> wouldn't<00:04:39.780> be

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
water saturated which that wouldn't be

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.770 
water saturated which that wouldn't be
good<00:04:39.990> for<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.200> tree<00:04:40.350> either<00:04:41.240> this<00:04:42.240> club<00:04:42.540> this

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
good for the tree either this club this

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.740 
good for the tree either this club this
type<00:04:43.169> of<00:04:43.200> soil<00:04:43.440> just<00:04:44.010> gets<00:04:44.880> rock-hard<00:04:45.330> after

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
type of soil just gets rock-hard after

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:53.650 
type of soil just gets rock-hard after
it<00:04:46.169> compacts<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:47.210> this<00:04:48.210> is<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.479> treated<00:04:48.900> soil

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.170 

now<00:04:54.660> you<00:04:54.720> will<00:04:54.930> notice

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180
