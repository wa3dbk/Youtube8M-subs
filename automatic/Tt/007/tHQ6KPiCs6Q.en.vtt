that<00:00:28.650> big<00:00:28.830> motherfucker<00:00:29.689> this<00:00:30.689> glitch<00:00:30.900> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
that big motherfucker this glitch is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
that big motherfucker this glitch is
actually<00:00:31.289> pretty<00:00:31.470> hard<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.399> who

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
actually pretty hard to do so I one who

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
actually pretty hard to do so I one who
is<00:00:32.669> fairly<00:00:32.940> new<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> glitching<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.110> general

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
is fairly new to glitching in general

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.990 
is fairly new to glitching in general
probably<00:00:35.040> should<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.340> doing<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
probably should not be doing this you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.940 
probably should not be doing this you
should<00:00:36.239> probably<00:00:36.329> use<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> window<00:00:37.050> very

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
should probably use the window very

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.010 
should probably use the window very
