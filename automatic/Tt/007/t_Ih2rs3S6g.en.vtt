00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
from kinking or bending the tile if I

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.700 
from kinking or bending the tile if I
walk<00:01:53.420> on<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.780> cap<00:01:54.020> sections

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
walk on the cap sections

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.109 
walk on the cap sections
it'll<00:01:55.069> keep<00:01:55.520> or<00:01:56.020> bend<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.140> tile<00:01:57.380> in<00:01:57.679> and

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
it'll keep or bend the tile in and

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.240 
it'll keep or bend the tile in and
you'll<00:01:59.119> have<00:01:59.300> to<00:01:59.450> repair<00:01:59.780> that<00:01:59.960> later<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:01.160> I

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
you'll have to repair that later and I

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.680 
you'll have to repair that later and I
think<00:02:01.490> we<00:02:01.610> have<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.759> little<00:02:02.000> example<00:02:02.509> of<00:02:02.569> that

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
think we have a little example of that

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.140 
think we have a little example of that
coming<00:02:03.020> up
