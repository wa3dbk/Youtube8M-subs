00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.289
 Today's expert, let's talk to 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.380

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.689
 front of the false delta here in brazil 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.060
 here with me 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.130
 Luis Lunardelli is fine on skin all 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.260
 well the milan is very welcome r10 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 demanded that you send her a 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.940
 specialist in sanitary metals issue 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.980
 a doubt indeed some doubts 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.829
 mine and I'm sure a lot of people 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.750
 because when I travel outside the country 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.210
 I managed to take a nice shower without 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.950
 variations in temperature since 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.660
 In my apartment, just call the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.430
 shower in the other room while you 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.739
 a bath that the temperature of my water 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.300
 superheat heads because this happens 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.320
 camila to monitor the temperature of the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.539
 shower 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.390
 the big problem is well maternity 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.909
 use of the bathroom people are at the same time 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.520
 time using warm water government a 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.890
 residence in a hospital hotel 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.939
 there is the simultaneous use of water 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.520
 hot and cold 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.900
 the products in brazil today do not do this 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.110
 monitoring work 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.330
 we need to have a product that does 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.710
 this balance when you have the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.810
 concurrency of use 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.509
 then you must have a device on the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.060
 place than to control the water 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.320
 hot and cold and then exploded 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.990
 this balance 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.860
 This is a system that in the United States 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.930
 in Europe 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.030
 it's called pre are bullets that's what the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.579
 delta is doing Brazil now to dell 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.770
 has this solution and I as a customer is not 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.110
 select sanitary metals it is clear that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.329
 my for example at bath time 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.110
 want a comfortable and relaxing bath 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.990
 tasty in the kitchen practicality and of course 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.180
 will not waste as you are an expert 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.520
 on the subject and guide the choice of 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.310
 metals that I have my expectations 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.500
 the kitchen do you have some 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.560
 important characteristics of the type is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.810
 product size people prefer 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.030
 is higher products for an object 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.000
 The biggest one that stands is in front of the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.250
 first gets bushes remove the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.660
 products have a high resistance in the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.580
 surface treatment 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.290
 this is very important because in 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.849
 kitchen has lots of scotch application 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.800
 brite good bath aggressive products 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.989
 cleaning you also have to 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.910
 worrying is a simple command to 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.940
 Convenience opening close and beyond

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.000
 water-saving practicality and beyond 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.209
 more if you are with your hands full 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.340

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.340
 very nice for voting 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.900
 in relation to the shower is a bit more 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.810
 complicated the famous bath time in the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.909

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.239
 a technology of balancing 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.120
 pressure that has a simultaneous pressure 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.459
 Are you going to have a car competition? 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.169
 Hot cold from the bathroom and you will not 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.319
 to have a bath in court 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:50.049

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.239
 cnet technology 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.849
 it uses little water that gives comfort 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.709
 too large in the bath to reduce the 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:03.189
 water consumption greater sustainability 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.280
 of the project's best practicality 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:09.879
 bath and also in relation to consumption of 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.639
 gas and water energy lies within a 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.040
 then it is really beautiful functional and 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.419
