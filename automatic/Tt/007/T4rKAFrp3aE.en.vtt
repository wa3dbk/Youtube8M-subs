we're gonna take a look at a general

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.869 
we're gonna take a look at a general
overview<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.540> all<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.080> different<00:00:04.470> types<00:00:04.620> of

overview of all the different types of

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.130 
overview of all the different types of
cells<00:00:05.879> that<00:00:05.970> can<00:00:06.210> be<00:00:06.299> found<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.930> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
cells that can be found in the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.339 
cells that can be found in the
bloodstream<00:00:07.410> based<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.840> what's<00:00:09.840> necessary

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
bloodstream based on what's necessary

bloodstream based on what's necessary
for<00:00:10.440> fighting<00:00:10.920> disease<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.730> then<00:00:11.940> we're

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
for fighting disease and then we're

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.209 
for fighting disease and then we're
gonna<00:00:12.120> take<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.360> look<00:00:12.509> at<00:00:12.660> cytotoxic<00:00:13.410> t-cells<00:00:13.920> a

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
gonna take a look at cytotoxic t-cells a

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.829 
gonna take a look at cytotoxic t-cells a
little<00:00:14.460> bit<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.820> fourth<00:00:15.179> type<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.630> cell

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
little bit it's a fourth type of cell

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.240 
little bit it's a fourth type of cell
ringing<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.199> introduced<00:00:16.440> here<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.890> then

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
ringing and introduced here and then

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.070 
ringing and introduced here and then
finally<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.119> know<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.660> all<00:00:18.779> kind<00:00:19.020> of

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
finally I know it's all kind of

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.660 
finally I know it's all kind of
hodgepodge<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.890> finally<00:00:20.310> we're<00:00:20.400> gonna<00:00:20.460> be

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
hodgepodge the finally we're gonna be

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.439 
hodgepodge the finally we're gonna be
looking<00:00:20.939> at<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.779> production<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.350> monoclonal

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
looking at the production of monoclonal

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.570 
looking at the production of monoclonal
antibodies<00:00:24.449> especially<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.340> treatment

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580

antibodies especially in the treatment
of<00:00:26.789> rabies<00:00:27.119> or<00:00:27.599> something<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.230> okay<00:00:28.769> so

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
of rabies or something like that okay so

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.120 
of rabies or something like that okay so
things<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.300> be<00:00:30.390> found<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.560> blood

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
things that can be found in the blood

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.799 
things that can be found in the blood
you<00:00:32.759> should<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.969> able<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.120> list<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.390> whole<00:00:33.570> bunch

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you should be able to list a whole bunch

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.420 
you should be able to list a whole bunch
of<00:00:33.989> things<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.860> comes<00:00:35.160> up<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
of things like that comes up as a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.130 
of things like that comes up as a
question<00:00:35.820> quite<00:00:36.059> often<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.510> list<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.930> quite

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
question quite often a list is quite

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.340 
question quite often a list is quite
easy<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.219> got<00:00:38.399> platelets

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
easy but have you got platelets

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.630 
easy but have you got platelets
erythrocytes<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.500> emphasize<00:00:40.640> phagocytes

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
erythrocytes can emphasize phagocytes

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.680 
erythrocytes can emphasize phagocytes
and<00:00:42.620> there's<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> little<00:00:44.010> idea<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.879> proportion

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and there's a little idea of proportion

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.369 
and there's a little idea of proportion
when<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:46.860> related<00:00:47.309> together<00:00:48.260> we've<00:00:49.260> got

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
when it's all related together we've got

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.529 
when it's all related together we've got
types<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.460> blood<00:00:50.640> cells<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:51.059> general<00:00:51.390> you've

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.060 
got your red blood cells and white blood
cells<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:54.480> red<00:00:54.870> blood<00:00:55.140> cells<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.860> should

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
cells the red blood cells you should

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.830 
cells the red blood cells you should
know<00:00:56.219> are<00:00:56.340> called<00:00:56.660> erythrocytes

RBC in general white blood cells are
called<00:01:00.829> leukocytes<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.879> we've<00:01:03.210> divided

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
called leukocytes and here we've divided

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.810 
called leukocytes and here we've divided
up<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.320> leukocytes<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.400> four<00:01:05.610> types

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
immune defense in íb biology so we're

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.539 
immune defense in íb biology so we're
looking<00:01:12.450> at<00:01:12.600> B<00:01:12.900> cells<00:01:13.229> these<00:01:13.770> are<00:01:13.830> lymphocytes

looking at B cells these are lymphocytes
B<00:01:15.210> cells<00:01:15.450> are<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> ones<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.020> produce

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
B cells are the ones that produce

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950 
B cells are the ones that produce
antibodies<00:01:16.909> helper<00:01:17.909> T<00:01:18.119> cells<00:01:18.420> help<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:18.869> the

antibodies helper T cells help with the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.929 
antibodies helper T cells help with the
activation<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.920> these<00:01:20.189> particular<00:01:20.640> cells

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
activation of these particular cells

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.179 
activation of these particular cells
these<00:01:21.210> are<00:01:21.270> also<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.750> targets<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.350> HIV

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
these are also the targets of HIV

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.670 
these are also the targets of HIV
you've<00:01:23.640> got<00:01:23.820> phagocytes<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:25.049> general

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you've got phagocytes these are general

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
non specific white blood cells kind of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.450 
non specific white blood cells kind of
like<00:01:29.640> pac-man<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.869> take<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:32.220> try

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
like pac-man that go and take just try

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.010 
like pac-man that go and take just try
to<00:01:32.520> devour<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.299> whole<00:01:33.479> bunch<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.750> different

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to devour a whole bunch of different

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.319 
to devour a whole bunch of different
types<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.350> things<00:01:34.590> go<00:01:35.250> through<00:01:35.329> endocytosis

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
types of things go through endocytosis

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
types of things go through endocytosis
and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.439> you've<00:01:37.590> got<00:01:37.710> cytotoxic<00:01:38.460> t-cells

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and then you've got cytotoxic t-cells

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.539 
and then you've got cytotoxic t-cells
which<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.570> haven't<00:01:39.869> addressed<00:01:40.650> specifically

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
which we haven't addressed specifically

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.090 
which we haven't addressed specifically
in<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.060> production<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.600> antibodies<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
in the production of antibodies and the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.310 
in the production of antibodies and the
immune<00:01:44.549> system<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.509> haven't<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.020> talked

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
immune system we haven't really talked

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.469 
immune system we haven't really talked
about<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.799> specific<00:01:47.280> role<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.579> cytotoxic

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
about the specific role of cytotoxic

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.940 
about the specific role of cytotoxic
t-cells<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.409> think<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.710> them<00:01:49.829> as

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
t-cells but you can think of them as

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.240 
t-cells but you can think of them as
being<00:01:49.979> very<00:01:50.369> special<00:01:50.670> as<00:01:51.030> being<00:01:51.649> extra<00:01:52.649> toxic

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
being very special as being extra toxic

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.050 
being very special as being extra toxic
they<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.700> kill<00:01:54.619> toxic<00:01:55.619> saito<00:01:56.579> means

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
they like to kill toxic saito means

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.880 
they like to kill toxic saito means
having<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.930> cell<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.619> it's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
having to do with the cell so it's

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.039 
having to do with the cell so it's
something<00:01:59.399> about<00:01:59.700> killing<00:02:00.060> cells<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.869> these

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
something about killing cells so these

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.230 
something about killing cells so these
t-cells<00:02:01.320> are<00:02:01.979> killing<00:02:02.549> certain<00:02:02.759> types<00:02:03.060> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
t-cells are killing certain types of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.649 
t-cells are killing certain types of
cells<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.200> cytotoxic<00:02:05.100> t-cells<00:02:05.610> are<00:02:05.969> good

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
cells so cytotoxic t-cells are good

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.320 
cells so cytotoxic t-cells are good
because<00:02:06.899> they<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.049> also<00:02:07.369> target<00:02:08.369> viral

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
because they can also target viral

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.400 
because they can also target viral
particles<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.020> are<00:02:10.080> in

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
particles that are in

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.250 
particles that are in
and<00:02:11.130> they<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.910> help<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.240> destroy<00:02:12.660> cells<00:02:13.020> that

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and they can help to destroy cells that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.900 
and they can help to destroy cells that
have<00:02:13.470> been<00:02:13.680> infected<00:02:13.920> by<00:02:14.550> viral<00:02:15.030> particles

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
have been infected by viral particles

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.460 
have been infected by viral particles
they<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:17.940> also<00:02:18.240> target<00:02:18.810> type<00:02:19.140> different

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
they can also target type different

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.530 
they can also target type different
types<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.980> cells<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:20.940> are<00:02:21.090> dividing

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
types of cells that are dividing

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.750 
types of cells that are dividing
uncontrollably<00:02:21.740> so<00:02:22.740> they're<00:02:22.980> also<00:02:23.160> targeting

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
uncontrollably so they're also targeting

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.940 
uncontrollably so they're also targeting
some<00:02:24.000> kinds<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.330> cancer<00:02:24.560> cells<00:02:25.560> okay<00:02:25.800> we're

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
some kinds of cancer cells okay we're

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.380 
some kinds of cancer cells okay we're
gonna<00:02:26.040> skip<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.520> section<00:02:26.910> over<00:02:27.000> here<00:02:29.390> to

gonna skip that section over here to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.690 
gonna skip that section over here to

excuse me I'm not gonna have time to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.760 
excuse me I'm not gonna have time to

edit that out I also applied on

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.620 
edit that out I also applied on
cytotoxic<00:02:35.490> T<00:02:35.640> cells<00:02:35.910> there<00:02:36.150> are<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.270> specific

actual saliva what happens is people
actually<00:03:10.820> can<00:03:11.820> die<00:03:12.590> really<00:03:13.590> really<00:03:13.800> fast

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
actually can die really really fast

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.040 
actually can die really really fast
before<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.760> body<00:03:14.940> even<00:03:15.240> produces<00:03:15.810> enough

are we can do we can instantly vaccinate
against<00:03:30.959> rabies

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
okay vaccine against rabies at that

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.060 
okay vaccine against rabies at that
point<00:03:33.330> it's<00:03:33.480> kind<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.720> too<00:03:33.900> late<00:03:33.930> as<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.830> are

already<00:03:35.610> suspected<00:03:36.510> -<00:03:36.770> well<00:03:37.770> that's<00:03:37.950> that's

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
already suspected - well that's that's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.370 
already suspected - well that's that's
the<00:03:38.310> whole<00:03:38.400> thing<00:03:38.670> you're<00:03:39.000> not<00:03:39.150> sure<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:40.050> it's

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
the whole thing you're not sure and it's

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.870 
the whole thing you're not sure and it's
gonna<00:03:40.470> take<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.860> long<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.040> find<00:03:41.190> out<00:03:41.550> if<00:03:41.730> it's

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
gonna take you long to find out if it's

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.699 
gonna take you long to find out if it's
actually<00:03:42.180> there<00:03:42.300> but<00:03:42.570> if<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:43.080> can<00:03:43.290> catch<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
actually there but if you can catch the

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.070 
actually there but if you can catch the
dog<00:03:43.920> or<00:03:44.370> catch<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.640> animal<00:03:45.270> the<00:03:45.390> raccoon<00:03:45.810> and

dog or catch the animal the raccoon and

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.080 
dog or catch the animal the raccoon and
bring<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.800> they<00:03:47.220> can<00:03:47.400> actually<00:03:47.670> test<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
bring it in they can actually test the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.940 
bring it in they can actually test the
animal<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.660> find<00:03:48.959> out<00:03:49.140> sometimes<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.650> can't

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
animal and find out sometimes you can't

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.460 
animal and find out sometimes you can't
but<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.580> sucesses<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.720> suspect<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.290> might

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
but you sucesses you suspect that might

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.220 
but you sucesses you suspect that might
be<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.739> case<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.520> you<00:03:53.580> can<00:03:53.730> simultaneously

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
be the case so you can simultaneously

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.390 
be the case so you can simultaneously
vaccinated<00:03:55.230> against<00:03:55.530> rabies<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:56.070> protect

yourself in case it hasn't caused a
full-blown<00:03:59.250> /<00:04:00.800> infection<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.790> can<00:04:02.970> also

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
full-blown / infection and you can also

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.510 
full-blown / infection and you can also
inject<00:04:03.750> antibodies<00:04:04.739> at<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.920> same<00:04:05.100> time<00:04:05.340> now

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
inject antibodies at the same time now

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.160 
inject antibodies at the same time now
these<00:04:05.640> are<00:04:05.820> not<00:04:05.910> antibodies<00:04:06.570> that<00:04:06.750> your<00:04:06.959> body

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
these are not antibodies that your body

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.380 
these are not antibodies that your body
has<00:04:07.290> produced<00:04:07.920> these<00:04:08.670> are<00:04:08.790> antibodies<00:04:09.360> that

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
has produced these are antibodies that

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.050 
has produced these are antibodies that
some<00:04:09.810> other<00:04:10.130> organism<00:04:11.130> has<00:04:11.250> produced<00:04:11.610> for<00:04:11.880> you

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
some other organism has produced for you

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.240 
some other organism has produced for you
we<00:04:12.480> call<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.780> monoclonal<00:04:13.470> antibodies

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
we call the monoclonal antibodies

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.610 
we call the monoclonal antibodies
because<00:04:14.459> we've<00:04:14.610> made<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:15.090> specific<00:04:15.420> clone<00:04:16.320> of

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
because we've made a specific clone of

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.930 
because we've made a specific clone of
the<00:04:16.859> correct<00:04:17.220> type<00:04:17.340> one<00:04:18.270> clone<00:04:19.039> clone<00:04:20.039> group

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
the correct type one clone clone group

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.000 
the correct type one clone clone group
the<00:04:21.000> correct<00:04:21.299> type<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.810> antibodies<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.860> we're

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
the correct type of antibodies and we're

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.040 
the correct type of antibodies and we're
injected<00:04:23.400> into<00:04:23.640> your<00:04:23.730> body<00:04:23.790> to<00:04:24.240> help<00:04:24.600> target

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
injected into your body to help target

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.230 
injected into your body to help target
the<00:04:25.650> pathogens<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.490> then<00:04:26.670> the<00:04:26.730> macrophages

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
the pathogens and then the macrophages

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.360 
the pathogens and then the macrophages
can<00:04:27.540> go<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:27.840> try<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.020> take<00:04:28.260> them<00:04:28.410> out<00:04:28.560> faster

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
can go and try to take them out faster

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.780 
can go and try to take them out faster
so<00:04:30.140> here's<00:04:31.140> a<00:04:31.230> general<00:04:31.440> procedure<00:04:31.890> for<00:04:32.280> how<00:04:32.730> to

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
so here's a general procedure for how to

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.120 
so here's a general procedure for how to
produce<00:04:33.090> these<00:04:33.750> antibodies<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.650> vaccines

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
produce these antibodies the vaccines

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.250 
produce these antibodies the vaccines
we've<00:04:35.670> talked<00:04:35.910> about<00:04:36.030> before<00:04:36.300> but<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.140> produce

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
we've talked about before but to produce

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.230 
we've talked about before but to produce
the<00:04:37.590> actual<00:04:37.740> monoclonal<00:04:38.340> antibodies<00:04:39.120> you

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
the actual monoclonal antibodies you

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.850 
the actual monoclonal antibodies you
have<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.540> get<00:04:39.690> somebody<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.110> make<00:04:40.350> them<00:04:40.560> for

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
have to get somebody to make them for

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.980 
have to get somebody to make them for
you<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:41.280> we<00:04:41.700> actually<00:04:42.060> take<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.390> antigen<00:04:42.870> in

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
you so we actually take the antigen in

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.960 
you so we actually take the antigen in
this<00:04:43.140> case<00:04:43.350> it<00:04:43.530> would<00:04:43.590> be<00:04:43.650> an<00:04:43.860> antigen<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.820> will

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
this case it would be an antigen it will

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.710 
this case it would be an antigen it will
be<00:04:45.060> viral<00:04:45.360> particles<00:04:46.880> viral<00:04:47.880> particles<00:04:48.510> that

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
be viral particles viral particles that

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.540 
be viral particles viral particles that
contain<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.380> antigen<00:04:50.100> which<00:04:50.310> are<00:04:50.460> the

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
contain the antigen which are the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.940 
contain the antigen which are the
triggers<00:04:50.940> that<00:04:51.510> correspond<00:04:52.140> to<00:04:52.200> rabies<00:04:52.710> and

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
triggers that correspond to rabies and

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.370 
triggers that correspond to rabies and
we<00:04:53.430> put<00:04:53.700> them<00:04:53.880> into<00:04:54.090> some<00:04:54.480> kind<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:54.780> animal<00:04:55.230> and

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
we put them into some kind of animal and

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.200 
we put them into some kind of animal and
we<00:04:55.560> cause<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:56.070> animal<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.730> go<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:56.940> the

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
we cause that animal to go to the

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.440 
we cause that animal to go to the
process<00:04:57.450> of<00:04:57.840> producing<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:59.520> correct

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
process of producing the correct

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.810 
process of producing the correct
antibody<00:05:01.050> so<00:05:01.500> that<00:05:01.650> animal<00:05:02.100> actually<00:05:02.310> it<00:05:02.610> goes

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
antibody so that animal actually it goes

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.660 
antibody so that animal actually it goes
through<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.180> immune<00:05:03.390> response<00:05:03.450> and

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
through the immune response and

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.220 
through the immune response and
hopefully<00:05:05.670> doesn't<00:05:06.000> die<00:05:06.180> in<00:05:06.480> the<00:05:06.630> process<00:05:07.050> and

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
hopefully doesn't die in the process and

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.970 
hopefully doesn't die in the process and
produces<00:05:07.830> these<00:05:08.420> antibodies<00:05:09.710> we<00:05:10.710> try<00:05:10.920> to

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
produces these antibodies we try to

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.100 
produces these antibodies we try to
identify<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.640> b-cells<00:05:12.270> that<00:05:12.510> are<00:05:12.600> producing

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
identify the b-cells that are producing

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.560 
identify the b-cells that are producing
the<00:05:13.290> correct<00:05:13.650> antibody<00:05:14.280> so<00:05:14.670> these<00:05:15.210> b-cells

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
the correct antibody so these b-cells

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.170 
the correct antibody so these b-cells
have<00:05:15.990> been<00:05:16.110> stimulated<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.940> hopefully<00:05:17.940> our

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
have been stimulated and hopefully our

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.750 
have been stimulated and hopefully our
making<00:05:18.720> clones<00:05:19.050> of<00:05:19.260> themselves<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:20.040> are

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
making clones of themselves and are

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.220 
making clones of themselves and are
producing<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.270> correct<00:05:21.510> antibody<00:05:21.990> that

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
producing the correct antibody that

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.940 
producing the correct antibody that
matches<00:05:22.620> with<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.830> rabies<00:05:23.780> viral<00:05:24.950> antigens

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
matches with the rabies viral antigens

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.190 
matches with the rabies viral antigens
and<00:05:26.190> we<00:05:26.669> extract<00:05:27.090> these<00:05:27.330> b-cells<00:05:27.720> these

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
and we extract these b-cells these

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.310 
and we extract these b-cells these
specific<00:05:28.650> b-cells<00:05:29.040> from<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.370> animal<00:05:30.140> we<00:05:31.140> now

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
specific b-cells from the animal we now

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.070 
specific b-cells from the animal we now
take<00:05:31.710> these<00:05:32.150> b-cells<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.660> we're<00:05:33.900> actually

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
take these b-cells and we're actually

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.310 
take these b-cells and we're actually
going<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.650> combine<00:05:35.610> them<00:05:36.150> with<00:05:36.390> some<00:05:36.840> tumor

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
going to combine them with some tumor

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.560 
going to combine them with some tumor
cells<00:05:37.590> that<00:05:37.860> can<00:05:38.310> just<00:05:38.580> grow<00:05:38.880> and<00:05:39.210> divide

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
cells that can just grow and divide

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.570 
cells that can just grow and divide
endlessly<00:05:40.260> so<00:05:40.890> when<00:05:41.070> they're<00:05:41.220> combined

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
endlessly so when they're combined

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.270 
endlessly so when they're combined
together<00:05:41.790> we<00:05:42.419> call<00:05:42.630> them<00:05:42.900> hybridoma<00:05:43.890> cells<00:05:44.130> so

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
together we call them hybridoma cells so

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.890 
together we call them hybridoma cells so
the<00:05:44.370> b-cells<00:05:44.760> are<00:05:44.880> fused<00:05:45.210> with<00:05:45.390> tumor<00:05:45.660> cells

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
the b-cells are fused with tumor cells

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.350 
the b-cells are fused with tumor cells
so<00:05:46.050> we've<00:05:46.169> got<00:05:46.380> a<00:05:46.620> cell<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.640> produces<00:05:47.880> the

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
so we've got a cell that produces the

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.540 
so we've got a cell that produces the
correct<00:05:48.570> type<00:05:48.960> of<00:05:49.080> antibody<00:05:49.620> and<00:05:49.890> we've<00:05:50.340> got

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
correct type of antibody and we've got

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.880 
correct type of antibody and we've got
cells<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:51.150> can<00:05:51.330> divide<00:05:51.600> endlessly<00:05:52.320> we

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
cells that can divide endlessly we

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.680 
cells that can divide endlessly we
combine<00:05:53.280> them<00:05:53.460> together<00:05:53.669> to<00:05:54.060> make<00:05:54.090> a<00:05:54.240> super

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
combine them together to make a super

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.659

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
we get we get a never-ending clone

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.980 
we get we get a never-ending clone
never-ending<00:06:01.650> clone<00:06:02.010> of<00:06:02.510> cells<00:06:03.510> that<00:06:03.750> are

sterilize<00:06:23.790> them<00:06:24.030> and<00:06:24.210> then<00:06:24.360> sell<00:06:24.630> them<00:06:24.840> to

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
sterilize them and then sell them to

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.159 
sterilize them and then sell them to
clinics<00:06:25.350> in<00:06:25.590> case<00:06:25.890> a<00:06:26.130> kid<00:06:26.340> comes<00:06:26.550> in<00:06:26.760> with<00:06:27.120> a

you will suspected bite from a rabid

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.350 
you will suspected bite from a rabid
animal<00:06:31.289> and<00:06:31.860> so<00:06:32.340> that<00:06:32.610> then<00:06:32.939> they<00:06:33.090> can<00:06:33.210> be

check<00:06:58.229> that<00:06:58.259> out<00:06:58.469> and<00:06:58.830> don't<00:06:59.759> get<00:06:59.999> rabies

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:00.689 
check that out and don't get rabies

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.320 
check that out and don't get rabies
