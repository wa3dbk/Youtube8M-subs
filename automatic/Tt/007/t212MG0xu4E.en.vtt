00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
just a couple of metal rails and I think

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.360 
just a couple of metal rails and I think
it<00:00:45.030> comes<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.450> screws<00:00:45.840> but<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.680> doesn't<00:00:46.980> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
it comes with screws but if it doesn't I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.130 
it comes with screws but if it doesn't I
have<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> whole<00:00:48.270> bunch<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.629> screws<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.050> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
have a whole bunch of screws that I

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.069 
have a whole bunch of screws that I
could<00:00:49.320> use<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.770> it's<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> big<00:00:50.129> deal<00:00:50.750> but<00:00:51.750> for

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
could use so it's not a big deal but for

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.779 
could use so it's not a big deal but for
little<00:00:52.289> items<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.070> i<00:00:53.309> definitely
