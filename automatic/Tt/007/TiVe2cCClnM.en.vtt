all right so connected but to the

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
all right so connected but to the
sparkplug<00:00:07.529> change<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:09.290> my<00:00:10.290> problem<00:00:10.769> is

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
sparkplug change on this my problem is

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.190 
sparkplug change on this my problem is
that<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:11.130> don't<00:00:11.550> have<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.820> camera<00:00:12.360> stand<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.080> hold

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
that I don't have a camera stand to hold

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.259 
that I don't have a camera stand to hold
this<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:13.650> I'm<00:00:13.769> doing<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.880> I'm<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:15.120> to

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
take off to get to the spark plugs under

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.980 
take off to get to the spark plugs under
here<00:00:20.070> because<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.180> see<00:00:21.420> everything<00:00:21.869> is

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
have to take that off also so those are

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.610 
have to take that off also so those are
the<00:00:58.150> things<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.780> I<00:00:58.810> know<00:00:58.990> that<00:00:59.290> you<00:00:59.350> have<00:00:59.470> to

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
the things that I know that you have to

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.770 
the things that I know that you have to
take<00:00:59.770> off<00:00:59.950> before<00:01:00.670> you<00:01:00.760> can<00:01:00.970> get<00:01:01.240> to<00:01:01.450> where<00:01:01.600> the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
take off before you can get to where the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.200 
take off before you can get to where the
spark<00:01:02.110> plugs<00:01:02.440> is<00:01:02.680> that<00:01:02.920> all<00:01:03.490> right<00:01:03.670> so<00:01:04.150> I'm

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
spark plugs is that all right so I'm

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.550 
spark plugs is that all right so I'm
gonna<00:01:04.360> start<00:01:04.660> taking<00:01:04.960> those<00:01:05.110> screws<00:01:05.380> off

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
gonna start taking those screws off

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.340 
gonna start taking those screws off
right<00:01:05.770> now

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
right now

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.310 
right now
the<00:01:08.350> hoses<00:01:08.860> remove<00:01:09.510> I'm<00:01:10.510> gonna<00:01:10.720> put<00:01:11.020> that<00:01:11.170> to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
the hoses remove I'm gonna put that to

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
the hoses remove I'm gonna put that to
the<00:01:11.350> side

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the side

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:39.390 
the side
now<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.260> next<00:01:14.590> Blood<00:01:14.770> loosen<00:01:15.430> this<00:01:38.400> you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
now to the next Blood loosen this you

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.830 
now to the next Blood loosen this you
have<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.640> be<00:01:39.760> careful<00:01:40.180> with<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.420> other<00:01:40.600> one

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
have to be careful with the other one

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.010 
have to be careful with the other one
because<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.229> can<00:01:41.260> fall<00:01:41.680> in<00:01:41.710> there

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.200 

so<00:01:48.020> as<00:01:48.260> you<00:01:48.440> see<00:01:48.740> su<00:01:48.950> loosely-knit<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.030> it's

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
so as you see su loosely-knit and it's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.600 
so as you see su loosely-knit and it's
coming<00:01:50.600> up<00:01:50.750> keep<00:01:51.530> pushing<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.100> down<00:01:52.310> do<00:01:52.580> not

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
coming up keep pushing it down do not

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:07.780 
coming up keep pushing it down do not
allow<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.240> come<00:01:53.510> on<00:02:05.980> now<00:02:06.980> you<00:02:07.040> can<00:02:07.490> try<00:02:07.730> to

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
allow it to come on now you can try to

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:24.850 
allow it to come on now you can try to
make<00:02:08.030> some<00:02:08.300> space<00:02:08.630> right<00:02:08.660> here<00:02:22.720> I<00:02:23.720> can't<00:02:24.650> I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
make some space right here I can't I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.340 
make some space right here I can't I
can't<00:02:25.160> go<00:02:25.340> through<00:02:25.550> this<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.900> get<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
can't go through this to get to the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.760 
can't go through this to get to the
spark<00:02:27.650> plugs<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:29.180> ended<00:02:29.750> up<00:02:29.870> taking<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.440> screw

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
spark plugs so ended up taking the screw

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.520 
spark plugs so ended up taking the screw
out<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.640> down<00:02:31.880> here

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
out that is down here

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.520 
out that is down here
as<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.650> can<00:02:33.710> see<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.660> as<00:02:35.660> good<00:02:35.960> as<00:02:36.110> holding

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
as you can see that as good as holding

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.400 
as you can see that as good as holding
it<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:36.920> then<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.190> taking<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.700> off<00:02:38.140> let's<00:02:39.140> see

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
it and then I taking that off let's see

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.730 
it and then I taking that off let's see
if<00:02:39.470> we<00:02:39.650> can<00:02:39.830> move<00:02:40.070> this<00:02:41.140> when<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.260> take<00:02:42.500> that

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
if we can move this when you take that

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.110 
if we can move this when you take that
out<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:43.220> suggest<00:02:44.000> getting<00:02:44.930> something<00:02:45.820> so<00:02:46.820> use

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
out I suggest getting something so use

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.570 
out I suggest getting something so use
to<00:02:47.600> cover<00:02:48.080> up<00:02:48.320> that<00:02:48.680> place<00:02:49.040> right<00:02:49.310> there

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
to cover up that place right there

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.410 
to cover up that place right there
the<00:02:50.300> hardest<00:02:50.630> thing<00:02:51.100> so<00:02:52.100> we<00:02:52.640> really<00:02:52.970> we<00:02:53.120> leave

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
the hardest thing so we really we leave

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.670 
the hardest thing so we really we leave
Italy<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.260> comes<00:02:54.530> off<00:02:56.170> well<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.200> see<00:02:57.500> that

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
Italy and it comes off well you see that

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.650 
Italy and it comes off well you see that
side<00:02:57.950> right<00:02:57.980> there<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:59.180> have<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.450> get

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
side right there you have to get

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.010 
side right there you have to get
something<00:02:59.959> I'm<00:03:00.380> block<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:00.980> off<00:03:01.720> I'm<00:03:02.720> going<00:03:02.930> to

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
something I'm block it off I'm going to
