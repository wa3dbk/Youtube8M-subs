00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
is the purpose of this map and basically

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.250 
is the purpose of this map and basically
the<00:00:25.680> purpose<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.279> map<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:27.539> live<00:00:27.900> and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
survive in this giant egg so it's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.830 
survive in this giant egg so it's
definitely<00:00:31.590> kind<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.040> cool<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:33.329> gonna<00:00:33.540> go

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
definitely kind of cool and I'm gonna go

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.209 
definitely kind of cool and I'm gonna go
out<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.440> quickly<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:34.829> as<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.130> can

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
out here really quickly so as you can

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.979 
out here really quickly so as you can
tell<00:00:35.280> there's<00:00:35.700> no<00:00:35.940> ground<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:36.630> anything<00:00:36.960> like

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
tell there's no ground or anything like

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.440 
tell there's no ground or anything like
that<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.040> pretty<00:00:38.489> much<00:00:38.579> spun<00:00:39.090> up<00:00:39.239> there

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that so you pretty much spun up there

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.940 
that so you pretty much spun up there
you<00:00:39.690> might<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.260> park<00:00:40.500> or<00:00:40.739> down<00:00:40.920> or

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
you might have to park or down or

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.639 
you might have to park or down or
something<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:42.170> colorfly<00:00:43.170> inside

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
something like that or colorfly inside

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.229 
something like that or colorfly inside
and<00:00:43.920> set<00:00:44.070> your<00:00:44.219> spawn<00:00:44.520> inside<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.090> or

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and set your spawn inside of here or

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.360 
and set your spawn inside of here or
maybe<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.690> even<00:00:45.809> might<00:00:46.110> spot<00:00:46.559> inside<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.160> here

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
maybe you even might spot inside of here

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.660 
maybe you even might spot inside of here
or<00:00:47.550> um<00:00:49.010> something<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.520> it's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
or um something like that but it's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.549 
or um something like that but it's
definitely<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.030> cool<00:00:51.390> idea<00:00:51.570> for<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.140> map<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
definitely a cool idea for a map as you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
definitely a cool idea for a map as you
can<00:00:52.680> tell<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.010> got<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> different

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
can tell it's got all of the different

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.840 
can tell it's got all of the different
kinds<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> biomes<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.430> giant

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
kinds of biomes and it's just a giant

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.869 
kinds of biomes and it's just a giant
egg<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.809> know<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.140> got<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.949> Arctic<00:00:59.399> biome

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
but definitely a very cool concept and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.580 
but definitely a very cool concept and
it<00:01:26.490> doesn't<00:01:27.000> start<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.380> might<00:01:28.409> be

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
it doesn't start there so you might be

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.730 
it doesn't start there so you might be
like<00:01:28.799> Eskimo<00:01:29.460> where<00:01:29.759> does<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.689> continue<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
like Eskimo where does this continue and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.429 
like Eskimo where does this continue and
um<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.909> check<00:01:33.360> out<00:01:33.509> rare<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:34.110> me<00:01:34.140> doing

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
um if you check out rare for me doing

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.260 
um if you check out rare for me doing
x-ray<00:01:34.890> glitch<00:01:35.100> there's<00:01:35.400> actually<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> end

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
x-ray glitch there's actually a end

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.420 
x-ray glitch there's actually a end
portal<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.930> don't<00:01:37.470> know<00:01:37.619> what<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.070> but

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
portal I don't know what that is but

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.580 
portal I don't know what that is but
there's<00:01:38.640> an<00:01:38.850> portal<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.329> abandoned<00:01:39.990> mine<00:01:40.200> shaft

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
there's an portal a abandoned mine shaft

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
there's an portal a abandoned mine shaft
and<00:01:40.979> there<00:01:41.700> might<00:01:41.880> even<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.150> another<00:01:42.570> portal

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and there might even be another portal

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.260 
and there might even be another portal
in<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:43.470> not<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.890> don't<00:01:44.250> think<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.640> yeah<00:01:45.240> I

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
in there I'm not I don't think so yeah I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.850 
in there I'm not I don't think so yeah I
don't<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.350> always<00:01:46.560> dig

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
don't think so but we can always dig

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.800 
don't think so but we can always dig
down<00:01:47.130> some<00:01:47.460> more<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.820> check<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.720> you

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
down some more and check out so you

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.420 
down some more and check out so you
might<00:01:49.079> not<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.380> able<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.590> go<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.979> nether<00:01:50.130> in

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
might not be able to go to the nether in

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280 
might not be able to go to the nether in
this<00:01:50.610> map<00:01:50.790> which<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.180> entirely<00:01:51.540> okay<00:01:51.960> because

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
this map which is entirely okay because

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.160 
this map which is entirely okay because
it's<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> flat<00:01:53.549> land<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.210> an<00:01:54.600> entirely

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
it's a on a flat land it be an entirely

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.929 
it's a on a flat land it be an entirely
flat<00:01:55.530> nether<00:01:55.920> anyway<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.369> it'd<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.700> pointless

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
flat nether anyway so it'd be pointless

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.649 
flat nether anyway so it'd be pointless
but<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.689> don't<00:01:58.460> you<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.149> end<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
but you don't you can go to the end and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.480 
but you don't you can go to the end and
fight<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.170> inner<00:02:01.380> dragon<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.310> is

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
fight the inner dragon so that is

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.429 
fight the inner dragon so that is
definitely<00:02:02.520> cool<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.450> I'm<00:02:03.780> really<00:02:04.170> excited

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
definitely cool and I'm really excited

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.649 
definitely cool and I'm really excited
for<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.920> map<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.369> can't<00:02:05.670> wait<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.000> see<00:02:06.240> how<00:02:06.450> it

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
for this map I can't wait to see how it

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.869 
for this map I can't wait to see how it
turns<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:07.140> because<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:08.069> definitely<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> cool

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
turns out because it's definitely a cool

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.880 
turns out because it's definitely a cool
concept<00:02:09.179> that's<00:02:09.629> original<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.500> don't<00:02:10.709> see

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
concept that's original and we don't see

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.300 
concept that's original and we don't see
that<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.069> whole<00:02:11.280> lot<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.700> these
