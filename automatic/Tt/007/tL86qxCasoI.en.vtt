00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
while being up close with Jack was

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.179 
while being up close with Jack was
really<00:01:36.600> ideal<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.710> communique

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
really ideal because the communique

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.640 
really ideal because the communique
element<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> thing<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.119> comes<00:01:39.360> out<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
element I thing really comes out of the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.289 
element I thing really comes out of the
situation<00:01:40.890> being<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.759> outweigh<00:01:42.030> just

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
situation being really outweigh just

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.030 
situation being really outweigh just
being<00:01:42.479> totally<00:01:42.840> over<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> top<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.740> think

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
being totally over the top and I think

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.520 
being totally over the top and I think
that<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.329> really<00:01:45.630> important<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> me<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that it was really important to me and I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.560 
that it was really important to me and I
think<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.799> all<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.100> us<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.090> shooting

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
think to all of us that the shooting

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.749 
think to all of us that the shooting
style<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.200> outrageous<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> scenario<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
style be is outrageous as a scenario and

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.700 
style be is outrageous as a scenario and
I<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> kind<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.990> push<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
I think just to kind of push the the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
I think just to kind of push the the
scenario<00:01:53.159> over<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.520> top<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.880> wanted<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.299> put<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
scenario over the top we wanted to put a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.020 
scenario over the top we wanted to put a
camera<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:55.049> lot<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.439> awkward<00:01:55.649> places<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.820> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
camera a lot of awkward places just I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.819 
camera a lot of awkward places just I
guess<00:01:57.329> put<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.049> perspective<00:01:58.710> of

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
guess put you in the perspective of

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.770 
guess put you in the perspective of
Uncle<00:01:59.549> Jack

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
Uncle Jack

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
Uncle Jack
and<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.190> things<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.610> came<00:02:02.790> up

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and so one of the things that we came up

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.940 
and so one of the things that we came up
with<00:02:03.180> was<00:02:03.720> ringing<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> camera<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
with was ringing the camera to the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.389 
with was ringing the camera to the
