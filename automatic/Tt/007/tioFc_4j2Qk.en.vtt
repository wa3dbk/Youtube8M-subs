00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
because i can't do this because the

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.020 
because i can't do this because the
sales<00:05:02.080> aren't<00:05:02.290> going<00:05:02.530> very<00:05:02.560> well<00:05:02.770> not<00:05:03.730> as<00:05:03.880> i

sales aren't going very well not as i
expected<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.220> it<00:05:06.220> costs<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:07.030> bit<00:05:07.150> too<00:05:07.330> much<00:05:07.480> to

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
expected and it costs a bit too much to

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.540 
expected and it costs a bit too much to
tank<00:05:07.930> by<00:05:08.050> myself<00:05:08.470> because<00:05:08.710> before<00:05:09.160> i<00:05:09.220> used<00:05:09.430> to

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
tank by myself because before i used to

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.810

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
magic because it seems to be the most
