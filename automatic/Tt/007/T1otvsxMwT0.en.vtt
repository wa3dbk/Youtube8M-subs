00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the same place right it's the body that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.290 
the same place right it's the body that
goes<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.840> down<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.670> top<00:00:41.969> end

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300

shock on a T type or an mga or MGB MGC
there's<00:00:50.879> twin<00:00:51.420> arms<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> very

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
there's twin arms so this is not a very

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.700 
there's twin arms so this is not a very
durable<00:00:53.670> system<00:00:54.149> remember<00:00:55.020> when<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.320> when

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
durable system remember when that when

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
durable system remember when that when
this<00:00:55.860> vehicle<00:00:56.100> came<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.940> was<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> bug-eyed

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
this vehicle came out it was a bug-eyed

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.510 
this vehicle came out it was a bug-eyed
sprite<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> bug-eyed<00:00:59.309> sprite

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
sprite and when it was a bug-eyed sprite

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.270 
sprite and when it was a bug-eyed sprite
at<00:00:59.850> weight<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.300> don't<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.739> 1200<00:01:01.739> weights<00:01:01.980> or

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
at weight I don't know 1200 weights or

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.450 
at weight I don't know 1200 weights or
so<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.670> wasn't<00:01:03.180> very<00:01:03.390> heavy<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.840> all<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.460> by

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
so it wasn't very heavy at all and by

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.330 
so it wasn't very heavy at all and by
the<00:01:05.519> time<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.390> add<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.260> safety<00:01:07.710> stuff<00:01:08.010> from

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the time we add on the safety stuff from

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
the time we add on the safety stuff from
from<00:01:09.650> 1968<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> reinforced<00:01:12.270> doors<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the collapsible columns and and then we

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.480 
the collapsible columns and and then we
get<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:18.080> 1975<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.530> add<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.189> rubber

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
get to 1975 and we add on the rubber

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.880 
get to 1975 and we add on the rubber
bumpers<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.689> had<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> triumph<00:01:22.500> engine

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
bumpers and we had the triumph engine

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.730 
bumpers and we had the triumph engine
and<00:01:23.070> gearbox<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.570> car<00:01:24.990> weighs<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.710> much

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and gearbox now the car weighs so much

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.190 
and gearbox now the car weighs so much
more<00:01:26.310> than<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.670> ever<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.200> originally

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
more than it ever was originally

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.859 
more than it ever was originally
designed<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.920> handle<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.600> front

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
designed to handle that this front

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.710 
designed to handle that this front
suspension<00:01:31.500> gets<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:32.250> tweaked<00:01:32.909> real<00:01:33.420> fast

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
suspension gets really tweaked real fast

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.120 
suspension gets really tweaked real fast
and<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.770> happens<00:01:35.630> because<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.259> bolt<00:01:37.650> this

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130

end the tie rod end will just fall off
the<00:03:43.010> steering<00:03:43.609> arm<00:03:44.410> so<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:45.620> is<00:03:45.709> a<00:03:45.739> good<00:03:46.160> time

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
the steering arm so this is a good time

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.150 
the steering arm so this is a good time
to<00:03:46.640> take<00:03:47.269> care<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:47.570> that<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.470> springs<00:03:48.890> are

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
to take care of that the springs are

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.580 
to take care of that the springs are
pretty<00:03:49.370> easily<00:03:49.609> changed<00:03:50.540> they<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:51.200> can<00:03:51.380> take

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
pretty easily changed they you can take

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.740 
pretty easily changed they you can take
the<00:03:51.980> spring<00:03:52.489> pan<00:03:52.730> right<00:03:52.970> out<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.359> bottom

the spring pan right out of the bottom
of<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.900> a<00:03:53.930> arm<00:03:54.230> with<00:03:54.739> four<00:03:55.040> bolts<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.700> spring

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
of the a arm with four bolts the spring

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.000 
of the a arm with four bolts the spring
drops<00:03:56.329> out<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:57.440> then<00:03:57.620> put<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:57.980> whole

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
drops out and then put the whole

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.460 
drops out and then put the whole
suspension<00:03:58.549> back<00:03:58.940> together<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.630> right<00:04:00.290> at

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
suspension back together and right at

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.979 
suspension back together and right at
the<00:04:00.650> end<00:04:00.680> go<00:04:01.670> ahead<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.150> install<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.720> spring

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
the end go ahead and install the spring

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.589 
the end go ahead and install the spring
so<00:04:03.769> it

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
so it

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.110 
so it
it<00:04:05.079> works<00:04:05.319> out<00:04:05.530> works<00:04:06.069> off<00:04:06.280> pretty<00:04:06.549> easily<00:04:06.819> I

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
it works out works off pretty easily I

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.429 
it works out works off pretty easily I
don't<00:04:07.360> think<00:04:07.510> there's<00:04:07.689> anything<00:04:07.930> left<00:04:08.319> here

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439 
don't think there's anything left here
