00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.520
 thus the vehicles owned by 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.010
 the soto family and they were 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.870
 literally flooded after the break 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.780
 of an old pipe at the end of 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.510
 curridabat the damages of the body and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.519
 engines are such that repair is 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.150
 I would have to make a millionaire 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:23.339
 investment but not only that all the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.140
 kitchen was destroyed and would be valued 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.239
 by experts from the National Institute of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.210
 safe so we were not allowed 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.570
 record it with jhonny soto assured that 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.070
 They had to sleep on inflatable mattresses 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.680
 also fears that the force of water 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.900
 will damage the structure of your home and under 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.990
 all that was water 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.500
 in the house it looks totally different to 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:51.730
 as it was yesterday but the condition 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:56.830
 one's soul obviously remains not 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:01.170
 well in the house already apparently this 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:05.320
 have another other figure not 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.750
 I feel really worried yesterday 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.119
 I was very worried about the condition 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.119
 in which the property was located but 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.530
 today I feel much more worried about 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.730
 the condition in which the property was left 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.850
 preliminary compensation is 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.560
 set in a million dollars but 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.340
 that figure according to the owners of the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 property could be increased I think 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.070
 what if I really definitely 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.280
 I did not think that the house was going to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.280
 create 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.740
 no deterioration that for me could be 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.270
 up to total 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.159
 yesterday night we decided 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.280
 after they dropped all the water 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.460
 we decided to stay 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.790
 by virtue of which not only I 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.170
 sentimental attachment to the house but that 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.520
 there are many things in the house that one 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.520
 he has to watch over them 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.370
 we did some things like to be able to 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.650
 spend the night 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.260
 the process for them to take responsibility 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.600
 of the damage began this Thursday of 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.030
 moment the family will not abandon its 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.770
 home until they determine the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.770
 true damages that it presents
