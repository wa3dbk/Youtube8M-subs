give<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> little<00:01:07.439> giddy<00:01:08.070> little<00:01:08.340> play<00:01:08.549> test

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
give you a little giddy little play test

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.420 
give you a little giddy little play test
of<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.320> pretty<00:01:10.320> much<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.710> tone<00:01:10.920> settings

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
of that pretty much the tone settings

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.289 
of that pretty much the tone settings
are<00:01:13.130> printing<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> middle<00:01:14.850> treble

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
are printing in the middle treble

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.280 
are printing in the middle treble
basically<00:01:16.290> around<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.590> middle<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.970> middle

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
basically around the middle the middle

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.719 
basically around the middle the middle
kind<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.380> lower<00:01:19.560> maybe<00:01:19.860> scoop<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.520> little

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
kind of lower maybe scoop just a little

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.300 
kind of lower maybe scoop just a little
bit<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.110> base<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> little<00:01:23.189> bit

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
bit and the the base just a little bit

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.790 
bit and the the base just a little bit
higher

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.830 

you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:47.760 

I

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.430 

ah

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.640 

clean<00:01:57.440> channel<00:01:58.330> will<00:01:59.330> go<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.690> little<00:02:00.380> bit<00:02:00.530> of

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
clean channel will go to a little bit of

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.220 
clean channel will go to a little bit of
grit<00:02:00.830> go<00:02:01.370> to<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.550> dirty<00:02:01.760> channel<00:02:02.210> pull<00:02:03.080> out

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
grit go to the dirty channel pull out

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.170 
grit go to the dirty channel pull out
the<00:02:03.470> love<00:02:04.130> here<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:06.080> this<00:02:06.230> is<00:02:06.290> I<00:02:07.160> think<00:02:07.910> this

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
the love here and this is I think this

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.490 
the love here and this is I think this
is<00:02:08.240> kind<00:02:08.510> of<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.780> Marshall<00:02:09.880> get<00:02:10.880> gain

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
is kind of like the Marshall get gain

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:47.080 
is kind of like the Marshall get gain
but<00:02:12.500> will<00:02:13.340> give<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.790> wrong

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:58.640 

Oh

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:10.660 

now<00:02:59.650> we're<00:02:59.830> going<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.010> go<00:03:00.130> high<00:03:00.430> gain<00:03:00.730> here

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.110 

Oh
