00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.120 

all<00:00:03.570> right<00:00:03.689> so<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.319> gravity<00:00:04.680> blast<00:00:04.920> takes

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
all right so the the gravity blast takes

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.039 
all right so the the gravity blast takes
a<00:00:05.250> great<00:00:05.460> deal<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.700> technique<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.569> we're

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
a great deal of technique and we're

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.330 
a great deal of technique and we're
going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.200> talk<00:00:07.379> about<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.710> snare<00:00:07.950> technique

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
going to talk about the snare technique

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.650 
going to talk about the snare technique
for<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.670> gravity<00:00:08.970> blast<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.420> everything

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
for the gravity blast and everything

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.270 
for the gravity blast and everything
else<00:00:09.809> kind<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.139> just<00:00:10.290> falls<00:00:10.469> into<00:00:10.650> place<00:00:10.740> on

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
else kind of just falls into place on

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.589 
else kind of just falls into place on
the<00:00:11.580> drumset<00:00:11.820> that's<00:00:12.150> why<00:00:12.240> I've<00:00:12.330> got<00:00:12.360> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the drumset that's why I've got the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.600 
the drumset that's why I've got the
Ciara<00:00:13.019> away<00:00:13.320> from<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.950> drum<00:00:14.130> set<00:00:14.309> right<00:00:14.429> now

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
Ciara away from the drum set right now

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.700 
Ciara away from the drum set right now
is<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:14.969> show<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.389> technique<00:00:15.809> on

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
is just to show you this technique on

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.130 
is just to show you this technique on
how<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.850> play<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.240> gravity<00:00:18.539> blast<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
how to to play the gravity blast is the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.560 
how to to play the gravity blast is the
ultimate<00:00:19.800> element<00:00:20.189> if<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.240> don't<00:00:21.390> know<00:00:21.449> what

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
ultimate element if you don't know what

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.540 
ultimate element if you don't know what
a<00:00:21.600> gravity<00:00:21.930> blast<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.650> probably<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
a gravity blast is it's probably the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.429 
a gravity blast is it's probably the
fastest<00:00:23.939> thing<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.269> drumming<00:00:24.570> ever

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
fastest thing and drumming ever

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.370 
fastest thing and drumming ever
it's<00:00:26.160> everything<00:00:26.670> going<00:00:27.119> at<00:00:27.240> 100%<00:00:27.660> including

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
it's everything going at 100% including

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.310 
it's everything going at 100% including
your<00:00:28.500> snare<00:00:28.740> using<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:29.609> hand<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.869> technique

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
your snare using one hand the technique

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.200 
your snare using one hand the technique
involves<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.890> fulcrum<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.880> what<00:00:33.000> you're<00:00:33.090> going

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
involves a fulcrum and what you're going

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.979 
involves a fulcrum and what you're going
to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.420> you're<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> find<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
to do is you're going to find the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.389 
to do is you're going to find the
fulcrum<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.590> do<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:34.860> any<00:00:35.010> time<00:00:35.250> that

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
fulcrum like you do with any time that

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.709 
fulcrum like you do with any time that
you're<00:00:35.489> picking<00:00:35.760> up<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> drumstick<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.570> get

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
you're picking up the drumstick and get

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.090 
you're picking up the drumstick and get
ready<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> play<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.559> find<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.829> good<00:00:37.980> balance

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
ready to play you find a good balance

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
ready to play you find a good balance
point<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> then<00:00:39.329> you're<00:00:39.450> gonna<00:00:39.540> rest<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
point and then you're gonna rest the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.139 
point and then you're gonna rest the
stick<00:00:40.230> on<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.370> rim<00:00:41.579> right<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:44.059> keeping<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
stick on the rim right here keeping it

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.900 
stick on the rim right here keeping it
about<00:00:45.360> I'd<00:00:45.750> say<00:00:45.780> an<00:00:46.289> inch<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> half<00:00:47.700> an<00:00:47.820> inch

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
about I'd say an inch to a half an inch

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.250 
about I'd say an inch to a half an inch
away<00:00:48.120> from<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:48.420> thumb<00:00:48.719> that's<00:00:48.960> where<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
away from your thumb that's where the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
away from your thumb that's where the
impact<00:00:49.590> point<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.180> stick<00:00:51.420> now<00:00:51.750> all

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
impact point is on your stick now all

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
impact point is on your stick now all
you're<00:00:52.020> gonna<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.890> motion<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.879> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
you're gonna do for the motion is a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.930 
you're gonna do for the motion is a
crank<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.500> again<00:00:55.710> over<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.789> over

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
crank down and up again over and over

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.430 
crank down and up again over and over
again<00:00:57.030> down<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> up

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
again down and up

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
again down and up
you're<00:00:59.100> gonna<00:00:59.190> bring<00:00:59.460> you're<00:00:59.760> gonna<00:00:59.850> leave

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
you're gonna bring you're gonna leave

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.119 
you're gonna bring you're gonna leave
the<00:01:00.239> stick<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> pretty<00:01:00.780> parallel<00:01:01.170> position

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the stick of a pretty parallel position

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.189 
the stick of a pretty parallel position
parallel<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> ground<00:01:03.420> or<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.809> your<00:01:03.960> snare

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
parallel to the ground or to your snare

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.850 
parallel to the ground or to your snare
and<00:01:04.610> drop<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.810> strikes<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> snare

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and drop it so that it strikes the snare

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.370 
and drop it so that it strikes the snare
but<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.520> fingers<00:01:08.880> push<00:01:09.150> past<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.990> fulcrum

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
but your fingers push past the fulcrum

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
but your fingers push past the fulcrum
lifting<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> stick<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.939> air<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.570> know

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
lifting the stick up in the air you know

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.260 
lifting the stick up in the air you know
you<00:01:12.720> see<00:01:12.990> how<00:01:13.140> I've<00:01:13.500> pushed<00:01:13.860> down<00:01:14.310> after<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you see how I've pushed down after the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
you see how I've pushed down after the
impact<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.979> stick<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.310> in

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
impact there you are the stick is up in

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
impact there you are the stick is up in
the<00:01:17.580> air<00:01:17.700> ready<00:01:18.270> for<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> second<00:01:18.840> strike<00:01:19.080> when

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the air ready for a second strike when

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.950 
the air ready for a second strike when
you<00:01:19.350> pull<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:20.180> your<00:01:21.180> stick<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> gonna<00:01:21.570> drop

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
you pull up your stick is gonna drop

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.920 
you pull up your stick is gonna drop
back<00:01:22.200> down<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.670> snare<00:01:23.850> again<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
back down on the snare again like that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.679 
back down on the snare again like that
that<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> motion<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.240> gravity

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that is the motion of the gravity

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.819 
that is the motion of the gravity
technique<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> snare<00:01:33.530> that's<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.680> there

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
technique on the snare that's all there

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:35.539 
technique on the snare that's all there
is<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> really

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
is to it really

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.490 
is to it really
now<00:01:36.060> when<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.360> speed<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> try<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
now when you speed it up and to try and

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.990 
now when you speed it up and to try and
keep<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> time<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> tricky<00:01:38.729> part

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
keep it in time that's the tricky part

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.330 
keep it in time that's the tricky part
you're<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.570> gonna<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> maintain

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
you're just gonna have to maintain

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.980 
you're just gonna have to maintain
thinking<00:01:41.340> about<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.790> cranking<00:01:42.360> motion<00:01:42.720> with

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
thinking about that cranking motion with

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.499 
thinking about that cranking motion with
your<00:01:43.140> hand<00:01:43.399> cranking<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.729> down<00:01:44.850> past<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
your hand cranking up and down past the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.569 
your hand cranking up and down past the
fulcrum<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.259> take<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.649> hand<00:01:46.829> down<00:01:47.009> past<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
fulcrum you take your hand down past the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.090 
fulcrum you take your hand down past the
fulcrum<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> snare<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.649> keep<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
fulcrum of the snare and keep that at a

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
fulcrum of the snare and keep that at a
consistent<00:01:50.490> speed<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.210> remember<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.840> also

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
consistent speed and remember you also

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.679 
consistent speed and remember you also
gotta<00:01:52.290> count<00:01:52.560> notes<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.280> beats<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.329> you've

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
gotta count notes and beats so you've

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.999 
gotta count notes and beats so you've
got<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.930> keep<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.320> with<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.619> measure<00:01:55.799> and

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
got to keep this in with and measure and

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.859 
got to keep this in with and measure and
with<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.250> time<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.790> I'm<00:01:57.360> gonna<00:01:57.479> show<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.719> how

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
with in time so I'm gonna show you how

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.850 
with in time so I'm gonna show you how
to<00:01:57.930> do<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.110> slow<00:01:58.320> again

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.950 

now<00:02:03.860> for<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.550> gravity<00:02:04.940> blast<00:02:05.210> speed<00:02:05.480> you<00:02:05.840> know

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
now for the gravity blast speed you know

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.360 
now for the gravity blast speed you know
you're<00:02:06.290> just<00:02:06.410> doing<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.710> same<00:02:06.740> cranking

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
you're just doing the same cranking

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:15.160 
you're just doing the same cranking
motion<00:02:07.610> only<00:02:07.730> quicker<00:02:12.880> okay<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.180> anyways<00:02:14.630> I'm
