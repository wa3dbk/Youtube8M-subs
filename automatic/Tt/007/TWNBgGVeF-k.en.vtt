00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.529
 dot com 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.689
 this time I 'm going to show a product that 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.880
 it was an acquisition one of those early mornings 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.020
 of internet promotions 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.230

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:34.040
 price of it interesting the chile to 400 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.400
 on the internet it cost him 599 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.160
 was found this past week in 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.890
 case in the last week that the submarine 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.070

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.829
 three hundred eighty-one real each one 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.039
 tablet or smartphone and a quad tablet 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.289
 core processor with a cool processor 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.940
 good amount of 16gb storage 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.860
 so let's take a look at 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.780
 on the product 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:06.940
 This is lenovo s 5 thousand. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:13.040
 very good 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:15.650
 nor to fit well adjusted than some 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.470
 items it comes with USB cable but I'm already 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.500
 using the USB cable charger for the 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.500
 drums 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.970
 documentation papers and reports of the 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.490
 user 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.829
 the quick guide but the USB cable that I 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.880
 I am using to recharge the 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.770
 tablet 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.530
 I went to do the transport of photos. 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.850
 videos anyway that thing that we 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.540
 we use for storage of the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.979
 device or device data 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.340
 show some product details 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.810
 front speaker 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.079
 something that is very welcome when you 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:08.119
 want to watch intel video content 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.060
 of the product a smooth side we do not have 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:19.129
 Nothing here at the bottom of the connector 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:20.030
 micro usb with a metallic finish on the 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.330
 other side 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.430
 the volume control buttons it 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.970
 off inverted 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.530
 At night we have the volume control 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.910
 below the on-off button turns the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:42.200
 top the headphone jack 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.920
 and on the back camera also counts 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.170
 with a front camera of 1 to 6 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.270
 I'll show you some megapixels here 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.950
 the product interface that is a model 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:03:00.890
 which has the operating system 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:02.480
 android 4.442 kitkat here show in 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.950
 horizontal orientation that is more 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.260
 easy for you 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.480
 the coolest of this lenovo interface 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.730
 I confess I'm using the interface 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.170
 of the new android in the day to day that wants me 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.709
 in the preferred android interface you 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.690
 you can find her there at na place thor 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.930
 easily but cooler this 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.870
 lenovo's proprietary interface is that it is 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.549
 an interface that for example the person 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.730
 will install the applications with the tablet 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.160
 and on most android devices 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.900
 You have to click the button all 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.320
 applications to find everything 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.670
 in which it does not like the interface 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.010
 of s 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.820
 it puts all the applications you 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.000
 has 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.489
 already on the same screen you do not need to change 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.680
 screen to be able to access 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.680
 apps you want for everything here 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.390
 all in a practical way without major 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.090
 complications 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.130
 then for those who are less experienced to 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.060
 who will eventually make the migration 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.440
 system to s &amp; p the android thing that 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.100
 can happen right? 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.459
 You have everything in the same place so do not 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:14.750
 there are problems for you to access 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:18.200
 content that you already have installed on 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.700
 notification system of the flap 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.979
 system items 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.590
 in this case the basic settings are 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:28.460
 you have access to the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:33.640
 configurations, we can confirm the 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.640
 version 4.4.2 android kitkat 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.450
 touching the screen of that device has 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.110
 hd resolution 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.910
 Another important point I think is worth 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.590
 worth being pointed out for who wants to see 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.070
 video content 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.770
 in this product I think it's worth it 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:58.650
 you suddenly think of this 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:03.140
 acquisition that not on the left side you 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.140
 have social networking notifications 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:18.540
 notifications of time applications like 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.550
 we always have a basic camera but 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.190
 with cool features like for example 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.480
 you want to take continuous photos of the 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.230
 device you do not need to do 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.760
 settings 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:33.270
 it's just you and leave your finger on 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.390
 the shutter button it will 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.390
 Photos 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.820
 The problem is that it does not always take away 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.920
 Nice pics, how can you see the 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.310
 result is not so cool so is all 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:52.470
 in green soon I recommend the simple 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:54.930
 I shot a front camera a camera 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:58.950
 frontal nice for you to make video 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.720
 calls to and from 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.790
 and mainly via skype 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.180
 I tested google bengals did not stay so 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:13.350
 cool, but on skype it stays 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:15.480
 minimally acceptable is a tablet with 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.850
 I found some nice performance 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.290
 problems with this product, such as 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.680
 The YouTube 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.180
 the youtube app for some reason 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.840
 he gives some embargoes for example 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.050
 I ask to open an external link him 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:39.210
 does not run but if you open it directly from the 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:41.250
 application it will run normal but it is a 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.070
 very cool product who I think 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.630
 it is well above average for 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.490
 users 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.700
 the most demanding I think they will 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.030
 want a product with more hardware 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.640
 powerful 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:57.720
 anyway this tablet is 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:00.270
 with me in tests I could already identify a 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.470
 Drums pretty good, he can stay. 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.500
 at least two days 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.720
 active without major problems and the review 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.970
 complete this and other 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.020
 technology you are targeting. 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.520
 net point 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.740
 I recommend that you sign the end of 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.080
 target of the club that is in 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:22.080
