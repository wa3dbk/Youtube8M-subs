00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.819
 mads mikkelsen in the main role in the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.379
 to experience German cinemas and thus 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.660
 we would be in view of the German 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.660
 trailer to the nation 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.170

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.170
 even so that's what you are too 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.110
 Believe me, no one was here 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.920
 in two hours I want to know who that 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.050
 has done 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.860
 how should that work or I'll take two 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.860

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.650

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.270
 I am here for you now we need people 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.910
 as they approach us against these killers 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.650
 Insane soldiers defend where they are 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.300
 come in here give me a revolver 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.490
 holster and ammo for my 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.950
 Winchester fought in the war 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.340
 I have who was the enemy 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.780
 Prussia 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.780
 my respect hand 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.250
 We always hoped and prayed that 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.910
 someone like her comes and us out of this 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.910
 miserably freed 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.670
 I have you underestimated who should 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.670
 that will not happen again 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.209
 for that the film has a good ten million 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.340
 euro budget is the optic 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.780
 relatively impressive good landscapes 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.400
 and above all, people gather to march in 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.840
 is and evergreen above all two 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.970
 main actor in front of the camera not 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.890
 be very cheap in disneyland 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.660
 the concorde movie rental company 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.940
 expected from the norton october 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.350
 2014 will be in German cinemas 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.780
 the history of john he says are 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.310
 emigrants from Denmark who once lived in 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.380
 war served and is overjoyed as 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.330
 to involve his wife and child 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.430
 but be brought to him as these 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.170
 That's what it's going to be for a number of bandits 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.000
 john revenge brings not only the bandits 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.110
 at 9 on the leader of this group 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.090
 he wants to hunt 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.130
 but this one is fire dangerous and then 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.989
 on service and easy in one 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.640
 quotes standard western out 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.680
 and his main character gives the revenge 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.420
 a loner wants to practice one of the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.100
 has nothing to lose and that is 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.450
 also exactly where west begins 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.830
 just lose because we have 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.120
 we still punish others holmes again 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.530
 This year, too, a little bit 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.900
 but this summer is especially the 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.519
 Bygone times we had with medal 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.989
 race to the west or django unchained 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.299
 he's so western a bit too 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.680
 So atypical were all here 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.209
 a bit more classic also packed with 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.859
 the classic landscapes and western 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.660
 cities and optics and especially as a mick 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.220
 is a mainstay and type of can 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.540
 just good grim and I think easy 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.130
 that evergreen is pretty cool in now 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.840
 the trailer come off I have to say 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.549
 for genre fans the thing could be something 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.290
 but of course rather niche project or 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.880
 niche product nothing for the broad 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.070
 The masses just went mad 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.570
 mainstream will be happy the station 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.430
 from the ninth october to experience and 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.840
 That's why I honestly say for fans 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.370
 the right one otherwise tends 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.440
 probably the fingers of it 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.730
 We will know more from the 9th of october 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.519
 and with it my trainer 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.230
 to let go of jack a thumb there 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.910
 if this video was made let it 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.620
 stay if not know otherwise 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.120
 her still a few left and me around and 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.430
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course, at the latest 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.430
 a new video about it then I hope 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.789
 here are of course again 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.789
 on the 3rd
