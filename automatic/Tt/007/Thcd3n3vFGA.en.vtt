 I think what's new and yes we go 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.960
 something comes around we have the 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.810
 display two touch buttons and here in 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.970

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.500
 normal button is the front camera here 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.920
 on the left side the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.860
 volume buttons micro usb port here the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.630
 difference to the hl 2.0 on the right 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.110
 side we have the power button above 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.420
 then the head of jack and show you 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.640
 times the features for completely new samsung 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.050
 call it the idea would come you see we 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.450
 have opened the camera app here and 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.240
 in special mode we can here and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.980
 see in the front camera and the people 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.390
 for example, here also the rear camera 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.600
 So that 's a nice feature we 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.670
 then, for example, the woman can do that 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.260
 take a child and then us too 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.709
 to bring in the picture I find a nice 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.690
 function also new here the floating 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.670
 to the view if we for example 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.260
 Here we go to the calendar 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.940
 here the calendar entry on 14 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.910
 just the thumb over it old samsung 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.100

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.870
 the whole thing when we are here ours 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.940
 we want to see pictures here 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.160
 in the folder are ten pictures 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.830
 here a preview without that 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.070
 to even touch the display 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.150
 is 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.519
 I hope you see that 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.900
 that was previously only possible with the sp 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.840
 that is also with the finger 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.269
 So it's really cool 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.780
 feature lockscreen of not quite nice 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.269
 Here, too, this function becomes real 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.799
 Used as they train us 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:21.450
 how the brighter this really looks 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:21.450
 Cool and was and is attractive 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:32.050

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.050
