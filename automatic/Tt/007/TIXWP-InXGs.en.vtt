00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.369 
we've basically not done a whole lot to
it<00:00:37.969> as<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.210> mentioned<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.899> last<00:00:40.079> video

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
it as I mentioned in the last video

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.250 
it as I mentioned in the last video
about<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.309> my<00:00:41.579> friend<00:00:41.940> he<00:00:42.780> never<00:00:43.020> came

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
about the my friend he never came

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.170 
about the my friend he never came
through<00:00:43.320> with<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> bond<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
through with the bond the the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.729 
through with the bond the the
power-steering<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.989> never<00:00:46.260> heard<00:00:46.500> anything

else<00:00:47.010> from<00:00:47.250> him<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.760> assume<00:00:48.149> he<00:00:48.300> didn't<00:00:48.510> want

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
it as I never heard from him again so I

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.530 
we'll take all the wiring guts out of it
and<00:03:49.620> we'll<00:03:50.620> move<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:50.919> over<00:03:51.129> to<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.400> cab<00:03:51.729> as

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
and we'll move it over to this cab as

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.960 
and we'll move it over to this cab as
you<00:03:52.810> as<00:03:53.049> I've<00:03:53.319> said<00:03:53.620> in<00:03:53.739> earlier<00:03:54.040> videos<00:03:54.430> the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
you as I've said in earlier videos the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.050 
you as I've said in earlier videos the
69<00:03:55.569> cab<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.109> it's<00:03:56.319> a<00:03:56.409> ranger<00:03:56.889> so<00:03:57.310> it's<00:03:57.639> got<00:03:57.849> air

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
69 cab is it's a ranger so it's got air

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.460 
69 cab is it's a ranger so it's got air
conditioning<00:03:58.239> which<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:58.989> know<00:03:59.049> not<00:03:59.409> all

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
conditioning which I know not all

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.179 
conditioning which I know not all
Rangers<00:04:00.009> have<00:04:00.189> air-conditioned<00:04:00.849> but<00:04:01.030> anyway

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
Rangers have air-conditioned but anyway

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.610 
Rangers have air-conditioned but anyway
it's<00:04:03.189> got<00:04:03.400> air<00:04:03.579> AC<00:04:03.819> on<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.449> so<00:04:05.109> we're<00:04:05.319> going<00:04:05.530> to

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
it's got air AC on it so we're going to

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.649 
it's got air AC on it so we're going to
have<00:04:05.769> some<00:04:05.979> custom<00:04:06.400> hoses<00:04:06.790> made<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.359> it'll

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
have some custom hoses made so it'll

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.089 
have some custom hoses made so it'll
once<00:04:08.019> we<00:04:08.169> get<00:04:08.290> it<00:04:08.439> moved<00:04:08.620> over<00:04:08.859> to<00:04:08.979> the<00:04:09.069> other

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
once we get it moved over to the other

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.089 
once we get it moved over to the other
chassis<00:04:09.609> with<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.030> Crown<00:04:10.239> Vic<00:04:10.479> setup<00:04:10.919> we<00:04:11.919> can

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
chassis with the Crown Vic setup we can

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.339 
chassis with the Crown Vic setup we can
hook<00:04:12.280> these<00:04:12.790> hoses<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:13.509> air<00:04:13.840> conditioned

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
hook these hoses this air conditioned

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.849 
hook these hoses this air conditioned
system<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:14.889> is<00:04:15.009> in<00:04:15.159> this<00:04:15.310> truck<00:04:15.639> up<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:17.769> the

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
system that is in this truck up to the

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.360 
system that is in this truck up to the
crown<00:04:18.070> bit<00:04:18.250> compressor<00:04:18.789> and<00:04:19.000> thus<00:04:19.269> having<00:04:19.570> AC

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
crown bit compressor and thus having AC

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.029 
crown bit compressor and thus having AC
now<00:04:21.510> once<00:04:22.510> we<00:04:22.690> do<00:04:22.840> all<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.229> transplanting<00:04:23.950> of

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
now once we do all the transplanting of

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.120 
now once we do all the transplanting of
all<00:04:24.159> that

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
all that

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.770 
all that
in<00:04:25.460> here<00:04:25.760> and<00:04:25.850> get<00:04:25.940> this<00:04:26.060> moved<00:04:26.330> over<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.690> the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
in here and get this moved over to the

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.940 
in here and get this moved over to the
other<00:04:26.900> chassis<00:04:28.750> that's<00:04:29.750> the<00:04:30.140> steering<00:04:30.740> column

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
other chassis that's the steering column

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.520 
other chassis that's the steering column
that<00:04:31.280> was<00:04:31.580> in<00:04:31.940> my<00:04:32.060> 6070<00:04:32.930> all<00:04:33.020> three<00:04:33.290> on<00:04:33.410> the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
that was in my 6070 all three on the

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.760 
that was in my 6070 all three on the
tree<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:34.580> we're<00:04:34.760> gonna<00:04:34.880> set<00:04:35.210> that<00:04:35.350> 67<00:04:36.350> cabin

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
tree so we're gonna set that 67 cabin

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.640 
tree so we're gonna set that 67 cabin
bed<00:04:36.950> it's<00:04:37.190> currently<00:04:37.580> on<00:04:37.960> my<00:04:38.960> truck<00:04:39.260> now<00:04:39.440> and

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
bed it's currently on my truck now and

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.790 
bed it's currently on my truck now and
set<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:39.890> on<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.220> chassis<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.870> I'm<00:04:42.290> just<00:04:42.500> I

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
set it on this chassis and I'm just I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.530 
set it on this chassis and I'm just I
don't<00:04:42.830> know<00:04:43.160> we're<00:04:43.550> gonna<00:04:43.700> let<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:44.060> kids<00:04:44.270> put

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
don't know we're gonna let the kids put

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.040 
don't know we're gonna let the kids put
it<00:04:44.630> all<00:04:44.780> back<00:04:44.990> together<00:04:45.230> and<00:04:46.570> possibly<00:04:47.570> put<00:04:48.020> a

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
it all back together and possibly put a

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.730 
it all back together and possibly put a
302<00:04:48.620> in<00:04:49.070> it<00:04:49.190> or<00:04:50.060> something<00:04:50.990> like<00:04:51.020> that<00:04:51.200> with

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
302 in it or something like that with

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.170 
302 in it or something like that with
the<00:04:51.950> combine<00:04:52.460> it<00:04:52.610> with<00:04:52.640> a<00:04:52.760> three<00:04:53.000> on<00:04:53.090> the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.410 
column and just have a just a nice
little<00:04:54.920> fun<00:04:55.250> I<00:04:55.460> guess<00:04:55.640> off-roading<00:04:56.150> type

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
little fun I guess off-roading type

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
I don't know off-roading something like

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.370 
I don't know off-roading something like
that<00:05:06.700> with<00:05:07.700> the<00:05:07.820> old<00:05:08.000> or<00:05:08.330> rusted<00:05:08.750> out<00:05:08.900> cabin
