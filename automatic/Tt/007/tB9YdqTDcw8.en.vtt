00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.930
 ultra buy 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.690
 vip market and i'm dying 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.900
 We present you another mega review 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.619
 home appliances and today we have a blender 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.570
 philips 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.590
 memorize model richard 2095 dash 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.410
 90 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.539
 so let's think about why 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.430
 In general, in principle, there are blenders 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.260
 surely many have the same 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.520
 question what is my normal 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:39.840
 men blender to whisk 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.390
 to mix ice 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.300
 it's usually enough okay let's 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.059
 let's see all the same our blender which 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.680
 now standing in front of me i can 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.170
 to be honest i was preparing for this 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.809
 I read the review a lot of reviews in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.940
 the internet and tell you the truth not all 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.190
 I write some good reviews 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.030
 threw in there brick tried it 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 grind up 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.850
 did not work blender burned friends here 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.359
 that's why it probably will 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.279
 only review where i will say 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:13.170
 the instruction is not for wimps and u need 

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:14.939
 read and we read on everyone 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.859
 case of her along with you let's 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.529
 first , after all, about the blender and so on 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:24.779
 there is a main bowl we have nonsense 

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:26.039
 we need it but still we have 

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:28.469
 main mechanism 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.560
 notice the beauty of the charm 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.450
 this blender is that it is stationary 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.810
 and here is the so-called 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.520
 stickies that is, you put it on 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.409
 sucked everything nowhere move here and 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:50.000
 I will break the table rather than move it 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:54.170
 blender oh everything will be fine 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.180
 So there is a power cord 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.910
 so where can blender be without it 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.530
 work autonomously and and there are several 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.840
 modes for which I will now 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.470
 address the maximum of your attention but 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.950
 let's start all the same bowl first 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.320
 the lid opens 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:19.010
 tight tight maybe no 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:22.010
 it's a nerve cup she's a cap very 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.470
 tight fit well you know in this 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.610
 only plus because if you quit 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.950
 there is a lot of fluid believe if it starts 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.860
 that liquid will be in your kitchen 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.410
 they were in a blender, and so there is such a 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.330
 special bowl system by the way 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.640
 please draw your attention 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.650
 there is a special markup how much 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.950
 you can put and but the most important point 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:49.040
 this volume is the maximum amount loaded 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.790
 products and a half liters the same bowl on 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.200
 first look 2 liters and in principle this 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.140
 will be enough for you 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.959
 coped with the tasks 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.820
 there are knives inside the bowl 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:10.459
 we will check how not sharp yes 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:15.190
 No, I didn't cut myself, but I was afraid 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:18.170
 cut just live it well well 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.840
 principle highlights we discussed 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.310
 she by the way is a spoon for mixing 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.380
 and so friends let's talk about 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.799
 instructions because very often in 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.930
 modern world everyone ignores the fact in 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.180
 principle, the presence of instructions to some 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.640
 device so here so that you have not 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.000
 there were problems with your blender for example 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.890
 if we crumble something well then 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.299
 there is the same 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.920
 potato meat anything else so here about hiv 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.200
 remember very carefully 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.420
 need to cut products into pieces 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.540
 size of approximately two by two on 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.580
 two centimeters no more because 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.620
 of course if we 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.740
 with our good Belarusian soul 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.380
 hospitable 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.960
 take this potato blender about nothing 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.970
 she won't do it and I'm afraid that you 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.100
 therefore it is necessary only to spoil all 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.020
 cut a little squares well 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.109
 and then everything will work out for you 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.709
 and pay attention to the instructions 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.140
 there is a maximum number of products 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.510
 which you can throw in the bender 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.970
 so here it is listed only in reference 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.800
 purposes therefore when processing large 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.820
 quantities of products before 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.940
 upload 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.210
 next blender make sure 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.030
 that the previous batch has already been mixed 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.700
 you need to immediately fall asleep a bucket of potatoes 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.010
 this explains the accessible language of all 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.060
 our viewers just in case want 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.060
 to tell that 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.880
 the instruction is very small there are only 8 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.860
 fad so i think you will not 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.330
 difficult to read before you start 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.000
 use a blender but some 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.040
 milestones moments we will 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.290
 Now let's discuss so let's say if you 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.200
 need to handle some small 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.780
 a product like garlic you throw 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.390
 garlic here in a bowl put it on 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.400
 main devices and in order to 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.360
 process the garlic you will need 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.230
 n button that is, you just clicked it 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.360
 used garlic processed or what 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.860
 some small product after which 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:30.300
 let go all to cook 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.300
 for example fruit cocktail 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:40.600
 you need to turn this lever on 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:43.900
 smoothies smoothies for those who don't know how to 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:47.020
 once again a cool fruit cocktail 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.990
 and you can add there dodika to 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.840
 he was already such a cold project if 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.850
 you drink it in one gulp then for a second your 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.800
 the brain will freeze so don't 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.740
 experiment well of course if you donâ€™t 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.380
 a cheater after you're in 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.080
 or everything you need to 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.860
 get a more homogeneous mixture in order 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.180
 so as not to fall there pieces of the days not 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.190
 mixed potatoes you're a pig 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.630
 potatoes until potatoes are not pieces 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.449
 mixed cabbage 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.550
 we take this spatula and neatly 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.569
 so here we stir to 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:25.470
 all make a fairly homogeneous mixture 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:28.830
 by the way there is still this blender so 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.840
 let's say idle mode and 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.389
 shutdown because if all of a sudden 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.970
 for some reason you forgot about what 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:39.240
 set to go astray the same 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.909
 smoothie and either set ice to prick then 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.979
 after you chopped enough 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.240
 amount of ice 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:48.240
 just a minute later a blender 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.569
 will turn off by itself so if you need this 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:55.139
 not enough he stopped 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:57.000
 mixed and then looked to have thrown 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.430
 some more pieces of ice 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.190

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.409
