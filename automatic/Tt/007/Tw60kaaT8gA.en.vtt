00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello i'm at marieville stylist 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.889
 private we are here I won two cities 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.049
 and here we are going to talk about how to choose 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.969
 jacket so that it falls perfectly 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.210
 so here we have a silhouette and its 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.090
 classics with a pretty julie in a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.869
 together we mean black tailor the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.640
 just a little flaw in my opinion the jacket 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.340
 is a bit long and does not score enough 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.700
 the silhouette see it falls a little 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.230
 little down we do not see the size so 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.809
 it lacks a bit of precision at the level 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.649
 of the look like this silhouette is not 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.899
 the most perfect 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.760
 we will try something else at once 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.489
 the jacket has changed 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.129
 we have a shorter drop the good 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.070
 length will always be pretty much at that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.680
 level there at the tip of the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.120
 hip before the start of the day and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.039
 we have something a little more marked 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.550
 it gives immediately more dynamic 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.439
 and the silhouette and one accentuates a little 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 more about the size of the sure the beginning 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.640
 of the short leg to give a little 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.110
 more than two lengths on the leg and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 better mark the silhouette 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.939
 the problem he stayed too long 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.970
 it's going to have a tendency to pack 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.200
 the silhouette and to lose the 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.030
 size dimension what is when 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.320
 even important in femininity it's a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.360
 minimum to mark its size 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.070
 it does not matter if you are a round menu 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.509
 the important thing is still to score 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.119
 structure your silhouette 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.470
 now you know how to choose 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.420
 your jacket 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.939
 not worth it from there I troll always have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.159
 kept from the structure a jacket this is a 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.900
 garment that needs to be structured especially 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.939
 when it's a jacket how do you 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.130
 besides, here is the good length 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.090
