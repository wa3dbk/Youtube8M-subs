difference<00:01:22.950> between<00:01:23.310> those<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> stage<00:01:24.060> 2

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
difference between those is the stage 2

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.080 
difference between those is the stage 2
option<00:01:24.780> offers<00:01:25.380> 20<00:01:25.770> percent<00:01:26.130> more<00:01:26.340> filtration

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
option offers 20 percent more filtration

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.760 
option offers 20 percent more filtration
surface<00:01:27.509> than<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> stage<00:01:27.960> 1<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:28.500> going

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
surface than the stage 1 so that's going

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.960 
surface than the stage 1 so that's going
to<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.100> should<00:01:29.250> answer<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.579> question<00:01:29.850> for

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
to that should answer that question for

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.950 
to that should answer that question for
those<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> who<00:01:30.390> are<00:01:30.479> shopping<00:01:30.689> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
wondering exactly what the differences

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880 
wondering exactly what the differences
you<00:01:32.820> might<00:01:33.270> also<00:01:33.540> notice<00:01:33.900> -<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.409> far<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
you might also notice - as far as the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.890 
you might also notice - as far as the
filtration<00:01:35.280> media<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.820> concerned<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.390> lot<00:01:36.780> of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
filtration media is concerned a lot of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.090 
filtration media is concerned a lot of
these<00:01:37.020> air<00:01:37.350> cleaners<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.009> an

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
these air cleaners are going to have an

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.340 
these air cleaners are going to have an
option<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> stainless<00:01:39.600> jacketed<00:01:40.049> filter

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
option for a stainless jacketed filter

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.050 
option for a stainless jacketed filter
or<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> standard<00:01:41.159> standard<00:01:41.700> filter<00:01:41.970> is

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
or just a standard standard filter is

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.510 
or just a standard standard filter is
going<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.810> average<00:01:43.310> aluminum<00:01:44.310> mesh

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
going to be your average aluminum mesh

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.039 
going to be your average aluminum mesh
here<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:44.970> you're<00:01:45.060> gonna<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.329> pink

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
here and then you're gonna see just pink

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.350 
here and then you're gonna see just pink
cotton<00:01:46.470> gauze<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.340> stainless<00:01:47.700> option<00:01:48.030> offers

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
cotton gauze the stainless option offers

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.580 
cotton gauze the stainless option offers
actually<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> stainless<00:01:49.079> mesh<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.470> then

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
actually a stainless mesh and then

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.960 
actually a stainless mesh and then
inside<00:01:50.009> there<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.280> actually<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> finer

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
inside there is actually a finer

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 
inside there is actually a finer
stainless<00:01:51.540> mesh<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.200> there's<00:01:52.350> actually<00:01:52.619> no

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
stainless mesh so there's actually no

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.679 
stainless mesh so there's actually no
gauze<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.280> wear<00:01:53.430> out<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.850> that's<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.509> another

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
gauze to wear out so that's just another

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.200 
gauze to wear out so that's just another
thing<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.960> consider<00:01:55.280> these<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.490> made<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.820> USA

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
thing to consider these are made in USA

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.850 
thing to consider these are made in USA
filters<00:01:57.630> they're<00:01:57.869> great<00:01:58.110> for<00:01:58.290> filtering<00:01:58.710> air

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
