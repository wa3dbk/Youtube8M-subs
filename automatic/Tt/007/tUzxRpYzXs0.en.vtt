00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.549
 etc. Clermont could not land and had to postpone afp 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.109
 the rebel commander oracle was not really able to recover 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.259
 like most of europe 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.300
 bordeaux we do not leave 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.579
 today rage 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.099
 in the book it looks like it's the crossroads with glue so we could 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.749
 to see anyway important remains the same 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.859
 the earth will not lose a page 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.839
 that marie idrac match with our collaborators containing the top of 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.920
 the posted alongside dear before him 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.390
 we are happy too 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.390
 for the author next October 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.200
 registration required 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.660
 laurent pelly but how to believe that the prisoners are not yet settled 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.660
 in a few hours so that peace for the people 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.270
 but a stop too much when we talk about him in groups in the guardian the 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.819
 pilot 

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:57.669
 will not be more than an hour we can not control when we talk 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.730
 and when we talk about it and carrying the record of the longest race 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.110
 at that child rights account the milestone could not 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.950
 to stop him from being a little poet and plastic artist it's amazing 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.920
 like so many others it is a priesthood at the manger when we have indicators 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.690
 when we read the book already 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.790
 in the people's capital there are several favorites a plebiscite 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.160
 at the bar 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.370
 before posting them for the time 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.260
 then the smoke lamented too late maybe there is no bar at 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.500
 late point 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.770
 why not by the father reproduce 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.020
 the pope calls in which was still allowed to the dodgers the fags 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.700
 in the context of little but have taken over three-quarters charm in the tops 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.460
 European scorers can dispute that points just like the fish is 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.720
 quite gaulle why 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.740
