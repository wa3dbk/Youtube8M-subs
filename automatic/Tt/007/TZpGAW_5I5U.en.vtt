00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.540
 zolling sports role quite cordially 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.310
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.150
 this friday the fifth of july 2013 it 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.850

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.170

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.689
 I wish you a nice one 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.230
 all right thank you firmly 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.750
 hear no comes back to the beginning 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.340
 nice to be there nice that you 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.989
 I'm just saying it that way 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.760
 why not you can sometimes 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.379
 be friendly to your wife today 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.030
 in the background only new map called rush 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.840
 that is why it should actually go in 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.399
 this video 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.760
 the whole continent is everything 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.649
 Before the mappack, of course, very short 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.250
 on the conditions and eckdaten 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.399
 So this video dominates 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.420
 the map quickly from the new dlc of 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.149
 black Ops 2 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.420
 he plays live in the game below 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.369
 the channel description and yes he plays 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.430
 with the ska here at the beginning 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.049
 until it is now just died the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.890
 Proud to have no stomach 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.229
 shit on it www.weisse what makes 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.420
 it's just his thing through and how 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.130
 told friends my carpet with the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.229
 kh does not matter either 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.390
 this is where the TdW muffler plays 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.810
 and I still do not believe anything 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.000
 I expect to pull fast so that can 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.990
 being or carving almost looks like it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.070
 Then finish your orbital dogs 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 sponge 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.119
 Let's see if all that we have since 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.340
 pretty high yes all well 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.470
 he plays with the team maybe works 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.820
 so yes friends today content dlc 3 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.450
 what's the whole nonsense I thought 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.009
 I mean if the gns or no idea 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.780
 is also shit 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.990
 you know it friends I'll get that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.049
 Ding certainly not I have recently 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.000
 made a video where i said 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.530
 I left out a little bit 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.709
 about the call of duty part time 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.960
 now in the moment and not since the beginning 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.680
 that it 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.300
 not quite so much fun even tell 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.320
 We pretend that some parts at all 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.050
 are no longer playable 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:26.360
 and that's why fans and dlc 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.360
 pack with new maps etc falls there 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.190
 of course flat with me is very clear 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.810
 and I just want to have yours 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.160
 I do not think everyone has that opinion 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.260
 a little smart 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.720

 belgium dlc 3d vision pervert coach 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.960
 not even looking at it 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.050
 in any case the new maps one of them 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.250
 you see that's called me quickly 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.510

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.620
 Let's get to the others first 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.980
 go fast fast fights are on 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.010
 this converted to the fighting arena 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.410
 Paintball is guaranteed to fall on those 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.840
 the players new possibilities and 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.250
 Challenges provide coverage 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.470
 to take advantage of your advantage 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.090

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.210
 lots of sandbags okay as you can 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.860
 behind entrench then many corners 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.630
 and forth left and right and diagonal 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.300
 here are interest paintball falls 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.100

 rambazamba in any case you the map 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.210

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.740
 see but the HC 1 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.450
 Of course, that is completely the case with Herrschaft 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.790
 nice here attacke bonanza friends there 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.320
 I could imagine the money goes 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.030
 yes, yes, but a few 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.630

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.970

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.290
 look for cover and then here too 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.640

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.239
 developer of this game is 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.079
 I do not know and here we come to the 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:28.949
 other maps friends 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:30.990
 Up to grumbles to cook cdu before the 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.719
 stage is ready for a tough one 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.060
 Conflict on this little forgotten 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:38.870
 Island in the middle of advent in Indian 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.669
 Ocean on the player between 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.740
 wreckage of a crashed jet 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.659

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.770

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.740
 read here cool 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.990
 So before I forget who, how 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.060
 Also in youtube channel has and videos 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.680
 or the mappack has on the xbox and 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.780
 also videos high latter of the camera 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.919
 like a video as a video answer easy 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.259
 times under post 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.180
 I'll take all of you over that 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.620
 mappack act like I would like to 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.229
 Watch some videos of the new ones 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.789
 maps because as I said I do not get swr 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.580
 That's why I'd like to have yours 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.539
 Opinion as I said, apparently only for 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.400
 xbox player 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.560
 At the moment he is only three years old 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.529
 days out and mostly it is like that 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.479
 only for xbox live members is and yes 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:23.370
 you can just not go the other 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.469
 Following platforms will be on hold later 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.000
 so just as I said joy if you 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.409
 as synonymous videos have then benefit as 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.400
 video answer down from the new maps 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.319
 I like to look at it 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.330
 that could do and of course in the 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:37.710
 Write comments so keep writing 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.479
 is the tour the tour is called this bed 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.550
 the players fight through the 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.430
 Debris of a ruined suspension bridge 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.500
 high above this east coast waterway 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.569
 where the action is on different levels 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.219
 takes place friends are all 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.210

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:56.000

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.379
 Waterway action different levels 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.089

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.909
 curbstone 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:10.050
 since there is probably also a map that will 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:12.930
 probably with remakes be from black ops 1 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.210
 I have to look where is their uplink 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.039

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.159
 look at us so friends 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:22.770
 beware of order tip in this new 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:25.560
 designed implementation of fans 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.960
 Popular card collects from call of duty 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.830
 black ops comes deep in the rainy 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.830
 jungle 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:38.100

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.710
 fire in range 2, I have nothing 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.230
 good friends I had there as well 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.280
 nothing good is this so remakes 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.450
 if they can not handle that, then how 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.220
 that said I'm burning 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.250
 friends who you have something there or 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.350
 You could also like the gameplay 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.240
 we send from the dlc I take the 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.800
 I like watching the video too 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.700
 then like to reply because it 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.380
 I am already interested 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.910
 just got this remake maps france 2 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:10.140
 I've already seen so there I have 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.480
 do not hold anything 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.910
 I do not know either and that's it 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.740
 as it was always cool was correctness 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.390
 but both in the app you can not 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.310
 again make friends the scales 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.080
 which is still cool in black ops 1 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.700
 as well as fine grange 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.620
 you can not replicate in black 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.020
 ops second is a completely different game like that 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.540
 called game that the cash register not so 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:35.250
 cool digger we tear in black ops 2 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:36.510

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.130
 send them to your friends send 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.440

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.930
 build discussion 

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.940

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.200
