00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
actually calls for some lime zest which

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.360 
actually calls for some lime zest which
is<00:02:16.800> basically<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.870> skin<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.470> lime<00:02:19.710> but

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
is basically the skin of the lime but

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250

the avocado is you know it gives you
that<00:03:55.510> added<00:03:55.689> fat<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.379> makes<00:03:56.739> it<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:56.920> little

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
that added fat so it makes it a little

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.460 
that added fat so it makes it a little
heavier<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:57.760> then<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.989> know<00:03:59.109> just<00:03:59.319> the
