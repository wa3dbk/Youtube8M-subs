00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
let's get going with the maps first of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
let's get going with the maps first of
all<00:01:16.799> let<00:01:16.950> me<00:01:16.979> talk<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.460> Hydra<00:01:18.150> Hydra<00:01:18.420> was

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
all let me talk about Hydra Hydra was

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.749 
all let me talk about Hydra Hydra was
the<00:01:19.020> like<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> power<00:01:20.130> plant<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.820> water<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:22.759> it's

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the like a power plant for water so it's

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.030 
the like a power plant for water so it's
pretty<00:01:24.090> cool<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.990> okay<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.650> an

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
pretty cool you know it's okay it's an

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.230 
pretty cool you know it's okay it's an
okay<00:01:26.430> map<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.570> probably<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.530> third

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
okay map this is probably my third

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.609 
okay map this is probably my third
favorite<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> map<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.960> guess<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.170> my

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
favorite of the map so I guess it's my

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.920 
favorite of the map so I guess it's my
third<00:01:32.430> least<00:01:32.790> favorite<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.890> map<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.930> it's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
third least favorite of the map so it's

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.440 
third least favorite of the map so it's
kind<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.560> there's<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:37.979> sides<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.210> maps

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
kind of there's two sides and the maps

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.710 
kind of there's two sides and the maps
are<00:01:39.630> replaced<00:01:40.020> really<00:01:40.439> weird<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.270> if

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
are replaced really weird so if you if

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.069 
are replaced really weird so if you if
you<00:01:43.079> cap<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.970> spawn<00:01:45.270> flag<00:01:45.570> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you cap be and then your spawn flag you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.569 
you cap be and then your spawn flag you
could<00:01:46.259> spawn<00:01:46.439> trap<00:01:46.680> them<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.920> their<00:01:47.070> spawn<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
could spawn trap them in their spawn and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.249 
could spawn trap them in their spawn and
they'll<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.090> keep<00:01:48.420> spawning<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
they'll just keep spawning there and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.319 
they'll just keep spawning there and
less<00:01:49.409> some<00:01:49.649> idiot<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.189> there<00:01:50.549> always<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.909> if

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
less some idiot and there always is if

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.840 
less some idiot and there always is if
you're<00:01:51.450> playing<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:53.040> afford<00:01:53.340> party<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
you're playing with not afford party and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.069 
you're playing with not afford party and
by<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.000> way<00:01:54.149> I've<00:01:54.270> been<00:01:54.420> playing<00:01:54.600> these<00:01:54.780> maps

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
by the way I've been playing these maps

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.380 
by the way I've been playing these maps
on<00:01:55.229> ground<00:01:55.530> war<00:01:55.710> because<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.369> tried<00:01:57.119> playing

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
on ground war because I tried playing

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.929 
on ground war because I tried playing
just<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.840> revolution<00:01:58.500> game<00:01:59.159> type<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.729> just

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
just a revolution game type and I just

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
just a revolution game type and I just
can't<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.630> don't<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.079> maps<00:02:01.290> enough

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
can't do it I don't like the maps enough

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.580 
can't do it I don't like the maps enough
to<00:02:01.950> actually<00:02:02.189> play<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.780> those<00:02:03.960> maps<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
to actually play on just those maps so I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.319 
to actually play on just those maps so I
have<00:02:05.100> been<00:02:05.280> playing<00:02:05.490> them<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.790> ground<00:02:06.030> war<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
have been playing them on ground war and

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.330 
have been playing them on ground war and
they're<00:02:06.590> amazing<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.680> ground<00:02:07.979> worse<00:02:08.160> he

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
they're amazing and ground worse he

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.770 
they're amazing and ground worse he
should<00:02:08.520> definitely<00:02:08.910> try<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.629> out<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
should definitely try them out and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.130 
should definitely try them out and
ground<00:02:10.080> where<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.379> haven't<00:02:10.679> already

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
ground where we haven't already

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.640 
ground where we haven't already
but<00:02:12.100> if<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.240> get<00:02:13.630> them<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.990> spawn<00:02:14.230> trap<00:02:14.500> this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
but if you get them in a spawn trap this

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.440 
but if you get them in a spawn trap this
is<00:02:14.800> definitely<00:02:15.430> one<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.730> best<00:02:15.910> spawn<00:02:16.150> trap

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
is definitely one of the best spawn trap

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.540 
is definitely one of the best spawn trap
see<00:02:16.630> get<00:02:16.959> them<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.160> whole<00:02:18.310> game

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
see get them in like in the whole game

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.350 
see get them in like in the whole game
like<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.090> don't<00:02:19.420> all<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.990> maps<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.910> rarely

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
like I don't all the maps but you rarely

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.390 
like I don't all the maps but you rarely
get<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.720> when<00:02:23.140> you're<00:02:23.680> like<00:02:23.920> me<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.160> you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
get that when you're like me and you

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.920 
get that when you're like me and you
play<00:02:24.610> alone<00:02:24.850> ground<00:02:25.209> war<00:02:25.390> there's<00:02:25.690> always

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
play alone ground war there's always

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.330 
play alone ground war there's always
people<00:02:26.170> are<00:02:26.290> gonna<00:02:26.410> ruin<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.800> spawn<00:02:27.040> so

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
people are gonna ruin the spawn so

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.870 
people are gonna ruin the spawn so
that's<00:02:28.150> that's<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:29.020> no<00:02:29.980> k<00:02:30.220> map<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.610> really<00:02:30.850> I

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
that's that's that no k map and really I

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.910 
that's that's that no k map and really I
get<00:02:31.120> all<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.330> much<00:02:31.540> next<00:02:32.020> map<00:02:32.170> is<00:02:32.350> grind<00:02:32.680> this

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
is actually the skate park map I really

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.310 
is actually the skate park map I really
just<00:02:36.820> don't<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.450> map<00:02:37.690> at<00:02:37.870> all<00:02:37.989> for<00:02:38.290> a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
just don't like this map at all for a

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.710 
just don't like this map at all for a
person<00:02:38.650> who<00:02:38.800> only<00:02:38.980> uses<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.370> sniper<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:40.569> is

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
person who only uses a sniper this is

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.690 
person who only uses a sniper this is
kind<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.080> hectic<00:02:41.230> crap<00:02:41.680> this<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.160> mostly<00:02:42.580> a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
kind of a hectic crap this is mostly a

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.550 
kind of a hectic crap this is mostly a
SMG<00:02:43.540> type<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.170> map<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:45.459> super<00:02:46.090> like

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
SMG type of map and it's super like

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.740 
SMG type of map and it's super like
always<00:02:47.560> somebody<00:02:48.550> coming<00:02:48.880> around<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.239> corner

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
always somebody coming around the corner

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.500 
always somebody coming around the corner
it's<00:02:50.200> super<00:02:50.769> cluttered<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.510> you're

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
it's super cluttered so you're

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.150 
it's super cluttered so you're
definitely<00:02:52.720> gonna<00:02:53.110> get<00:02:53.350> destroyed<00:02:53.560> if<00:02:54.010> you're

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
definitely gonna get destroyed if you're

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.040 
definitely gonna get destroyed if you're
trying<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.700> use<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.850> sniper<00:02:55.180> like<00:02:55.420> DSR

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
trying to use a sniper like DSR

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.660 
trying to use a sniper like DSR
especially<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> DSR<00:02:57.010> because<00:02:57.280> it's<00:02:57.430> really

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
especially the DSR because it's really

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.699 
especially the DSR because it's really
slow<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.180> you're<00:02:58.750> going<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.930> use<00:02:59.050> hyper<00:02:59.410> trays

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
slow so you're going to use hyper trays

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.740 
slow so you're going to use hyper trays
in<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.920> XP<00:03:00.459> are<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.910> ballista<00:03:01.420> because

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
in the XP are the ballista because

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.270 
in the XP are the ballista because
you're<00:03:01.900> just<00:03:02.260> gonna<00:03:02.410> have<00:03:02.560> bad<00:03:02.680> luck<00:03:02.739> with<00:03:02.950> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
you're just gonna have bad luck with the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.660 
you're just gonna have bad luck with the
tsr<00:03:04.090> because<00:03:04.330> that's<00:03:04.510> at<00:03:04.630> SMG<00:03:05.230> map<00:03:05.530> next<00:03:06.519> map

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
tsr because that's at SMG map next map

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.520 
tsr because that's at SMG map next map
is<00:03:06.850> downhill<00:03:07.090> which<00:03:07.600> is<00:03:07.750> actually<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.290> snow

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
is downhill which is actually the snow

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.350 
is downhill which is actually the snow

map which is my favorite this is

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.120 
map which is my favorite this is
probably<00:03:10.600> one<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:10.959> my<00:03:11.050> favorite<00:03:11.470> maps<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.890> plan

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
probably one of my favorite maps to plan

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.640 
probably one of my favorite maps to plan
ground<00:03:12.459> where<00:03:12.640> now<00:03:12.790> it's<00:03:13.720> amazing<00:03:14.200> i<00:03:14.290> love<00:03:14.320> it

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
everything a lot of this stuff is

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.979 
everything a lot of this stuff is
actually<00:03:23.320> under<00:03:24.100> like<00:03:24.579> sand<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.299> this<00:03:25.810> map<00:03:25.959> is

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
actually under like sand and this map is

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.990 
actually under like sand and this map is
also<00:03:26.410> ok<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:26.950> seems<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.280> it's<00:03:27.430> really<00:03:27.760> slow

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
also ok it seems that it's really slow

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.120 
also ok it seems that it's really slow
paced<00:03:28.269> even<00:03:28.660> in<00:03:28.750> ground<00:03:28.989> war<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:29.860> i<00:03:29.890> don't

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
paced even in ground war so i don't

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.310 
paced even in ground war so i don't
really<00:03:30.549> like<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.090> map<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:31.630> if<00:03:31.810> i<00:03:31.870> had<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.140> give

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
really like the map so if i had to give

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.009 
really like the map so if i had to give
the<00:03:32.500> whole<00:03:32.709> map<00:03:33.010> rating<00:03:33.700> out<00:03:34.299> of<00:03:34.360> 10<00:03:34.540> i<00:03:34.780> would

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
the whole map rating out of 10 i would

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.259 
the whole map rating out of 10 i would
probably<00:03:35.500> give<00:03:35.860> it<00:03:35.890> around<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.489> five<00:03:36.790> or<00:03:36.820> six

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
probably give it around a five or six

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.900 
probably give it around a five or six
out<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.480> 10<00:03:37.750> it's<00:03:38.620> not<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.920> greatest<00:03:39.040> map<00:03:39.640> pack

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
out of 10 it's not the greatest map pack

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.819 
out of 10 it's not the greatest map pack
but<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:40.329> also<00:03:40.660> not<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.049> worst<00:03:41.380> map<00:03:41.620> pack

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
but it's also not the worst map pack

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.240
