okay<00:00:03.330> so<00:00:04.339> there's<00:00:05.339> been<00:00:05.580> some<00:00:05.730> interest<00:00:06.089> as

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
okay so there's been some interest as

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.600 
okay so there's been some interest as
far<00:00:06.420> as<00:00:06.629> preventative<00:00:07.230> training<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.919> I'm

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
far as preventative training and I'm

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.870 
far as preventative training and I'm
going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.820> share<00:00:09.559> one<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.590> my<00:00:10.710> favorite

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
going to share one of my favorite

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.520 
going to share one of my favorite
exercises<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.660> do<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.019> help<00:00:13.139> keep<00:00:13.380> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
exercises to do to help keep the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.570 
exercises to do to help keep the
shoulders<00:00:13.950> down<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.160> back<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.820> lot<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:16.580> lot

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
shoulders down the back a lot of a lot

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.380 
shoulders down the back a lot of a lot
of<00:00:17.789> folks<00:00:18.570> who<00:00:18.779> work<00:00:18.960> out<00:00:19.199> particularly<00:00:19.949> men

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
of folks who work out particularly men

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.380 
of folks who work out particularly men
we<00:00:21.390> do<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> lot<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.160> push<00:00:23.160> movements<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
we do a lot of the push movements and

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.240 
we do a lot of the push movements and
things<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.109> pulling<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.740> lats<00:00:25.980> my

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
things like that and pulling the lats my

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.700 
things like that and pulling the lats my
pecs<00:00:26.490> get<00:00:26.730> real<00:00:26.910> strong<00:00:27.090> cause<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> interior

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
pecs get real strong cause the interior

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.959 
pecs get real strong cause the interior
health<00:00:28.980> causes<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.849> anterior<00:00:30.390> tilt<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
health causes the anterior tilt of the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.870 
health causes the anterior tilt of the
humeral<00:00:33.930> head<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> fall

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
humeral head and so you get a fall

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.250 
humeral head and so you get a fall
around<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> shoulder<00:00:36.690> which<00:00:36.870> could<00:00:37.079> lead<00:00:37.230> to

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
around the shoulder which could lead to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.040 
around the shoulder which could lead to
impingement<00:00:37.829> among<00:00:38.010> other<00:00:38.190> issues

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
impingement among other issues

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.139 
impingement among other issues
neurological<00:00:40.460> compromise<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.790> things<00:00:42.030> of

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
neurological compromise and things of

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.100 
neurological compromise and things of
that<00:00:42.180> nature<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:43.640> use<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> body<00:00:45.000> blade<00:00:45.270> I've

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
that nature so I use the body blade I've

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.690 
that nature so I use the body blade I've
been<00:00:46.289> using<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.890> last<00:00:46.950> five<00:00:47.309> years<00:00:47.370> or

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
been using it for the last five years or

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.420 
been using it for the last five years or
so<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.960> definitely<00:00:49.680> kept<00:00:49.829> my<00:00:49.980> shoulders

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so and it's definitely kept my shoulders

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.100 
so and it's definitely kept my shoulders
out<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.700> trouble<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.449> here's<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
out of trouble so here's some of the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.420 
out of trouble so here's some of the
things<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
things I like to do with it

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.779 
things I like to do with it
right<00:00:54.300> here<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.730> right

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
right here so you can see that right

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
right here so you can see that right
there<00:00:58.070> this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.309> scapular<00:00:59.879> plane<00:01:00.230> all<00:01:01.230> right

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
there this is a scapular plane all right

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
there this is a scapular plane all right
so<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> 45<00:01:02.399> degree<00:01:02.579> angle<00:01:02.789> right

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
so it's like a 45 degree angle right

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.260 
so it's like a 45 degree angle right
there<00:01:03.390> that's<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.350> scapular<00:01:04.769> plane<00:01:05.090> and<00:01:06.090> so

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
there that's a scapular plane and so

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.609 
there that's a scapular plane and so
what<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.689> doing<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.290> kind<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.530> like

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
what this is doing is it's kind of like

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.359 
what this is doing is it's kind of like
an<00:01:07.770> oscillatory<00:01:08.250> effect<00:01:09.409> it's<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.920> makes<00:01:11.189> that

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
an oscillatory effect it's it makes that

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.280 
an oscillatory effect it's it makes that
muscle<00:01:11.790> kind<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.090> rhythmically<00:01:12.689> stabilized

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
muscle kind of rhythmically stabilized

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
muscle kind of rhythmically stabilized
and<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:14.340> kind<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.610> isometric<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.360> nature

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and it's kind of isometric in nature

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.510 
and it's kind of isometric in nature
which<00:01:15.900> means<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.650> put<00:01:16.830> much

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
which means it's not going to put much

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.420 
which means it's not going to put much
stress<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> joints<00:01:18.860> this<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.040> working<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
stress on the joints this is working the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.580 
stress on the joints this is working the
blower<00:01:20.610> trap<00:01:20.970> or<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.930> look<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.560> like

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
blower trap or as we look or as I like

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
blower trap or as we look or as I like
to<00:01:22.770> refer<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> his<00:01:23.490> trapezius<00:01:24.000> number<00:01:24.270> four

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
to refer to his trapezius number four

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.810 
to refer to his trapezius number four
there's<00:01:25.259> four<00:01:25.470> segments<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> trapezius

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
there's four segments of the trapezius

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.630 
there's four segments of the trapezius
to<00:01:26.939> makes<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.210> trapezoid<00:01:27.869> shake<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.369> this

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
to makes a trapezoid shake and so this

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.120 
to makes a trapezoid shake and so this
works<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> lower<00:01:30.210> trap<00:01:30.600> which<00:01:31.350> helps<00:01:31.770> kind<00:01:31.979> of

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
works the lower trap which helps kind of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.690 
works the lower trap which helps kind of
keep<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:33.049> shoulder<00:01:34.049> blade<00:01:34.700> moving

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
keep that shoulder blade moving

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.730 
keep that shoulder blade moving
correctly<00:01:36.240> when<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.479> do<00:01:36.720> overhead<00:01:37.200> movements

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
correctly when you do overhead movements

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.600 
correctly when you do overhead movements
or<00:01:37.979> even<00:01:38.670> chest<00:01:38.939> presses<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.460> just

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
or even chest presses so I like to just

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.530 
or even chest presses so I like to just
do<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.790> this<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.970> available

neck neutral subtle retracted now we're

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.850 
neck neutral subtle retracted now we're
going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> get<00:02:00.869> serratus<00:02:01.439> I'm<00:02:01.649> already

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
going to get serratus I'm already

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.680 
going to get serratus I'm already
feeling<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.280> cramp<00:02:02.549> up<00:02:02.759> that's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.119> good<00:02:03.270> sign

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
feeling it cramp up that's a good sign

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.930 
feeling it cramp up that's a good sign
it's<00:02:04.080> working<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:05.190> a<00:02:05.370> sign<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
it's working that's a sign that the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.359
