 erich mary note life borrowed 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.420

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.590

 book after reading which so 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.619

 Count of Monte Cristo Alexander demand 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.000
 the story of a young man who 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.450

 field of play life figures real people 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.579
 but it is not a whim or sick imagination 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.910
 the fact is that the protagonist needs 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.809
 revenge for their pernicious life and this 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.239
 the book calls 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.910
 most controversial feeling because 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.449
 understand who is to blame who is right where is good 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.530
 where is evil and how would you do it yourself 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.260
 place of heroes 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.870
 just impossible but this book is not 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.090
 blind spot rather she 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.700

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.890
 Diana Sidorchuk The main heroine known 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 the writer who never and never 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.990
 I haven't told anyone in my whole life 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.210
 one word of truth about your birth and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.000
 childhood and indeed about life in general 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.390
 This is a wonderful book where from secret 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.810
 mystery even when conducting love mystic 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.420
 and detective is an amazing piece 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.659
 and just bewitching 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.790
 you read them before you fall in love forever 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.450
 and will never be able to part with 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.600
 this book is 451 degrees fahrenheit 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.659
 raya bradbury future in which there is no place 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.450
 person thinking person feeling 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.399
 and a human being is not because 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.500
 in this book burn books 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.229
 the thing is that in society in this 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.590
 the work voluntarily refused to go 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.060
 along the path of spiritual development and took 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.329
 technical development 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.729
 it ruined them if even a little 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.090
 hopes that someday in the world in this 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.380
 the book will be saved and if even a little 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.810
 hope that our 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.380
 the real world will not turn into a world 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.030
 described in the work of ray bradbury 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.700
 it is worth constantly rereading it 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.250
 work so that in the real world not 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.860
 become a hero from this book farmyard 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.900
 george orwell book which can 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.360
 completely screw your worldview 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.460
 of course the story is quite recognizable and 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.610
 well brought into our real life 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.880
 there are those who rule there are those who rule and 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.580
 of course there is a story that all 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.190
 it is done for the sake of the future for the sake of the great 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.730
 beautiful future idea as usual 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.860
 good and performance as usual is lame 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.990
 this is a construction satire book 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.540
 perfect society is amazing 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.000
 true book about people in power and about 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.190
 people under this power the great gatsby 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.200
 Francis Scott Fitzgerald so much 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.390
 rustled so much admired it 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.010
 product especially when came out in 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.040
 movie rent base lurman 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.680
 and now it's not so good a couple 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.560
 remember and reread the great gatsby 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.570
 great with his love of his loyalty 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.120
 he is also great in his sense of purpose 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.600
 he had hope he had a dream and 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.240
 he went to her right ways he 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.700
 chose to achieve this dream and goal 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.050
 Of course it's up to the reader where in 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.350
 this book is good 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.140
 and where evil and if between these concepts 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.290
 the edge again the decision falls on the shoulders 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.410
 reader but you know how immensely i am 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:45.420
 I love this work as I immensely 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.220
 I love gatsby and how much I do not respect 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.530
 daisy 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.570
 I don't know what else to say because 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.940
 that so much is not said 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.730
 just have to reread 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.420
 recount and recount lips colors 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.270
 of blood 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.030
 author yuri root walk by 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.080
 the beautiful city of Budapest introduction 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.660
 with a certain mysterious girl in black 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.100
 visiting the point of the prince of darkness himself 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.380
 mystical story about the forces of good and evil 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.609
 light and darkness is amazing 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.829
 composition 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.079
 from which you can not tear myself away 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.060
 its the first time and you will definitely 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.099
 want to reread it again and again 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.289
 humiliated and offended 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.360
 Fedor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky this 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.849
 a work that will affect the heart 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.400
 each major topics that rise 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.389
 in this piece this is the problem of fathers and 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.819
 children problems of class inequality and 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:44.520
 unrequited love but the most important thing is 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:48.030
 a work about a sick society about 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.389
 upside down world where vanity rudeness 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.180
 and arrogance elevate and put on first 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.250
 a place of kindness and warmth 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.219
 so it will be in the mud those words that we do not 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.569
 told each other mark levy story about 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.300
 that second chance 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.490
 should always be and at all his not 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.430
 just want to give this second chance 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.610
 important want to get this second chance 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.279
 book raises so interesting as 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.090
 I think the important question is that from the first 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:20.939
 times you can not cover all your 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.750
 paying attention only to some individual 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.319
 moments so here highlighting them therefore 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.719
 the book 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:30.719
 you just need to reread to 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:33.870
 fully understand everything that happens 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:36.690
 events to fully understand what you are 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.360
 personally feel a hero 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.789
 of this work and what you can 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.000
 take for yourself from this work 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:48.240
 Stefan Zweig's novels I personally read 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.110
 sunset 1 heart and the letter of a stranger and this 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.009
 amazing spiritual and life stories 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.250
 which simultaneously 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:58.409
 hopeless and life-affirming and after 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.050
 read you understand what you have to 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:03.750
 value your life should value your 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.960
 loved ones and listen not 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.870
 only to themselves but also to the outside world but 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.319
 it does not go too far allowing 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:16.110
 this world itself you sit on the neck 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.779
