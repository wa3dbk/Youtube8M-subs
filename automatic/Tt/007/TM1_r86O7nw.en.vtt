00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
you do one of these then your bead is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.630

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
actually going to have to fit so it'll

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.959

drop<00:00:44.850> down<00:00:44.910> inside<00:00:49.340> these<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.550> way<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.730> do

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
drop down inside these the way to do

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
drop down inside these the way to do
this<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> take<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> piece<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> memory<00:00:52.590> wire

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
this is to take a piece of memory wire

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.060 
this is to take a piece of memory wire
and<00:00:54.320> just<00:00:55.320> drop<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> down<00:00:57.109> inside<00:00:58.109> your<00:00:58.800> piece

and just drop it down inside your piece
and<00:00:59.510> cut<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.539> 13<00:01:01.440> mil<00:01:01.739> longer<00:01:02.359> than<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.629> need

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and cut it 13 mil longer than you need

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.520 
and cut it 13 mil longer than you need
and<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:05.670> reason<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.840> reason<00:01:06.960> you're<00:01:07.260> cutting

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and the reason the reason you're cutting

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.109 
and the reason the reason you're cutting
it<00:01:07.650> longer<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.640> put<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> beats

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it longer is that when you put the beats

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.050 
it longer is that when you put the beats
on<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.479> it'll<00:01:09.570> actually<00:01:09.750> space<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:11.750> 13<00:01:12.750> mm

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
on it it'll actually space it up 13 mm

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.249 
on it it'll actually space it up 13 mm
when<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.509> linked<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:15.990> just

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
when you have your linked you can just

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.480 
when you have your linked you can just
use<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.470> sight<00:01:16.920> cutters<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:19.280> then<00:01:20.280> you're

use your sight cutters and then you're
ready<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.909> assemble<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.640> when<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> take<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
ready to assemble so when you take it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.130 
ready to assemble so when you take it
out<00:01:24.950> it'll<00:01:25.950> look<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:29.780> take<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:30.990> flat

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

out it'll look like this take your flat
round<00:01:31.500> pliers<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.540> you're<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.840> bend

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
round pliers and you're going to bend

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.030 
round pliers and you're going to bend
the<00:01:34.740> tightest<00:01:35.189> loop<00:01:35.520> possible<00:01:36.560> right<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the tightest loop possible right on the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:46.460 
the tightest loop possible right on the
very<00:01:38.250> end

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.700 

decide<00:01:47.470> what<00:01:47.740> pattern<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:48.310> want<00:01:49.650> I'm<00:01:50.650> just

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
decide what pattern you want I'm just

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.580 
decide what pattern you want I'm just
doing<00:01:51.370> a<00:01:51.550> 1<00:01:51.880> 2<00:01:52.060> 3<00:01:52.300> 2<00:01:52.600> 1<00:01:53.310> pattern

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
doing a 1 2 3 2 1 pattern

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.060 
doing a 1 2 3 2 1 pattern
separated<00:01:56.590> by<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.800> silver<00:01:57.430> bead<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:01.030> I'm<00:02:01.450> using

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
separated by a silver bead and I'm using

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.120 
separated by a silver bead and I'm using
turquoise<00:02:03.420> haishi<00:02:05.460> which<00:02:06.460> is<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:07.979> basically<00:02:08.979> a

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
turquoise haishi which is a basically a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.120 
turquoise haishi which is a basically a
barrel<00:02:09.610> shape<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:11.350> can<00:02:11.500> use<00:02:11.560> anything<00:02:14.130> so

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
barrel shape you can use anything so

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.850 
barrel shape you can use anything so
that's<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:16.060> beginning<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.600> my<00:02:16.870> pattern<00:02:17.320> do

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
that's the beginning of my pattern do

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.600 
that's the beginning of my pattern do
the<00:02:18.040> whole<00:02:18.220> thing<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.920> check<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.400> for

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the whole thing and then check it for

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the whole thing and then check it for
length<00:02:23.520> when<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.640> get<00:02:24.790> all<00:02:24.910> your<00:02:25.090> beads<00:02:25.330> on

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
length when you get all your beads on

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.110 
length when you get all your beads on
it's<00:02:26.290> going<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.620> be<00:02:26.739> difficult<00:02:26.950> if<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.970> have

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
it's going to be difficult if you have

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.580 
it's going to be difficult if you have
this<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.540> right<00:02:28.690> length<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.170> what<00:02:29.440> you're

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
this the right length so what you're

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.699 
this the right length so what you're
going<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.860> do<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.220> very<00:02:30.250> carefully<00:02:31.410> grab<00:02:32.410> this

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
going to do is very carefully grab this

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.900 
going to do is very carefully grab this
with<00:02:33.700> your<00:02:33.910> flat<00:02:34.180> round<00:02:34.480> pliers<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:36.430> hold<00:02:36.459> it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
with your flat round pliers to hold it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.870 
with your flat round pliers to hold it
and<00:02:37.110> then<00:02:38.220> Bend<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.519> tight<00:02:39.910> loop<00:02:40.239> in<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.660> end

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
and then Bend a tight loop in the end

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.190 
and then Bend a tight loop in the end
now<00:02:42.880> once<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.209> grab<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.570> hold<00:02:43.810> it<00:02:43.959> tight

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
now once you grab it hold it tight

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.290 
now once you grab it hold it tight
because<00:02:44.709> if<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.220> drop<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.850> whole<00:02:46.030> bloody

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
because if you drop it the whole bloody

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.190 
because if you drop it the whole bloody
thing<00:02:46.420> will<00:02:46.870> unravel<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:49.360> now<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:49.630> need<00:02:49.989> to

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
thing will unravel so now you need to

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.370 
thing will unravel so now you need to
bend<00:02:50.410> your<00:02:51.000> nice<00:02:52.000> tight<00:02:52.450> little<00:02:52.810> loop<00:02:53.019> in<00:02:53.230> the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
bend your nice tight little loop in the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.430 
bend your nice tight little loop in the
end<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:57.130> you're<00:02:57.430> finished<00:02:58.049> now<00:02:59.049> you<00:02:59.110> could

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
end and you're finished now you could

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.900 
end and you're finished now you could
wear<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.860> as<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.100> bracelet<00:03:00.519> on<00:03:01.120> its<00:03:01.390> own<00:03:05.910> but

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
wear this as a bracelet on its own but

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.729 
wear this as a bracelet on its own but
happily<00:03:08.549> this<00:03:09.549> will<00:03:09.760> just<00:03:10.000> snap<00:03:10.299> around<00:03:10.720> your

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.150 

bangle

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.860 

and<00:03:19.160> it'll<00:03:19.430> snap<00:03:19.730> down<00:03:20.000> inside<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:23.480> when<00:03:23.720> it

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
and it'll snap down inside and when it

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.670 
and it'll snap down inside and when it
when<00:03:24.170> it<00:03:24.200> goes<00:03:24.500> in<00:03:28.990> you'll<00:03:29.990> find<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:30.470> the

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
when it goes in you'll find that the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.090 
when it goes in you'll find that the
ends<00:03:30.950> touch<00:03:31.900> so<00:03:32.900> there<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.230> is<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.710> if<00:03:33.950> you

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
ends touch so there it is and if you

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.920 
ends touch so there it is and if you
want<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.430> wear<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.610> as<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.000> separate<00:03:35.480> bracelet

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
want to wear that as a separate bracelet

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.330 
want to wear that as a separate bracelet
you<00:03:36.050> can<00:03:36.170> just<00:03:36.380> take<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.710> out<00:03:36.830> just<00:03:37.100> stick<00:03:37.310> a

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
you can just take it out just stick a

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.190 
you can just take it out just stick a
toothpick<00:03:37.790> in<00:03:37.850> and<00:03:38.180> lick<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.870> end<00:03:39.050> out<00:03:41.200> there

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
toothpick in and lick the end out there

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.940 
toothpick in and lick the end out there
you<00:03:42.380> are<00:03:42.440> one<00:03:43.250> with<00:03:43.460> one<00:03:44.210> without<00:03:44.390> beads<00:03:44.950> and

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
you are one with one without beads and

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.730 
you are one with one without beads and
like<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:46.850> said<00:03:47.060> earlier<00:03:47.330> you<00:03:47.480> could<00:03:47.780> when<00:03:48.590> you

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
like I said earlier you could when you

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.740 
like I said earlier you could when you
have<00:03:48.890> one<00:03:49.070> of<00:03:49.160> these<00:03:49.250> that's<00:03:49.610> larger<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.720> can

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
have one of these that's larger you can

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.350 
have one of these that's larger you can
use<00:03:51.080> larger<00:03:51.590> beads<00:03:51.860> but<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:52.760> would<00:03:53.030> still<00:03:53.300> use

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
use larger beads but I would still use

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.610 
use larger beads but I would still use
the<00:03:53.600> memory<00:03:54.140> wire<00:03:54.940> because<00:03:55.940> it's<00:03:56.480> easier<00:03:57.020> it's

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
the memory wire because it's easier it's

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.690 
the memory wire because it's easier it's
easier<00:03:58.130> than<00:03:58.340> doing<00:03:58.490> the<00:03:58.790> expandable<00:03:59.450> type
