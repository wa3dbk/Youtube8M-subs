though this is printed on a federico a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.660 
though this is printed on a federico a
better<00:01:44.610> paper<00:01:45.229> it's<00:01:46.229> harder<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.649> read<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.490> me

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
better paper it's harder to read to me

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.530 
better paper it's harder to read to me
any<00:01:48.110> harder<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> understand<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> the
