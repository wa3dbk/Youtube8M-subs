00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
okay so I'm doing my fireplace makeover

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.839 
okay so I'm doing my fireplace makeover
the<00:00:06.540> first<00:00:06.779> step<00:00:07.080> was<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.830> prepared<00:00:08.250> fireplace

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
the first step was to prepared fireplace

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.290 
the first step was to prepared fireplace
I<00:00:09.240> cleaned<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.260> up<00:00:10.429> got<00:00:11.429> all<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.670> old<00:00:11.820> stuff

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
I cleaned it up got all the old stuff

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.430 
I cleaned it up got all the old stuff
off<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.219> then<00:00:14.219> next<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.790> cut<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.540> cement<00:00:15.990> board

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
off and then next I cut the cement board

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.150 
off and then next I cut the cement board
I<00:00:16.640> measured<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.820> shapes<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.050> cut<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
I measured all the shapes and cut the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.390 
I measured all the shapes and cut the
cement<00:00:20.460> board<00:00:20.640> out<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.840> now<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.100> the<00:00:23.100> next

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
cement board out and so now the the next

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.779 
cement board out and so now the the next
step<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.150> lay<00:00:24.689> down<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.050> cement<00:00:25.320> board<00:00:25.789> and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
step is to lay down the cement board and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.800 
step is to lay down the cement board and
I'm<00:00:27.090> using<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:28.250> construction<00:00:29.250> adhesive<00:00:29.810> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
I'm using this construction adhesive to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.139 
I'm using this construction adhesive to
do<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.920> some<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.250> board's<00:00:32.579> there<00:00:32.790> that

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
do it for some of the board's there that

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.150 
do it for some of the board's there that
are<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.600> flat<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.440> will<00:00:34.800> also

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
are going to be flat up here I will also

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.700 
are going to be flat up here I will also
I<00:00:35.489> use<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.030> construction<00:00:36.390> adhesive<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:37.260> well

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
I use the construction adhesive as well

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.750 
I use the construction adhesive as well
as<00:00:38.010> some<00:00:38.550> screws<00:00:39.510> into<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:41.040> brick<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
as some screws into the brick just to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.270 
as some screws into the brick just to
kind<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.000> help<00:00:42.210> keep<00:00:42.870> them<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> had<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
kind of help keep them up what I had to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.639 
kind of help keep them up what I had to
do<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:45.120> heart<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> stones

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
do this heart was actually the stones

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.250 
do this heart was actually the stones
were<00:00:46.920> uneven<00:00:47.489> very<00:00:48.329> uneven<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> point

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
were uneven very uneven to the point

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.900 
were uneven very uneven to the point
that<00:00:49.500> was<00:00:49.649> afraid<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> break<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.430> cement

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
that was afraid to break the cement

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.410 
that was afraid to break the cement
board<00:00:51.120> once<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.050> down<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.280> sat<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.210> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
board once it was down if you sat on it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
board once it was down if you sat on it
so<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> used<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.629> construction<00:00:57.629> mortar<00:00:58.399> kind

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
so I used the construction mortar kind

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.299 
so I used the construction mortar kind
of<00:00:59.489> laid<00:01:00.390> some<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.870> down<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.410> level<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
of laid some of it down to level out the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
of laid some of it down to level out the
area<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.480> now<00:01:03.660> I'm<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.229> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:05.840> put<00:01:06.840> down

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
area so now I'm just going to put down

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.730 
area so now I'm just going to put down
some<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.860> construction<00:01:08.549> adhesive<00:01:08.670> on

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
some of this construction adhesive on

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.340 
some of this construction adhesive on
directly<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.950> top<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.460> hurt<00:01:11.970> stone<00:01:12.479> and

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.929 

just<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:22.009> it<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.040> squeezes<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.850> of

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
just like that it just squeezes out of

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.780 
just like that it just squeezes out of
the<00:01:24.030> tube<00:01:24.530> very<00:01:25.530> rapidly<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.340> toothpaste

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the tube very rapidly like toothpaste

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.370 
the tube very rapidly like toothpaste
and<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:29.640> next<00:01:29.970> step<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.930> lay

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and then the next step is just to lay

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:43.530 
and then the next step is just to lay
this<00:01:31.619> Network<00:01:32.189> down

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.660 

and<00:01:44.540> just<00:01:45.079> kind<00:01:45.290> of<00:01:45.320> press<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.130> down<00:01:48.430> like<00:01:49.430> that

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
and just kind of press it down like that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.060 
and just kind of press it down like that
and<00:01:50.619> that's<00:01:51.619> it

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
and that's it

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.789 
and that's it
first<00:01:52.790> pieces<00:01:53.060> down<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.750> I'm<00:01:54.470> going<00:01:54.740> to

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
first pieces down and I'm going to

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.700 
first pieces down and I'm going to
continue<00:01:55.130> on<00:01:55.310> top<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.090> then<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:57.289> next<00:01:57.619> is

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
continue on top and then the next is

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.700 
continue on top and then the next is
going<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.780> fasten<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.810> bottom<00:02:00.170> part

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
going to be to fasten the bottom part

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.669 
going to be to fasten the bottom part
and<00:02:00.920> so<00:02:01.189> on<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:02.360> that's<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.960> for<00:02:03.140> now<00:02:03.259> more

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
and so on so that's it for now more

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.950 
and so on so that's it for now more
later
