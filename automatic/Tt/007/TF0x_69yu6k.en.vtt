00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.519
 what's happening here 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.769
 what it says to the countryside 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:26.509
 I can not wait to see the snow-covered hills 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.729
 left behind the heat the humidity 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:31.419
 and the mosquitoes 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.760
 this is life

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.060
 the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.180
 the colors of the rough 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.950
 walk through the woods 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.740
 forest 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.960

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.640

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.820
