00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello everyone and welcome to the video 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.580
 number 11 of game programming in 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.969
 this video we are going to make this 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.480
 rectangle move with the keys of the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.160
 keyboard 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.830
 Unlike the previous video where 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.190
 we moved them with the mouse they would see what 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.380
 important that is these classes and the 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.140
 time that we take to create these 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.900
 the listeners classes because it's going to be very 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.060
 fast very easy to change so that it 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.990
 move with the keys well basically 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.430
 here we had the yei frame 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.040
 swing 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.920
 denounced constructor the game look 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.130
 we render that still this myth 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.640
 does not do anything or we're not using it 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.640
 we saw it a little 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.830
 then we have the render that we draw 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.630
 a black color and then we draw a 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.630
 rectangle in a coordinate of x 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.570
 well let's do now is let's 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.070
 open the keyboard listener that is 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.120
 just the kirchner that will be 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.300
 listening to this game 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.450
 and we're going to see that this start has 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.970
 three methods and we will import more 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.760
 that nothing these two teams and the one that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.980
 uses this method is called when a 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.960
 key is pressed on the keyboard 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.950
 and this one when we release a key we're going 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.180
 to make the rectangle show 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.870
 but let's see 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.930
 other types of movement better 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.380
 the course but this is going to look like this 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.790
 because it is very simple and important 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.220
 It is that we understood what 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.070
 let's do everything perfect wave 2 good 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:57.510
 this method that impress receives a 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.510
 event parameter of class i vents 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.050
 has a couple of interesting methods 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.130
 have enough interesting minutes 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.149
 and what are we going to use us is 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.640
 get boy 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.250
 this gives me back a code with him 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.160
 the key that caused the event if the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.340
 key that has been pressed has a code 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.610
 now we also have all the codes 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.860
 of the keys if we access the class 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.630
 write point 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.690
 here we have all the codes as per 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.020
 example here 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.750
 if it is a number 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.180
 has the number of elected what we are going 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.650
 to do is 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.939
 if the event was the key code 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:52.020
 that consoles event is the same here and see 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:55.130
 left wing that left 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:59.340
 then we are going to do 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.150
 for example game point woman 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.150
 left 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.410
 let's program this function let's 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.520
 put here 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.830
 and remembering our rectangle 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.980
 is printed in an x in one and what 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.989
 let's do is 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.620
 if you have to move to the left that is 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.620
 you resist 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.760
 a certain number for example 10 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.510
 the X will be more to the left 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.310
 let's try it quickly and here 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.020
 we see that it moves to the left 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:43.030
 let's repeat the same for others 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.740
 yes for the right up and down 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.740
 let's put baker 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.480
 right I think so 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.489
 I think it is 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:07.410
 and we are going to create other meters by right 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.410
 move up and move 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.890
 let's create this is going to be the same 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.890
 but instead of subtracting it he will add 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.959
 and we're going to make the other two that are missing 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.440
 as well 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.440
 you 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.930
 as I have seen it does the same but with the 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.930
 coordinate and this will subtract 10 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.050
 and this is going to add 10 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.280
 then now we can move the 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.890
 rectangle for what we want 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.440
 and with the keyboard keys of the doctor 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.890
 we leave if then we learned there 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.590
 how can we use and how to manage the 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.020
 keyboard events using the listener 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.780
 of keyboard that we created in the days 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.750
 Earlier remember that you are free to 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.650
 get off the listeners get off all 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.290
 actually 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:17.120
 so they can learn faster if 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:21.760
 they try and play for a while with that 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.760
 so come it feels video greetings
