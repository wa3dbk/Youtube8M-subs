you can do to flavor your playing with
let's<00:00:14.280> start<00:00:14.340> by<00:00:14.580> doing<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.880> couple<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.240> pedal

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
let's start by doing a couple of pedal

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.260 
let's start by doing a couple of pedal
tones<00:00:16.310> pedal<00:00:17.310> tones<00:00:17.609> are<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:18.029> repeating

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
tones pedal tones are just repeating

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.010 
tones pedal tones are just repeating
patterns<00:00:19.430> repeating<00:00:20.430> notes<00:00:20.689> up<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.900> down

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
patterns repeating notes up and down

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.650 
patterns repeating notes up and down
different<00:00:22.380> scales<00:00:23.269> some<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> may<00:00:24.630> know

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
different scales some of you may know

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.109 
different scales some of you may know
them<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.410> lot<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.769> may<00:00:25.920> know<00:00:26.130> them<00:00:26.369> some<00:00:27.029> of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
them a lot of you may know them some of

them a lot of you may know them some of
you<00:00:27.240> may<00:00:27.330> not<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> ones<00:00:28.349> who<00:00:28.500> don't

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
you may not this is the ones who don't

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.220 
you may not this is the ones who don't
or<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> few<00:00:30.150> more<00:00:30.359> there's

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
or just like to know a few more there's

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.389 
or just like to know a few more there's
a<00:00:31.320> couple<00:00:31.500> different<00:00:31.679> kinds<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.309> will

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
a couple different kinds of will

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.590 
a couple different kinds of will
different<00:00:32.610> kind<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.850> patterns<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.450> can

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
different kind of patterns that you can

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.680 
different kind of patterns that you can
use<00:00:36.230> one<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:38.180> of<00:00:39.180> course<00:00:39.239> everybody

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
use one of them of course everybody

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.709 
use one of them of course everybody
pretty<00:00:40.020> much<00:00:40.140> knows<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.620> more<00:00:40.770> common<00:00:41.219> one

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
pretty much knows the more common one

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:50.209 
pretty much knows the more common one
the<00:00:42.719> descending<00:00:44.090> pattern<00:00:45.090> think<00:00:48.950> that<00:00:49.950> one's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the descending pattern think that one's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.189 
the descending pattern think that one's
like<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> said<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.480> pretty<00:00:51.629> common<00:00:51.930> there's

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
like I said it's pretty common there's

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:00.380 
like I said it's pretty common there's
also<00:00:53.030> different<00:00:54.030> ones<00:00:54.360> like

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.619 

that<00:01:01.390> one<00:01:01.539> is<00:01:01.629> basically<00:01:02.199> just<00:01:03.509> moving<00:01:04.509> down

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
that one is basically just moving down

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.440 
that one is basically just moving down
one<00:01:04.900> note<00:01:05.110> repeating<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:07.770> triplet<00:01:08.770> of<00:01:08.890> notes

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
one note repeating a triplet of notes

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:29.399 
one note repeating a triplet of notes
higher<00:01:10.450> down<00:01:10.720> moving<00:01:10.990> down<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:29.200> be<00:01:29.289> done

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
higher down moving down that can be done

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.730 
higher down moving down that can be done
in<00:01:29.560> any<00:01:29.649> scale<00:01:30.100> or<00:01:30.490> key<00:01:32.429> fast<00:01:34.200> basically<00:01:35.200> the

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
in any scale or key fast basically the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:46.490 
in any scale or key fast basically the
you<00:01:36.250> guys<00:01:36.520> have<00:01:36.729> heard<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.390> before

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.910 

and<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.950> other<00:01:47.100> pie

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.980 

at<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.340> bottom<00:01:52.729> of<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.970> pad

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.380 

go<00:01:56.990> up

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
go up

another one's not really so much a pedal
tone<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.109> is<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:28.439> repeating<00:02:29.040> pattern

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
tone as it is just repeating pattern

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.880 
tone as it is just repeating pattern
it's<00:02:31.290> great<00:02:31.560> for

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890
